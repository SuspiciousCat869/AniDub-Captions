is our strongest rival

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:14.195 position:24% line:83% align:start

From now on,

00:08:39.387 --> 00:08:42.023 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu will show
their true strength.

00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:44.492 position:30% line:83% align:start
When their team
feels pressured...

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.227 position:21% line:83% align:start
is when they unleash
their potential.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.962 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just don't forget that!

00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:49.030 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:52.500 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's how we lost
the last championship.

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:55.236 position:30% line:83% align:start
If we get cocky
from this advantage,

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:57.171 position:24% line:83% align:start
we'll lose to them

-Yeah!
-Yeah!

We have to score more.

00:09:02.076 --> 00:09:03.044 position:21% line:89% align:start
If we get too cocky,

00:09:03.077 --> 00:09:05.379 position:16% line:83% align:start
they surely are going to
tie the scoreboard.

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:07.148 position:24% line:83% align:start
