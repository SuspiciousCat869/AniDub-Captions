-[sigh]
-That's a shame!

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
The goalkeeper stopped
the ball!

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.670 position:33% line:83% align:start
But even so,
Misugi is amazing!

00:01:08.703 --> 00:01:11.873 position:19% line:83% align:start
The game's pace changed
as soon as he entered!

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:13.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now I understand why
they call him

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:15.075 position:16% line:89% align:start
the Prince of the Field!

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.512 position:27% line:83% align:start
His play style is
very elegant!

00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:18.613 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:19.547 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:21.348 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, but of course,
that doesn't mean that

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.383 position:16% line:89% align:start
he's better than Tsubasa!

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.620 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's the best of them all!

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:29.657 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I still think that
Jun Misugi is also good!

00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:32.660 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kumi, you do know we came
to watch the match

00:01:32.694 --> 00:01:33.728 position:16% line:89% align:start
and not the boys, right?

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:35.262 position:19% line:89% align:start
Of course, I know that!

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.832 position:21% line:83% align:start
The point of watching
other teams' matches

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.334 position:35% line:83% align:start
is to study
our potential rivals!

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:41.435 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, it doesn't
look like it.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.504 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kumi] Well, I gotta tell
the captain.

00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:51.913 position:21% line:83% align:start
What? Misugi entered
on the first half?!

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.514 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.
-Wow.

00:01:53.548 --> 00:01:54.882 position:16% line:83% align:start

to know

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:56.216 position:19% line:89% align:start

00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:41.089 position:16% line:83% align:start
- <i>Tournament Conclusion.</i>
-It was a great first half.

00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:43.390 position:27% line:83% align:start
Misugi's goal is
totally irrelevant.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:46.027 position:19% line:83% align:start
The important thing is
to keep him at bay.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.494 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's your cue, Sawada.

00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:48.129 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:03:48.162 --> 00:03:49.831 position:24% line:89% align:start
One moment, Coach.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:53.134 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't you let me deal
with Misugi for once?

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:55.169 position:27% line:83% align:start
He stole the ball
from me in the first half

00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:57.370 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I won't let him
make me look like a fool!

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.073 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Kitazume]
Calm down, Kojiro.

00:03:59.107 --> 00:04:00.108 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:02.543 position:24% line:83% align:start
The sport of soccer
is a team sport.

00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:05.378 position:27% line:83% align:start
And every player
has a position to play.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:08.049 position:33% line:83% align:start
For example,
you're the front striker

00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:10.051 position:27% line:83% align:start
and your only job
is to score goals.

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:11.819 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let your teammates
do theirs.

00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:15.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
Any personal matters
must stay off of the field.

00:04:15.123 --> 00:04:17.024 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is that clear enough?

00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:18.291 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, Coach.

00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:19.694 position:38% line:89% align:start
 <i>Damn it.</i>

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:22.496 position:19% line:83% align:start

 <i>is a team sport,</i>

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.967 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>but duels among captains</i>
 <i>are also important!</i>

 <i>that obnoxious Misugi!</i>

00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:31.105 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's okay, Captain.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.241 position:16% line:83% align:start
We all know how important
it is for us

-[gasp]

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:38.546 position:16% line:83% align:start

Captain.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:40.181 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just make sure to score,
okay?

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:41.414 position:30% line:89% align:start
We'll help you.

00:04:42.884 --> 00:04:44.218 position:19% line:89% align:start

[chuckle]

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:51.092 position:13% line:83% align:start
We managed to score a goal
on the first half, kids.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.994 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now we must get three more.

But remember, Misugi,

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.132 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll only let you play
20 minutes.

00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.499 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'm aware of it.

00:20:00.434 --> 00:20:02.136 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's right, Kojiro.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.105 position:30% line:83% align:start
And you haven't
even noticed.

00:20:04.138 --> 00:20:06.306 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now that you play
for Team Toho,

00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:08.076 position:16% line:89% align:start
your heart has gone soft.

00:20:08.109 --> 00:20:10.078 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't play the fool with me.

00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:12.279 position:19% line:83% align:start
I saw how you had pity
for Misugi,

00:20:12.312 --> 00:20:13.648 position:13% line:89% align:start
and that's why Team Musashi

00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:16.784 position:19% line:83% align:start
managed to get the ball
back so easily.

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:19.954 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your competitive spirit
is gone completely, kid.

00:20:19.987 --> 00:20:20.988 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:20:22.289 --> 00:20:24.859 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Kira] Fortunately,
you still have a prodigy

00:20:24.892 --> 00:20:26.761 position:13% line:89% align:start
who can defend a goal post!

00:20:26.794 --> 00:20:27.929 position:19% line:89% align:start
But if they had scored,

00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:30.531 position:24% line:83% align:start
the blame would be
all on you.

00:20:30.565 --> 00:20:31.498 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:33.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're a disgrace, Kojiro!

00:20:33.433 --> 00:20:35.803 position:19% line:83% align:start
I never taught you how
to have compassion!

00:20:35.837 --> 00:20:38.740 position:19% line:83% align:start
A true tiger never has
compassion for its prey!

00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:41.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
And the only thing that
matters is the strength!

00:20:41.274 --> 00:20:42.409 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uh...
-[Mr. Kira] If you were

00:20:42.442 --> 00:20:43.678 position:24% line:89% align:start
the same as before,

00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:46.748 position:13% line:83% align:start
we would've kicked Misugi's
heart beyond repair!

00:20:46.781 --> 00:20:47.782 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:20:47.815 --> 00:20:50.383 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[groan]
-[yell]

00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:52.754 position:27% line:83% align:start
Since you joined
this school,

00:20:52.787 --> 00:20:57.158 position:16% line:83% align:start
you lost your game style,
the fierceness of the tiger.

00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:59.894 position:21% line:83% align:start
That fighting spirit
that once was in you

00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:01.095 position:21% line:89% align:start
has all disappeared.

00:21:01.129 --> 00:21:05.298 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've forgotten the reason
you used to play this game.

00:21:05.332 --> 00:21:08.002 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Kojiro I knew
was different.

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:09.704 position:30% line:83% align:start
He was a Tiger
fighting adversity

00:21:09.737 --> 00:21:11.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
and he only thought
about himself,

00:21:11.304 --> 00:21:12.405 position:19% line:89% align:start
not about anyone else.

00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:17.011 position:19% line:83% align:start
I must go, but you keep
training hard,

00:21:17.044 --> 00:21:18.746 position:21% line:89% align:start
even if I'm not here.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.480 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Yes! Yes, Captain!
-Yes! Yes, Captain!

00:21:25.219 --> 00:21:26.888 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Wakashimazu.
-Huh?

00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:28.089 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hello, Captain.

00:21:28.122 --> 00:21:29.957 position:16% line:83% align:start
You really didn't have to
come see me.

00:21:29.991 --> 00:21:30.992 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's okay.

00:21:31.025 --> 00:21:34.294 position:16% line:83% align:start
I had to go to some place
and it was on the way.

00:21:34.327 --> 00:21:37.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
You just need to get
some rest for now.

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:39.233 position:13% line:89% align:start
We hope you get well soon.

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:40.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, Captain.

00:21:41.202 --> 00:21:42.236 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Kira]
That's the reason

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.304 position:38% line:83% align:start
your team
has been loyal to you.

00:21:44.337 --> 00:21:46.040 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ken and Takeshi worked hard

00:21:46.073 --> 00:21:47.575 position:16% line:83% align:start
to get in the same school
as you

00:21:47.608 --> 00:21:49.342 position:16% line:89% align:start
so they could follow you.

00:21:50.144 --> 00:21:51.646 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're so selfish.

00:21:51.679 --> 00:21:53.714 position:21% line:83% align:start
How could you forget
about them like that?

00:21:54.749 --> 00:21:57.350 position:24% line:83% align:start
And while you waste
your time being soft,

00:21:57.384 --> 00:21:58.553 position:21% line:89% align:start
your rival, Tsubasa,

00:21:58.586 --> 00:22:01.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
keeps improving himself
more and more.

00:22:01.255 --> 00:22:03.124 position:21% line:83% align:start
He'll soon be out of
your reach.

00:22:03.157 --> 00:22:07.195 position:27% line:89% align:start
[tiger growling]

00:22:07.228 --> 00:22:09.130 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Mr. Kira]
Now I'm the only trainer

00:22:09.163 --> 00:22:11.165 position:33% line:83% align:start
of the school
for the city of Okinawa.

00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:12.332 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:12.365 --> 00:22:14.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kojiro, If you ever feel
like your strength

00:22:14.502 --> 00:22:17.205 position:24% line:83% align:start
is vanishing while
you're playing this game,

00:22:17.238 --> 00:22:20.074 position:21% line:83% align:start
and you lose against
Tsubasa again,

00:22:20.107 --> 00:22:21.742 position:13% line:89% align:start
you know where to find me.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.416 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? Captain Hyuga?
