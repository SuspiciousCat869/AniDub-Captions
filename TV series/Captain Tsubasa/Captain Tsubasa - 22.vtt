00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:35.903 position:24% line:89% align:start
Did we really win?

00:10:35.936 --> 00:10:38.939 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well done, man!
You did it, Tsubasa.

00:10:38.973 --> 00:10:41.543 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:10:41.576 --> 00:10:42.511 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:44.011 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:44.979 position:38% line:89% align:start
Captain!

00:10:45.012 --> 00:10:46.981 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:50.217 position:24% line:83% align:start
Calm down, manager.
I'm doing fine.

00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:50.784 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:10:50.818 --> 00:10:52.153 position:24% line:89% align:start
Misugi, are you--?

00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:55.823 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa, I sincerely
congratulate you.

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:58.159 position:10% line:89% align:start
You beat me fair and square.

00:10:58.192 --> 00:10:59.660 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's no doubt that...

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:00.928 position:16% line:89% align:start
you're the better player.

00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:02.597 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, I don't think
that's true.

00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:03.931 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm really not.

00:11:03.964 --> 00:11:06.233 position:24% line:83% align:start
Had it not been for
your heart condition...

00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:09.538 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure you would've
stopped my last shot.

00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:12.806 position:30% line:83% align:start
Team Musashi is
a very strong opponent.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.742 position:13% line:89% align:start
That means a lot, Tsubasa.

00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:16.777 position:30% line:83% align:start
But in the end,
you were better.

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:18.979 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're the better player.

00:11:19.013 --> 00:11:21.550 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can retire without
any doubts.

00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:23.350 position:16% line:89% align:start
What do you mean by that?

00:11:23.384 --> 00:11:24.685 position:13% line:89% align:start
I was only allowed to play

00:11:24.718 --> 00:11:26.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
a couple of minutes
every match.

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.989 position:21% line:83% align:start
And ever since I knew
I'd face you...

00:11:29.023 --> 00:11:31.358 position:13% line:83% align:start
I had decided I would play
a whole match.

00:11:32.693 --> 00:11:33.894 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't care that I lost.

00:11:33.928 --> 00:11:35.796 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm truly happy leaving...

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:37.231 position:21% line:83% align:start
with having faced you
and knowing that

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:38.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
I played my best.

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:40.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's what means
the most to me.

00:11:41.636 --> 00:11:43.237 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm truly thankful, Tsubasa.

00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:45.806 position:33% line:83% align:start
And you guys,
you're the best.

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:48.409 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Don't sweat it.
-It was our pleasure.

00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:49.743 position:24% line:89% align:start
And you too, Yayoi.

00:11:49.777 --> 00:11:52.279 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want to thank you too
for everything you've done.

00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:53.113 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:54.516 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm pretty sure...

00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:56.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
that without all of
your help...

00:11:56.317 --> 00:11:59.353 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't have experienced
such a beautiful match.

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.821 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah... Captain.

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:04.124 position:24% line:83% align:start
I owe you big time.
I'm in your debt.

00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:06.293 position:16% line:83% align:start
And now, I'd like for you
to help me

00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:07.494 position:13% line:89% align:start
as the manager of the team.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.998 position:33% line:83% align:start
I need to get
all the way to the bench.

00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:12.199 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:13.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
Of course...

00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:14.703 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:16.103 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, my dear Misugi.

00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:19.373 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh darling,
we should be proud of him.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.208 position:13% line:89% align:start
Jun is an excellent player.

00:12:21.242 --> 00:12:22.943 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, he is.

00:12:24.778 --> 00:12:25.680 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Jun]
Tsubasa Ozora.

00:12:25.714 --> 00:12:26.880 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:29.450 position:16% line:83% align:start
I decided I won't give up
on soccer just yet.

00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:31.519 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:35.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even if I can only play
two minutes next time...

00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:38.526 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll step on the pitch
one more time for sure.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.760 position:30% line:89% align:start
And some day...

00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:42.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll completely recover
from my heart condition.

00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:44.298 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know you will.

today is the big day

The finals of
the national tournament.

00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:19.166 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah. It's a pity that

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:21.902 position:19% line:83% align:start
I couldn't be in Japan

You don't have to worry
about that, Captain.

You can see the match

Somehow,
that doesn't feel right.

00:14:11.553 --> 00:14:12.453 position:38% line:83% align:start
[driver]
It's no bother.

00:14:12.486 --> 00:14:14.756 position:35% line:83% align:start
Either way,
it's on the way to my job.

00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:16.290 position:27% line:83% align:start
Team Nankatsu is
very strong.

00:14:16.323 --> 00:14:18.192 position:24% line:83% align:start
And that's because
you guys cheer them on

00:14:18.225 --> 00:14:19.728 position:24% line:83% align:start
during the matches,
young miss.

00:14:19.761 --> 00:14:20.829 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's because we have

00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:22.396 position:19% line:83% align:start
our star player Tsubasa
with us, sir.

While we're on the subject,
Tsubasa...

He's your boyfriend,
right?

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:27.736 position:44% line:83% align:start
What?
My boyfriend?

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:28.770 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, come on.
What're you saying, sir?

I'm driving, you know?

00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:36.143 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Shiroyama] Kids, you did
a great job out there.

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:38.412 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thanks to all your efforts,

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:39.446 position:21% line:89% align:start
we finally got here.

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.851 position:24% line:83% align:start
We didn't even feel
the absence of Koji.

I'm sorry for complicating
your lives, guys.

00:14:45.653 --> 00:14:46.855 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ryo, you covered

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:48.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
his position very well.
Thank you.

00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:50.157 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ah, well, you know...
[laughs]

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.092 position:16% line:89% align:start
And while on the subject,

00:14:52.126 --> 00:14:54.829 position:24% line:83% align:start
you did a great job
in today's match, Yuzo.

00:14:54.863 --> 00:14:57.030 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sure that Genzo
is very proud of you.

00:14:57.064 --> 00:14:58.432 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Yuzo]
Thank you.

00:14:58.465 --> 00:15:00.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, this time around,

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:01.569 position:21% line:83% align:start
Genzo will be the one
covering for you.

00:15:01.603 --> 00:15:02.537 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that okay?

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:03.738 position:33% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Yuzo.

00:15:03.772 --> 00:15:04.839 position:27% line:89% align:start
Very well played.

00:15:04.873 --> 00:15:06.407 position:27% line:83% align:start
That means a lot
coming from you.

00:15:07.274 --> 00:15:09.878 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm going to protect
Nankatsu's goal.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.613 position:27% line:83% align:start
Team Meiwa won't
be able to score.

00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:12.346 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:15:12.847 --> 00:15:14.114 position:24% line:89% align:start
And just remember,

00:15:14.148 --> 00:15:16.584 position:21% line:83% align:start
if Genzo were to have
any problems with his foot,

00:15:16.618 --> 00:15:19.119 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll come back in
the game immediately, Yuzo.

00:15:19.153 --> 00:15:21.288 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yes, sir.
You know I'll be prepared.

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:23.190 position:30% line:89% align:start
Great to hear.

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:24.692 position:19% line:89% align:start
Lastly, you, Tsubasa...

00:15:24.726 --> 00:15:25.527 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.393 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm congratulating you

00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:29.163 position:21% line:83% align:start
for taking your team
to the finals.

00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:30.497 position:19% line:89% align:start
I feel so proud of you.

00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:33.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
All of you did an excellent
job on the pitch.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.803 position:35% line:89% align:start
But now...

00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:37.237 position:24% line:83% align:start
you have to put in
twice as much effort.

00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:38.172 position:35% line:89% align:start
This is...

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:40.842 position:30% line:83% align:start
the last match
you'll ever get to play...

00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:42.443 position:21% line:89% align:start
with the same jersey.

00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:44.813 position:27% line:89% align:start
After this match,

00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:47.147 position:24% line:83% align:start

00:21:03.698 --> 00:21:07.702 position:19% line:83% align:start
And now, let's show off
Team Meiwa's true power.

00:21:07.735 --> 00:21:10.470 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll win and we'll take
the trophy back home.

Listen up, guys.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:14.776 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is the very last match.

00:21:14.809 --> 00:21:17.178 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's pour our hearts
on the pitch.

00:21:17.211 --> 00:21:18.613 position:19% line:89% align:start
And above all things...

00:21:18.646 --> 00:21:20.380 position:30% line:83% align:start
let's show them
who we really are, team.

-Yeah!

00:21:25.853 --> 00:21:27.287 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's the last match.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.090 position:27% line:83% align:start
You gotta give it
everything you've got!

00:21:29.123 --> 00:21:30.290 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, Nankatsu.

00:21:30.323 --> 00:21:33.227 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have to win for
all of us, you hear me?

00:21:33.261 --> 00:21:36.197 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
