00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:23.423 position:19% line:83% align:start
-So, today is the day.
-Uh-huh!

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:24.659 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll catch up
with you later.

00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:25.092 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:00:25.994 --> 00:00:27.795 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right!
I'll see you later, Coach!

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.062 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Bye, guys!

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:33.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
Does he always take
the ball with him

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.269 position:21% line:89% align:start
when he goes outside?

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:35.670 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.506 position:38% line:83% align:start
You know,
I've been wondering...

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.541 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:39.574 --> 00:00:42.042 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa was supposed to
go to school in Shutetsu

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.144 position:33% line:83% align:start
to be part of
their famous soccer team.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.681 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why the sudden
change of plans?

00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:47.649 position:19% line:89% align:start
He really insisted that

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:50.050 position:13% line:83% align:start
he wanted to be transferred
to Nankatsu

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
and it looks like he's
already making new friends.

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:53.655 position:24% line:89% align:start
And on top of that,

00:00:53.688 --> 00:00:57.090 position:19% line:83% align:start
the great Roberto Hongo
is going to be coaching him.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:59.661 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure his dad
will be very happy.

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:00.695 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:46.834 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:59.814 --> 00:03:01.783 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>Medical diagnosis report.</i>

00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:11.391 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Hey, Roberto!

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:12.660 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you have the uniform
you wore

00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:14.696 position:24% line:83% align:start
when you played for
the Brazilian national team?

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:15.530 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:17.330 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'd love to see
the uniform

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
that you wore back then for
the national team, Roberto!

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:22.670 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:27.141 position:19% line:89% align:start
Whoa, this is so cool!

00:03:27.175 --> 00:03:28.275 position:35% line:89% align:start
Number 10!

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.310 position:16% line:89% align:start
Have a look at this, Mom.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:31.813 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's the real thing!

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:33.881 position:21% line:89% align:start
It looks really good.

00:03:33.915 --> 00:03:35.382 position:21% line:89% align:start
By the way, Roberto,

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.618 position:19% line:83% align:start
you did wash it before
giving it to him?

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:40.054 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
Of course, I washed it!

00:03:40.088 --> 00:03:42.023 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[chuckle]
-[Tsubasa] Robero!

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:43.256 position:38% line:83% align:start
Someday,
I'll take on the world

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.727 position:24% line:83% align:start
with the best team
anyone has ever seen.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.295 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even Brazil won't stand
a chance against me.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.831 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] [chuckle]
There you go.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:52.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[Tsubasa] [chuckle]
-I'll never forget that.

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:53.901 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know you can do it!

00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:56.671 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Okay!
-[chuckle]

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:01.709 position:19% line:89% align:start
"The world", he says...

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:11.619 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Nakano]
What?

00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:14.889 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you just say that
the soccer club won a match?

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:16.858 position:41% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:19.060 position:13% line:83% align:start
How about you see the score
with your own eyes?

00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:20.895 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow, you're right!

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:22.697 position:19% line:89% align:start
5-2 against Nishigaoka?

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.497 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's awesome!

00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:25.499 position:27% line:83% align:start
How did your lame
soccer club

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.300 position:13% line:89% align:start
manage to score five goals?

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:30.872 position:38% line:83% align:start
[chuckle]
Well, thank you for asking.

00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:32.707 position:21% line:83% align:start
Our new club member,
Tsubasa,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.143 position:13% line:83% align:start
scored four of those goals
all by himself.

00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:36.778 position:33% line:83% align:start
What's more,
the one who scored

00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.714 position:19% line:83% align:start
the deciding fifth goal
was me! [chuckle]

00:04:39.747 --> 00:04:43.483 position:13% line:83% align:start
My head shot was literally
a perfect goal!

00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:45.385 position:27% line:83% align:start
It was thanks to
Tsubasa's cross,

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:46.486 position:33% line:89% align:start
to be honest.

00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:48.089 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[Ryo] Uh...
-Just hold on a minute.

00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:49.657 position:24% line:83% align:start
Who is this Tsubasa
character?

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.760 position:19% line:83% align:start
And when exactly did he
become a team member?

00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:53.828 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, actually...

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
We ran into each other
out of pure luck

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.965 position:30% line:83% align:start
during our last
spring break.

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.299 position:33% line:89% align:start
By pure luck?

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:00.501 position:13% line:89% align:start
What're you talking about?

00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:02.335 position:30% line:83% align:start
Wait a second,
that means that

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.038 position:27% line:83% align:start
if it weren't for
that Tsubasa guy,

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:05.640 position:27% line:83% align:start
you wouldn't have
scored any goals?

00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:06.373 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.109 position:35% line:83% align:start
One person
scoring four goals

00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:09.510 position:30% line:83% align:start
is even better
than a hat trick.

00:05:09.544 --> 00:05:12.547 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even Shutetsu doesn't
have someone like that.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.482 position:27% line:83% align:start
We have some news
that'll surprise you too.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:17.552 position:30% line:83% align:start
Our soccer club
now has a coach.

00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:19.687 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I nearly forgot.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.556 position:33% line:83% align:start
Our coach is
the former member

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.524 position:27% line:83% align:start
of the Brazilian
national soccer team,

00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:26.194 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Roberto Hongo.
-What're you talking about?

00:05:26.227 --> 00:05:27.360 position:24% line:89% align:start
Isn't that awesome?

00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:29.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's an acquaintance
of Tsubasa.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just what kind of guy
is this Tsubasa character?

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:33.868 position:21% line:89% align:start
Look, there he comes.

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:34.902 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:05:39.607 --> 00:05:41.609 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
Is that Tsubasa?

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:43.711 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
Yeah, that's him.

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:46.147 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why is he dribbling
the ball right now?

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.315 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just as expected.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.449 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's been dribbling
all the way from home.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:50.885 position:19% line:89% align:start
All the way from home?

00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:52.452 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's always like that.

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:55.056 position:27% line:83% align:start
Wherever he goes,
he keeps on dribbling.

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:56.290 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa...

00:05:56.324 --> 00:05:57.592 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's really good at it.

00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.560 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nakano] It must be true
he scored five goals.

00:05:59.594 --> 00:06:00.695 position:33% line:83% align:start
He looks like
the kind of guy

00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:03.297 position:33% line:83% align:start
who could do
something like that, right?

00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:05.365 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I did score
one of them.

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:07.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
He only got four goals in.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.137 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tsubasa!

00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:11.639 position:24% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Ryo!

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:12.673 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:19.814 position:27% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa Ozora...

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:23.084 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is Tsubasa.

00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:24.719 position:16% line:89% align:start
He is your new classmate.

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:26.621 position:19% line:83% align:start
Make sure you make him
feel welcomed.

00:06:26.654 --> 00:06:29.056 position:38% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa,
please intorduce yourself.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.925 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's up, guys?

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.093 position:24% line:89% align:start
My name is Tsubasa!

00:06:33.361 --> 00:06:35.495 position:27% line:89% align:start
By the way, uh...

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:39.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
why did you bring
a soccer ball to class?

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.369 position:16% line:89% align:start
'Cuz it's my best friend.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.603 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:44.471 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It's your best friend?
-Yeah!

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:45.640 position:33% line:89% align:start
Guess what?!

00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:47.875 position:35% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa has
joined the soccer club!

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:50.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
This year, our club will
be different from before.

00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:52.780 position:13% line:83% align:start
The inter-school tournament
is gonna be great!

00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:55.016 position:38% line:83% align:start
[chuckle]
Sanae, I'm trusting you

00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:56.517 position:21% line:83% align:start
with cheering us on.
Can you handle that?

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.452 position:33% line:83% align:start
Isn't Tsubasa
the really awesome player?

00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:01.522 position:30% line:83% align:start
The rest of you
never won a single game.

00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:04.625 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're all just members of
the no-good soccer club.

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:05.826 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
That's not true.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.861 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:09.263 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, until the tournament,

00:07:09.297 --> 00:07:10.463 position:21% line:89% align:start
if Ryo and the others

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:12.465 position:21% line:83% align:start
become better friends
with the soccer ball,

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.935 position:24% line:83% align:start
they'll get better
at soccer.

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:15.803 position:19% line:89% align:start
Roberto said so, guys.

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:17.972 position:24% line:83% align:start
He called the ball
his "best friend."

00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:18.739 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:07:19.607 --> 00:07:21.509 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's all go see
the new soccer team

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:23.411 position:19% line:83% align:start
practice after school,
you guys.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.478 position:35% line:83% align:start
-All right!
-Yeah!

00:07:25.513 --> 00:07:27.882 position:44% line:83% align:start
Uh...
Well, let's get ready.

00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:30.151 position:21% line:83% align:start
The entrance ceremony
is about to begin.

[Principal] Students of
Nankatsu Elementary,

who are in a sports club...

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:40.594 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know you are all
restlessly waiting for

00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:42.863 position:16% line:83% align:start
today's entrance ceremony
to end.

00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:45.032 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Principal]
From today on,

00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:47.034 position:19% line:83% align:start
you'll start practicing
in preparation for

00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:50.304 position:13% line:83% align:start
the inter-school tournament
with Shutetsu.

00:07:50.338 --> 00:07:51.706 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't slack off!

00:07:51.739 --> 00:07:52.707 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Yes, Coach!
-Yes, Coach!

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.608 position:13% line:89% align:start
You guys have to work hard

00:07:54.642 --> 00:07:57.078 position:10% line:83% align:start
to win our third consecutive
inter-school tournament!

00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:58.980 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:07:59.013 --> 00:08:00.715 position:19% line:89% align:start
Listen up, kendo club!

00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:01.782 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[yelling]
-We must erase

00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:04.352 position:30% line:83% align:start
the humiliation
of last year.

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:06.220 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't give up,
keep on running!

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:08.522 position:13% line:83% align:start
The inter-school tournament
is around the corner.

00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:09.523 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's keep on training!

00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:12.093 position:13% line:83% align:start

00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:14.195 position:19% line:83% align:start

 <i>Go Nankatsu!</i>

One, two!
One two!

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:37.785 position:16% line:83% align:start
This year, we'll finally
be able to settle the score.

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:40.388 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's no wonder that
each club is fired up.

00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:41.822 position:16% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right, Sanae?

00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:42.757 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.726 position:24% line:83% align:start
The biggest problem
is the soccer club.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.629 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's go and check out
just how good Tsubasa is.

00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:51.565 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right, we're off
to the soccer field, guys!

-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:08:57.738 --> 00:09:01.709 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh my, Roberto left
his jersey out here.

00:09:01.742 --> 00:09:04.945 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ace striker, number 10...

00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:06.047 position:30% line:89% align:start
Roberto Hongo.

00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:10.985 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's not Tsubasa,
but that's still very cool.

00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:13.554 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, I need to clean.

00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:18.859 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh! Oh no!

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:21.729 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:25.132 position:30% line:89% align:start
Medical report?

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:29.036 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Roberto.

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:35.342 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.111 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:38.813 position:21% line:89% align:start
What does this mean?

00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:43.784 position:35% line:89% align:start
Roberto...

00:09:44.318 --> 00:09:45.719 position:30% line:89% align:start
It can't be...

00:10:08.109 --> 00:10:10.044 position:19% line:89% align:start
The weather's so nice!

 <i>After all, it was useless.</i>

00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:21.755 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>I did everything I could</i>

00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:24.058 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>and upon the advice</i>
 <i>of Captain Oozora,</i>

00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:27.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>I've finally made it back</i>
 <i>to my homeland.</i>

00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:29.630 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>Yet, the diagnosis</i>

00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:32.733 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>that I have</i>
 <i>retinal detachment.</i>

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:35.136 position:30% line:83% align:start

 <i>we were late to notice it.</i>

00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:37.271 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>If I keep on playing</i>
 <i>soccer any longer,</i>

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:40.374 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:42.209 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>I will become blind...</i>

 <i>forever.</i>

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:47.681 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>Please announce that</i>
 <i>I'll be retiring.</i>

00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:52.486 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>Give my best</i>
 <i>to the rest of the team.</i>

00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:54.722 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>I plan to stay</i>
 <i>in my homeland</i>

 <i>for the time being.</i>

00:10:57.358 --> 00:10:58.259 position:24% line:89% align:start
Incredible dribbles

00:10:58.292 --> 00:11:00.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
from the Brazilian
national team player,

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:01.762 position:30% line:89% align:start
Roberto Hongo!

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:06.800 position:16% line:83% align:start

 <i>to play professional soccer.</i>

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.135 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>But as things are,</i>

00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:11.672 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>it might be best for me</i>
 <i>if I lived in my homeland.</i>

00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:14.008 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>You don't need</i>
 <i>to worry about me.</i>

00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:16.777 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>I've been preparing</i>
 <i>myself for this</i>

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.379 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>ever since I left Brazil.</i>

00:11:24.285 --> 00:11:26.854 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>But if ever return</i>
 <i>to Brazil one day,</i>

00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:28.322 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>I have a feeling that</i>

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:29.256 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>I won't be alone.</i>

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.693 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>In my homeland,</i>
 <i>I've found a new flame.</i>

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:34.862 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>His passion for the game</i>

00:11:34.895 --> 00:11:36.397 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>reminds me of my own.</i>

00:11:37.464 --> 00:11:39.300 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, guys,
let's start practicing!

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:40.635 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:11:40.669 --> 00:11:44.205 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] <i>And that flame's</i>
 <i>name is Tsubasa.</i>

00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:45.105 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:46.273 position:38% line:89% align:start
Roberto!

00:11:46.307 --> 00:11:47.474 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Coach!

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.412 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right!
Let's do this!

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.747 position:38% line:89% align:start
Roberto!

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.325 position:33% line:89% align:start
A-Awesome...

00:12:04.358 --> 00:12:05.726 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:07.861 position:21% line:83% align:start
That was a nice shot,
Roberto!

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:09.496 position:24% line:89% align:start
Nice pass, Tsubasa!

00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:10.965 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
So cool!

00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:12.366 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uh...
-Did you see it?

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.200 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did you? Did you?

00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:15.135 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did you guys see
that awesome shot?

00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:16.170 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I did!

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.472 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa's pretty good,

00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:20.307 position:27% line:83% align:start
but that old man
is not bad either.

00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:21.775 position:16% line:89% align:start
That long shot was crazy.

00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:23.277 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is that their new coach?

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.446 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is that who Ryo was
talking about earlier,

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:26.681 position:19% line:89% align:start
that Brazilian player?

00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:30.384 position:35% line:83% align:start
His name is
"something-something" Hongo.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.186 position:16% line:89% align:start
The name's Roberto Hongo.

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:33.020 position:24% line:89% align:start
You are talking to

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:34.888 position:35% line:83% align:start
a Brazilian
national player, guys.

00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:36.658 position:21% line:89% align:start
An ex-player, though.

00:12:36.691 --> 00:12:37.358 position:27% line:89% align:start
And who are you?

00:12:38.292 --> 00:12:40.629 position:13% line:83% align:start
They're the cheering squad
of Nankatsu.

00:12:40.662 --> 00:12:41.762 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:44.198 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm Sanae Nakazawa
and I'm the leader of

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.000 position:35% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu's
cheerleading squad.

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:47.101 position:13% line:89% align:start
Everyone calls her "boss."

00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:49.436 position:19% line:83% align:start
[growl] Hey! You better
keep quiet, Ryo!

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:50.904 position:10% line:83% align:start
Really? Did you guys come to
cheer our soccer club then,

00:12:50.938 --> 00:12:52.741 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did you guys come to cheer
our soccer club then,

00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:54.308 position:27% line:89% align:start
or just to watch?

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:55.476 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not really.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.777 position:33% line:83% align:start
Ryo has been
telling everybody

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.045 position:19% line:89% align:start
about yesterday's match

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:00.180 position:16% line:83% align:start
and we were just curious
about Tsubasa

00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:01.716 position:30% line:89% align:start
and you, Coach.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.150 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh?
-Huh?

00:13:03.183 --> 00:13:05.919 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ryo was boasting about
our lame soccer club

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:08.088 position:35% line:83% align:start
having such
a big transformation.

00:13:08.122 --> 00:13:10.257 position:27% line:83% align:start
We've come to see
what that's all about.

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:11.892 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh? Hmm...

00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:15.796 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:18.132 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're gonna start with
a practice match!

00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:19.199 position:38% line:89% align:start
A match?

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:22.436 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a welcoming party for
the new member, Tsubasa.

00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:27.141 position:41% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:33.715 position:35% line:83% align:start
Seriously?
A welcoming party?

00:13:33.748 --> 00:13:34.815 position:13% line:89% align:start
This'll be the opposite of

00:13:34.848 --> 00:13:36.884 position:33% line:83% align:start
the time when
I first met Tsubasa,

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:40.154 position:21% line:83% align:start
the match between him
and B team of Shutetsu.

00:13:40.187 --> 00:13:42.122 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Roberto] Tsubasa will be
attacking alone.

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:44.358 position:30% line:83% align:start
Ryo and others
will pass the ball.

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:45.092 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mark him...

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:46.093 position:38% line:89% align:start
In short,

00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:49.063 position:19% line:83% align:start
you'll try not to have
the ball taken from you.

00:13:49.096 --> 00:13:51.965 position:16% line:83% align:start
If Tsubasa gets the ball,
he'll shoot.

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:53.967 position:30% line:83% align:start
The time limit
is five minutes.

00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:56.470 position:13% line:83% align:start
If his shot becomes a goal,
Tsubasa wins.

00:13:56.504 --> 00:13:59.406 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you manage to protect
your goal for five minutes,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.908 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ryo's side wins.

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:02.910 position:24% line:83% align:start
Isn't this a really
crazy idea?

00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:05.714 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even if he is really good,
isn't this a little unfair?

00:14:05.747 --> 00:14:08.215 position:44% line:83% align:start
Sshh!
Shut up and watch.

00:14:10.184 --> 00:14:12.953 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're all gonna play
against Tsubasa?

00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:13.921 position:24% line:89% align:start
He'll get the ball

00:14:13.954 --> 00:14:14.922 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the blink of an eye
for sure.

00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:17.424 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just have a little faith,
you guys!

00:14:17.458 --> 00:14:18.225 position:21% line:89% align:start
If he takes the ball,

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:19.493 position:27% line:83% align:start
you just have to
take it back.

00:14:19.527 --> 00:14:22.096 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't winning against
Tsubasa be the best?

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:24.098 position:13% line:89% align:start
Easier said than done, Ryo!

00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:25.800 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's all of us
against Tsubasa...

00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:26.967 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's do this!

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.636 position:35% line:83% align:start
-All right!
-All right!

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.672 position:21% line:89% align:start
Bring it on, Tsubasa!

00:14:30.705 --> 00:14:32.439 position:21% line:89% align:start
Here I go, everybody!

00:14:40.548 --> 00:14:42.015 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Start!
-[whistle]

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.420 position:30% line:83% align:start
Here he comes!
Hiroshi, follow Tsubasa!

00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:47.454 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm on it!

00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:49.624 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:52.459 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Tsubasa.

00:14:52.493 --> 00:14:55.597 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll be holding you down
for the next five minutes.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.631 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:14:58.465 --> 00:14:59.900 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh? He's passed!

00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:01.268 position:27% line:89% align:start
He got past them!

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:03.605 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, you guys,
somebody cover him!

00:15:03.638 --> 00:15:04.539 position:44% line:89% align:start
Here!

00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:06.173 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:15:06.574 --> 00:15:07.341 position:47% line:89% align:start

Oh! Uh, here you go!

00:15:10.477 --> 00:15:12.446 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:14.248 position:33% line:89% align:start
Go after him!

00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:15.382 position:33% line:89% align:start
Here I come!

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:17.117 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:19.486 position:21% line:89% align:start
Come on, recover it!

00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:20.954 position:30% line:89% align:start
I got this one!

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:23.424 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[grunt]
-Huh?

00:15:23.457 --> 00:15:25.459 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Amazing!
-He's fast.

00:15:26.694 --> 00:15:28.797 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.800 position:41% line:83% align:start

Guys, go after him!

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:33.033 position:41% line:89% align:start

[grunt]

00:15:38.939 --> 00:15:40.174 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Ichikawa]
He's so strong.

00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:42.510 position:33% line:83% align:start
Ryo's team is
no match for him.

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:45.179 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's got great talent,
don't you think, Sanae?

00:15:45.212 --> 00:15:46.180 position:21% line:89% align:start
With him on the team,

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:48.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
we have a real chance
this year!

00:15:48.482 --> 00:15:49.617 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa...

00:15:50.184 --> 00:15:51.619 position:21% line:89% align:start
Three minutes to go.

00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:54.087 position:24% line:89% align:start
We still have time!

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:56.524 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's recover the ball!

00:15:56.558 --> 00:15:58.593 position:16% line:89% align:start
We can let Roberto down!

00:15:58.626 --> 00:16:00.528 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-[grunt]

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:02.429 position:38% line:89% align:start

-Oh!
-Ah!

00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:07.334 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:09.236 position:30% line:89% align:start
Get up, Manabu!

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:11.305 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just one more minute left.

00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:12.439 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:16:26.053 --> 00:16:27.522 position:19% line:89% align:start

Wow, that was awesome!
What a great goal!

00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:07.695 position:16% line:89% align:start
Too bad we lost that one!

00:17:07.729 --> 00:17:10.030 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa's really amazing!

00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:11.498 position:33% line:89% align:start
He's so cool!

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:12.099 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa!

00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:15.135 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Ryo] You really have
a powerful kick!

00:17:15.168 --> 00:17:17.772 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thank you... It's 'cuz
I really love soccer.

00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:23.243 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, what's going on
with you, Sanae?

00:17:23.277 --> 00:17:25.245 position:19% line:89% align:start
You look really weird.

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:27.515 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're acting different
all of a sudden.

00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:29.551 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, Sanae? Hello?

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:31.485 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:17:33.655 --> 00:17:35.222 position:35% line:89% align:start
is so cool!

00:17:35.255 --> 00:17:36.490 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?!
-What?!

00:17:36.524 --> 00:17:39.192 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're getting
all mushy on us, Sanae!

00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:41.328 position:10% line:89% align:start
Congratulations to everyone.

00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:44.331 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have managed to give
Tsubasa a good match.

00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:45.867 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
You have to promise to keep

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.635 position:16% line:89% align:start
training hard every time.

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:48.836 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay?

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.070 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:17:57.477 --> 00:17:58.478 position:41% line:89% align:start
Shoot!

00:18:00.648 --> 00:18:02.584 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.654 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:18:14.662 --> 00:18:16.229 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is there any updates?

00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:19.366 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, they started training
with their new coach,

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:22.336 position:19% line:83% align:start
the ex-Brazilian player
Roberto Hongo.

00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:23.972 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm really curious to see

00:18:24.005 --> 00:18:25.405 position:27% line:83% align:start
how far that team
will progress

00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:27.575 position:24% line:83% align:start
under the direction
of a professional.

00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:30.845 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't think
any of the other players

00:18:30.878 --> 00:18:32.013 position:21% line:89% align:start
will be a challenge.

00:18:32.046 --> 00:18:33.213 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:34.782 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Genzo] In the game
against Nishigaoka,

00:18:34.816 --> 00:18:38.251 position:21% line:83% align:start
The only one who made
a difference was Tsubasa.

00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:40.153 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't underestimate them.

00:18:41.188 --> 00:18:43.423 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not worried about
anyone on that team.

00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:45.258 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm going to be
ready for them!

00:18:50.297 --> 00:18:52.299 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nakano] That training
was really hard.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.370 position:21% line:83% align:start
This Brazilian coach
really made them work hard.

00:18:56.403 --> 00:18:59.206 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm exhausted just
by looking at them.

00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:01.876 position:41% line:83% align:start
[yawn]
I'm exhausted!

00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:02.877 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.179 position:35% line:83% align:start
Seriously?
You guys are so weak!

00:19:06.213 --> 00:19:08.181 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now what's your problem?

00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:09.383 position:27% line:89% align:start
Look at Tsubasa.

00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:11.151 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
He still looks fresh.

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:14.221 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Ryo]
But he's not like us!

00:19:15.188 --> 00:19:16.423 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's no wonder everybody

00:19:16.456 --> 00:19:18.425 position:27% line:83% align:start
always makes fun
of you guys.

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:21.129 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought you really wanted
the team to get better.

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:22.329 position:35% line:89% align:start
Calm down.

00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:24.331 position:16% line:83% align:start
It'll take a lot of time
and practice.

00:19:24.364 --> 00:19:25.566 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've gotta be patient.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.668 position:27% line:89% align:start
I dunno if I can!

00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:29.137 position:19% line:83% align:start
Inter-school tournament
is about to start!

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:31.105 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're right!
That's why...

00:19:31.139 --> 00:19:32.372 position:27% line:89% align:start
Remember, kids...

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:34.876 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll have to become
best friends with the ball

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:37.045 position:24% line:83% align:start
if you want to win
your matches.

00:19:37.078 --> 00:19:39.113 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa and coach
are always telling us

00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:40.548 position:19% line:89% align:start
how important that is.

00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:43.350 position:27% line:83% align:start
How can we become
best friends with the ball?

00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:45.485 position:16% line:89% align:start
Always bring it with you.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.221 position:10% line:83% align:start
You must remember to take it
everywhere you're going.

00:19:48.255 --> 00:19:51.025 position:13% line:83% align:start
At school, eating lunch...
Everywhere.

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:52.225 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:55.228 position:24% line:83% align:start
Isn't that how you
you always do it, Tsubasa?

00:19:55.262 --> 00:19:56.931 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, pretty much.

00:19:56.964 --> 00:19:58.298 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're always
dribbling the ball

00:19:58.331 --> 00:19:59.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
on the way to school?

00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:00.434 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:20:01.002 --> 00:20:02.235 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's right, guys.

00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:04.572 position:30% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa did not
learn that from me.

00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:07.742 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's been doing it since
he was a little boy.

00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:08.743 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa...

00:20:08.776 --> 00:20:11.546 position:33% line:83% align:start
From now on,
you can't use your hands.

00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:13.380 position:30% line:83% align:start
The soccer ball
does not appreciate it

00:20:13.413 --> 00:20:15.282 position:27% line:83% align:start
when you carry it
with your hands.

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:16.584 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait a minute!

00:20:16.617 --> 00:20:18.986 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you telling me
we have to dribble the ball

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.354 position:30% line:83% align:start
wherever we go,
like Tsubasa does?

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:22.790 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know you can do it!

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.959 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you have to!

00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:26.359 position:21% line:89% align:start
Easy for you to say!

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:28.228 position:35% line:83% align:start
You want to
get better, right?

00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:30.363 position:13% line:83% align:start
What about the goalkeeper,
though?

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:33.500 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hmm... I guess the same
goes for you,

00:20:33.534 --> 00:20:35.970 position:19% line:83% align:start
but sometimes, you can
use your hands too.

00:20:36.003 --> 00:20:37.071 position:35% line:89% align:start
Whoa, cool!

00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:38.405 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's not fair!

00:20:38.438 --> 00:20:40.240 position:16% line:89% align:start
That'll be all for today.

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:43.144 position:13% line:83% align:start
Guys! Make sure you go home
dribbling the ball!

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:45.113 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Are you serious?!
-Are you serious?!

00:20:45.146 --> 00:20:45.980 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Ryo] Yeah!

00:20:46.814 --> 00:20:48.516 position:19% line:89% align:start
See you later, Tsubasa.

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:51.251 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, see you tomorrow, guys!

00:20:51.284 --> 00:20:53.020 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why don't you
cool it a little?!

00:20:53.054 --> 00:20:54.287 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Please don't embarrass us

00:20:54.321 --> 00:20:55.590 position:21% line:89% align:start
in front of Tsubasa!

00:20:55.623 --> 00:20:58.025 position:41% line:83% align:start
[growl]
Be quiet already!

00:20:58.059 --> 00:21:00.128 position:27% line:83% align:start
That looks really
difficult for them.

00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:01.929 position:19% line:89% align:start
These guys are awful...

00:21:01.963 --> 00:21:05.298 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know, but that's how
they're gonna get better.

00:21:05.332 --> 00:21:07.168 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is so exciting!

00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:08.536 position:33% line:83% align:start
I can't wait
'till the start of

00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:10.037 position:10% line:89% align:start
the inter-school tournament!

00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:13.273 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:21:13.306 --> 00:21:16.144 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm starving!
I need to get home quickly.

00:21:16.177 --> 00:21:18.045 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[Tsuyoshi] Oh no!
-Huh?

00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:19.312 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just my luck!

00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:21.215 position:30% line:83% align:start
What am I going
to do now, Ryo?

00:21:21.249 --> 00:21:22.750 position:24% line:89% align:start
Aw, what a mess...

00:21:22.784 --> 00:21:24.351 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hold on...

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:26.020 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do you live
around here, Manabu?

00:21:26.053 --> 00:21:27.155 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not really,

00:21:27.188 --> 00:21:29.289 position:24% line:83% align:start
but my best friend
won't even listen to me!

00:21:29.322 --> 00:21:30.258 position:24% line:89% align:start
What am I gonna do?

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.592 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:21:31.626 --> 00:21:34.996 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm not really sure if we
can make it home like this.

00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:37.364 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's cool to be goalkeeper!

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:44.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>He's very good.</i>

00:21:44.105 --> 00:21:45.840 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>As good as when</i>
 <i>I was his age.</i>

00:21:46.674 --> 00:21:49.610 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Roberto]
 <i>No... Maybe even more.</i>

00:21:52.146 --> 00:21:53.247 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
There you go!

00:21:53.281 --> 00:21:55.817 position:21% line:83% align:start
The ball hasn't even
touched the ground.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.985 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, Tsubasa,
do you like soccer?

00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:00.922 position:27% line:83% align:start
What a question.
Of course I do!

00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:02.023 position:38% line:89% align:start
Perfect!

00:22:02.056 --> 00:22:04.725 position:16% line:83% align:start
From now on, you have to
wake up at 5 a.m. to train.

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:05.860 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:22:05.893 --> 00:22:09.063 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to teach you what
real Brazilian soccer is.

00:22:09.096 --> 00:22:11.032 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah! All right.

00:22:13.835 --> 00:22:15.435 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>Dear Coach Joao...</i>

00:22:15.468 --> 00:22:17.404 position:35% line:83% align:start
 <i>I've found</i>
 <i>a glimmer of light.</i>

00:22:17.437 --> 00:22:19.006 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>His name is Tsubasa.</i>

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.310 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>I'll take my chances on him.</i>

00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:24.679 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>He has a lot of potential.</i>

00:22:24.712 --> 00:22:27.281 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'll make him</i>
 <i>a world-renowned player.</i>

00:22:27.315 --> 00:22:31.252 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>I know I've left the field,</i>
 <i>but soccer will always be...</i>

00:22:31.285 --> 00:22:33.054 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>a part of my life.</i>
