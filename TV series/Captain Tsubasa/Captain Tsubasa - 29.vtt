00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:43.711 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ah, this can't be!

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
Always keep your eyes
on the ball, Kenichi!

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:48.181 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ishizaki, we need to
run back and defend fast.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.316 position:27% line:89% align:start
Aw, at this rate,

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:51.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't be able to
see him score.

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:52.152 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tsubasa!

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.855 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let Ishizaki defend
by himself.

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:54.989 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's the only thing
he's good for.

00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:56.089 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, I heard that.

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:57.825 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can come and defend
if you'd like.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.126 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.394 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] They're playing
differently now.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.361 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.865 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa used to play
as the forward before.

00:01:03.898 --> 00:01:05.265 position:38% line:83% align:start
But now,
he's the centre-midfield

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
that keeps the team
together.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.635 position:21% line:89% align:start
So he's a midfielder?

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:10.572 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wow, you can tell you know
nothing about soccer, Kumi.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:12.040 position:13% line:83% align:start
Okay, just stop hitting me,
Yukari.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.140 position:21% line:83% align:start
-It hurts, you know?
-[laugh]

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.610 position:19% line:83% align:start
The midfielder position
is a key role.

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:18.613 position:21% line:83% align:start
His position is to be
in the center of the field.

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:20.982 position:16% line:83% align:start
He has the responsibility
of giving instructions

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:21.883 position:21% line:89% align:start
to the other players,

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:22.650 position:10% line:89% align:start
pace the rhythm of the game,

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:23.585 position:35% line:83% align:start
-as well as
-Teppei,

00:01:23.618 --> 00:01:24.919 position:21% line:83% align:start
-create opportunities
-you need to cover

00:01:24.953 --> 00:01:26.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
-for the forwards.
-the left wing with Ryo.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.387 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's a player
who's on the defensive

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.523 position:16% line:83% align:start
-as well as the offense.
-[grunts]

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:30.825 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a difficult position,
but not for him.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.394 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can do it, Tsubasa!
I believe in you! Score!

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.830 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Yukari]
You can do it, Tsubasa!

00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:37.431 position:27% line:83% align:start
I believe in you!
Score!

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:40.902 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:42.302 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scream]

00:01:42.804 --> 00:01:43.805 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did you see that?

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:44.539 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.610 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nankatsu improved quite
a bit, don't you think?

00:01:48.643 --> 00:01:49.510 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but we'll represent

00:01:49.544 --> 00:01:51.144 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Shizuoka prefecture
this year.

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:52.245 position:24% line:89% align:start
You got that right.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:53.380 position:35% line:83% align:start
This time,
we're more than ready

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.481 position:38% line:83% align:start
to defeat
Nankatsu Middle School

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:56.517 position:13% line:83% align:start
in the prefecture's finals,
you guys.

00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:59.554 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have a secret weapon
in store waiting for them.

00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:01.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, what do you think,
Nitta?

00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:04.491 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, I think that...

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.894 position:24% line:83% align:start
we're going to win
by a two goal margin.

00:02:06.928 --> 00:02:10.098 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't you forget that after
all of you left Nankatsu,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
I carried our team
into victory.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.135 position:24% line:83% align:start
And today won't be
any different.

00:03:56.971 --> 00:03:58.338 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hello, Tsubasa.

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.074 position:10% line:83% align:start
You've had tremendous growth
since the last championship.

00:04:00.108 --> 00:04:01.241 position:33% line:89% align:start
Thank you for

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:02.577 position:21% line:83% align:start
-the kind words, sir.
-It looks like he's

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.112 position:13% line:83% align:start
-How do you feel nowadays?
-gotten even more popular.

00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:05.213 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Training hard?
-The media's been

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.413 position:16% line:89% align:start
all over Tsubasa lately.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.015 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's true all right.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.483 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even more so now,
since he went to

00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:11.586 position:10% line:83% align:start
that intensive training camp
in the spring.

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, I think he's always
one step ahead of us,

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.090 position:16% line:83% align:start
-no matter what happens.
-It's too true.

00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:17.792 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, what're you guys
talking about?

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:18.659 position:21% line:89% align:start
Last time I checked,

00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:21.195 position:19% line:83% align:start
soccer is an 11 player
sport, isn't it?

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.429 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're all important.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.966 position:38% line:83% align:start
[laughs]
I'm just glad you're not

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:26.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
the same bratty girl
from three years ago, Sanae.

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:27.902 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kenichi]
That's true.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:29.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
She used to be the head
of the cheer squad

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:30.905 position:10% line:89% align:start
and she was very aggressive.

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:33.207 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Hajime] Who would've known
she would get more girly?

00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:35.209 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Manabu] To be honest,
she surprised all of us.

00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:36.878 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's like she's
a different person now.

00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:38.146 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sanae was aggressive?

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:39.479 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's incredible.

00:04:39.514 --> 00:04:41.849 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't picture her
acting that way now.

00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:42.784 position:30% line:83% align:start
-People mature.
-Huh?

00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:44.085 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's very normal.

00:04:44.118 --> 00:04:46.120 position:27% line:83% align:start
They say love can
make people change

00:04:46.154 --> 00:04:47.155 position:30% line:89% align:start
for the better.

00:04:47.188 --> 00:04:48.790 position:44% line:83% align:start
What?
No, don't tell me that she--

00:04:48.823 --> 00:04:51.659 position:13% line:83% align:start
[gasp] Hey, could you stop
talking about me already?

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:52.960 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[chuckle]
-That must mean that

00:04:52.994 --> 00:04:53.961 position:10% line:89% align:start
you're in love with someone.

00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:56.130 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who wouldn't be after
watching Tsubasa play

00:04:56.164 --> 00:04:57.565 position:30% line:89% align:start
so handsomely?

00:04:57.598 --> 00:05:00.034 position:13% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] You sure show him
a lot of love.

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:02.036 position:10% line:83% align:start
Some of us are more handsome
than he is, you know.

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.171 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[laughs] Please, Ishizaki,
-[growl]

00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:04.437 position:19% line:83% align:start
-stop kidding yourself.
-What?

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.207 position:21% line:83% align:start
Someone would have to
be blind to cheer for you.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.175 position:33% line:89% align:start
I dare you to

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:08.142 position:16% line:83% align:start
-say that again. It's not
-[growl]

00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:09.243 position:16% line:83% align:start
like you're Ms. Universe.
-[growl]

00:05:09.277 --> 00:05:11.012 position:19% line:83% align:start
-No one even likes you.

Next semester,
the elimination phase

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:16.617 position:16% line:83% align:start
for the summer tournament
will start.

00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:18.820 position:19% line:83% align:start
Would you like to speak
a bit on the subject?

00:05:18.853 --> 00:05:20.221 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah.
For this year,

00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:21.589 position:27% line:83% align:start
I plan on winning
the national tournament

00:05:21.622 --> 00:05:23.524 position:33% line:83% align:start
for the third
consecutive year.

00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:24.892 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're the rival to beat,

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:26.527 position:19% line:83% align:start
and we know that teams
from other regions

00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:28.196 position:27% line:83% align:start
are training hard
to try and defeat you

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.462 position:27% line:89% align:start
this time around.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.833 position:24% line:83% align:start
You'll have to face
Hyuga from Toho Academy,

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:32.600 position:27% line:89% align:start
as well as Sawada

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:34.202 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the goalkeeper
Wakashimazu.

00:05:34.235 --> 00:05:35.736 position:21% line:83% align:start
And we know they have
their sights set on

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.370 position:24% line:83% align:start
stealing the title

who's lead by
Hikaru Matsuyama,

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:42.210 position:27% line:83% align:start
trains very hard
under severe conditions

00:05:42.243 --> 00:05:43.678 position:16% line:89% align:start
to become even stronger.

00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:45.913 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Tachibana twins
from Hanawa Middle School

and Jun Misugi from Musashi
are top scorers

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:52.687 position:13% line:83% align:start
that you'll surely have to
face again in the field.

head to head against them.

Tell me, is Tsubasa
improving his Portuguese?

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:24.779 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've heard him practicing
day and night,

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:26.180 position:24% line:83% align:start
so there's no doubt
in my mind

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:27.515 position:13% line:89% align:start
he must be improving a lot.

00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:30.117 position:19% line:83% align:start

Aren't you worried that

00:07:35.823 --> 00:07:37.892 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa will be all alone
in Brazil?

00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:40.127 position:13% line:83% align:start
He wouldn't have his family

Don't you worry.

[Mamoru]
According to the bracket,

00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:16.731 position:24% line:83% align:start
we'll have to play
up until the second round.

00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:18.632 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no need to worry,
you guys.

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:20.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
None of the teams
in our prefecture

00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:21.902 position:21% line:83% align:start
have a chance against

00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:25.506 position:19% line:83% align:start
until the second round
as well.

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:26.607 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.043 position:19% line:83% align:start

That's nothing
to sweat about, but...

00:08:39.253 --> 00:08:41.088 position:16% line:83% align:start
if you're really worried
then...

00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:43.724 position:10% line:83% align:start
we can play a practice match
against them beforehand.

00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:44.959 position:33% line:83% align:start
Remember that
this means that...

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:47.228 position:24% line:83% align:start
we'd only see them
until the finals.

Huh?

00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:49.263 position:16% line:89% align:start
They'll avoid playing us.

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:50.197 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't think
they want us knowing

00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:51.399 position:13% line:89% align:start
how strong they really are.

00:08:51.432 --> 00:08:52.566 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:58.672 position:27% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter
who we're up against.

00:08:58.706 --> 00:08:59.807 position:19% line:89% align:start
We have to concentrate

They're so much faster
than three years ago.

00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:31.732 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can someone tell me
who those guys are?

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:32.867 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can't believe it.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.270 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's Urabe, Takeshi,
Nishio and Nakayama.

00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:37.471 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, um, Coach,

00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:39.373 position:30% line:83% align:start
shouldn't we be
stopping them?

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:40.641 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:43.177 position:38% line:83% align:start

[Mamoru] No, they stole
the ball from Tsubasa.

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:48.916 position:35% line:89% align:start
Impossible.

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:50.585 position:27% line:83% align:start
When in the world
did they become

00:10:50.619 --> 00:10:52.653 position:16% line:83% align:start
-so much faster than him?
-Nitta!

00:10:52.686 --> 00:10:54.455 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's mine.

 <i>He's really fast.</i>

00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:58.627 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:18.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're not the same guys

We're looking at the team

00:11:22.483 --> 00:11:24.318 position:27% line:83% align:start
who'll represent
the prefecture.

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.886 position:21% line:89% align:start
Otomo middle school.

[growls]

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa, don't worry
about what happened today.

00:11:33.294 --> 00:11:34.361 position:24% line:89% align:start
Because after all,

00:11:34.395 --> 00:11:36.063 position:27% line:83% align:start
they did learned
a lot from you

00:11:36.096 --> 00:11:38.533 position:21% line:83% align:start
when we were part of
the same team.

00:11:38.567 --> 00:11:39.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:40.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, they learned fast,

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.368 position:16% line:83% align:start
because they've improved
their game quite a bit.

00:11:41.402 --> 00:11:42.403 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Either way,
- <i>Yeah,</i>

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:43.804 position:21% line:83% align:start
-we're the champions.

00:11:50.512 --> 00:11:54.114 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>When I tried stopping it,</i>
 <i>the force was so strong,</i>

00:11:54.148 --> 00:11:56.685 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>that my leg fell numb</i>
 <i>from the impact.</i>

00:11:56.717 --> 00:11:59.220 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>That player's name</i>
 <i>is Shun Nitta.</i>

 <i>Where could he have</i>

 <i>He's really strong.</i>

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:08.329 position:13% line:83% align:start

 <i>with Captain Tsubasa.</i>

00:12:11.666 --> 00:12:13.100 position:41% line:83% align:start
[narr]
 <i>And we're back.</i>

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:16.036 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Shiroyama]
Shun Nitta...

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.238 position:30% line:83% align:start
I remember him
being known as

00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:20.841 position:24% line:83% align:start
the savior of team
once you left, Tsubasa.

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:22.142 position:27% line:89% align:start
He's the savior?

00:12:22.176 --> 00:12:23.043 position:38% line:89% align:start
Exactly.

00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:25.112 position:19% line:83% align:start
He could run 100 meters
in 11 seconds

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:27.248 position:30% line:83% align:start
and he has very
agile movements.

00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:30.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's a player with
incredible talent.

00:12:30.117 --> 00:12:31.852 position:13% line:89% align:start
His famous "Falcon Shot"...

00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:33.187 position:16% line:89% align:start
is his special technique.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.624 position:16% line:83% align:start
It makes the ball take on
a life of its own.

00:12:35.657 --> 00:12:37.692 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm referring to the spin
he gives the ball.

00:12:37.726 --> 00:12:39.960 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it was surprising.

00:12:39.994 --> 00:12:41.161 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nitta has always shown

00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:42.731 position:21% line:83% align:start
demonstrated passion
for soccer.

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:44.098 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks to Nitta,

00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:46.500 position:13% line:83% align:start
the team won the elementary
school national tournament

00:12:46.534 --> 00:12:48.002 position:30% line:83% align:start
even when they
didn't have you.

00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:50.337 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's so talented
he overcame Takeshi Sawada

00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:51.539 position:19% line:89% align:start
from Meiwa by himself,

00:12:51.573 --> 00:12:53.974 position:21% line:83% align:start
proving his abilities
in the field.

00:12:54.008 --> 00:12:55.042 position:33% line:83% align:start
To be honest,
I don't think

00:12:55.075 --> 00:12:56.645 position:41% line:83% align:start
winning
the elimination phase

00:12:56.678 --> 00:12:58.613 position:10% line:83% align:start
will be that easy this year,
Tsubasa.

00:12:58.647 --> 00:12:59.380 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:00.147 position:44% line:83% align:start
[boy]
Excuse me,

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.982 position:19% line:83% align:start
-are you Tsubasa Ozora?
-Huh?

00:13:02.016 --> 00:13:04.218 position:30% line:83% align:start
Can we stay and
watch you practice?

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:06.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
Our dream is to be
excellent players

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.088 position:19% line:83% align:start
just like you someday,
Tsubasa.

00:13:08.122 --> 00:13:10.725 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course,
it'll be my pleasure.

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:12.192 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Hanji]
Say it with me, Otomo.

00:13:12.226 --> 00:13:12.893 position:44% line:83% align:start
-One!
-Two!

-One!
-Two!

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:17.498 position:33% line:83% align:start
Look, Urabe,
look who we have.

00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:18.600 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:20.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
Here it goes!

00:13:20.134 --> 00:13:21.135 position:24% line:83% align:start
-That was amazing.
-Yeah! All right!

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:22.336 position:35% line:89% align:start
Incredible!

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:23.304 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can you teach me

00:13:23.337 --> 00:13:23.871 position:33% line:83% align:start
-to do that?
-Tsubasa!

00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:24.905 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:26.206 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hello, Urabe.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
I hope you're not thinking
we'll be wasting our time

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:31.412 position:19% line:83% align:start
having a practice match
with the likes of you punks.

00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:32.514 position:19% line:89% align:start
What you saw yesterday

00:13:32.547 --> 00:13:35.149 position:16% line:83% align:start
was just a taste of what
the real game will be like.

00:13:35.182 --> 00:13:36.785 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll destroy you
in the field!

00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:37.619 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-[Hanji] You'd better

00:13:37.652 --> 00:13:38.720 position:24% line:89% align:start
be ready, Tsubasa.

00:13:38.753 --> 00:13:40.087 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm saying it,
because this time,

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.388 position:27% line:83% align:start
we'll defeat you
and your team full of

00:13:41.422 --> 00:13:44.191 position:21% line:83% align:start
untalented, mediocre,
attention seeking wannabes.

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:45.326 position:30% line:89% align:start
Stop it, Urabe.

00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:46.695 position:16% line:89% align:start
Watch your language, kid.

00:13:46.728 --> 00:13:48.362 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's get out of here,
you guys.

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:49.396 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:51.932 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:54.636 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Shun]
Finally, a worthy opponent.

00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:56.036 position:24% line:83% align:start
Make sure to get to
the finals

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.906 position:13% line:83% align:start
so we can face each other,
Tsubasa Ozora.

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:02.209 position:24% line:89% align:start
You know, Tsubasa,

00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:04.746 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've seen Nitta visit
this field every single day,

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:06.113 position:19% line:83% align:start
for the past two years,
young man.

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:07.181 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:09.651 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Shiroyama] The distance
between Otomo and Nankatsu

00:14:09.684 --> 00:14:11.118 position:27% line:89% align:start
is only 18 miles.

00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:12.620 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's a young man
who possesses

00:14:12.654 --> 00:14:14.556 position:19% line:89% align:start
enormous determination.

00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:16.023 position:35% line:83% align:start
Team Otomo
doesn't attack much,

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:17.991 position:27% line:83% align:start
but their defense
is very good.

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:20.795 position:24% line:83% align:start
However, this year
will be a lot different.

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:22.597 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now they have Nitta
to attack,

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.331 position:33% line:83% align:start
so they have
perfect balance.

00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:26.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
He was the missing
puzzle piece.

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:28.035 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now their team is complete.

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:57.197 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>We have to keep on training.</i>

00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:01.034 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>Leave our pride behind,</i>
 <i>and surpass ourselves.</i>

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:03.705 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>I have to improve</i>
 <i>all of my skills.</i>

00:15:03.738 --> 00:15:05.305 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>Or I'll flat line.</i>

00:15:06.407 --> 00:15:07.408 position:41% line:89% align:start
 <i>Here!</i>

00:15:10.512 --> 00:15:13.013 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:14.649 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Here, you're all sweaty.
-Oh.

00:15:14.682 --> 00:15:15.517 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you so much.

00:15:16.183 --> 00:15:18.118 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sure, no need to thank me.

00:15:18.152 --> 00:15:20.287 position:13% line:89% align:start
You just keep working hard.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.054 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:15:21.823 --> 00:15:23.190 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Yeah, I'll do that!

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:24.291 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:28.797 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now we'll play five
against four Nankatsu.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.564 position:41% line:89% align:start
[pants]

00:15:29.597 --> 00:15:30.732 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, um, Tsubasa,

00:15:30.765 --> 00:15:32.032 position:33% line:83% align:start
why don't we
take a break first?

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:34.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, at least let us drink
a little bit of water.

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:36.538 position:30% line:83% align:start
Didn't you hear
my instruction?

00:15:36.571 --> 00:15:38.038 position:27% line:89% align:start
We'll keep going.

00:15:38.071 --> 00:15:40.107 position:21% line:83% align:start
The elimination phase
is about to begin,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.375 position:30% line:83% align:start
and if we don't
train hard enough,

00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:44.111 position:24% line:83% align:start
we won't even last
three matches out there.

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:47.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everybody heard me.
We have to keep on training.

00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:49.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but be more
understanding.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.051 position:33% line:83% align:start
The new guys
are still adjusting

00:15:51.084 --> 00:15:52.186 position:13% line:89% align:start
to the rhythm of practice.

00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:54.221 position:24% line:83% align:start
Five against four.
Do as I tell you.

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:55.956 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, Tsubasa,
calm down already.

00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:57.792 position:19% line:89% align:start
Both of you, calm down.

00:15:57.826 --> 00:15:58.927 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.027 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but coach--

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.696 position:16% line:89% align:start
Take a five minute break.

00:16:01.729 --> 00:16:02.897 position:13% line:89% align:start
Then the third year players

00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:05.032 position:27% line:83% align:start
will play against
the second and first years.

00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:07.869 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa, you'll play with
the first and second years.

00:16:07.902 --> 00:16:08.870 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:16:08.903 --> 00:16:10.370 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Furuoya]
Get prepared, kid.

00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:11.371 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:16:12.507 --> 00:16:14.975 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think that training
for so long under this heat

00:16:15.008 --> 00:16:16.043 position:30% line:89% align:start
drove him crazy

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:17.177 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Mamoru]
Exactly.

00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:18.947 position:16% line:83% align:start
Doesn't he see that we're
giving it our all

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:20.080 position:27% line:89% align:start
even in training?

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:21.916 position:30% line:83% align:start
You guys are in
your comfort zone.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:22.750 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:16:22.784 --> 00:16:24.051 position:13% line:89% align:start
What're you talking about?

00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:25.219 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's very simple.

00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:27.722 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your attitude's changed
quite a bit, guys.

00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:29.089 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:30.057 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Listen up, guys, this match
-Everybody's determination

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.158 position:30% line:83% align:start
-won't be easy.
-slowly faded

00:16:31.191 --> 00:16:32.159 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're a good bunch,
-since the second

00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:33.628 position:30% line:83% align:start
-we know that.
-championship win.

00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:35.229 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Tsubasa, here!
-Huh?

00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:39.032 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
Listen up,

00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:40.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
-don't get nervous.
-[Ryo] She thinks

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:41.368 position:30% line:83% align:start
-We can do it!
-we're getting too cocky?

00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:42.269 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:43.872 position:30% line:83% align:start
Then how about
we show Tsubasa

00:16:43.905 --> 00:16:45.940 position:30% line:83% align:start
we can beat him
and the new guys together.

00:16:45.974 --> 00:16:46.708 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:16:46.741 --> 00:16:47.909 position:38% line:89% align:start
[whistle]

00:16:47.942 --> 00:16:49.109 position:27% line:89% align:start
Try and catch me.

00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:51.211 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Don't let him get through.
-Yeah.

00:16:51.245 --> 00:16:51.846 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yell]

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.548 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, how cute.

00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:56.016 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:57.184 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:58.418 position:24% line:83% align:start
Izawa, don't lower
your guard

00:16:58.452 --> 00:17:01.421 position:13% line:83% align:start
when you are in possession
of the ball.

00:17:01.455 --> 00:17:02.389 position:44% line:89% align:start
Here!

00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:03.658 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh... Yeah.

00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:04.526 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh...

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:06.426 position:41% line:83% align:start
[grunt]
I got it.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.494 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's yours, Taki!

00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:10.899 position:19% line:83% align:start
Good, you know the wing
is all mine.

00:17:10.932 --> 00:17:12.299 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Taki!
-Oh, what the--?

00:17:12.332 --> 00:17:13.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't think you'll
always get away

00:17:13.635 --> 00:17:14.702 position:21% line:89% align:start
with the same trick.

00:17:14.736 --> 00:17:16.069 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Whoa!
-If you don't rely on

00:17:16.103 --> 00:17:17.672 position:27% line:83% align:start
other techniques,
they'll take the ball away.

00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:18.405 position:38% line:89% align:start
Taki, no!

00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:20.440 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kisugi, don't get
distracted.

00:17:20.474 --> 00:17:21.809 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:21.843 --> 00:17:23.611 position:27% line:83% align:start
You let yourself
be covered easily.

00:17:23.645 --> 00:17:24.712 position:13% line:89% align:start
If you're waiting for Taki

00:17:24.746 --> 00:17:26.079 position:35% line:83% align:start
to give you
a crossover pass,

00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:27.749 position:21% line:83% align:start
you have to be moving
all the time.

00:17:27.782 --> 00:17:28.616 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now what will you do?

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.517 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa...

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.720 position:38% line:83% align:start
Come on!
We'll go on the offensive.

00:17:32.754 --> 00:17:33.453 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Yes, Captain!
-Yes, Captain!

00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:35.623 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Let's go, Takasugi.
-Uh-huh.

00:17:35.657 --> 00:17:36.624 position:41% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:17:36.658 --> 00:17:38.125 position:41% line:83% align:start
[growl]
Take this.

00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:39.493 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:17:39.527 --> 00:17:41.996 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is that all Nankatsu's
defense has really got?

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.163 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yelling]

00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:44.431 position:21% line:89% align:start
It was a two on one.

00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:45.465 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.236 position:41% line:89% align:start
[groan]

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:51.573 position:21% line:83% align:start
Morisaki, Wakabayashi
would've been able to

00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:53.841 position:30% line:83% align:start
stop that kick
with a single hand.

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:55.375 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:56.476 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:57.477 --> 00:17:58.713 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa!

00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:00.380 position:41% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:01.749 position:41% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:18:01.783 --> 00:18:03.483 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hmm...
-Hmm...

00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:08.188 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right, you asked for it.

00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:09.156 position:16% line:89% align:start
If that's what you want,

00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:10.892 position:27% line:83% align:start
we'll get serious
on you, Tsubasa.

00:18:10.925 --> 00:18:12.125 position:13% line:89% align:start
We won't play nice anymore.

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:14.294 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll steal the ball
no matter what.

00:18:14.328 --> 00:18:15.863 position:16% line:89% align:start
You won't get through me.

00:18:15.897 --> 00:18:16.831 position:33% line:89% align:start
My friends...

00:18:16.864 --> 00:18:18.066 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:20.602 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh, I have no idea
what's going on right now.

00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:21.368 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's train some more,

00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:22.637 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Nankatsu.
-Yeah, let's do it!

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:23.605 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:25.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
Prodding their pride
can be useful sometimes.

00:18:25.807 --> 00:18:26.874 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's right, Coach.

00:18:26.908 --> 00:18:29.276 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now everybody's gotten back
the hunger and passion

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:31.111 position:33% line:83% align:start
they once had
in their eyes.

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:33.480 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>Wow, I'm beginning</i>
 <i>to understand...</i>

00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:36.584 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>Now I know why Sanae</i>
 <i>likes him so much.</i>

[screams]

00:18:46.527 --> 00:18:48.195 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you all right,
you guys?

00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:50.832 position:19% line:83% align:start
With a body like that,
you're built like a wall.

00:18:50.865 --> 00:18:51.933 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:18:51.966 --> 00:18:54.102 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Nitta,
your friend is amazing.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:55.135 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know he is.

00:18:55.168 --> 00:18:57.170 position:35% line:83% align:start
Ichijo was
the main goalkeeper

00:18:57.204 --> 00:19:00.108 position:21% line:83% align:start
during the time I was
playing for Nankatsu.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.274 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now I understand.

00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:02.409 position:10% line:89% align:start
With Nitta in the offensive,

00:19:02.442 --> 00:19:03.811 position:35% line:83% align:start
and Ichijo
as our goalkeeper,

00:19:03.845 --> 00:19:05.780 position:19% line:83% align:start
-we'll definitely win.
-[chuckles] Thank you.

00:19:05.813 --> 00:19:06.648 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is awesome.

00:19:06.681 --> 00:19:08.750 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now Team Otomo
has two secret weapons

under their sleeves.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.553 position:21% line:83% align:start
This year, we're sure
to beat Nankatsu's team.

[narr] <i>And so,</i>

00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:23.931 position:19% line:89% align:start
Here we are once again.

00:19:23.965 --> 00:19:25.165 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.901 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:29.871 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's Wakabayashi.

"Nankatsu's ex goalkeeper."

00:19:47.722 --> 00:19:50.858 position:16% line:83% align:start
Our captain wrote to us,
and he wishing us good luck.

00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:54.929 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[Katagiri] Tsubasa.
-Huh?

00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:56.229 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mr. Katagiri.

00:19:56.263 --> 00:19:57.799 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's been quite a while.

00:19:57.832 --> 00:19:59.199 position:19% line:89% align:start
The last time I saw you

00:19:59.232 --> 00:20:00.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
was in the national
championship.

00:20:02.503 --> 00:20:04.972 position:19% line:83% align:start
I sent a lot of videos
of your gameplay

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:06.974 position:24% line:83% align:start
to various schools
in Brazil.

00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:08.241 position:16% line:89% align:start
And just like we thought,

00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:10.645 position:27% line:83% align:start
many of them are
interested in you.

00:20:10.678 --> 00:20:12.446 position:24% line:83% align:start
So then that means
I'll be able to go to Brazil

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:14.148 position:24% line:83% align:start
as soon as I'm done
with high school?

00:20:14.182 --> 00:20:15.116 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's it, kiddo.

00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:17.018 position:21% line:89% align:start
But for the moment...

00:20:17.051 --> 00:20:19.087 position:27% line:83% align:start
just concentrate
on the tournament.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.755 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll be focusing
on Brazil later.

00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:21.789 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:20:21.823 --> 00:20:25.093 position:16% line:83% align:start
First, you have to become
a full fledged legend,

00:20:25.126 --> 00:20:27.494 position:27% line:83% align:start
here in our very
own country.

00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:29.731 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know you can do it,
Tsubasa.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you're to win
the championship

00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:34.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
for the third time
in a row...

00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:37.304 position:19% line:83% align:start
you'll technically have
four in total,

00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:41.008 position:16% line:83% align:start
counting the time before
your high school years.

00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:43.144 position:24% line:83% align:start
Once you're able to
accomplish this,

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:46.114 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll be at the top
of the pyramid.

00:20:46.147 --> 00:20:48.950 position:24% line:83% align:start
Only then will you
get to go to Brazil.

00:20:48.983 --> 00:20:52.120 position:27% line:83% align:start
And when you do,
soccer in Japan...

00:20:52.153 --> 00:20:54.488 position:19% line:89% align:start
will change completely.

00:20:54.522 --> 00:20:56.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa, you must become
the leader

00:20:56.456 --> 00:20:59.459 position:21% line:83% align:start
that'll change soccer
in our beloved country.

00:20:59.493 --> 00:20:59.961 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:04.632 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm going to get my third
consecutive championship.

00:21:04.665 --> 00:21:07.635 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't let anyone
take our title.

00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:08.669 position:38% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.304 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:45.006 position:13% line:83% align:start
-to take that banner home.
-Huh?

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:47.241 position:38% line:83% align:start
[chuckle]
You're dreaming, Urabe.

00:21:47.275 --> 00:21:48.676 position:33% line:83% align:start
That banner's
already ours.

00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:50.477 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
you can ever defeat us.

00:21:50.511 --> 00:21:52.445 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ha! Then how about
we make a bet

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:54.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
that the team who loses
has to do anything

There's no way you could
possibly win.

00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:03.224 position:16% line:83% align:start
This time, I'll make sure
you shred all of you

that again, you idiot.
