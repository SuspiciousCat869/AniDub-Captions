his opponent is,

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:41.615 position:24% line:83% align:start
the more his desire

[Mitsuru]
Look, he sounds interesting.

00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:16.416 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's the captain of
Team Nankatsu,

the current champions.

are training to defeat
Tsubasa Ozora.

but to stay here, do I?

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.949 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want to face off
against him.

00:20:47.982 --> 00:20:48.950 position:30% line:89% align:start
