Are you Kojiro Hyuga?

 <i>Acrobatic Soccer.</i>

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
You want to recruit me
for the Toho Academy?

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.193 position:33% line:83% align:start
As you know,
Toho Academy is famous.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:14.494 position:16% line:89% align:start
It shapes and represents

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.464 position:13% line:83% align:start
the strongest professional
players in our country.

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:20.134 position:30% line:83% align:start
And we are very
interested in you.

00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:21.803 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Listen, Kojiro,

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:25.006 position:16% line:83% align:start
your game and personality
are both very interesting.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.808 position:24% line:83% align:start
And let me tell you
that we are aware

00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:27.809 position:13% line:89% align:start
of your current situation.

00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:32.146 position:10% line:83% align:start
Kojiro, if you manage to get
into the Toho Academy,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.949 position:16% line:83% align:start
all your family expenses
will be covered.

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:37.752 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think this could change
the life of your siblings

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:40.154 position:19% line:83% align:start
and you could focus on
your career completely.

00:03:40.188 --> 00:03:42.023 position:13% line:89% align:start
School and living expenses?

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:43.256 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, exactly.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.559 position:13% line:89% align:start
If you enter to our school,

00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:47.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
you would only need to
focus on your soccer career.

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:48.462 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:52.299 position:27% line:83% align:start
But before that,
we have one condition.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.267 position:30% line:83% align:start
-One condition?
-Yes.

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.137 position:13% line:83% align:start
And know that our intention
from the beginning

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.405 position:30% line:83% align:start
was to observe
you and Tsubasa.

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.908 position:19% line:83% align:start
You both are candidates
under consideration.

00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:01.676 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.343 position:24% line:83% align:start
We really came here
to recruit

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:06.180 position:21% line:83% align:start
whoever won the match
that you just finished.

00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:09.183 position:16% line:83% align:start
And it was Meiwa who won
that incredible match.

00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:11.219 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, we really don't
want our decision

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.121 position:24% line:83% align:start
to be determined by
that unique game

00:04:13.154 --> 00:04:14.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
since we haven't
made up our minds

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:17.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
about who would be
the best choice.

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:18.793 position:21% line:89% align:start
How can you say that?

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:20.260 position:19% line:89% align:start
Our team won the game!

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.029 position:35% line:83% align:start
That means
I'm better than him.

00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:23.664 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm the best player
of them all!

00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:25.967 position:16% line:83% align:start
You will be when you win
the national tournament.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.135 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:27.168 --> 00:04:29.036 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you really are
the number one player

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.204 position:27% line:89% align:start
you claim to be,

00:04:30.238 --> 00:04:32.140 position:24% line:83% align:start
then you must prove
your worth on the field.

00:04:32.173 --> 00:04:33.373 position:10% line:89% align:start
Win the national tournament,

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
and then, you will be
part of the Toho Academy.

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:38.913 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll play with our team
and you'll become a star.

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:40.248 position:16% line:89% align:start
This isn't a joke, is it?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.449 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, I would never joke
about this.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:45.119 position:13% line:83% align:start
In that case, I'm going to
win the national tournament!

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:46.521 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:54.195 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kaori] You must be
one of the two best teams

00:04:54.228 --> 00:04:56.097 position:33% line:83% align:start
in your block
in order to qualify.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.265 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Don't forget it.
-Huh?

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.431 position:30% line:89% align:start
And who knows?

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.068 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe you'll have to
face Tsubasa once again.

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:42.069 position:30% line:83% align:start
The Hanawa team
sure is strong.

00:06:42.103 --> 00:06:43.337 position:27% line:89% align:start
They're amazing.

00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:45.172 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wanna face them,
Roberto!

00:06:45.206 --> 00:06:46.607 position:24% line:89% align:start
I just can't wait!

00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.110 position:41% line:83% align:start
I know!
Remember that the target...

00:06:49.143 --> 00:06:50.278 position:35% line:89% align:start
is to win!

00:06:50.311 --> 00:06:53.413 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will, and I will go to
Brazil with you!

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.116 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[cheers]
-[Tsubasa] Yeah!

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:23.711 position:44% line:83% align:start

-[whistle]

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:24.578 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:24.612 --> 00:07:26.213 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-We did it!

00:07:27.315 --> 00:07:28.616 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tsubasa]
It's a tie.

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:29.951 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Masao] That means if we
don't win the match

00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:32.420 position:10% line:83% align:start
against the Hanawa tomorrow,
we won't make it

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.722 position:21% line:83% align:start
and our team will be
out of the competition.

00:07:36.057 --> 00:07:37.058 position:38% line:89% align:start
[snicker]

00:07:40.227 --> 00:07:41.929 position:19% line:89% align:start
The next match we play

00:07:41.963 --> 00:07:44.298 position:24% line:83% align:start
determines the fate
of our team.

00:07:44.332 --> 00:07:45.633 position:19% line:89% align:start
According to the table,

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:48.035 position:27% line:83% align:start
we won't make it
if we just tie the game.

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.638 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why the objective
in tomorrow's match

00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:52.606 position:16% line:89% align:start
is to defeat Team Hanawa.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.408 position:24% line:83% align:start
Listen, I want you
to remember

00:07:54.442 --> 00:07:56.544 position:24% line:83% align:start
their match against
the Shimabara.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.413 position:19% line:83% align:start
Their strongest weapon
is the forwards,

00:07:59.447 --> 00:08:01.082 position:21% line:89% align:start
the Tachibana twins.

00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:01.983 position:13% line:89% align:start
Their perfect coordination

00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:04.285 position:35% line:83% align:start
makes them
a very difficult adversary.

00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:05.619 position:27% line:83% align:start
Their confidence
is such that

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:07.088 position:30% line:83% align:start
they only play
at the offense,

00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:10.291 position:10% line:83% align:start
while the rest of their team
only defend their area.

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:12.727 position:27% line:83% align:start
So they depend on
those two to score.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.728 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:15.696 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even so, the Shimabara
couldn't do anything.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.232 position:10% line:83% align:start
And that's the reason why we
need to come up with a plan

00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:19.767 position:19% line:89% align:start
to stop those brothers.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.869 position:27% line:83% align:start
The tournament is
on the line.

00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:23.971 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why this will
be our strategy.

00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:24.739 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tsubasa.

00:08:24.772 --> 00:08:25.439 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir.

00:08:25.473 --> 00:08:26.007 position:41% line:89% align:start
Misaki.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.974 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir.

00:08:27.008 --> 00:08:29.977 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have a very special
mission for you two.

00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:30.978 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:08:35.016 --> 00:08:37.485 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's a lot of
responsibility.

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:37.952 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:40.688 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I guess that's
the best we can do

00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:43.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
if we want to beat
those brothers.

00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:45.426 position:33% line:83% align:start
So tomorrow,
I'm counting on you, Taro.

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:46.894 position:21% line:89% align:start
The same goes to you.

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:48.829 position:24% line:83% align:start
They won't take us
by surprise.

00:08:48.863 --> 00:08:50.231 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scream]

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:51.365 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.867 position:27% line:83% align:start
We surprised you,
didn't we?

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.335 position:30% line:83% align:start
You must always
be on alert!

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:55.236 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:56.203 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:08:56.237 --> 00:08:57.438 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:58.739 position:33% line:89% align:start
Pillow fight?

00:08:58.773 --> 00:09:00.007 position:38% line:89% align:start
It's on!

00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:00.574 position:35% line:89% align:start
Take that!

00:09:00.608 --> 00:09:02.209 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:09:02.243 --> 00:09:02.977 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.245 position:27% line:89% align:start
Aw, my poor head!

00:09:04.278 --> 00:09:05.212 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hajime]
What's wrong with you?

00:09:05.246 --> 00:09:06.814 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Taro]
Aw, Koji. I'm sorry!

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:07.048 position:44% line:89% align:start
Goal!

00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:09.817 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah! That goal was from
our captain, Koji!

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.919 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yeah? Well,
here's my counterattack!

00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:12.720 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yell]

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:15.022 position:38% line:83% align:start
[chuckle]
Did you see that, Koji?

00:09:15.056 --> 00:09:16.657 position:30% line:83% align:start
They'll say I'm
the super goalkeeper!

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.492 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah?
Let's tell that to Genzo

00:09:18.527 --> 00:09:20.261 position:21% line:83% align:start
and see what he says
about it!

00:09:20.294 --> 00:09:22.329 position:19% line:89% align:start
And now, it's my turn!

00:09:22.363 --> 00:09:23.431 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:09:23.464 --> 00:09:26.033 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:27.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
I just stopped it!

00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:28.169 position:35% line:89% align:start
Take this!

00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:29.538 position:38% line:89% align:start
My turn!

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.005 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you'll see!

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:32.206 position:35% line:89% align:start
Watch out!

00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:34.108 position:38% line:83% align:start
My turn!
I'm gonna get you!

00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:35.676 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, guys, hear me out.

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:37.244 position:21% line:89% align:start
We will win tomorrow!

00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:38.813 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:39.914 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:41.115 position:41% line:89% align:start
Great!

00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:43.250 position:38% line:83% align:start
Let's go!
Yeah!

00:09:45.319 --> 00:09:47.021 position:19% line:89% align:start
In these past two days,

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:50.091 position:19% line:83% align:start
we were able to observe
all our candidates, correct?

00:09:50.124 --> 00:09:52.893 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, with the exception of
Team Nankatsu's goalkeeper,

00:09:52.927 --> 00:09:55.429 position:19% line:83% align:start
who unfortunately won't
be playing this time.

00:09:55.463 --> 00:09:56.697 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's a shame.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
He was the captain
of Team Shutetsu.

00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:00.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
They won the championship

00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:03.003 position:21% line:83% align:start
by not letting anyone
score him any goals.

00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:05.806 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no one that can
be compared to that kid.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.543 position:16% line:83% align:start
But tell me... What about
the keeper from Team Naniwa?

00:10:08.577 --> 00:10:09.977 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kaori]
Nakanishi is good.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.313 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's very agile despite
his constitution.

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:14.849 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a shame. Without
Genzo Wakabayashi here,

00:10:14.882 --> 00:10:16.750 position:19% line:83% align:start
we can't be sure about
who is better.

00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:18.953 position:30% line:83% align:start
And what about
the midfielders, my lady?

00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:20.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
So far, the ones
I'm considering

00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:22.656 position:16% line:89% align:start
are Misaki from Nankatsu,

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.859 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hikaru Matsuyama
from Team Furano,

00:10:24.892 --> 00:10:27.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
and Takeshi Sawada
from Team Meiwa.

00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:29.330 position:16% line:89% align:start
But he's in fourth grade.

00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:31.098 position:13% line:89% align:start
We can discard him for now.

00:10:31.132 --> 00:10:34.335 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm more interested
in Misaki and Matsuyama.

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:36.170 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hikaru Matsuyama.

00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:39.039 position:10% line:83% align:start
But don't you think that kid
is lacking technique?

00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:40.474 position:33% line:83% align:start
The fact that
he was able to bring

00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:42.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
his public school
to the nationals

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.712 position:30% line:83% align:start
speaks more of
character, strength,

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:47.915 position:13% line:83% align:start
and his skills as a leader
than any technical exam.

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:51.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
We can teach technique,
but not talent.

00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:52.554 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:53.988 position:19% line:89% align:start
Of all the midfielders,

00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:56.757 position:16% line:83% align:start
the best without question
is Jun Misugi

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.025 position:24% line:89% align:start
from Team Musashi.

00:10:58.058 --> 00:11:00.828 position:35% line:83% align:start
That kid is
a real prodigy in soccer.

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:03.097 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's an incomparable leader.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.064 position:38% line:89% align:start
Correct.

00:11:04.098 --> 00:11:05.766 position:38% line:83% align:start
In fact,
the trainer is looking for

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:08.202 position:27% line:83% align:start
someone proactive
and with great judgment

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:09.203 position:13% line:89% align:start
to make the team stronger.

00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:12.607 position:30% line:83% align:start
And of course,
for the striker position,

00:11:12.641 --> 00:11:15.309 position:21% line:83% align:start
we have Tsubasa Ozora
from Nankatsu,

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.546 position:27% line:83% align:start
