gonna to take a break

[sighs] These last

00:07:43.531 --> 00:07:44.832 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've been thinking
that maybe

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:47.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm being selfish

That selfishness may break

Roberto, stop it.

It's not like that.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.978 position:19% line:89% align:start

Genzo!

00:08:01.015 --> 00:08:02.016 position:30% line:89% align:start

-Oh...
-Oh...

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:07.855 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tsubasa, I won't play
in the national tournament.

00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:08.923 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:09.657 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.392 position:19% line:89% align:start
It looks like my injury

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:13.694 position:30% line:83% align:start
is more serious
than I thought.

00:08:13.728 --> 00:08:16.597 position:27% line:83% align:start
I must wait until
it completely heals.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.466 position:10% line:89% align:start
And that's the reason why...

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
I need you to do me a favor.

Even if I'm not there,

00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:23.904 position:27% line:83% align:start

all the matches

00:08:23.938 --> 00:08:24.972 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the tournament.

00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:27.475 position:21% line:83% align:start
Until you get to play
against Kojiro Hyuga.

00:08:27.508 --> 00:08:28.676 position:27% line:89% align:start
All the matches?

00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:31.512 position:30% line:83% align:start
I let him score
a goal that day.

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:33.948 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I failed you
as a keeper and a captain.

00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:37.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sure I must have
my leg healed by then...

00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:38.686 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm begging you...

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:40.087 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please wait for me.

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:42.556 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it...

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.725 position:13% line:89% align:start

Run!

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:53.100 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it!

00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:54.869 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, one more!

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:56.604 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:58.439 position:19% line:89% align:start
Put more energy in it!

00:08:58.472 --> 00:09:00.141 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you can't stand
this heat,

00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:02.676 position:19% line:83% align:start
then you better forget
about winning the nationals!

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.811 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:05.713 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Mizuno]
It looks like the absence

00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:07.681 position:21% line:89% align:start
of Genzo Wakabayashi

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:09.950 position:30% line:83% align:start
is the cause of
their unusual behavior.

00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:12.586 position:38% line:83% align:start
-I know.
-It is to be expected.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.955 position:27% line:83% align:start
We have some kids
from the Shutetsu,

00:09:14.989 --> 00:09:17.758 position:33% line:83% align:start
without him,
they must be feeling down.

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:20.628 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's true. Genzo is not only
the goal keeper,

00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:24.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
he's the captain that
keeps everyone focused.

00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:25.666 position:13% line:89% align:start
His absence is very strong

00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:27.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
and not having him for
the next matches...

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:30.704 position:24% line:83% align:start
is really affecting
his teammates' spirits.

00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:32.673 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Shiroyama] The only one
that looks to be unaffected

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:34.208 position:19% line:83% align:start
The only one that looks
to be unaffected is Tsubasa.

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:35.409 position:30% line:89% align:start
Heads up, Taro!

00:09:35.443 --> 00:09:36.710 position:35% line:89% align:start
A one-two!

00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:38.145 position:35% line:83% align:start

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:39.780 position:27% line:89% align:start

so you're the only one

-that we've got!

Miss Ozora...

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:07.542 position:35% line:83% align:start
If your son
goes with me to Brazil,

00:10:07.576 --> 00:10:08.642 position:21% line:89% align:start
won't you be lonely?

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.712 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
Why are you so worried?

00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:14.014 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please, ma'am.
I need to know.

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:17.651 position:30% line:89% align:start
The truth is...

00:10:17.685 --> 00:10:18.686 position:27% line:83% align:start
I would be lying
if I say that

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:20.555 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't get lonely
sometimes.

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:22.056 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Mrs. Ozora] But just like
I told my husband,

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:23.724 position:21% line:83% align:start
we parents can't keep
our children

00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:25.626 position:16% line:83% align:start
from making their dreams
come true.

00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:28.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
But ma'am, Tsubasa
is only in elementary!

00:10:28.563 --> 00:10:29.598 position:38% line:89% align:start
I know...

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.800 position:16% line:83% align:start
but my son is very mature
for his age.

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:34.034 position:21% line:83% align:start
And his biggest dream
in the world

00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:36.670 position:13% line:83% align:start
is to become a professional
soccer player.

00:10:36.704 --> 00:10:39.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
That has been his dream
since forever.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.643 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that's why when you
invited him to Brazil,

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:44.211 position:21% line:89% align:start
he was really happy.

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:46.113 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Mrs. Ozora]
I'm his mom.

00:10:46.147 --> 00:10:48.215 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want him to make
his dreams come true

00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:49.750 position:16% line:89% align:start
without any distractions,

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:52.920 position:21% line:83% align:start
and when he does it,
I'll be very happy.

00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:57.424 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Shiroyama] Well done!
Good job, you guys!

00:10:57.458 --> 00:11:00.761 position:13% line:83% align:start
In three days, our trip to
Tokyo will finally arrive,

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:01.962 position:24% line:89% align:start
but before that...

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:05.600 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll just name the new
captain of the team.

00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:06.734 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-A new captain?

00:11:06.767 --> 00:11:08.102 position:27% line:89% align:start
What about Genzo?

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:09.136 position:30% line:89% align:start
Unfortunately,

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.906 position:16% line:83% align:start
he won't be able to play
because of his injury.

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:14.775 position:13% line:83% align:start
And that's why I've decided
to name someone else

00:11:14.808 --> 00:11:15.943 position:24% line:89% align:start
to take his place.

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:17.011 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:19.747 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know it will be difficult
without his support,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.750 position:13% line:83% align:start
but that doesn't mean that
we can't win without him.

00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:24.251 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Shiroyama]
We're still a strong team.

00:11:25.486 --> 00:11:27.656 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right, listen up,
you guys!

00:11:27.688 --> 00:11:28.889 position:35% line:83% align:start

00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:37.698 position:33% line:83% align:start
