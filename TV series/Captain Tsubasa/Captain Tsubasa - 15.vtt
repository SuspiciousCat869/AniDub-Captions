00:19:00.575 --> 00:19:01.274 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't sweat it.

It doesn't matter

You played your best.

Oh!
Yeah, that's true.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.555 position:30% line:83% align:start
Because in the
elimination phase,

00:19:14.589 --> 00:19:17.424 position:16% line:83% align:start
two teams from each group
can make it out.

we will still be in

What's important now is to
win all the next matches.

00:19:34.075 --> 00:19:35.375 position:19% line:89% align:start
If we win our matches,

We can still win.
