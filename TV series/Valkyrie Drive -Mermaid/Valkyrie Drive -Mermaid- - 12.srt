Just as we long suspected.

330
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,500
The absorbed virus transformed
into a new lifeform altogether--

331
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,333
Evolution's miracle.

332
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,541
[A]
That is what happens when

333
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,458
the reaction from a Valkyrie
Effect goes over 100%.

334
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,916
Oh, Mirei...

335
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,375
Mamori...

336
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,416
I'm finally...

337
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,791
For the first time, I'm excited
to have these super powers.

338
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,083
I can use them to help
people everywhere.

339
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,875
And make the world better.

340
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,333
You're right.

341
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,958
[MAMORI]
So...

342
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,583
--...let's shine!
--[MIREI] Let's shine!

343
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:42,791
So, you're Island Five's
Watcher, Torino Kazami, right?

344
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,083
I'm going to need a
full report from you.

345
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,541
I understand.

346
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,625
One more thing-- Some names
on this list of exiles...

347
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,958
They're not among any
of the returnees.

348
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,916
Don't worry about them.

349
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,458
They're out there.

350
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,750
Finding a better use for what
they learned on the island.

351
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:06,125
Mamori, are you sure
you wanna do this?

352
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,958
Over going home?

353
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,541
Believe me, I do still
dream of going home,

354
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,791
of seeing my mom and dad
and old friends again.

355
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,291
But...

356
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,166
There are so many
people around the world

357
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,333
that I want to use our powers
to help before I go back.

358
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,000
We can remove the Armed Virus
from anyone who carries it

359
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,000
and give them their lives again.

360
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,500
If we can prevent just one girl

361
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:29,916
from having to go through
what we did, we owe it to her.

362
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,958
So, yeah. I'm sure
I wanna do this.

363
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,291
Whatever you want, it's fine.

364
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,958
But what I still don't get is
why Meifeng's coming with us.

365
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,416
I wanna see what
Super Mamori does next!

366
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,291
And to be blunt-- [giggles]

367
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,541
It sounds like there's
money to be made.

368
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,583
That'll be a lot of work--
Just you two, saving the world.

369
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,416
So we're here to help.

370
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,750
Helping because you
want to, right?

371
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,208
That's free will, baby!

372
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,458
Great!

373
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:58,708
We're all here!

374
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,083
Let's go.

375
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,666
[MAMORI] Our happy ending...
has just begun.
