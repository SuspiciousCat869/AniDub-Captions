00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,541
No.

95
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,750
[KASUMI]
Hmm...

00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,666
Then I'll try
explaining it as best I can.

97
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,625
This is an artificial
island called "Mermaid."

98
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,875
You, me--all of us--have
been brought here

99
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,708
because we're infected
with the Armed Virus.

[MAMORI]
I've never heard of that.

101
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,333
It has no known cure,
but it grants the infected

102
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,958
a special power.

103
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,041
[ANGE] Miss Charlotte,
that new Liberator transfer?

104
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,000

105

[CHARLOTTE]
Thank you, Ange. Good work.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,958
That girl not only knew
she had powers,

107
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,083
she knew how to use them
right off the bat.

108
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,541
Could she be the
long-rumored, "soldier?"

109
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,291
There's no proof the
soldier's real, let alone her.

110
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,833
[CHARLOTTE giggles] Soldier or
not, she's still a new transfer,

111
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,083
and new transfers
need to be broken.

112

Our girl may have been
special back home...

113

she is just one of many.

from the beach?

115

any special powers.

00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,541
I didn't want my first kiss
to be with a girl!

124
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,208
I couldn't keep her
from doing stuff to me

125
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,541
with her hands, either.
I'm sorry! I'm weak!

00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,750
[KASUMI] You're not
in trouble for any of that.

Just keep watching the film.

128
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:33,041
Miss Tokonome,
this is your power.

129
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,625
You're able to transform your
body into a weapon

130
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,291
that we call an "Arm."

131
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,708
And we call you girls with this
transforming power, "Extars."

132
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,250
In turn, the girls who
use you Extars,

133
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,833
or as we say, DRIVE you,
are called, "Liberators."

134
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,416
Every single girl you
will meet on this island

135
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
falls into one of
those categories.

136
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,208
They're either
Liberators or Extars.

137
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,583
You must have somehow
changed that footage.

138
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:01,541
Girls can't do that.
Please, tell me this is a joke.

139
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,458
I know it can be a lot
to swallow, but it's all true.

140
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,916
I wouldn't lie to you.

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,291
[MAMORI] Yeah, it's-it's just
a lot to take in all at once.

I was in the arena with.

147

Getting rescued from certain
