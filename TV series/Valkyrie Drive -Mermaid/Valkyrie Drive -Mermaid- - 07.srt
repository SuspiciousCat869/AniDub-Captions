[KUSUMI yells]

321
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:48,875
You good?

322
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah...

323
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,458
I feel great!

324
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,333
Heh!

325
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,375

--[AKIRA gasps]
--[KUSUMI] Don't move!

331
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,916
I don't think I've
ever met you before.

332
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,208
Are you a Warter secret weapon?

333
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,083
You caught us off-guard.

334
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,666
But luckily, I had the
Warter paralysis spray on me.

335
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,666
[AKIRA]
So this was all a set up.

336
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,666
That's right. The "hostage"
was the mastermind.

337
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,416
[gasps] Why do this?

338
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,875
Because I'm sick of living
my life in that dumb castle!

339
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,625
No matter how civilized we act,

340
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,958
we're never getting
off this island

341
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,791
like our fearless leader,
the Gouverneur, claims.

342
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,208
That's why I teamed up with a
few of the resident bad girls

343
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,166
to put a big plan into motion.

344
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,416
A reform movement to
make over the entire Veste

345
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,958
into something that
offers real fun and hope.

346
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,750
But this isn't reform,
this is terrorism. You fool!

347
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,083
[MIIDERA]
As long as we get what we want,

348
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,000
you can call it
whatever you like.

349
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,625
[KUSUMI] What should we
do with her friends?

350
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,791
[MIIDERA] Tie 'em up and
throw 'em on the floor.

351
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,375
Make sure this one doesn't get
close to her Liberator, though.

352
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,916
We don't want her
hands to wander.

353
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,458
Next thing you know,
they'll be Driving indoors.

354
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,916
[MIIDERA sighs] All that time
pretending to be a hostage

355
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,250
really cramped me up.

356
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,708
[KUSUMI] Hey! Don't stand
there, they can see you!

357
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,041
[MIIDERA]
I'm fine.

358
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,666
Besides, if Charlotte
does storm the place,

359
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,541
we'll just escape
down the emergency exit

360
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,333
our guests gave us.

361

Hey, uh, Miss Heelhold?

362
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,500
Do you remember what
happened to me yesterday

363
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,166
when I first saw you at the
beach when you were in the nude?

[AKIRA gasps]

365
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,416
I can't.

00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
[MAMORI]
Because of you, I have hope.

Huh?

368
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,041
So use me.

00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,208
Now's my chance to help you.

370
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,166
Are you sure?

371
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,333
Yes.

That gas she got sprayed
with paralyzed her.

as fast as you can.

I was kidding about
wanting money to go in.

394

All they had to do was
ask, and I'd have gone!

But no, they're all
like, "Later, Meifeng!"

The hostage situation is over.

But they had to take Mirei

to the castle for
medical treatment.
