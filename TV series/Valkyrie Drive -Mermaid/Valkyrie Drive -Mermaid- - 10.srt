Shut up!

323
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,625
[screams]

324
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,208
Kasumi! Don't do this.

325
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,833
And Mirei... You need to
stop using your powers, too.

326
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,875
It's crazy--us fighting.

327
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,208
We're supposed to
all help each other!

328
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,458
Seems your motivation's
paying off.

329
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,041
Pay close attention to
their battle, Hibiki.

330
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,541
The Kommandeur's
fighting on behalf

331
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,625
of your continued well-being.

332
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,958
On behalf... of me?

333
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,125
[MIREI]
Too late!

334
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,125
[MIREI groans]

335
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,583
[KASUMI]
I'm sorry, Mirei.

336
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:37,083
But Hibiki will
always come... first!

337
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,333
[KASUMI gasps]

338
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,833
Hibiki...

339
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,875
C'mon, Kasumi, finish her.

340
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,125
You won't get a better
chance than this one!

341
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,041
Do it, Kommandeur!

342
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,166
[ANGE]
Yeah or you're disobeying

343
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,083
a direct order
from your superior!

344
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,458
You better beat her
right now, Kommandeur.

345
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,916
For Miss Charlotte...

346
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,041
Better yet, for the new
Gouverneur of Mermaid island!

347
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,083
[yelps]

348
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,916
[MAMORI]
Hold on!

349
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,958
[KASUMI gasps]

350
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,208
[ANGE]
Oh no, you don't!

351
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,166
[MAMORI gasps]

352
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,916
Wow! Nice catch, Kasumi!

353
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,166
What are you doing?!

354
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,375
[MAMORI screams]

355
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,333
[ANGE screams]

356
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,291
[MARIANNE, MONROE]
Ange!

357
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,875
In that case...

358
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,083
Screw Kasumi.

359
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,208
We'll crush you ourselves!

360
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:44,750
[ANGE screams]

361
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:03,250
So, the girl with the Valkyrie
Effect... is my old friend.

362
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,750
[MAMORI groans]

363
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,041
Mamori... Hold on.

364
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,083
What the hell was that?

365
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,708
[MIREI]
You!

366
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,500
[MIREI]
"Soldier Arm."
