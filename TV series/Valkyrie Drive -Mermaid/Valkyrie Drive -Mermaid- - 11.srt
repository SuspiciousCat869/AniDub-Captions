00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,291
[MOMOKA sighs]
It's a real shame.

I could've made a
day of killing her,

you're doing with that girl.

00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,083
As Gouverneur of the Warter,

00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,500
I demand that you
explain your intentions--

If you ever wanna make
it off this island,

then shut your mouth
and do as you're told.

00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,500
I don't understand.

172
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,541
I thought I was...

Aw, you forgot the shut your
mouth part already! [giggles]

[MEIFENG sighs]

I made so much cash from
that match the other day.

176
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,916
I was gonna take a bath in it!

And now I'm even poorer
than I was before!

You poor thing.

We owe you one, truly.

[MEIFENG] Yeah, well,

00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,125
I think you know.

00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,125
They took Mamori.

I'm gonna track them down

But in that condition,
what can you--

I'm coming, Mamori.

Stop, A3. She isn't a fighter.

Please just leave her be.

She hasn't done anything

Her Valkyrie Effect

198
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,500
It just went over 70 somehow!

Yup, this girl is the real
deal! I finally found her!

210
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,833
Tell me, do you have any
idea what will happen

211
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,541
to the Armed Virus if the
reaction size hits 100?

212
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,791
Do you have any idea what this
hot little mutant's capable of?

213
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,041
Uh-- Yeah... No.

214
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,916
This has never been documented,
but theoretically the virus

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,041
should begin to
distribute unevenly.

216
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,750
This could cause a total
reversal of its symptoms.

217
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,458
So wait, A3, does this
mean what I think it does?

218
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,250
What it means is that
there's no need for me

to give this treasure up
to the organization.

You'll be deployed

Before that happens,
a word of advice.

226
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,750
This is an organization
that values results.

Fail to provide them,

and we will fail to have
reason to provide for you.

We do not carry dead weight.

Instead, I'll put you
into a near-death state.

It's the only way
to get you out.

I can't explain how, but I plan
to send you somewhere safe.

I've made arrangements
for you to start over.

Leave C7 behind.

begin to atone for my sins.

I beg you, go and
do what I cannot.

It doesn't matter what she did.

she must be quarantined.

without even telling
me about it first?

My name's Momoka Sagara.

We have lots in common.

Once, I was Mirei's
partner, too.

thing that ever happened to me.

You mean that
Mirei got you hurt?

00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,875
That's right.

296
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,833
Rather than let the
organization dispose of me,

297
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,333
I "volunteered" to take on their

newest experimental
enhancements.

299
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,833
They toyed with my body.

300
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,291
Cut into me again and again.

301
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,500
And turned me into a monster.

302

So do you understand why I feel
a little salty towards her now?

303
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,000
Ever since her, my
life has been about

304
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,250
having things taken
from me, one by one.

305
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,166

I'm gonna need to
use your power, kay?

There's no need to be afraid.

I've got a vested interest in
making this feel good for you.

the stronger a weapon you'll be.

You've got a stronger

But the human mind and body...

[MOMOKA] No matter how
noble your intentions may be,

and you can always
drown in pleasure.

No, I can't!
