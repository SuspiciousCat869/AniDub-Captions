But most of the girls'
power potential is pretty weak,

162
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,708
so they're told to just
fall in line and do

163
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,916
what the Warter say
for their own protection.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,250
And no one complains
about that fate?

165
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,083
All of Mermaid Island's
lifelines are

166
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,875
under Warter control.

167
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,041
Like the factories in

and medical supplies.

[MEIFENG]
As long as you obey Warter,

170
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,458
they'll make sure you
have the food, shelter,

171
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,291
and clothes you need
for a safe life.

172
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,333
And no girl's gonna complain
about getting free stuff.

00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,958
[MIREI] I take it you stole
these goods from the Warter?

Bingo!

scary-powerful they are?

Aren't you worried
they'll come after you?

Don't worry about me,
I'll be fine.

notice, let alone trace to me.

informed immediately,

the first time it transpired?

It wasn't an incident big enough

to warrant your attention.

257
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,500
Because the amount
stolen was so small,

258
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,583
I thought that making a fuss
over it might cause us

259
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,958
to take our minds off far more
pressing concerns,

260

and in turn, cause
even more of a mess.

We shouldn't be too harsh.

that we're capable of
maintaining law and order.
