00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,666
[AKIRA] The chip I provided
you with held the coordinates

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,291
of the initial
facility from which

3
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,833
the rest of Mermaid
Island was built.

4
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,208
Were you able to
find anything?

5
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,541
[RAIN]
Almost everything of interest

6
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,833
had been cleared out in advance.

7
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,083
However...

8
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,166
We did encounter an Arm
we'd never seen before.

9
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,541
That thing possessed powers
far different from our own.

10
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,791
Could it have been...
an Artificial Arm?

11
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,500
What's an Artificial Arm?

12
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,041
They are created by
injecting the Armed Virus

13
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,166
into a clone cell
to form Cyborgs

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,625
with the power of Extars.

15
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,333
It's actually the
same technology

16
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,458
that was used to create my Arm.

17
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,916
According to my mother,
the technology was developed

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,958
in secret by an organization
that trains soldiers.

19
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,083
It almost too
outlandish to believe.

20
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,166
But not after what we've seen.

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,666
[LADY J]
Yes.

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,916
We've seen an Artificial Arm,
and a soldier in action--

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,458
The soldier Mirei Shikishima.

24
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,541
[MAMORI]
Oh, Mirei...

25
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,625
[MAMORI]
I don't get it.

26
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,625
Why did you look like that...?

27
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:44,583
Mirei... What happened to you?

28
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,833
And why didn't you
want me to see it?

29
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,875
Any sign of the transfer?

30
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,208
[MIYASATO]
Not so far.

31
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,125
But she should have landed
somewhere around here.

32
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,333
[KOUZUKI]
Kommandeur, over there!

Huh?

00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,750
[KASUMI]
Are you okay?

35
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,833
[MOMOKA groans]

36
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,375
Yeah, but where am I?

37
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,208
An artificial island
called Mermaid.

38
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,625
[MOMOKA]
Mermaid?

39
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,583
[HEXE A] I heard a rumor
we got a new transfer.

40
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:02,458
Is it true?

41
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,000
[HEXE B]
Yeah, I think so.

42
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,250
[HEXE C] Cool, so when will
they do the awakening battle?

43
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,333
[HEXE D] I heard somebody
say they're gonna skip it.

44
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,875
Apparently, this one's
already been awakened.

45
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,416
That's a drag.

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,708
I was hopin' I'd get
to set up a few bets.

47
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,166
What a wasted opportunity.

48
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,125
Well then, I suppose you
must be the new transfer.

49
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,291
Care to give your name?

50
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,666
[MOMOKA giggles]

51
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,125
Momoka Sagara, at your pleasure!

52
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:33,708
It's... a... joy...
to meet you! Meow!

We enforce the rule
of Veste Castle.

[MOMOKA]
Charlotte's kinda formal.

Uh-- Well, moving on then.

62
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,625
Reports say you're already
in control of your powers,

63
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,458
is that true?

64
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,791
[MOMOKA]
Sure is!

00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,208

When did you awaken?

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,291
Wish I could tell ya.

68
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,750
But I don't remember, sorry.

69
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,375
Say, do you have anything
to drink around here?

70
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,500
I'm feelin' all kinds of
parched, right now.

Refreshment can wait.

I'm afraid our first priority
is finding a Liberator.

One who can match
your abilities.

75

But there's no need
for that with me!

76

there, unconscious.

If it weren't for

Is she okay?

been accepted... into Adel.

And she didn't even have to
do an awakening ceremony.

Miss Kasumi-- the mandate

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,958
Unproductive hands
turn quickly to crime.

163
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,875
So shouldn't we go scold them?

164
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,125
I mean, that's the kind of
thing Adel was made to do, no?

165
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,125
[ANGE] Yes, but we also respect
the will of the Gouverneur.

166
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,333
[MOMOKA]
Goober-ner? What's that?

167
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,291
[MARIANNE] Our Gouverneur is the
wonderful Lord Akira Hiiragi!

168
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,875
The leader of Warter and a
shining symbol of Veste itself!

169
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,125
Lord Hiiragi is a
marvelous, benevolent,

170
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,583
and dashing young man!

171
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,958
Huh. Must be a
fascinating person.

172
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,833
[AKIRA] Please. I'm flattered,
but it's too much.

173
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,583
The Gouverneur?

174
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,166
Oh, Lord Akira!

175
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,958
Very well sighted, Soldier.

176
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,083
You honor me!

177
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,916
A compliment from
our leader himself!

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,250
I take it you must be
Miss Momoka Sagara,

179
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,000
the newest addition to Adel.

180
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,125
I am Gouverneur Akira--

181
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,583
[laughs] Why are you
dressed like that?

182
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,166
You look like a boy!

183
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,125
[gasps]

184
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,666
Seriously, you've gotta tell me,

185
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,833
is that a cosplay
or something, c'mon?

186
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,375
What the heck's your game, girl?

187
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,916
[MARIANNE]
Learn your place, Françoise!

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,250
Be silent, please!

189
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,500
Lord Akira may be beautiful,

190
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,541
but that doesn't make
him a girl in costume!

191
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,375
In fact, he's the only male
on this entire island.

192
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,750
Yeah, fat chance of that.

193
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,625
Come on now, do your homework!

194
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,041
Whatever she might've told you,

195
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,000
the Armed Virus doesn't
infect XY chromosomes.

196
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,583
This island is 100% boy-free.

197
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,125
This Akira person
is definitely a girl.

198
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,791
That's enough from
you, Françoise!

199
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,208
But it's true!

200
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,166
She's still new here,
Gouverneur, please forgive her.

201
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,291
We apologize for this insult.

202
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,375
My goodness, I must be
an effeminate man indeed.

203
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,583
[ANGE]
Not at all.

204
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,625
You are both virile
and handsome, my Lord.

205
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,916
That's kind of you to say, Ange.

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,166
I think I'll... take my leave.

207
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,541
[AKIRA] A new transfer
right after we investigate

208
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,791
the construction facility.

209
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,291
Coincidence? Or retaliation?

210
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,125
[CHARLOTTE giggles]

211
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,625
You think the
Gouverneur is a woman?

212
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,166
No, Françoise, that
couldn't possibly be.

213
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,083
I mean, it's true,
he is effeminate,

214
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,041
but you shouldn't
jump to conclusions.

215
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,458
You say it's impossible,
but how do you know?

216
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,541
Have you seen for yourself?

217
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,791
[CHARLOTTE gasps]

218
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,750
No, because that would
be highly inappropriate.

219
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,958
Ange and Marianne haven't
seen any proof either.

220
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,708
It's almost like no one has.

221
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,291
As if all of this time, it was
nothing but a clever trick.

222
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,125
[CHARLOTTE] Assuming that this
claim of yours could be true.

223
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,208
Why? For what reason
would the Gouverneur

224
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,208
even want to impersonate a man?

225
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,916
Well, that one's pretty obvious.

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,125
She did it so she would stand
out around all these girls.

227
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,375
Once she had their attention,

228
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,916
I bet all it took
to convince them

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,208
she'd make a good leader
was not to screw up.

230
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,000
Kinda sad, really.

231
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,291
The fastest way for a girl
to take charge around here

232
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,875
was by pretending to be a boy.

233
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,791
This is embarrassing, Charlie.

234
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,625
You allowed yourself to be
tricked by a stupid costume.

235
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,916
That may be, but you'd do
well to know your place.

236
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,958
Remember the first time
we drove together?

237
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,500
I could tell you were a very
powerful Liberator instantly.

238
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,458
You're stronger than
that goober-ner girl.

239
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,541
If you took over, this
island could be better

240
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,750
than it ever was under her rule.

241
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,458
What are you saying?

242
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,708
She lied to us. We aren't
the traitors if she lied.

243
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,708
It'd be worse if we let
her get away with it.

244
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,541
But you aren't gonna let her
get away with it... Are you?

245
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,416
[gasps]

246
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,958
No, I won't.

247
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,666
I will go to the Gouverneur
immediately and get the truth.

248
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,250
If he's been lying,
I'll expose him.

249
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,791
"Exposing" her would mean
letting everyone know.

250
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,208
That might be hard
if you talk in private.

251
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:35,708
I know of a way to reveal the
truth for everybody to see.

252
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:46,125
[MIREI groaning]

253
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,541
[MEIFENG] All right, girls,
time to place your bets!

254
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,208
We've got Gouverneur
Akira Hiiragi,

255
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,500
the leader of Warter itself,
versus Charlotte Scharsen,

256
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,041
his second in command
and Kommandeur of Adel.

257
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,000
A match like this hits
once in a lifetime.

258
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,708
A match like this makes history!

259
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,416
If you never bet again,
then bet on this match.

260
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,291
Don't miss this opportunity!

261
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,041
I'll put ten maid on Lord Akira!

262
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,708
That'll be thirty maid for me!

263
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,708
Of course! And the best
of luck to you both.

264
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,291
[MEIFENG]
I'm gonna make a killing!

265
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,041
Gotta admit, Warter
does put on a show.

266
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,250
[KASUMI] I understand you're
going to fight Charlotte.

267
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,791
I-It's not my place
to question sir, but--

268
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,208
[AKIRA] I agreed to her
request for a few reasons.

269
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,791
First, it seemed earnest enough.

270
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,958
But also, I wish to learn about

271
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,541
Miss Momoka Sagara's
Extar abilities.

272
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,500
Furthermore, I want
to show the Hexe

273
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,208
a display of the power
we Warter yield.

274
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,708
I believe this will help tighten
up discipline around here.

275
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,875
In our concern about the
current state of Veste,

276
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,833
Charlotte and I are
of a single mind.

277
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,625
This fight of ours will
serve as a wakeup call.

278
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,125
[KASUMI]
I see, but--

279
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,083
Trust me when I say I have
other considerations as well.

280
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,500
[KASUMI]
May I ask, what kind, sir?

281
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,041
So far, it's nothing concrete.

282
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,541
Pardon me, Charlotte, but do you
really plan to fight Lord Akira?

283
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,875
Why would you wish to
do the Gouverneur harm?

284
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,208
Hush and I'll explain.

285
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,541
I don't suppose I've told
you why I joined Warter

286
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:09,166
in the first place or why
I decided to create Adel?

287
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,708
I sought to maintain order,
and to keep the peace,

288
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,208
to find a way off this island.

289
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,541
It's with the same goals in mind
that I sought this battle.

290
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,000
I am incapable of fully
comprehending the complexity

291
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,916
of your thoughts on this matter.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,583
Regardless, I have great
faith in your leadership.

293
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,625
I shall continue to follow you.

294
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,750
[CHARLOTTE]
That was well said, Ange.

295
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,041
Best of luck, Ma'am.

296
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,458
If this goes as I think
it will, I won't need any.

297
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,750
After all, I've been
blessed by a goddess.

Wow, I can barely
hold in the laughter.

Just as handsome as always!

Gouverneur Akira Hiiragi.

306

Leader of and mind behind
the formation of a government

307
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,375
on this little island.

308
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,541
And on top of that, a
remarkably gifted Liberator.

309
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,291
Partnered with an
obviously outdated,

310
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,458
but nonetheless genuine
artificial Extar.

311
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,708
Whelp! seems like we should
call Akira Hiiragi our target

312
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:34,958
and get this ball rollin'!

313
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,041
[D5]
Don't be a fool!

314
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,208
[D5] Akira Hiiragi is but one
of a number of candidates.

315
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,916
Seek confirmation and
proceed to Phase Two.

316

We can't afford to make
assumptions in this.

[E9] I get what you're
saying, but aren't we

318
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,291
making this mission more
tedious than it has to be?

You find it tedious?

[AKIRA] As you know, Charlotte,
I do not relish violence.

323
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,083
I was inspired to
accept your challenge

324
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,375
not by my own arrogance, but
by the passion of your appeal.

The strength of your resolve
to make an orderly society--

Thank you, Gouverneur Akira.

You've talked enough.

328

I can see that you're
determined to do this,

329
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,583
but I don't understand why.

Let the fight begin
and you'll learn.

331
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,500
Fair enough.

332
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,541
I shall do just that.

It only took him one hit?

Talk about a one-sided match.

This was a foolish idea
you had, Charlotte.

I know you're lying!

You've been keeping
secrets from us, Gouverner!

What are you talking about?

You're only making this
worse by trying to hide it!

Trying to hide what?

[CHARLOTTE] You know
full well, you imposter!

I don't know what the

[AKIRA] For the transfer to
have that kind of strength--

364
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:12,750
This confirms it. She must be...
