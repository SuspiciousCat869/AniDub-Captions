[engine revving]

2
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,125
[AKIRA] Looks like you didn't
find anything useful today.

3
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,208
No!

4
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,000
You found our hiding spot.

5
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,416
Since when were we
trying to hide, Rain?

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,791
Whether you're hiding or not,

7
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,041
you shouldn't underestimate me.

8
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:18,083
See. I could have surprised you
like this whenever I wanted.

9
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:21,208
Could have taken you and thrown
you in the dungeons, but...

10
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,083
What?

11
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,000
[AKIRA] There's a location
mentioned on that drive.

12
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,458
And I want you both
to investigate it.

13
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,375
[LADY J]
Why us?

14
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,791
[AKIRA]
There are two reasons.

15
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,791
For starters, I don't want
to get the other Warter

16
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,833
involved in this yet.

17
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:40,041
Secondly, I believe the
two of you, as "Lady Lady"

18
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,791
possess the perfect set
of skills for this job.

19
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,583
Of course, I refer
to your backgrounds

20
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,291
before you were
brought to this island--

21
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,916
You were special
agents of Nafrece.

22
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,250
You know your stuff, Gouverneur.

23
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,625
[RAIN] I bet you know J's bust
size down to the millimeter.

24
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,250
[LADY J chuckles]

25
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,333
Do you accept this
mission or not?

26
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,625
And what happens if we don't?

27
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,750
[AKIRA] Well then,
you leave me no choice

28
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,333
but to play the
best card I have.

29
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:12,416
Hidden at the spot on
that drive is the secret...

30
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
...of this island, Mermaid.

31
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,375
[MEIFENG humming]

32
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,541
Um, so, guys...
You still haven't told us

33
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,416
exactly what it is
you need our help with.

34
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,541
Where are you even taking us?

35
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,833
Well, for now... Why don't we
just keep it all a surprise?

36
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,458
I know! You're taking
us to a beach party!

37
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,166
[MEIFENG] No way; it's
gotta be more than that.

38
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,125
The Lady Lady duo ain't
using their powers

39
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,375
to be in motorcycle form
and drive themselves.

40
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:31,041
That means they're saving
their energy for something big.

41
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,041
I wonder what danger awaits us.

42

[MAMORI whimpers]

43
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,625

[MAMORI squeals]

47
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,541
[MEIFENG] Or maybe it's more
dangerous than we can imagine.

48
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,208
M-Mirei! Tell her to stop!

49
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,541
Meifeng, stop!

50
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,541
[MEIFENG]
Lighten up, Mamori! I'm kiddin'!

51
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,208
[AKIRA] There is only one
condition for this mission.

52
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,708
The new girl...

53
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,916
It's essential you bring Mirei
Shikishima along with you.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,250
[RAIN]
Why is that?

55
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,625
Because I need to learn
whether something's true.

56
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,708
The military's prevented from
using Armed Virus girls...

57
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,875
But rumors persist
they've trained such girls

58
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,250
in the shadows.

59
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,375
[RAIN] You think Mirei--
quiet, weird Mirei--

60
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,041
is a former soldier?

61
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,833
[MEIFENG sighs]

62
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,833
Miss Rain, are you sure this
is the spot on the drive?

63
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:30,916
Meifeng.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,375
I just double-checked
the coordinates

65
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,458
and we're definitely
in the right spot.

66
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,541
Uh...

67
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,791
Well, over there, to be exact.

68
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,791
Then I guess it's
time we go to work.

69
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,583
All right, J. You ready?

70
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,750
Roger that.

71
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,833
[MEIFENG]
It's just a rock.

72
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,166
Huh?! Hey! Guys!

about this, after all.

[MEIFENG]
Down we go.

86
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,291
This may not be a long
caving trip, girls.

87
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,916
Looks like the path's
gettin' pretty narrow.

88
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,625
So the Gouverneur sent us
on a wild goose chase?

89
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,875
Hold on.

90
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,291
Ow! Hey, what's your
problem, Blondie?!

91

[groans]

92
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,208
That air current means
there's a room over there.

93
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,583
[MIREI]
Right here.

94
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,833
Well, I don't see
any openin'. Sorry.

95
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,916
All I see is a wall of rock!

96

[MEIFENG chuckles]

99
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,500
I called it.

100
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,708
To open a rock wall,

101
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,541
all you gotta do is
sit on a secret lever.

102
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,375
No one's buying that.

[MIREI gasps]

Well, girls, I'd say
this is a bullseye.

105
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,166
Yes.

[MEIFENG]
Hey!

108
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,041
[MAMORI]
What's wrong, Meifeng?

109
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,208
[MEIFENG] They didn't even
thank me for openin' the door!

110
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,375
I'm getting real fed up with
always being overlooked!

111
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:44,041
[clanging]

112
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,208
I thought we were
supposed to be stealthy

113
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,791
while we sneak
around this place.

114
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,833
[MIREI gasps]

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,791
[MAMORI]
Guys, where are we?

116
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,583
[MIREI]
Some kind of factory.

117
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,250
[MAMORI]
Yeah, but what were they making?

118
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,708
[MIREI]
Don't know.

119
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,500
[MEIFENG] I can't believe
there's something so massive

120
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,916
hidden under the island!

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,583
Well, how would we ever know?

122
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:19,333
Of course, the bigger shock
is the Warter not knowing.

123
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,333
That just tells me that
whoever built it,

124
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,958
didn't want it being found.

125
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,916
Which means, "mission
accomplished" for us.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,333
But maybe the thing this factory
is responsible for building

127
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,500
is the very Mermaid
island itself.

128
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,791
That would explain
why it's closed down.

129
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,416
Doesn't look like it's been
operational for years.

130
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,666
Well, we found the
place. What now?

131
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,125
[RAIN]
We keep investigating.

132
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,208
See if there are some old
subsystems still running

133
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:49,458
or documents lying around that
can give us more information.

134
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,708
If we really are walking
through the construction yards

135
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,958
that created Mermaid,
we may be able to uncover

136
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,333
the secrets of the island
and why we're here.

137
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,625
What's more, the
blueprint of the island

138
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,375
may show us how to escape it.

139
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:01,916
[MAMORI gasps]

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,166
[MEIFENG gasps]

141
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,750
[BOTH] We might be able
to escape the island!

142
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,166
Let's split up to
search more ground.

143
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,875
--[MAMORI] All right!
--[MEIFENG] Yeah!

144
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
[MEIFENG]
Big fat nothing.

145
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,458
Whoever was here last,
really cleaned the place out.

146
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,208
Even if we could
reboot the systems,

147
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,250
I doubt they left any
incriminating data

148
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,333
on the hard drives.
