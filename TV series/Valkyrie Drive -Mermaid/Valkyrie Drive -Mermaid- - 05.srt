Gouverneur...

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,500
Miss Charlotte. You were too
quick to decide that Noe

421
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,583
could never activate
Nimi's abilities.

What? I didn't see
any abilities!

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,541
[CHARLOTTE] So, what, you want
me to admit that I was wrong,

425
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,625
is that it, Gouverneur?

426
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,500
[AKIRA] Since there was
a lag in her activation,

427
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,083
your mistake is
somewhat understandable.

428
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,250
But now, having seen
what they're capable of,

429
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,666
I think we can both agree
that Nimi and Noe

430
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,708
are meant to be together.

Don't worry, Mamori.
