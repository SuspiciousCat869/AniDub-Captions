[MOTHER] They found it
during her last physical.

The doctors are calling it...

00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,708
They say it's...

...an abnormality! [sobs]

[FATHER] Does she have
any of the symptoms yet?

[MOTHER sobs]

[MAMORI] They cried and
argued for hours that night,

12

but I was still
too young to understand

why my parents were so upset.

14

[MAMORI] Looking back, I should
have just run up and hugged her

15
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,791
and said, "Don't cry, Mommy!
Everything's gonna be okay!

[MAMORI]
But maybe I held back,

19
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,583
because even as a
little girl... I knew.

20
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:17,916
[MAMORI] Deep down, I knew.
In fact, I've always known.

21
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,125
[MAMORI]
The truth.

22
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,375
[MAMORI]
That I'm not a normal girl.

And, wait--where is here?

Then let's test her.

I have a job for you.

a beach this empty... and hot.

[MAMORI]
What do I do now?

52
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,333
[MAMORI] Maybe I can
cut through the jungle?

53
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,416
No, I can't! There might be
giant bugs hiding there!

54

I'm just a teenage girl
raised in the big city!

So, um, can one of you
tell me where we are?

Or even better, just let me
borrow your phone

to pick me up.

It's what's on your shirt, kid!

It says "Virgin!"

I'm sure some perv out
there will find it hot.

No! That's not true!

73
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,875
It's just a
spelling coincidence.

74
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,875
You see, the Kanji for
my last name looks the same.

To-ko-no-me! That's what
it really spells!

So you're not a virgin?

judge a book by its cover.

been with a boy...

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,916
What...? They beat her...
The rookies won.

330
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,666
They took down Saejima.
I wasn't expecting that.

331
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,833
Could it really be...
that these girls

332
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:20,250
are even stronger
than those of A Class?

Are they soldiers?

334
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,958
With that power... perhaps.

Well, this is starting
to get interesting.

00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,333
But at least...

338

...now I won't be bored.

What... you did...
with your hands...

[MAMORI] Why do you think
I'd be okay with that?

I can't believe she left

00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,500
the house in that.

No! That's not it!
Listen to me, it's my last name!

Tokonome! They look the same!

355
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,000
It doesn't say "virgin." Why
would I wear a shirt like that?!

356
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,125
How many times
do I have to tell you?!
