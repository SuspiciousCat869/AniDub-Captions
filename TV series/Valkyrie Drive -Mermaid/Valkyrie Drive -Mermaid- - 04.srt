As you command, my lord.

163
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,583
Move out!

164
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,625
--We can't just ru--
--[KASUMI] That's enough!

165
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,458
Gouverneur Hiiragi's
orders are absolute.

166
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,500
[CHARLOTTE growls]

167
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,500
Goodness. That was
a close one, wasn't it?

168
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,458
[MIREI grunts]

169
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,416
What has your
panties in a twist?!

170
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,166
You made me kiss you.

171
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,500
That's what.

172
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,708
Truly a fascinating girl.

173
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,333
I like you, Mirei. Think
you'll be seeing more of us.

174
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,916
In fact, I know it.

175
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,000
Lady Lady... They're powerful.
They might be Soldier-class.

176
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,083
Could it be...?
Just when I needed him most,

177
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,125
the charming, gallant prince
I've been waiting for has come.

178
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,750
[MAMORI] It's him...
It has to be, I'm sure of it!

179
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,458
My true prince!

180
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,583
You handled that perfectly.
Thank you, Lord Hiragi.

181
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,250
It was the least I could do
to calm things down.

182
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,583
We had nothing to gain
from escalating that conflict.

183
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,916
Yes. I completely agree, sir.

184
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,625
[CHARLOTTE] The Gouverneur
never even should've known

185
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,291
we'd left the castle!

186
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,250
Who...? Who could've told him?!

187
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,291
I won't let it happen again!

188
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,625
[MEIFENG] Ooh, boy,
am I glad you're all okay!

189
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,625
It really is too bad
that happened...

190
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,333
I wonder what Warter
was looking for.

191
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,083
[RESIDENT A] What do you mean,
"You wonder"?! It was you!

192
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,500
Okay, yeah, I know. I'll do
better next time, honest.

193
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,875
[RESIDENT B]
I thought that Charlotte girl

194
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,625
--was gonna kill us.
--[RESIDENT A] I know, right?

195
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,666
Like I said, I'll do better.

196
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,166
[TORINO] What's all this
about a prince now?

197
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,750
[MAMORI] Oh, um!
The gouverneur, I mean.

198
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,333
You wouldn't
know him, would you?

199
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,833
Well, of course.
He's quite famous, you know.

200
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,791
Ah... Could you tell me
what he's like, please?

201
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,833
Yeah, I guess so.

202
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:29,333
Akira Hiiragi--slightly
over five-foot seven.

203
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,375
My sources tell me
he's blood type A.

204
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,250
As sweet as you are;
I bet you're the same.

205
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,291
So far, it seems like
he's the only boy

206
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,791
who's gotten the Armed Virus.

207
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,333
I don't know if that helped him
become Gouverneur or not.

208
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:44,041
What I bet was helpful is
his great power as a Liberator.

209
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,916
He's a Liberator, really?

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,208
Wait! So Liberators
are the ones who

211
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,375
turn Extars into weapons,
aren't they?

212
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,750
[TORINO]
They sure are!

213
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,208
If he's a Liberator
and I'm an Extar...

214
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,416
...I guess that he
and I could be...

215
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,208
Mr. Hiiragi, please allow me
to become your Arm only,

216
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,375
until death do us part!

217
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,791
Miss Virgin...

218
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,416
It's Tokonome.

219
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,416
Sorry, it's confusing.

220
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,541
I could never use a frail
beauty like you for war.

221
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,875
That would expose you to danger,
and I plan to keep you safe.

222
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,208
For the rest of my life.

223
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,541
[MAMORI]
Oh... Mr. Hiiragi...

224
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,791
[AKIRA]
Miss Virgin.

225
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,583
[MAMORI]
It's Tokonome...

226
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,500
[MAMORI sighs]
So perfect...

227
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,291
I see what's going on here.

228
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,000
You're not the first girl
to fantasize

229
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,458
about becoming
the Gouverneur's arm.

230
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,666
[gasps] No, I mean, he is
really amazing, but...

231
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,458
...I'm not worthy.

232
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,125
But you like him, don't you?

233
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,916
Well, um... Mm. Wait.

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,833
Mr. Hiiragi doesn't have
a girlfriend already, does he?

235
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,375
[TORINO] Nope, and
it'd be chaos if he did.

236
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,625
He's something of
an idol on this island.

237
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,791
[MAMORI]
Huh... Is that so?

238
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,291
[AKIRA] Well, Kommandeur.
How fare our wounded Ritters?

239
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,916
[KASUMI]
None were badly wounded.

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,916
I expect they'll be able
to resume their duties

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,500
within the next few days.

242
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,708
Along with Lady Lady,
Miss Shikishima could have

243
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,125
slain them with ease,
but It would seem

244
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,666
she showed some restraint.

245
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,625
[KASUMI]
Yes, I suspected.

246
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,041
Gouverneur, may I ask you
a question please?

247
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,583
By all means.

248
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,125
With all due respect, my lord,

249
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,958
why allow Lady Lady
to do as they will?

250
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,750
[AKIRA]
There are a number of reasons.

251
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,375
Each of them is
both Liberator and Extar.

252
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,166
Powerful at that.

253
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,833
Warter has the
strength to beat them,

254
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,791
but not without
becoming weakened.

255
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,125
There's no cause
to take that risk.

256
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,708
And besides, I do
harbor some hope for them.

257
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,375
Hope, sir? For what?

258
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:43,458
Well... Rogues they may be,
but their goal is still

259
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,041
to escape this island,
same as ours.

260
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,416
The only real difference is
in how they mean to do it.

261
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,041
How can you be so certain

262
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,916
that we'll get away
with this, Charlotte?

263
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,791
[CHARLOTTE] What is it
you're fretting over?

264
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,666
[ANGE] The Gouverneur ordered
us to withdraw. All of us.

265
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,708
[CHARLOTTE] Come now, Ange,
it's about interpretation.

266
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,791
I tried to get everyone back
to the castle as ordered.

267
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,083
But those armored cars get so
cramped that when

268
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,625
Miranda said
she'd walk, I let her,

269
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,125
and now I guess
she hurt her foot.

270
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,458
I can see her now, dragging
herself through the woods.

271
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,833
That poor darling.

272
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,958
If she does get back, I'll
make all her boo-boos better.

273
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,291
[MIREI gasps]

274
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,375
[MIREI]
What have you done?

275
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,541
[MAMORI giggles]
Meifeng wanted to make up

276
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,791
for all the trouble,
so she got these for me!

277
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,166
That girl really is
a jack-of-all-trades, huh?

278
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,333
[sighs] Now I can imagine
I'm with Mr. Hiiragi

279
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,125
whenever I'm at home!

280
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,541
What a nightmare...

281
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,833
[MAMORI gasps]
Sorry, did you say something?

282
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,541
No, ma'am.
I have nothing to say.

283
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,833
[MAMORI] 'Kay, well I don't know
about you, but I'm exhausted.

284
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,833
Could you get the light for me?

285
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:00,875
[MIREI]
Yes.

286
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,458
Mr. Hiiragi...

287
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,166
[MAMORI sobs]

288
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,083
[MAMORI]
I wanna go home...

289
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:28,416
Daddy... Mommy...
I wanna see you again...

290
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,458
[MIREI sighs]

291
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,666
[TORINO] Hmm... Well, we've
made it through another day,

292
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,041
at least.

293
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,791
[TORINO giggles]

294
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,916
[TORINO] It must be
even harder for Akira.

295
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:52,750
[AKIRA] Miss Virgin.
Hey, there, Miss Virgin.

296
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,375
[MAMORI sighs]
It really is Tokonome...

297
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,875
[AKIRA] Uh, right.
Miss Tokonome, hi.

298
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,833
Hey there. How are you doing?

299
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,916
[AKIRA]
I'm good. Wake up, now.

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,958
[MAMORI]
Hmm...?

301
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,958
[gasps]
My prince! You're here!

302
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,833
[AKIRA] If you would,
Miss Tokonome, follow me.

303
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,208
Uh, yeah, okay.

304
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,666
[MAMORI]
Hey. Where are you going?

305
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,875
Wait for me!

306
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,083
No prince. But where could
he have gone, though?

307
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,791
[AKIRA]
Just over here, Miss Tokonome.

308
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,875
[gasps]

309
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,916
Oh. Hi again.
Lead on, gentle prince.

310
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,958
Wherefore art thou,
handsome prince?

311
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,416
Princes aren't
supposed to tease.

312
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,416
[AKIRA]
Nor would I.

313
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,000
[gasps]

314
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,875
You are Mr. Hiiragi, right?

315
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,458

Shouldn't you be at Veste?

Yes, I certainly should.
It's hard to explain, but---

I've been in agony, ever since
I first laid eyes on you.

I had no choice but to sneak
back here and see you again.

I couldn't stop myself.
I had to come.

You really mean it, don't you?

Oh, I do. My heart's on fire.

it can only mean one thing.

Miss Tokonome. Forgive me.

I've wanted to
touch you so badly.

329
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,875
