It's time to place your bets!

they're coming back.

mission accomplished.

Strange how it doesn't
even occur to them

that we might've set them up.

32

after pullin' off a good scam.

33
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,000
I agree. It has a certain class.

34
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,083
The sweet and tart
are very balanced.

35
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,291
It tastes just sour enough
to be exciting.

36
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,333
Speaking of,
that acting of yours

37
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,125
was pretty intense, Futaba.

38
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,625
Why, thank you.

39
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,250
Yeah, and what
about you, Meifeng?

Ha! You really went
for the Oscar, huh?

42
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,708
Shut up! Look, if you
don't like how I do it,

43
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,000
then next time,
you take the part,

44
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,375
and we'll hit you for real.

45

Simmer down, girls.
Everything worked out perfectly.

46
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,708
What is there to fight about
if we're filthy rich?

47

We do make a good team.

00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,625
It helps that we have
our own personal Ritter.

Know what I mean, Hyouko?

51
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,541
And in castle management,
we have Futaba Kirii.

52
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,666
And to sell all
the goods we steal?

53
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,000
We have Meifeng.

[FUTABA]
Of course.

I adjusted the on-file
inventory last night.

62
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,000
It should be as good as if
these supplies were never here.

63
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,083
I sack the castle.

64

I make sure she
doesn't get caught.

65

stupid look on Charlotte's face

Lady J had beaten her.

like that in ages.

Like, honestly,
what'd she expect?

121
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,083
She spread the word all over
that anyone could join,

122
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,375
no questions asked. So of course
Lady Lady showed up!

123
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,625
She was so mad!

124

Yeah, I'll say.

125
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,958

a fit. The mess was huge.

Kinda makes ya think, though.

If we could help

with the odds this tilted,

129

the three of us could make
a friggin' killing off of it.

130
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,416
No one would know her, so...

131
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,250
...we wouldn't have
to pay out a penny.

132

All we have to do is find some
hot chick no one knows about.

133
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,708
As if it'd be that easy.

if we want--

Yes, I am. Why do you ask?

138
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,083
I was just wondering how
preparations were coming along.

139
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,791
Pick a prize for the pageant?

140
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,875
We have. Same as last year.

141

The victor goes home with
a dozen cans of peaches.

142
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,666
Gotcha. How hard
would it be for you

143
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,250
to change that
to something else?

144
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,541
Well... It kind of
depends on what to.

145
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,166
But, yes, I could probably
pull a few strings.

The Mermaid Festival?

148
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,875
You're still pretty new
to this place,

149
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,125
so I doubt you've heard of it.

150
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,333
But, yeah, it's a pretty
big deal to the locals.

151
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,375
We do food stands, competitions,
all sorts of fun stuff.

152
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,708
It's like a giant party!

153

[gasps]
That's cool!

154
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,291
Is it okay for us
to come, though?

155
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,875
Why else would
I tell you about it?

156
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,375
Look, as long as
the festival's going on,

157
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,750
everyone puts that
political crap aside!

from the town and the castle

159
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,000
can all hang out and unwind!

160
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,333
Anyway, we put on
this Beauty Pageant--

161
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,750
It's like the main event
of the whole party. Check it!

162
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,541
Wow! Is that what I think?

163
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,208
It sure is! I was just as
surprised as you are!

164
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,916
But yeah, I remember you sayin'
you like this cat thing,

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,375
so when I saw that it was our
prize, I had to show you!

166
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,875
[sighs]

167
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,541
[MAMORI]
So cute!

168
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,291
Thanks, but,
I don't have a chance

169
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,833
of winning a beauty pageant.

170
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,416
The only thing that stands out
about me is how small I am.

171
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,875
You shouldn't
underestimate yourself.

172
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,375
Aw, thanks, Mirei.

173
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,375
[groans] Well... Maybe you
don't have to win it yourself.

174
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,291
I don't know if you're friends
with any bombshells,

175
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,875
but if you are, then
maybe you could ask her

176
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,291
to win the pageant for you.

177
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,333
Okay, but what exactly does
a bombshell look like?

178
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,583
Oh, you know.

179
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,041
Someone with long legs,
luscious blonde hair.

180
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,000
And let's see,
a voluptuous body with curves

181
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,791
in all the right places.

182
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,791
Ohh, and if she acted
a little bit boyish,

183
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,333
at a competition with only
girls, it'd be perfect!

184
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,458
[MEIFENG] Oh yeah, if you
could find someone like that,

185
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,708
you'd have your
cat toy in the bag!

186
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,208
But if such a beautiful
person existed,

187
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,000
do you really think
she'd be willing to enter

188
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,500
the pageant for me?

189
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,250
Oh, well, who's to say? Depends
on how much they like ya.

190
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,500
[MAMORI giggles]

191
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,125
[MEIFENG] It's time for beauty
pageant training to commence!

192
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,666
Prepare to be beautified!

193
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,875
[MAMORI]
Woo-hoo!

194
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,250
All right, we'll start
with your posture!

195
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,000
This oughtta flatten out
that belly of yours!

196
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:33,041
[MIREI grunting]

197
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,416
[MEIFENG] Next, I want you
to raise those hips!

198
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,000
[MIREI grunting]

199
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,458
We're gonna train
those breasts to stand tall!

200
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,541
[MIREI grunts]

[MIREI, MAMORI grunting]

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,291
Now that we've
got you trained up,

205
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,916
all we need's a
smokin' hot outfit!

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,166
What do you think
about this idea?

207
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,791
I cooked up a little
somethin' myself!

208
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,750
I was thinking something
more professional.

209
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,541
I say we go bolder!
Check this one out!

210
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,333
Hey! That just gave me
another idea!

211
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,875
Considering our model,
perhaps we should go

212
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,125
for something a little
more adult, like this!

213
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,333
I feel like that's
a little too bold.

214
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,166
[gasps]
Here's an idea!

215
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,541
What if we dressed her
up in something

216
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,333
like Mr. Hiiragi might wear?

217
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,333
[GROUP sighs]

218
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,333
Oh. Well, no worries
if you don't want to.

[yawns]

220
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,625
Guess we should probably
call it a night soon, huh?

221
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,958
[gasps] No, let's
try to keep going.

222
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,375
Mirei's been training really
hard to win this pageant,

223
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,791
so I need to work
just as hard to help her.

224
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,000
After all, she's only
doing this for me.

225
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,500
Ah. All right, just a
little bit longer, then.

226
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,333
[CHARLOTTE]
I assume that preparations

227
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,708
for the festival are
going well so far?

228
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,166
Yes, ma'am. We've no
issues to report.

229
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,166
[CHARLOTTE] No? Well,
isn't that good to hear?

230
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,416
Oh, by the way.

231
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,416
I think I may join
the beauty pageant again.

232
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I was wondering how you
feel that might go for me.

233
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,458
Oh! You'd surely win!

234
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,333
I agree! The girls
of Mermaid Island

235
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,375
are eager to see
your beauty on stage!

236
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,333
I have no doubt that the contest
would be a rout in your favor!

237
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,125
[CHARLOTTE laughs]
If that's really true,

238
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,208
I suppose I have no choice
but to toss my hat in.

239
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,958
I trust that you won't allow
any incidents at this pageant.

240
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,541
We wouldn't want a repeat of
last year, now, would we?

241
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,291
No, I don't believe that
would bode well for anyone.

helping out me and Noe!
