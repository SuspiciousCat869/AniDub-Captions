1
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:03,469
I really like you.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,005
(Gunshot)

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:06,507
Huh?

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,474
(Anzai pained gasp)

5
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,210
(Gunshot)

6
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,780
(Gasp)

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,148
Uh!

8
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,017
Ah!

9
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,587
(Heavy breathing)

10
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,123
(Growly scream)

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,193
(Strangled gasp)

12
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,965
(Sobbing)

13
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,000
[ANZAI]
I really like you.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,270
[TSUKASA]
No... Anzai, wait!

15
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,142
[SAWAZAKI]
Hey! What's wrong? Anzai!

16
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,744
We need to get going.
[YANAGI] Hm.

17
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:46,613
Jill, you're
staying here.
[JILL] What!? Why?

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,981
(Grunt)

19
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,916
It's your kind that are
the sick murderers here!

20
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,317
(Gunshot)

21
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,420
My mother...
she is dead because of you!

22
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,791
(Anzai growls)
If you devils never existed,
she'd still be alive!

23
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,792
(Gunshot)

24
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,793
[ANZAI]
Damnit!

25
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,327
(Gunshot)

26
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,197
(Anzai coughing blood)

27
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,334
[HANS]
You're weaker than
I thought you'd be.

28
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,537
[HANS]
Are you just a human?

29
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:14,508
[HANS]
Whoa! I think she
blew out your lung.

30
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,610
[HANS]
If you don't do something
quick, you're gonna die.

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,379
[HANS]
You've lost a lot of blood,
and we gotta fix that lung.

32
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,281
I guess I can give you this.

33
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,183
Organ restoration...

34
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,653
what's that like... 200ccs?

35
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,723
[HANS]
Nothing works better than
human blood, after all.

36
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:31,892
[ANZAI]
No...!

37
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,093
(Grunting)

38
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,630
I don't want... that shit!

39
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:45,305
(Strained breathing)

40
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:53,814
[ANZAI]
What is this? Where am I?

41
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,518
It looks...familiar.

42
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,219
(Startled)

43
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,690
[ZERO SEVEN]
Who are you?! You a friend
of that piece of shit?

44
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,393
[HANS]
Not really. I'm just here
as a passing life‐saver.

45
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:09,462
Shared a bit of
human blood is all.

46
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,198
Human blood?
So you're a devil too!

47
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,667
(Gunshot)

48
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,702
Oh, don't get any shady ideas.
I bought this.

49
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,604
It was for sale
by owner, you see.

50
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,840
You expect me to take
a devil at his word?

51
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,276
[ZERO SEVEN]
That man... that devil...!

52
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,780
He tricked my mother into
thinking he loved her!

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,950
Then he drank her blood
as she lay dying...

54
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,184
as he raped her!

55
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,587
(Devil screaming)
Huh?

56
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:37,724
[HANS]
You know, I think you might
be looking at this all
in the wrong way.

57
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,994
What I'm getting is that
that guy was a total degenerate.

58
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,197
And that he just so happened
to also be a devil as well.

59
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,866
[ZERO SEVEN]
Hrm!

60
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,068
[HANS]
It takes more than one factor
in someone's life

61
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,670
to drive them to crime.

62
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,772
You have to look at what sort
of environment they grew up in,

63
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:54,274
what heir interests are,
and who's always around them.

64
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,912
All of these come together
in a complex pattern to
create that foundation.

65
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,313
In other words...

66
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,982
treating someone like
a potential criminal

67
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,686
just because they happen to be
a devil is way too simplistic.

68
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,221
(Devil screaming)

69
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,898
[YOUNG ANZAI]
(Scared)

70
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,833
(Retching)

71
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,335
[TSUKASA]
Are you scared?

72
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,470
They're devils. Just like you.

73
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,707
[YOUNG ANZAI]
B‐but I'm not...
I'm only half...

74
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,510
[YOUNG ANZAI]
I'm nothing like these devil‐

75
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,747
[ZERO SEVEN]
Shut up! Not another word!

76
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,381
If he weren't a devil.

77
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,484
He would never have done
those terrible things!

78
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,125
[DEVIL]
Blood!

79
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,993
[DEVILS]
Blood! Blood! Blood!

80
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,530
(Devils screaming)

81
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,465
[YOUNG ANZAI]
I'm not...

82
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,068
I'm not like them!

83
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,670
(Growling)

84
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,404
[YOUNG ANZAI]
Blood!

85
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,173
[HANS]
But you have to realize...

86
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,009
people do terrible things too.

87
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,812
(Growl)

88
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,441
(Gasp)

89
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,712
(Growl)

90
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,650
Huh...?

91
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,619
[SAWAZAKI]
So, then Anzai just
ran off by himself?

92
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,354
[TSUKASA]
Uh... yes, sir.

93
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,590
[SAWAZAKI]
He must be
chasing the sniper.

94
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,894
[TSUKASA THINKING]
<i>Oh, Anzai...</i>
<i>All because I was bleeding.</i>

95
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,663
<i>He was crying.</i>

96
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,666
<i>What do I do? It's my fault.</i>

97
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,834
I have to do something.

98
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,004
[YANAGI]
What the hell just happened?

99
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,706
[YANAGI]
He wouldn't!

100
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:16,242
[YANAGI]
Sawazaki, come on!
We need to find Anzai fast!

101
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,512
[TSUKASA]
Uh... Wait!

102
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,480
I am going with you!

103
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,949
(Roaring)

104
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,489
(Roaring)

105
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,898
(Hiss)

106
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,633
(Grunting)

107
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:54,515
[YANAGI]
So you're telling me that
Anzai didn't lick your wound?

108
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,149
[TSUKASA]
That's right.

109
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,851
Anzai... he resisted.

110
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,687
[YANAGI]
I see. Well then there's
still hope for him.

111
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,158
[TSUKASA]
<i>Maybe if Anzai sees me,</i>
<i>he'll come back to his senses.</i>

112
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,492
(Beeping)

113
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,629
[SAWAZAKI]
Hey, what's that sound?

114
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,664
[YANAGI]
You know that ring he wears?

115
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,100
I can monitor him,
track his temperature,
in case of an emergency.

116
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,739
This sound is the alarm
that goes off when he gets
above 102 degrees.

117
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,509
[TSUKASA]
He's normally only 80 degrees.
That's a big jump!

118
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,647
[YANAGI]
There's only one thing
that could have this much
effect on a devil.

119
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:30,617
He must have ingested an
extremely large quantity
of blood.

120
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,720
The problem is... if his temp
keeps going up like this...

121
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,658
it'll effect his brain and
other vital organs, leading
to permanent damage.

122
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:40,627
Worst case scenario,
he might die.

123
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,395
[SAWAZAKI]
He might die? Seriously?

124
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,897
[TSUKASA]
Anzai...

125
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,532
[YANAGI]
We must make sure to find him,

126
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,233
so we can stop him
before that happens.

127
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,571
I've never seen something
this drastic before.

128
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,342
[HANS]
Hey, I want you
to calm down now.

129
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,911
(Roar)

130
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,381
Oh well...
his wounds are healed,

131
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,084
but now the blood's
totally gone to his head.

132
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,558
Go to Hell... I'll kill you!

133
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,959
[HANS]
Whoa!

134
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,028
(Growl)

135
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,129
(Gasp)

136
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,197
[YANAGI]
This is only a theory,

137
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,932
but it's possible
the sniper

138
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,901
is identifying vampires
by their temperatures.

139
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,670
With thermo‐imaging,
there's a heat signature.

140
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,808
[SAWAZAKI]
And you're sure...
you're absolutely certain
Anzai's consumed blood?

141
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,310
[YANAGI]
Yeah I didn't believe it
at first, either.

142
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,779
In suppressing his desire
for Tsukasa's blood,

143
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,481
he might have just instead
amplified his bloodlust.

144
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,351
[TSUKASA]
So it is my fault.

145
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,788
[SAWAZAKI]
If he did drink blood, then
we'll need the tranquilizers.

146
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,024
[TSUKASA]
Tranquilizers? Not sedatives?

147
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,093
[SAWAZAKI]
Those are medicinal,
tranquilizers are
more like a weapon.

148
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,864
They're for
law enforcement only...
to use on crazed devils.

149
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,365
[TSUKASA]
He's a suspect?

150
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,867
[YANAGI]
We've no choice.

151
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,602
[YANAGI]
We have to help the blood donor.

152
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,271
Lots of devils tend to
go after young women, so...

153
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,073
(Pained gasp)

154
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,211
[TSUKASA]
<i>What... was that...</i>

155
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,213
<i>That pain I just felt?</i>

156
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,249

Oh, no!
We're not exactly...

313
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,068
Uh...

314
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,904
[ANZAI]
I really like you.

315
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,840
Perhaps I should
tell him I like him too.

316
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,542
Then maybe we can go out.

317
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,011
Wait! He's just
waiting around for you
to get back to him?

318
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,580
So when'll that be?

319
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,883
Oh right... you have
no way to contact him.

320
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:06,186
Hm. You know
you're probably right.

321
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,654
It's been a couple of weeks...

322
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,723
but I bet he's
bothered by what happened.

323
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:12,458
That was the most devil‐like
I'd ever seen him.

324
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,562
And he... almost attacked me.

325
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,331
(Knock at the door)

326
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,766
[SAWAZAKI]
Come on, Anzai.

327
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,603
How long are you gonna
hole up in there?

328
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:23,770
(Knocking)

329
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,606
Your suspension ends tomorrow.

330
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:29,610
We're meeting at the bar
downstairs at 6 o'clock.
Try not to be late.

331
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,513
[YANAGI]
If you're really worried about
it, I got something for ya.

332
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,215
Just think of it
as a gift.
A gift?

333
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:38,451
[YANAGI]
He's afraid he's going to
lose it and hurt somebody
close to him.

334
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,887
So that's a tool to help
ease his anxiety.

335
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,090
Hm...

336
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,860
[SAWAZAKI]
Anzai...
Who are you?

337
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,062
Are you a devil?
(Anzai sighs)

338
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,132
[SAWAZAKI]
No, you're a cop.

339
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:01,307
[HANS]
Come to think of it...
doesn't it bother you?

340
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,243
[TSUKASA]
Doesn't what bother me?

341
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,211
He almost killed you
back there.

342
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,313
Uh... that would
frighten most people.

343
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:11,351
Yeah I know,
but it was Anzai. Oh!

344
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:12,986
Huh?

345
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,588
You like him that much?

346
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:17,057
Then what if he trained to get
a tolerance for blood?

347
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,058
Tolerance?

348
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,526
See this?

349
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,695
I drink just a little bit of
blood every single day.

350
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,229
So you...
drink blood?

351
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,632
Is it really okay for you
to do something like that?

352
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:29,402
Yeah, I just drink a little
at a time to get my body
accustomed to it.

353
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,038
That way it's easier to resist
the urge to feed on others.

354
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:36,342
Therefore, I can see
or even taste blood and
still maintain my sanity.

355
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,512
It heals wounds, as well.
Oh!

356
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:41,281
So the other day, when Anzai
survived that gunshot wound,

357
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,516
it was because...?

358
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:45,018
I see now.
But then whose blood was it?

359
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:48,154
I have some volunteers
that don't mind sharing
a little with me.

360
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:52,693
That way it's not too hard
for any one person, you know?

361
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:54,795
<i>I never would have</i>
<i>thought of that.</i>

362
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:58,632
Do you want me to help you?
Y'know, find Anzai, that is.
Huh?

363
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,433
There aren't a whole lot
of half‐breeds out there,

364
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:01,467
so I'd like to meet him.

365
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,236
And then maybe...

366
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,172
I could introduce him to
the art of blood tolerance.

367
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,874
Oh...

368
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,917
Um‐hm...

[WEATHER WOMEN]
Good evening, everyone.
I'm here at the fountain plaza.

379
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,436
We were able to enjoy
a little bit of sun today.

380
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,639
But tomorrow, we can
expect more snow.
