I'll get you something, too.

2
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,108
A present.

00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,076
[TSUKASA]
Yeah?

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,713

00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,382
[TSUKASA]
Of course...but when?

00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:19,786
[ANZAI]
Any time will be fine.

What? Because you hit my

to you.

[ANZAI]
Why are you apologizing?

13
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,135
[TSUKASA]
Because it's all my fault.

14
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,003

No...just stop talking.

Oh! Tsukasa!

20
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,555
I'm over here!

21
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,358
[MIWAKO]
I haven't seen you since winter
break started!

22

You stopped
paying attention to me.

28

pretty well!

end up meeting him?

34
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,652
[TSUKASA]
Uh, well he's...

35
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,555
He's not very friendly...

36
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,824
And often gets angry with me.

37
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,294
But he's really very nice...

38
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,597
And he's willing to admit when
he's wrong.

39
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,632
Oh...and he can jump really
really high!

Wait, what? Is he in track and
field or something?

41

[TSUKASA]
Umm no, not really...but like
that.

42
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:28,308
And, uh...I met him on the way
home one night.

43
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,677
He's been coming over after
work.

44
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,614
I usually end up making dinner
for us to eat together.

45
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,917
[MIWAKO]
Wha!? You actually let him in
your house and feed him dinner?

46
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,752
Is that a good idea?

47
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:39,753
Is he a decent guy?

48
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,821
You trust him?

49
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,524

Yes. I believe I CAN trust him.

50

absolutely certain then I guess.

53

[ANZAI]
I act like I'm some knight in
shining armor.

54
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,548
[YANAGI]
It's Yanagi. How have things
been?

55
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,750
Come see me sometime after New
Year's.

56
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,652
It's almost time for your
physical.

57
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,722
Oh...and Sakaki's hosting his
usual New Year's party at the
bar.

58
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,826
I got a wife and kids, so I
won't be there... but all the
singles should be.

if you feel like it.

60

I think I got carried away

61

and bought too much stuff.

I'm feeling kind of out of it.

63
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,640
Is it because I didn't get any
sleep last night?

64
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,842
I just couldn't.

Sounds like that could be the
work of a devil.

[ANZAI]
Vampires tend to stab their
victims after a kill.

114
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,418
It's to hide any signs that they
drank blood.

115
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,221
If I were working the case I'd
suspect the missing man.

116
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,158

So then...since he's missing
that means he ran away.

We can't say for sure, though.

If that missing man is a
devil...

he may be around here by
now.

vegetables.

him good?

Oh...you know, now that you
mention it,

00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,805
[WALLA: STREET CROWD]
(curious chatter)

152
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:55,709
[JILL]
I can't believe I have to work
on New Year's Eve.

153
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,411
[SAWAZAKI]
Well, when the person of
interest is a devil...

154
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,514
Of course, we're still waiting
on the autopsy.

155
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,282
[MANAGER]
Hey! You the detectives?

156
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,117
One of my employees is a
vampire.

157
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,652
His name is Katagiri.

158
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,955
He's the guy that did it! Get
out there and go arrest him!

159
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,892
[SAWAZAKI]
You're Mr. Okino, the manager,
correct?

160
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,094
We don't know for sure who is
responsible.

161
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,830
[MANAGER]
What's to know? She had no blood
left in her body.

162
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,399
It had to be a vampire, what
else could it be?!

163
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,266
[SAWAZAKI]
Sir, just calm down.

164
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,201
[JILL]
Excuse me.

165
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,068
[MANAGER]
(startled)

166
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,269
[JILL]
Why is it,

167
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,205
that you reek of the
smell of blood?

168
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,041
[MANAGER]
(surprise) Y‐you're just
making stuff up!

169
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,076
[MANAGER]
What do you know about
anything!?

170
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,779
[JILL]
My sense of smell is better than
average.

171
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,017
Humans only reek this badly of
blood when they've been drenched
in someone else's.

172
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:42,923
[MANAGER]
(fear)(falling down in fear)
Y...you're a devil?

173
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,327
[SAWAZAKI]
Hello?

174
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,895
What is it? I'm busy.

175
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,364
[ANZAI]
It's Anzai. Is there a wanted
devil on the loose?

176
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,735
[SAWAZAKI]
(Huh?) Yeah, the suspect in the
restaurant stabbing.

177
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,237
But I think he was framed.

178
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,539
[ANZAI]
He's innocent?

179
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,073
[SAWAZAKI]
Well, according to the autopsy.

180
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,475
The killer made it look like a
devil did it,

181
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,410
by causing massive
blood loss.

182
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,346
I haven't been able to identify
him...

183
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,550
But there's a devil nearby who
seems to be running
from‐(noticing)

184
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,717
[ANZAI]
Hey!

185
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,085
[ANZAI]
Don't feed him!

186
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,086
[ANZAI]
Name and age.

187
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,320
[KATAGIRI]
I'm...Oryo.

188
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,089
[ANZAI]
I need your real name in full.

189
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,959
[KATAGIRI]
Ryunosuke Katagiri, age 36.

190
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,761
[ANZAI] You get that?
[SAWAZAKI] Yeah, that's our guy.

191
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,262
[KATAGIRI (UNDER)]
(sneezes)

192
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,865
[SAWAZAKI]
We'll send a car to get him.
Where are you?

193
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,567
[KATAGIRI]
Those dark circles....

194
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,601
[KATAGIRI]
Is your boyfriend a devil, too?

195
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:28,702
[TSUKASA]
(surprise)

196
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:29,836
[TSUKASA]
H‐he's not my boy‐!

197
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:30,737
[KATAGIRI]
That's your objection?

198
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,038
Wait and he's not...

199
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,807
but you're spending New Years
Eve together.

200
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,009
[TSUKASA]
(flustered)

201
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,545
[ANZAI]
I have a question I need to ask.

202
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,981
If you were framed, you
shouldn't need to run.

203
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,049
So why did you come all the way
out here?

204
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,285
[KATAGIRI]
(groan)

205
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,221
[ANZAI]
Give me an honest answer, and
you can have some food.

206
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,092
[KATAGIRI]
Devils run faster than humans.

207
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,960
And we're stronger

208
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,831
If we get in a fight, we might
end up beating the guy half to
death.

209
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,568
I once hit a man and he
immediately started to bleed.

210
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,905
I felt the urge come over me.

211
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,607
I lost my mind at that point.

212
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,976
I hated that man, but I sucked
his blood.

213
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,445
So I made up my mind.

214
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,414
I'll never hurt a human
again...

215
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:16,482
and if I feel like I
might...

216
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,185
I get out as fast I can.

217
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,155
The girl that was murdered was
nice to me.

218
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,959
She was the only one there who
always treated me like a human
being.

219
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:31,097
I refuse...to become a devil.

220
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,314
[KATAGIRI]
Thanks for the hot pot. It was
delicious.

221
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:52,819
[JILL]
That's the girlfriend? She's
just a baby.

222
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,621
[SAWAZAKI]
Let's go, Jill.

223
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,357
[JILL]
She beat me in chest‐size.

224
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,725
[JILL]
Hey Yuuki!

225
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,160
[JILL]
Come see me sometime.

226
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,927
[ANZAI]
(annoyance)

227
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,228
[JILL]
I'll be waiting!

228
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,396
[TSUKASA]
Huh?

229
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,430
[SAWAZAKI]
What was that?

230
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,566
[JILL]
Nothing. Come on.

231
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,967
Let's get outta here.

232
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,202
[ANZAI]
Like hell I would ever go to her
place.

233
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,238
[TSUKASA]
That woman...looked like a
Hollywood movie star.

234
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,441
[ANZAI] What?
[TSUKASA] I just thought she was
really pretty.

235
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,744
[ANZAI]
Oh yeah, I guess she's okay

236
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,346
[TSUKASA]
(lightly crying)

237
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,582
[ANZAI]
(surprise)

238
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,617
[ANZAI]
Wha? Wh‐why you crying?

239
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,018
[TSUKASA]
I'm sorry. It's nothing.

240
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,053
[ANZAI]
Is it...what she just said?

241
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,591
About going to see her? She was
just messing with us.

242
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,659
[WOMAN A]
These stairs are killing me!

243
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,060
[WOMAN A]
You bought too much to drink.

244
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,662
[WOMAN B]
Some of that is for you, you
know

245
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,431
[WOMAN A]
(laughs) I don't even drink wine

246
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,167
[ANZAI]
You okay?

247
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,971
[ANZAI]
(OM shock) What's gotten into
you!?

248
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,541
[TSUKASA]
(whimper) I'm sorry.

249
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,376
I just...feel so pathetic.
(breath)

250
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,279
[ANZAI]
Pathetic about what?

251
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,648
[TSUKASA]
It's just...

252
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,551
she was so beautiful.
I'm jealous is all.

253
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:02,422
And, um...I didn't even know
that was your first name 'til
then.

254
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,859
[ANZAI]
(going in for the hug inhale)

255
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,894
[TSUKASA]
Huh?

256
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,996
[TSUKASA]
What's happening here?

257
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,899
I've dreamed of this. More than
once.

258
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,736
I really am pathetic.

259
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,939
Always doing things like this in
my dreams

260
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,143
But I know...I'm nowhere near
good enough for someone like
him.

261
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,779
[TSUKASA]
(coughing) (falling back)

262
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,847
[ANZAI]
Tsukasa!

263
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,382
[TSUKASA]
(heavy breathing)

264
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,918
[TSUKASA]
I'm fine...Anzai.

265
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,154
[ANZAI]
(concerned)

266
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,523
[ANZAI]
Your face is redder than before.

267
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,624
[ANZAI]
Hey, can you walk?

268
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,825
[TSUKASA]
(Mm...)

269
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,727
[ANZAI]
I'm the one who's pathetic.

270
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:44,698
I could tell she wasn't feeling
well, but I ignored it, and now
look at her.

271
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:49,402
[FEMALE TV HOST]
We're here gazing at the holiday
lights at Sapporo Odori Park.

272
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,337
[TSUKASA] Hokkaido.
[HOST(UNDER)]There is a
tremendous turnout

273
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,973
[TSUKASA]
I'd like to go there someday.

274
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,708
[HOST]
revelers are waiting for the big
countdown.

275
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,042
[ANZAI]
You sure?

276
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,045
[ANZAI]
It's cold.

277
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,953
[ANZAI]
I'll take you.

278
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:08,722
[TSUKASA]
(Hmm...)

279
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,591
[ANZAI]
(breath catch)

280
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:12,058
[ANZAI]
What am I doing?

281
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,260
[ANZAI]
I need to get myself a sedative.

282
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,229
[ANZAI]
(standing up)

283
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,365
[FEMALE TV HOST]
Get ready for the countdown.

284
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,870
[TV HOST]
Ten...Nine...Eight...Seven...Six
. .

285
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,473
[ANZAI]
What am I saying..."I'll take
you"?

286
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:32,078
She's a human...and I'm a devil.

287
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,816
[SAWAZAKI]
Another one?

288
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,052
Shot through the head with a
7.62mm bullet.

289
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,921
This is the fifth one.

290
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:42,956
Jill...look.

291
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,891
[JILL]
I already did!

292
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,127
[JILL]
(not feeling well)

293
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,898
[SAWAZAKI]
You saw the blood and it didn't
make you transform.

294
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,267
Which means this victim isn't
human, either?

295
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,971
[JILL]
Can't you be gentlemanly enough
to ask if I'm ok‐

296
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,640
[SAWAZAKI]
Ahh...

297
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,876
Ahh...Poor girl.

298
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,849
[SAWAZAKI]
Looks like last night's victim
makes five...in this series of
shootings.

299
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,885
All with a single straight shot
to the head.

300
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,557
And it's looking like the
victims are all devils.

301
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:17,658
[ANZAI]
Devils?

302
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:18,959
[SAWAZAKI]
But not one of them

303
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,927
was in a transformed state when
they died.

304
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,629
They looked like normal humans.

305
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,799
[JILL]
So you're saying the killer must
have known they were devils?

306
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,351
[SAWAZAKI]
Assuming that's true...then how

307
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,135
did the shooter know the victims
were devils?

308
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,735
That information is only
exclusive to city halls,

309
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:36,242
insurance companies, hospitals,
and the police.

310
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,444
There are some devil dating
sites, but...

311
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:42,115
[JILL]
(sigh) What's wrong? You got
a date or something, Yuuki?

312
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,251
How far have you gotten with
her? You touch her boobs yet?

313
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,854
[ANZAI]
Must you broadcast your dumb
questions?

314
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,923
[JILL]
Come on, I really want to know
the answer.

315
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,093
How does one go about dating a
human woman, huh?

316
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,195
The sight of blood arouses you.

317
00:14:55,295 --> 00:15:00,466
And when you're aroused, you
want more blood.

318
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,969
You can't even feel her up
without having to be cautious. ,/
[ANZAI]
Don't talk like that! And quit
it with the hands!

319
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,271
[JILL]
You know it's driving you crazy.

320
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,208
I'd be happy to help you let off
some steam.

321
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,776
[SAWAZAKI]
Uhh excuse me.

322
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:13,013
Do you know why Anzai's here,
even though he's suspended?

323
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:17,784
If there's a list of devils
being passed around...then
either of you two could be the
next target.

324
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,385
[ANZAI] (gasp)
[JILL] (slight utterance)

325
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,588
[JILL]
Aw...Are you worried about our
safety?

326
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:26,126
[SAWAZAKI]
No. I'm saying I don't have time
to babysit you. So watch
yourselves.

327
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,561
[JILL]
You don't have to be so mean.

328
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:29,462
[ANZAI]
(agony)

329
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:32,198
[SAKAKI]
They really are just like
children.

330
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:33,834
[YANAGI]
Hey there guys.

331
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,536
[SAWAZAKI]
Hey Yanagi.

332
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:38,505
[YANAGI]
I thought I might find my
patient being held up in here.

333
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,308
[ANZAI]
I'll take my physical another
time. I didn't forget, I
promise.

334
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,477
[YANAGI]
I told you to come see me after
New Year's.

335
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,813
And I bet you're running low on
sedatives, too.

336
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,181
[ANZAI]
(breath) I have one left.

337
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,583
[YANAGI]
Just one? You shouldn't

338
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,651
go through them that fast!

339
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,052
So when are you coming?!

340
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,120
I want a specific date! Today!

341
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,690
[ANZAI]
Today won't work. Tomorrow would
be much be‐

342
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,859
[YANAGI]
Tomorrow, it is! 10 o'clcok in
the morning

343
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,126
[JILL]
He's such a gangster.

344
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,728
[SAKAKI]
There's a list of devils?

345
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,598
Ok so what is the current
population of devils anyway?

346
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:08,902
[JILL]
I believe it's...0.01%. That
right, Sawazaki?

347
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:12,806
[SAWAZAKI]
That's about the right
percentage living here in Japan.

348
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,641
Roughly a thousand in Tokyo.

349
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,377
Somewhere between
near‐threatened and endangered.

350
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,846
[JILL]
Now that sex between humans and
devils is legal...

351
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,949
I'm guessing we'll be seeing
even fewer purebloods around.

352
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:27,053
Oh! You could let Yanagi watch,
so that you can screw your
girlfriend!

353
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,189
[ANZAI]
Get your mind out of the gutter!

354
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,391
[SAWAZAKI]
You two quit fighting!

355
00:16:34,652 --> 00:16:36,763
[WALLA: STREET CROWD]
(chatter)

356
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:43,003
[ANZAI]
I still haven't been able to get
her that Christmas present yet.

357
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,739
[SAWAZAKI]
I almost forgot. You can see
your girlfriend if you want.

358
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,142
But hold off on jumping
telephone poles. You'll get
noticed.

359
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:52,412
[ANZAI]
I know that! I'm walking like a
regular person on the ground.

360
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,114
[SAWAZAKI]
I know how you like jumping.

361
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,316
[ANZAI]
Ugh...see ya.

362
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,090
[TSUKASA]
Cheese‐stuffed cabbage rolls.

363
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,860
Good idea, if I say so myself.

364
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,194
Should be tasty.

365
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,496
I think he should be getting
home pretty soon.

366
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:13,700
(blushes), "getting home"? Why'd
I say it like that?

367
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,369
[MIWAKO]
And you're sure you can trust
this guy?

368
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,971
[TSUKASA]
I told you, I could!

369
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,673
[MIWAKO]
Well, I'm worried about you!

370
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,275
You had virtually no interest in
men before now.

371
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,679
And you haven't really known him
for all that long, am I right?

372
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,047
[TSUKASA]
Umm right.

373
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,115
[MIWAKO]
You can't be too careful, okay?

374
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,417
If anything happens, then you
must talk to me.

375
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,554
[TSUKASA]
It's like she's my mom.

376
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:37,758
[TSUKASA]
But she's right. We haven't
really known each other for that
long.

377
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:40,160
I only just met him two months
ago.

378
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,296
I mean...I'm not even his
girlfriend.

379
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:47,668
Come to think of it...I feel
like I hardly even know him.

380
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:48,835
Ohhh I don't know...

381
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,638
he does keep
coming to my apartment.

382
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,373
[TSUKASA]
(hmh?)

383
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,175
[TSUKASA]
Who could it be? A delivery?

384
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,611
Anzai always comes in through
the balcony, so...

385
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,413
Uh...whaa? (shocked)

386
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,448
[ANZAI]
Well, it's nice to see you, too!

387
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,018
[TSUKASA]
B‐but...why are you at my front
door?

388
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,887
[ANZAI]
I do that sometimes.

389
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:08,488
[TSUKASA]
Oh! The rice is done.

390
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,592
So, uh...We're having cabbage
rolls today.

391
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:14,528
I tweaked the recipe, and I
think it'll be good.

392
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,397
[TSUKASA]
(hmh?)

393
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,399
[ANZAI]
How you feeling?

394
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,034
[TSUKASA]
H‐how am I...?

395
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,503
[TSUKASA]
I'm good! I'm great!

396
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,038
[ANZAI]
Your fever's gone? Well your
hand is hot

397
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:29,810
[TSUKASA]
No, your temperature is just too
cold. You're around 80 degrees,
right?

398
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,978
Are all devils just as cold as
you?

399
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,479
[ANZAI]
Did you go out today?

400
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,149
[TSUKASA]
What? No...well, just to the
store.

401
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,385
[ANZAI]
Not sure what it is...but you're
different

402
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,723
[TSUKASA]
Oh...I...put on...some makeup.

403
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:43,957
[TSUKASA]
(breath catch)

404
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,125

[TSUKASA]
(inhale)

407
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,588
[ANZAI]
I really like you. (urk!)

408
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,823
[TSUKASA (shock)]
ANZAI (pained gasp)

409
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,064
Damn...

410
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,032
I missed.

411
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:29,636
The next one gets your head, you
monster.

412
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,939
[TSUKASA]
Anzai! Anzai!

413
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,841
[ANZAI]
(gasping in pain)

414
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,009
[ANZAI]
You hurt?

415
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,411
[TSUKASA]
No. But you are, Anzai.

416
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,013
[ANZAI]
Please, don't cry.

417
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:41,081
[TSUKASA]
(crying)

418
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,516
[ANZAI]
I'll be [just] fine.

419
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,350
[ANZAI]
Get your head down.

420
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,219
[ANZAI]
Where'd it come from?

421
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,921
(breath)
How long were they after me?

422
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,991
[ANZAI]
Never mind that‐WHY were they
after me?

423
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:52,425
[ANZAI]
Because I'm a devil?

424
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,331
[ANZAI]
(gasp)

425
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,775

Kill...

426
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,610
[TSUKASA]
Are you...

427
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,276
[ANZAI]
Kill!

428
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,477
[TSUKASA]
Okay?

Don't touch me, you monster!

murderer?

It's your kind that are the sick
murderers here!

00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:23,416
[ZERO SEVEN]
You pretend to care just long
enough

445
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:24,851
so as too drink our
blood!

00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,222
[ZERO SEVEN]
My mom...she died because of
you!

448
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:32,526
[ZERO SEVEN]
If you devils never existed,
she'd still be alive!

449
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:33,960
[ZERO SEVEN]
That's why I kill you!

450
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,430
[ZERO SEVEN]
To make sure...you never kill
again!

451
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,766

Damnit!

(coughing blood)

453
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:48,408
[ZERO SEVEN]
I hate you...I hate all of your
kind.

[HANS]
You're weaker than I thought
you'd be.

456
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,412
[HANS]
Are you a civilian?

Devils' Line.
