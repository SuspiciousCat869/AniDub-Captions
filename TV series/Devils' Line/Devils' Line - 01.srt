I could introduce you to

What about Professor Ochiai?

You're his favorite student,
Tsukasa.

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,585
[TSUKASA]
I'm not his favorite.
And I'm pretty sure he's
married.

57
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:48,088
[MIWAKO]
Hey, cut her some slack. Tsukasa
is "pure," okay?

00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,590

She's not like you lot.

Tsukasa is actually responsible.

You make it sound like we're a
bunch of shallow airheads!

[TSUKASA] (wry laugh)
[MIWAKO] And believe it or not,
Tsukasa has...

63
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,666
[AKIMURA] Hey Tsukasa.
[MIWAKO] (oops!)

64
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,167
[AKIMURA]
Can I sit next to you?

65
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,838
And would you mind showing me
your notes?

00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:08,408
[TSUKASA]
(slight utterance)
Sure, no problem.

67
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,077
[MIWAKO]
What? Borrowing Tsukasa's notes
again?

68
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,915
[AKIMURA]
Hers are the most helpful‐she
knows how to organize them.

69
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,751
[FEMALE STUDENT A] That's for
sure. [FEMALE STUDENT B] Can I
see too?

70
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,187

Hey, Tsukasa. I'm having a hard
time getting this one.

71
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,557
[TSUKASA]
(laughs)
Um, well, you have to...

72
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,158

There's Professor Ochiai!

73
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,327

Alright, take your seats.

74
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,296
And quit stealing Tsukasa's
notes.

[TSUKASA]
(sheepish)

76
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,903
[TSUKASA]
So where were you heading next,
Miwako?

77
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:41,174

Well, there are a few companies
I'd like to apply for.

Oh yeah...we have to find jobs.

00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:48,048

No, you're such a great
student‐you could go for a PhD!
You know?

80
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,451
[TSUKASA]
I'm not so sure. I don't think I
want more school.

81
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,086
[MIWAKO]
Huh?

82
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,957
[TSUKASA]
I do like doing research and
learning new things,

83
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,660
[TSUKASA]
And I like college, too, but...

84
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,162
[AKIMURA]
It's okay. You don't have to
rush.

00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,264
[MIWAKO]
Yes, you do!

86
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,732
[MIWAKO]
You don't have to get a
boyfriend,

87
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,101
But if you don't get serious
about your future,

88
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,537
you could be in big trouble.

[TSUKASA]
It's true.

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,314
[TSUKASA]
As the days go on,

92
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,650
I usually just go with the flow.

93
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,919
[TSUKASA]
I can't see the future,

94
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:30,757
so my only option is to do my
best with what's in front of me.

95
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:35,829
[TSUKASA]
How do you figure out what it is
you really want to do in life?

96
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,302
[TSUKASA]
There it is. It's that feeling
again.

153
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,037
[JILL
Did you think we'd let you get
away?

154
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,541
[JILL
This game of tag ends here.

155
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,474
[MAN

(takes off running)

166
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,734
[SAWAZAKI]
Think he's a first offender?

167
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,835
[YANAGI]
Hard to say.

168
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,104
Once they get a taste of blood,

169
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,472
they never forget it.

170
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:37,443
They lose themselves to the
mental high and the sexual rush.

171
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:41,147
Human blood is just like a
narcotic to them.

172
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,918
[SAWAZAKI]
And they get ten times higher
than any human on drugs.

173
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:50,524
[SAWAZAKI]
It's unbelievable an entire
race, born with an addiction to
human blood.

174
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:51,424
[YANAGI]
Vampires.

I know you're suffering.

179
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,266
[JILL
Let me put you out of your
misery.

180
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,602

[RADIO] B
Is he the one behind the serial
vampire murders?

183
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:16,349
[RADIO] A
No. Negative, not this guy...

184
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,370
[MIWAKO]
Hey, Tsukasa, what do you think?

185
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,840
[MIWAKO]
What's really behind the Vampire
Murders?

186
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,509
[AKIMURA]
Come on, she doesn't need to see
that stuff!

187
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,144
[MIWAKO]
Aww, look at you, Akimura.

188
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,980
[AKIMURA]
(Aghh)
Stop looking at me like that.

189
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,917
ANNOUNCER (UNDER)
The next station is Korakuen.
The doors on the right side will
open.

190
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:55,021
[MIWAKO] Tsukasa's place is a
far walk. Make sure she gets
home okay. [AKIMURA] I will,
don't worry

191
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,509
COUPLE WOMAN
It was a great show!

192
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:16,777
COUPLE MAN
Yeah, it was.

193
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:17,844
COUPLE MAN
What do you wanna do now?

194
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,646
[TSUKASA]
(ah!)

195
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,147
[TSUKASA]
(slight utterance)

196

[AKIMURA]
(slight utterance)

197
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,340
[AKIMURA]
You really don't have to worry
about it, Tsukasa.

198
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:49,843
[TSUKASA]
Huh?

199
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,445
[AKIMURA]
What I said to you the other
day.

200
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,615
[AKIMURA]
It's okay.

201
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:58,384
I knew you didn't think
of me that way.

202
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,486
[AKIMURA]
I'm not trying to make you feel
bad.

203
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,688
[TSUKASA]
I know that, okay!

204
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,657
[AKIMURA]
Whoa. If looks could kill.

205
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:06,292
[TSUKASA]
What!? I don't look like
anything.

206
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:21,908
[AKIMURA]
But anyway,
It does help to know that you
don't have a boyfriend, Tsukasa.

207
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,810
[TSUKASA]
(wry smile)

208
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,648
[AKIMURA]
I just feel like, if you did
have one...

209
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,516
I might not be able to recover.

210
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,119
[TSUKASA]
What are you talking about?

211
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,723
[AKIMURA]
I'm serious.

212
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,391
[TSUKASA]
What?

213
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,860
[TSUKASA]
Huh

214
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,300
[AKIMURA]
For now...

215
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,804
[AKIMURA]
I'm okay as friends.

216
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,839
[AKIMURA]
But someday,

217
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,775
If you ever start to...you
know...

218
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,242
[TSUKASA]
(slight utterance)

219
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,113
[AKIMURA]
Never mind.

220
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,418
[TSUKASA]
(deep breath)

221
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,322
[TSUKASA]
(shock)

222
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,062
[TSUKASA]
(gahh)

223
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,800
[TSUKASA]
Akimura?

224
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,568
[AKIMURA]
Let's take a different way.

225
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,770
I don't feel safe here.

226
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,238
[TSUKASA]
Okay.

227
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,544
[TSUKASA] & [AKIMURA]
(running)

228
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:35,415
[TSUKASA] & [AKIMURA]
(running)

229
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,919
[TSUKASA]
(panting)

230
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:45,491
[AKIMURA]
We should be far enough away by
now.

231
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,228
[TSUKASA]
It's definitely him.

232
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,897
That's the
guy I saw on the train.

233
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:51,965
[TSUKASA]
Who is he?

234
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,967
[TSUKASA]
He's following me

235
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,335
[AKIMURA]
(surprise)

236
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,837
[TSUKASA]

239
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,210
[TSUKASA]
(noticing something)

240
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,748
[AKIMURA]
(grr)

241
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,216
[TSUKASA]
(breathing)

242
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,719
[TSUKASA]
(surprise)

243
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,187
[TSUKASA]
(huh?)

244
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,592
[AKIMURA]
(slight utterance)

245

00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,267

249
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,039
[TSUKASA]
(pushes him)

250
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,207

253
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,916
[AKIMURA]
(sigh)

00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,319
[TSUKASA]
(slight utterance)

255
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,890
[AKIMURA]
Sorry about that.

256
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,892
[AKIMURA]
Let's go.

257
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,796
[TSUKASA]
(hesitant)

258
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,397
[AKIMURA]
(awkward laugh)

259
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,166
[TSUKASA]
(gasp)(hm?)

260
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,968
[ANZAI]
Hey there, vampire.

261
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,570
[TSUKASA]
(surprise)

262
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,505
[TSUKASA]
(ah!)

263
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,439
[AKIMURA]
(ow!)

264
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:14,648
[ANZAI]
What‐a man's blood doesn't do it
for you?

265
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,986
[AKIMURA]
okay...who are you?

266
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,189
[AKIMURA]
What...do you...want

267
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,325
[AKIMURA]
(gulps)

268
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,893
[AKIMURA]
I'm wasn't goint to...

269
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,530
...I would never drink her
blood.

270
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,698
Leave us alone.

271
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,500
[TSUKASA]
Aki...mura?

272
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,170
[AKIMURA]
Look you're scaring my friend.

273
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,372
I don't know who you are,

274
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,308
but there's nothing to worry
about.

275
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,578
I've never directed my bloodlust
at her

276
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:45,512
and I never will.

277
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,613
[ANZAI]
Of course not.

278
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,048
You found a
different outlet.

279
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,584
You turned your bloodlust on the
three other women

280
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,085
three women you
murdered.

281
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,019
[TSUKASA]
(shock)

282
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,588
[AKIMURA]
Listen!

283
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,256
That wasn't me.

284
00:15:56,356 --> 00:16:01,027
[ANZAI]
I'm told your semen was found at
each of those scenes.

285
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,031
[AKIMURA]
It wasn't mine!

286
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,367
Don't talk about that in front
of Tsukasa!

287
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,970
[ANZAI]
Your DNA was a match.

288
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,473
I wouldn't be following you
without the evidence.

289
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,576
[ANZAI]
Go!

290
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:16,877
[AKIMURA]
Tsukasa!

291
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,979
[AKIMURA]
You keep your hands off of her!

292
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,949
[ANZAI]
I understand you want to be a
hero in front of your
girlfriend.

293
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,885
even if you wern't a
vampire...you'd be trash.

294
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,653
[AKIMURA](UNDER)
(oof)

295
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,422
[AKIMURA] (nngh)
[ANZAI] You're better off
letting me arrest you now.

296
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,324
[ANZAI]
Once a vampire has raped and
murdered a victim,

297
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,426
They can never shake the thirst
for that pleasure.

298
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,796
They're guaranteed to kill
again.

299
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,163
[ANZAI]
Sooner or later,

300
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,033
you would have
done the same thing to her, too.

301
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,669
[AKIMURA]
I would never hurt her.

302
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,305
I've been taking medicine to
help me control it.

303
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,542
I even gave myself a sedative
earlier.

304
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:50,711
I can be fine with her

305
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:53,379
and take this secret to my
grave.

306
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:57,117
[AKIMURA]
I know all human lives are
considered equal.

307
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,987
But they're not equally
important to everyone.

308
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,388
[AKIMURA]
(gahh)(deep breath)

309
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,658
[AKIMURA]
I just can't protect everyone,
okay?

310
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,895
[TSUKASA] (breath)
[AKIMURA] I agree, it's not
right.

311
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,564
[AKIMURA]
But it's not fair...

312
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:13,900
Why should I have to kill other
women just to keep Tsukasa safe?

313
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,639
Or should I have killed her to
stop myself from killing the
others?

314
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:19,806
Or maybe I...

315
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,676
I just shouldv'e killed myself?

316
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,477
[AKIMURA]
(sob)

317
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:25,679
[AKIMURA] Tsukasa.

318
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,981
[AKIMURA]
(sobbing)

319
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,516
[TSUKASA]
(afraid)

320
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,051
[AKIMURA]
(sobbing)

321
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,422
[AKIMURA]
(surprise)

322
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,703
[TSUKASA]
I'm so sorry. I should have
realized.

323
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:30,143
[AKIMURA]
(sobbing)

324
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,880
[TSUKASA]
(crying)

325
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,620
[AKIMURA]
Tsukasa.

326
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:49,295
[TSUKASA]
(crying)

327
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,899
[TSUKASA]
(crying)

328
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,502
[TSUKASA]
(crying)

329
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,406
[ANZAI]
Can you walk?

330
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,977
[TSUKASA]
(struggles to stand)

331
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,779
[ANZAI]
Not on that leg, you can't.

332
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,282
This is Anzai from F Squad.

333
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:13,086
[ANZAI]
I've apprehended Target A.
Currently at Hongo 4‐10.

334
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,555
[SAWAZAKI]
This is Sawazaki.

335
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,123
Hidaka will be there to back you
up in three minutes.

336
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,559
[ANZAI]
I tranqed him.

337
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,194
And sorry, something came up.
Take him in for me.

338
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,295
[SAWAZAKI]
What?!

339
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,797
Standby. You could atleast wait

340
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,599
three minutes for someone to‐

341
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,715
[TSUKASA]
Don't you have to go?

342
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,519
[TSUKASA]
Don't worry, I'll be...

343
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,954
[ANZAI]
Fine? No, you won't.

344
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,827
[ANZAI]
This way?

345
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:54,895
[TSUKASA]
Mhmm

346
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,208
[ANZAI]
Hey. 301, right?

347
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,485
[TSUKASA]
Thank you for everything...

348
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:20,987
Anzai.

349
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:26,492
[ANZAI]
You need to forget my name
understand?

350
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,595
[ANZAI]
forget what happened today.

351
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,901
[TSUKASA]
(crying)

352
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:35,969
[ANZAI]
(sigh)

353
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,103
[ANZAI]
Don't cry.

354
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,605
[TSUKASA]
why shouldn't I cry!?

355
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,908
Akimura and I were friends for
a really long time!

356
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,646
[TSUKASA]
I least, I thought we were.

357
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,815
[TSUKASA]
I...

358
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,218
[TSUKASA]
I guess I didn't know anything
about him.

359
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,420
[ANZAI]
The thing about vampires is...

360
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:58,358
[ANZAI]
Biologically, they're extremely
similar to humans.

361
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,793
[ANZAI]
If they don't ever transform,

362
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:01,161
Then most other vampires

363
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,997
can't pick them out in a crowd.

364
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,432
[ANZAI]
So if he was trying his
damnedest to hide it,

365
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:10,804
[ANZAI] Then you can't blame
yourself for not knowing he was one.

366
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:11,609
[TSUKASA] (slight utterance)

367
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:13,607
[ANZAI]
But vampires...

368
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,408
are fighting a constant battle
against the fear

369
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:20,914
that they'll lose control the
instant they see human blood.

370
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:24,484
[ANZAI]
He might've really loved you and
meant to protect you

371
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:27,788
[ANZAI]
But devils and humans were never
meant to be together.

372
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,024
[TSUKASA]
Devils?

373
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,092
[ANZAI]
That's right.

374
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,827
That's what we call vampires.

375
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,061
[ANZAI]
(realization)

376
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,532
[ANZAI]
Your mouth.

377
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,467
[ANZAI]
It's bleeding.

378
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:42,769
[TSUKASA]
Now you notice?

379
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,372
[TSUKASA]
I cut my lip when you shoved me!

380
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,742
[TSUKASA]
I'm getting a little sick of how
rough you a‐

381
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,043
[TSUKASA]
(gasps)

382
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:51,712
[TSUKASA]
(shock)

383
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:52,946
[TSUKASA]
(ah!)

384
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,683
[TSUKASA]
(ugh!)

385
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:02,422
[ANZAI]
(licking/kissing)

386
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:04,825
[TSUKASA]
(gasp)

387
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,090
[TSUKASA] & [ANZAI]
Devils' Line

388
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,859
[TSUKASA] & [ANZAI]
Line 2.

389
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,628
[TSUKASA] & [ANZAI]
Safe House.
