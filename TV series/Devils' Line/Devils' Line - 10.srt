Well, well, well.
I've been looking for you.

00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,487
Remember me?

12
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,524
You broke into my office
at the university.

13
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:27,027
You attacked me, and shattered
every bone in my face.

So happy to see you.

What do you think?

Do you have any idea what
I have had to endure
since that day?

18
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,106
The university fired me
and my wife left me,

19
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,308
making me pay an arm and
a leg in child support.

20

On top of that, a student
put all my personal
information online.

21
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:49,249
My nightmare began the day
you invaded my office.

22
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,619
That was the day that
ended up ruining my life.

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,657
I'm a social outcast now,
and it's all thanks to you.

24
00:00:56,757 --> 00:01:00,293
Like I care. I never wanted
to see that face of yours
ever again.

25
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,996
Must be because birds of
a feather flock together.

I've done some research
on you devils.

Apparently your thirst for
blood is aroused at the
same time as your sex drive?

29
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:14,675
You were in full‐on monster mode
in my office, weren't you.

30
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,544
You act tough, but you're
no better than me.

31
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,980
You were turned on, seeing
Tsukasa with her shirt off,

36
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,321
[OCHIAI]
So... what just triggered
your transformation?

37
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,524
Was it the memory
of her bare skin?

38
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,827
Or please don't tell me...
it was from this right here?

39

What?

40
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,898
So... my blood is actually
turning you on, huh?

41
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,232
You sick fuck.

42
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,401
Seriously? You got
a little boner, there?

43
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,369
From the nosebleed of
a dude that you hate!

00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,840
Ha! Man, I gotta feel

[SAKAKI]
Hmm...

116
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:41,201
[SUPERIOR]
Look, devil personnel were
supposed to be banned
from investigations.

117
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,872
And F Squad's devils were
specifically prohibited from
going in the field un‐escorted,

118
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,975
but now we have one
that's wreaked havoc on
public transportation,

119
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,044
and the video is
all over the internet.

120
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,615
Now there will be disciplinary
action coming down later,

121
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:58,418

it will be more than
suspending one officer.

By the way, where is Ishimaru?

123

[ISHIMARU]
So let me get this right.

132
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,177
There's someone on the
vigilante corps

133
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,112
with a personal grudge
against you.

134
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,414
I must say I didn't expect that.

135
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,083
What's gonna happen to me?

136
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:34,087
Internally, the worst
punishment our bylaws allow.

137
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,523
For now, we've
taken the position

138
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,191
that you weren't
actively deployed,

139
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,560
that you just
happened to be there

140
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,161
and got mixed up
in the incident.

141
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,596
Because if we don't,

142
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,431
what you did was bad enough
to easily get you fired.

143
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:49,369
The higher ups are pretty
upset about that video
getting uploaded.

144
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,941
But even after you transformed,
you still didn't hurt
the guy, so that's good.

145
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,044
And personally I find
this video very interesting.

146

00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,226
What is it you're going to do?

153
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,928
[ISHIMARU]
As your superior officer,

154
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,164
I thought I ought to know just
how much you're capable of.

155
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,499
(Shocked)

156
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,803
[ISHIMARU]
Devils are strong.

157
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:26,139
Even their most basic
physical abilities
far surpass those of humans.

158
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,876
Surely there had to be an
opening for you to get in
a good punch on me.

159
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,045
I'd appreciate it if you'd try.

160
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,479
No!

161
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,281
I don't know how much
control I'll end up having

162
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,817
after I'm fully transformed.

163
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:41,421
[ISHIMARU]
That's exactly what
I want you to figure out.

164
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,423
What in the hell
are you thinking? Don't!

165
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,759
It's just you and me in here.

166
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,927
Your girl's not around.

167
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,629
And if you do happen
to lose control,

168
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,831
I guarantee
I'll restrain you.

169
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,266
Just stop it!
Why are you doing this?

170
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,869
If anyone can do it... you can.

171
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,904
(Door opens)
[TSUKASA] Good morning.

172
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,641
Oh! Well, good morning, Tsukasa.

173
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,809
Um, where's Anzai?

174
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,245
He just left a few minutes ago
with Ishimaru.

175
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,548
[TSUKASA]
Oh...

176
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,149
[ISHIMARU]
Anzai.

177
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,451
You can handle this.

178
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,620
Fight me. For real.

179
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,021
Don't be stupid.

180
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,357
I have read every file
we have on you.

181
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:21,194
You're afraid of who
you are when you're
a fully transformed devil.

182
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,564
But on the other hand,
you have an intense desire

183
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,833
to try and control your
devil transformation.

184
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,268
(Slurp)

185
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,370
[ANZAI]
Uh...

186
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,573
[ISHIMARU]
Come on. Hit me.

187
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:33,940
Do it!

188
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,808
(Anzai grunts)

189
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,342
[ANZAI]
<i>I got him.</i>

190
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,444
(Inhales)
See, you're faster now.

191
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,946
(Scream)

192
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,315
(Anzai groans)

193
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,417
(Anzai coughing)
[ISHIMARU]
Don't let your guard down.

194
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:45,919
Have you not noticed yet,

195
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,354
you've been in full control
of yourself this whole time.

196
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,692
Wasn't that true yesterday, too?

197
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,260
[ANZAI]
<i>I'm... still in control?</i>

198
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,029
Do you get it now?

199
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,332
I honestly could not dodge
that hit that you threw
at me earlier.

200
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,934
So, there you go.

201
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,436
You've transformed,
but you're thinking rationally.

202
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:08,474
What you are experiencing
is what we call a benign
transformative reaction.

203
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,676
[ANZAI]
Huh?

204
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,477
[ISHIMARU]
Your senses are sharpened,

205
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,979
your reflexes have improved,

206
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,282
and you can almost access your
maximum muscle strength.

207
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:20,854
Plus it seems you can
consciously control
what you are doing.

208
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,723
You haven't been able
to realize it yet,

209
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,425
but now we know exactly
what you're capable of.

210
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:27,594
And what is that?

211
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,964
It may be that the sight
of human blood isn't the
only thing that can trigger

212
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,000
a full transformation response
within your system.

213
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,902
Could be your trigger is also...

214
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,804
That's it... who are you?

215
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,139
(Ishimaru grunts)

216
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,040
You are fast!

217
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,775
Can you see my every move?

218
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,077
[ANZAI]
Answer me! How d'you know...
about devils?

219
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,647
[ISHIMARU]
I can tell you
I'm not your enemy.

220
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,651
[ISHIMARU]
Time for the next stage.
Drinking blood.

221
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,885
(Anzai struggling)

222
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,486
You don't need to
worry about me.

223
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,056
I can take care of myself
in this circumstance.

224
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,224
Don't you want to know
more about your potential

225
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,526
and what that means for you?

226
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,395
My what? My potential?

227
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:06,432
(Car pulls up and doors open)

228
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,835
[SAWAZAKI]
Tsukasa!

229
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,604
[TSUKASA]
Where's Anzai?

230
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,773
[ISHIMARU]
Go on.

231
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,515
[ISHIMARU]
Wait.

232
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,116
That's not gonna
be necessary here.

233
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,953
Officer Anzai is in complete
control of himself now.

234
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,491
(Nervous gasp)

235
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:35,729
[ANZAI]
<i>I didn't want Tsukasa to have</i>
<i>to see me in my devil form.</i>

236
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,430
I don't think you have to worry.

237
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:42,068
Pretty sure that guy knows
what he's doing when it
comes to devils.

238
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,071
I've been a big fan of devils
for a really long time.

239
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:45,739
[ANZAI]
Huh?

240
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,040
When I was a kid,

241
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,709
I had a friend I played with
who was a devil.

242
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,045
It got me interested,
so I started doing research.

243
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,017
Do you understand what it
means... to make him transform?

244
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,521
I have a basic idea of
the extent and method of
the transformation.

245
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:01,922
And how to deal with it.

246
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,324
I'm asking if you understand
how someone would feel

247
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,527
if they were forced to
transform like that?

248
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:08,494
[ISHIMARU]
Hmm...

249
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:13,133
Oh... I'm so sorry.

250
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:17,070
(Thunder)

251
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,543
It's no good,
I can't get seem to get in.

252
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:24,377
[ISHIMARU]
And that means?

253
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,547
[KENICHI]
It means the hideout computer
isn't connected to the internet.

254
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,014
So I can't hack in.

255
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,883
[SAWAZAKI]
Is it always offline?

256
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,452
[KENICHI]
No. Maybe they disconnected it
to avoid hacking.

257
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:36,957
If someone's thinking
that far ahead, it would have
to be Zero Two or Zero Six.

258
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,726
[ISHIMARU]
Are the numbers given
in order of importance?

259
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,928
Zero Two is technically
our leader...

260
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,130
but after that,
I think it's random.

261
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,131
And Number One?

262
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,867
That would be the investor...

263
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,134
I don't know who it is.

264
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,470
Then do you know who
the other numbers are?

265
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:51,805
[KENICHI]
Uh... Well, um...

266
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,306
Why start holding back now?

267
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,609
[SAWAZAKI]
What are these
"probably no one" marks?

268
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,311
[KENICHI]
I've never seen them at the
hideout or heard their names,

269
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,581
so I think the numbers
must've been skipped.

270
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,415
But I don't actually
know for sure.

271
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:06,553
[ANZAI]
So one‐three isn't Thirteen?
...it's Jason?

272
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,555
[KENICHI]
Yeah. I don't know why.

273
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,990
I think there is a Jason,

274
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,491
but I don't know
their real name.

275
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:12,693
That's not good.

276
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,828
You sure no one has
those numbers?

277
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,296
If I could just see the roster,

278
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,832
it should tell us which numbers
haven't been assigned.

279
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,435
If we want the roster
then we probably have to
break in to the hideout.

280
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:26,940
I'd like to ask for some
backup, but we don't know
who might be a spy.

281
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,610
Worst case, our squad
will go it alone.

282
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,077
That sounds about right.

283
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,213
(Raining outside)

284
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,784
So now then, are you
over your hatred?

285
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm putting it
on hold for now.

286
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,957
Are you mad at me?

287
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,192
For taking a shot at you and
putting a hole in your chest.

288
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,329
[ANZAI]
Mad? That I got shot?

289
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,597
Please, Anzai.

290
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,398
You should be
apologizing to her!

291
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,867
Hm?

292
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,602
[ANZAI]
Whenever you shot
through that window...

293
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,104
...a piece of glass
cut her face.

294
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,340
Oh, no, please...

295
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,408
it doesn't bother me.
I, uh, kind of like it.

296
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,410
[ISHIMARU]
What do you mean
"hole in his chest"?

297
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,546
It's just, uh...

298
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,413
I never heard
anything about this.

299
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,282
[ANZAI] What are you...?
Get off me!
[ISHIMARU] How could
an injury like‐

300
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,116
(Gasp)

301
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,585
How did you heal that fast,

302
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,087
I put a 7.62mm
right through you?!

303
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,157
Of course.
That was when...
he gave you‐

304
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,693
[KANO]
Okay kiddos, that'll be

There was once a detective

who discovered devils could
heal their wounds by
drinking human blood.

So did he get fired
or something?

Officially, he was
transferred from fieldwork,

I always thought that
devils are dangerous.

And that devils and
humans should stay

00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,683
<i>but it seems the anti‐devil</i>
<i>faction is making</i>
<i>an example of him.</i>

460
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,319
Hm...?

461
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,455
[ANZAI]
Huh...

462
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,024
[KIKUHARA]
<i>I'm on an investigation,</i>

463
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:27,493
<i>looking for a devil serial</i>
<i>killer named Tamaki Anzai.</i>

464
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,632
[ANZAI]
<i>Kikuhara!</i>

465
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,366
[ISHIMARU]
Anzai, I can't let you go alone.

466
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,901
[ANZAI]
Then come with me!

467
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,737
[ANZAI]
<i>Devil serial killer...</i>

468
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,705
<i>Tamaki Anzai?</i>

469
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,608
Can I help you there?

470
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,444
As I recall, you were
suspended from duty, Officer.

471
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:47,013
You and I met a long
time ago, didn't we?

472
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,582
We already discussed this.

473
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,350
At the new staff ceremony.

474
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,853
No. More than 10 years ago.

475
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:56,823
Tell me about the devil
serial killer, Tamaki Anzai.

476
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,726
[KIKUHARA]
<i>Does he have no memory of it?</i>

477
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,462
[KIKUHARA]
<i>That's not possible.</i>

478
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,103
You should go home.

479
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,005
I can't have you
disrupting the scene.

480
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,774
Hey, Kikuhara.

481
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:16,342
Who are you exactly?

482
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:19,646
The question is who are you?

483
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:20,847
(Anzai shocked)

484
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,316
If you can't even remember
what happened that day,

485
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,251
you have no right
to ask me who I am.

486
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:29,455
I remember everything that
has ever happened to me,
good or bad.

487
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,491
No matter how painful.

488
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:34,027
I own it all, regardless.

489
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,632
Excuse me.

490
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:45,371
[ANZAI]
<i>Did I... want to remember?</i>

491
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,908
Reporting in.

492
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:29,042
You are late,

493
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:30,911
[KIKUHARA]
<i>Jason.</i>

494
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:44,658
[ANZAI & TSUKASA]
