00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:14,855
Target T apprehended.
Assault charges to be filed.

162
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,391
Present on the scene:
Senior Officer Sawazaki

163
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,927
And Officer Anzai.

164
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,063
(Yuuko sobbing)

165
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,777
Oh!

166
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,345
Uh...

167
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,781
(Anzai grunting)

168
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,649
[ANZAI]
I knew it!

169
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,250
You followed me, didn't you?

170
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,619
Huh!

171
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,854
And you didn't even
bother to lock the door?

172
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,290
You're all alone,
it's the middle of the night!

173
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,125
Yeah you're right. Sorry.

174
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,995
But you left this, I thought
I'd return it to you.

175
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,262
(Gasp)

176
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,901
Uh...

177
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,970
Uh...

178
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,072
[ANZAI]
I... I'm sorry.

179
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:10,143
[TSUKASA THINKING]
<i>Really? Is he</i>
<i>apologizing to me?</i>

180
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,580
[ANZAI]
But from now on, you don't
have to bring me my stuff.

181
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,148
[TSUKASA]
Oh...

182
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,883
Understand?

183
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,820
Yeah... I got it.

184
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,456
[TSUKASA]
Um... So, that woman...

185
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,759
[ANZAI]
She's an old friend.

186
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:30,664
We... we used to make snowmen
when we were kids.

187
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,233
(Gasps)

188
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,168
It's cold.

189
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,203
(Exhales)

190
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:43,777
[ANZAI]
Do not get hurt
in front of me again.

191
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,350
(Anzai exhales)

192
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,852
[ANZAI]
As I was saying earlier...

193
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,220
it's not easy for non‐family
members to visit a devil.

194
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,958
But they might make an
exception if you helped
the devil reform himself.

195
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,661
If you wanna see him,
then that's how you can
do it, alright.

196
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:01,461
(Shivers)

197
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:02,963
You okay?

198
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:07,033
I mean... if you want...
you could use the uh...

199
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,401
A kotatsu.

200
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,003
[TSUKASA]
You have one at home?

201
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,973
I only have the basic things
one needs to get by.

202
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,241
Everyone needs a kotatsu.

203
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,843
Do you get cold easily?

204
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,613
[ANZAI]
No, but my temperature
stays around 80 degrees.

205
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,247
What, that's low!

206
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,415
(Radio chirps)

207
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,984
[SAWAZAKI]
Anzai. Where are you?

208
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:27,521
I've told you to stop
running off like this.

209
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,656
[ANZAI]
Sorry, but I gotta go.

210
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:33,459
And you make sure
to lock your door.

211
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,361
Hey! Wait a sec!

212
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,598
Huh?

213
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,633
[JILL]
What?! Do it with
somebody watching?

214
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:40,901
Not a chance.

215
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,468
[SAKAKI]
Welcome back, Anzai.

216
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,572
[YANAGI]
Anzai, how's it going?

217
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,207
[YANAGI]
Right then, here are
your tranqs.

218
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,810
[ANZAI]
Oh, thanks. This'll help.

219
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,413
Where's Sawazaki? Not here yet?

220
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:54,748
He should be here soon.

221
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,617
Sounds like you're gonna
be in for a lecture.

222
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:00,587
Something about...
oh, you running off
on your own again?

223
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,922
[JILL]
He's right, Anzai.

224
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,857
You've been a stranger
around here lately.

225
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,325
(Anzai groans)

226
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,993
[JILL]
Why run away when you've
got someone like me

227
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,262
taking pity on you and
inviting you over?

228
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,764
[ANZAI]
Leave me alone.

229
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,265
Water, please.

230
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,867
I didn't realize you two
were actually dating.

231
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,436
Oh, please.
Of course we are.

232
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:17,904
I didn't realize
that either.

233
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,640
What is wrong
with you guys?

234
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,608
You know you can't
believe a word she says.

235
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,044
She just wishes we were.

236
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,783
So, what was it you two
were just talking about?

237
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,085
[JILL]
Hm? Hee‐hee...

238
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,789
Just some ridiculous new clause
they added to the guidelines.

239
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,858
Devil Conduct Guidelines
Article 1:

240
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,195
Sexual intercourse between
a human and a vampire
will now be legal...

241
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,365
As long as there is consent
from both parties...

242
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,200
and a doctor is present.

243
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,069
(Anzai groans)

244
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,272
[JILL]
I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

245
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,075
The Tamaru couple was in
that very situation,

246
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:58,011
I mean they even signed
a pre‐nup promising
not to have sex,

247
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,514
and look how that turned out.

248
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,291
(Happy giggle)

249
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,795
[TSUKASA THINKING]
<i>What kind of hot‐pot</i>
<i>should I make?</i>

250
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,897
A what? Hot pot?

251
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,231
In your apartment?

252
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,001
Uh‐huh. It's too cold
out on the balcony.

253
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,337
Plus, you know...
I was hoping we could talk.

254
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,639
(Anzai gulps)

255
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,074
Y'know that's no reason
to just let me in.

256
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,944
I can't just go in your place
like that. That would be um...

257
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,779
[TSUKASA]
Hmm...

258
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,414
Ah...

259
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,952
Uhh... if it can uh...

260
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,988
Let's wait til after
my squad meeting tomorrow.

261
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,924
[TSUKASA]
Oh...

262
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,126
I'll stop by the grocery store
on my way home from class

263
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,394
and pick up all the
ingredients we'll need.

264
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,295
Is there anything you‐

265
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,565
[ANZAI]
Hey...

266
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,966
What are you so happy about?

267
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,135
Huh? Oh uh‐nothing!

268
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,238
[ANZAI]
How about...
you wait till I'm done...

269
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,641
then we can meet up and
I'll carry the bags.

270
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:04,945
So... uh which school was it
that you go to again?

271
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:11,518
[TSUKASA]
Let's see, Professor Ochiai's
office should be right
around here.

272
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,920
Oh. Here we go, this is it.

273
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,921
(Both startled)

274
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,356
[OCHIAI]
Hey, Tsukasa.

275
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,292
What are you doing here?
Can I help you?

276
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:23,129
Uh... I came to return
the book I borrowed from you.

277
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,166
Ah! So it was you
all this time, huh?

278
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:29,069
[TSUKASA]
Sorry, I kept forgetting
to bring it back.

279
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,606
Oh no, I understand,
it's okay. Hm...

280
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,242
[OCHIAI]
Oh! Is it snowing out there?

281
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,477
(Tsukasa gasps)

282
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:40,113
[OCHIAI]
Well then, you must be
pretty cold, I bet.

283
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,948
Why don't you stay here
and warm up?

284
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,184
No... I don't have time.

285
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,320
[OCHIAI]
I can at least make you
some tea. C'mon in.

286
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,889
(Tsukasa gasps)

287
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:57,864
[SAWAZAKI]
So, "devils and humans living
together is a bad idea," right?

288
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,200
[JILL]
Hm? Where did that come from?

289
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,704
[SAWAZAKI]
Anzai's little creed.
You know...

290
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,506
Seems Target T
that we apprehended...

291
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:08,474
She and Anzai were at the
same orphanage as kids.

292
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,743
What?

293
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,812
I'd say he's had a
lot to think about

294
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:16,216
ever since we arrested that
serial killer last month.

295
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,951
He's spent a lot of time
checking up on the girl

296
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,587
who was the motive
behind the murders.

297
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,322
[OCHIAI]
Here. Careful, it's hot.

298
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,059
[TSUKASA]
Oh... Thank you very much.

299
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,595
Soooo... let me think now.

300
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,597
Where did I put it?

301
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,567
[TSUKASA THINKING]
<i>Maybe I'm just being</i>
<i>neurotic, but...</i>

302
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,469
<i>But he's kind of scaring me</i>
<i>for some reason.</i>

303
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,071
<i>But...</i>

304
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,641
<i>...I don't think I was afraid</i>
<i>the other day with Anzai.</i>

305
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:44,210
<i>I should've been. I mean he was</i>
<i>a total stranger kissing me!</i>

306
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,113
<i>Normally, that would be</i>
<i>even worse.</i>

307
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,282
<i>Oh, something is wrong with me.</i>

308
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,184
[OCHIAI]
Your timing was perfect.

309
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,485
Uh...

310
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,387
I got another really good book
I was looking forward to

311
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,422
lending you the next time
you came in for class.

312
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,891
Oh, no...

313
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,526
I just had your book
for over six months,

314
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,361
I can't go and
