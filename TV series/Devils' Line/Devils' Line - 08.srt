[ANZAI]
There's this doctor,
a friend of Yanagi's.

68
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,918
He told me in order to control
the devil inside me,

69
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,253
I had to know myself.

70
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,755
That it's important
to figure out

71
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,790
exactly what causes
me to transform...

72
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,260
And just how far
my transformation will go.

73
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,328
But to be honest...

74
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,297
I've never thought
about it that way.

75
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,699
I didn't want to hurt you,

76
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,267
so I always thought
it would be best

77
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,503
if I just tried to
keep you at a distance.

78
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,372
But every time I transform,
it's because of you.

79
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,208
So if I want to learn more
about why I transform...

80
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,878

I'm going to have to
drag you in with me.

But I fear it means
putting you in more danger.

82
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,651
And I would never
want to do that to you.

84
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,490
I've never actually
talked to you about this.

I could have been bleeding.

just end right there.

going to kill me.

[TSUKASA]
Mm!

161
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,386
The sedative hasn't
worn off yet...

162
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,989
so I don't think
I'll transform.
Yeah.

163
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,591
Anzai's a bigger pervert
than he lets on.

164
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,225
[TSUKASA]
Oh!

165
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,160
You might wanna watch
yourself there, Tsukasa.

166
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,866
[KATAGIRI]
Huh?

167
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,035
Oh... I see.

168
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,970
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,508
[KIKUHARA]
So you're saying the manger
of Cross Bar, Kiwako Oe

170
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:30,677
and her employee Wataru Akase,
are both dead?

171
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,714
And Ryunosuke Katagiri
is in hiding?

172
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,316
Though he's virtually
immobilized for now.

173
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,220
Two people died because of him.
That should be warning enough.

174
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,457
[USHIO ON RADIO]
<i>C Squad, Ushio here...</i>

175
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:47,594
<i>Zero Seven and Nine appear to</i>

176
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:52,432
<i>The workers who went up</i>

<i>had their uniforms stolen.</i>

177
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,601
<i>They were left</i>

178
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,269
And what about the hostage?

179
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,806
[USHIO]
<i>Um... a devil showed up</i>

<i>It's him...</i>
[USHIO] <i>What now?</i>

182
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,414
[KIKUHARA]
We got a tip earlier from what
sounded like a young man.

183
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:12,986
He said there were snipers
on the roof of both the
Mino Hotel and Grand Hotel.

184
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:17,624
The blood splatter on the
roof will eventually tell them
that Makimura was involved.

185
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:22,028
As for now... there was
nothing mentioned in the tip
about you being a spy.

186
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,797
I wonder why...

187
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,033
[KIKUHARA]
<i>I couldn't say. But Anzai's</i>
<i>just a low‐ranking officer.</i>

188
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,936
<i>It may be that he couldn't</i>
<i>make the call on his own.</i>

189
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,073
<i>We'll keep an eye on F Squad</i>
<i>for the time being.</i>

190
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,575
Sounds good.

191
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,710
[KIKUHARA]
<i>Can you find out</i>
<i>who the hostage was?</i>

192
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,144
I'll find her.

193
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,580
It's just a hunch but...

194
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,849
I think Anzai and
the hostage are lovers.

195
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,985
[KIKUHARA THINKING]
<i>Well... interesting.</i>

196

<i>fall in love with a human,</i>

<i>Aside from the hair color,</i>

<i>Although, if he gets</i>

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,896
<i>It would be tragic.</i>

201
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,932
<i>The half‐devil son of</i>
<i>a violent mass murderer...</i>

<i>Yuuki Anzai.</i>

204
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,774
After I move to
the place over the bar,

205
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,375
we can see each other
every day.

206
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,845
Yeah, I guess you're right.

207
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,748
[ANZAI]
This place is a mess.

208
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,817
They're supposed to
come fix it next month.

209
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,652
[ANZAI]
Next month?

210
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,453
Make sure to bring
your valuables.

211
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:23,957
This place is just asking
to be robbed. Huh?

212
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,626
[ANZAI]
You can take that, too.

213
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:26,627
[TSUKASA]
Huh?

214
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,061
(Taps foot)

215
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,464
We won't be seeing this
place again for a while.

216
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:32,966
[TSUKASA]
When it calms down,

217
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,502
I hope we can relax
under the kotatsu again.

218
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,570
[ANZAI]
Yeah.

219
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,438
[SAWAZAKI]
That's fishy.

220
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:42,108
He's not with the police.
It's an amateur stakeout.

221
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,812
Could just be a nosy reporter...
trying to get a look at Tsukasa.

222
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:49,115
A lot of people saw her
during the Ikebukuro incident.

223
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,418
Some people have even leaked
her name and school, too.

224
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,987
That's just great.

225
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,822
[YANAGI]
Changing the subject.

226
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,991
There are rumors going
around about a new group..

227
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,793
they're trying to
wipe out the devils.

228
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,427
What, are you serious?

229
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,063
[YANAGI]
They're called the CCC.

230
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,766
Known as the
Chosen Civil Community...

231
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,802
[KANO]
So these lunkheads
think they're chosen, eh?

232
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,236
Sounds sketchy.

233
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,206
After the Ikebukuro Incident,
it's to be expected,

234
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,176
groups like these are bound
to pop up during tragedy.

235
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,811
Don't you think
it's a little too soon

236
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,646
for a group to be
fully formed yet?

237
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:20,814
Abso‐tutely.

238
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,382
[TSUKASA]
So, um...

239
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,117
I see the happy couple's here!

240
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:27,053
[KANO]
Who's ready for some
bloodlust training?

241
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,755
[ANZAI & TSUKASA]
Hmm...

242
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,757
[KANO]
The Anzai Couple will be
in Guestroom A.

243
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,927
Yanagi and I will be
standing by in Room B next door.

244
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,697
I brought a few restraining
devices with me.

245
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,999
They were all made
with devils in mind.

246
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,967
So what are we
supposed to do, exactly?

247
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,103
Enjoy some hanky panky,
of course.

248
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,304
(Anzai gulp)

249
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,206
[KANO]
And we'll actually
have you transform.

250
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,941
Huh?

251
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,043
[ANZAI]
Wait! I thought this training
was to help me control it!

252
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,513
To control it, we need the
timing of your transformation.

253
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:56,583
And the point of training
is to control the
transformation afterwards.

254
00:11:56,683 --> 00:12:01,187
Control doesn't mean "stop,"
it means gaining
mastery over it.

255
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,256
If you want to stop
the bloodlust,

256
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,092
then all I can tell you
is to stop dating women.

257
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,830
Just chill it, daddy‐o,
this is why we have protection.

258
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,765
You kids have fun.

259
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:15,368
And don't worry,
we'll be checking it all out
from right next door.

260
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,469
(Anzai & Tsukasa gulp)

261
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,538
[KANO]
Yanagi, can you hear me?

262
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:18,705
[ANZAI & TSUKASA]
<i>Whaaaat!</i>

263
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:19,740
I can hear you loud and clear.

264
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,307
Tell me, why?

265
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,376
I thought a doctor only watched
if we planned on doing it!

266
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,613
Simmer down, it's only to
make communication easier

267
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,482
and we're going to have it off
most of the time anyway.

268
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,686
Besides, depending on how
it goes, you might get lucky.

269
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,187
Don't be stupid.

270
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,823
Anyway, Yanagi and I will
be monitoring your temperature

271
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,525
from Room B, if you're worried.

272
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,628
If you transform and
your temperature rises
above the control value,

273
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,666
we will force the audio
channel open and address you
from the other room,

274
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,134
asking if you or Tsukasa
have been hurt at all.

275
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,370
And you must both
answer this question.

276
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,941
If we feel it necessary,
we will also turn on
the video feed.

277
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,781
So, they're really going to keep
this whole thing offline, right?

278
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:05,118
If he's not, then that doctor
has some serious problems
he needs to take care of.

279
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,253
[TSUKASA]
Oh! Maybe this is it.

280
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,990
The microphone and the camera
are both X‐ed out.

281
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,358
[ANZAI]
Oh... it should be okay then.

282
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,794
(Anzai startled)

283
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,729
You okay, Anzai?

284
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,230
(Angst)

285
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,400
Don't push yourself too hard.

286
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,003
Do you wanna take a break?

287
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,138
[ANZAI]
No... I'm okay.

288
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,007
[TSUKASA]
Why don't you put these on?

289
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,209
[ANZAI]
Uh... okay.

290
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,011
[TSUKASA]
Nail protectors...

291
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,246
They protect nails
when they've grown

292
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,949
and measure added length
during transformation.

293
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,884
[ANZAI]
Are these handcuffs?

294
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,452
They're heavy.

295
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:46,159
Maybe I should take them off,
they feel kind of weird.

296
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,362
No, I like it.
I feel like it's safer this way.

297
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,396
Really?

298
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,765
I could hide them.

299
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,299
Like this.

300
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,136
Oh no, that's even
worse somehow!
Stop it!

301
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:59,640
Oh! Sorry, I just hit you
where you got shot, didn't I?

302
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,875
It's fine, actually.

303
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,577
It's already healed up.

304
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,711
See?

305
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:05,646
(Gasp)

306
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:06,747
Hm? What's wrong?

307
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,182
Uh... Nothing... just uh...

308
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,653
Does it hurt or anything?

309
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:13,987
Not anymore.

At this point in time.

We should hold off on
passing the sex law...

intercourse.

restraining devices

to use during intercourse...

But there are issues
that need to be resolved

such as the safety of these
devices and their availability.

Passing the new law without
having addressed any
of these issues...

00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,958
would be like setting a trap.

Incident has made devils'
public knowledge...

I can't help but think
the government might
use this new law

463
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:09,970
as a means to try and capture
the devils and eliminate
them from our society.

Mm‐hm...

465
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:54,207
It was so sudden, I mean I just
couldn't come out and say,

466
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,309
"Well hello there,
I'm your mother."

467
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:59,179
But you wouldn't believe
how much he's grown.

468
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,682
He even had a human girlfriend.

469
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,118
[MIDORI]
Yeah... I'm a little worried
by that, too.

470
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:08,589
But, I also had a feeling
that they would be okay...

471
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:10,824
And when I saw
both of their faces...

472
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:14,728
I wanted to tell you so badly,
I came back as fast as I could.

473
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,030
But, there weren't any
direct flights.

474
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,400
[TAMAKI GRUFFLY]
I want to hug you.

475
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,836
To hug me? Or Yuuki?

476
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:26,439
[TAMAKI]
Both of you.

477
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,775
[MIDORI]
Yeah...

478
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,044
I hope the day comes
that you can...

479
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,946
Tamaki.
