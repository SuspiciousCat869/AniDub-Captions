00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,930
<i>Do not let them get killed.</i>

159
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,469
(Young Anzai scared)

160
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,804
[KIKUHARA]
Can't get down?

161
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,205
[YOUNG ANZAI]
Oh!

162
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,574
[KIKUHARA]
Just jump...

163
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,475
I'll catch you.

164
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,177
[YOUNG ANZAI]
Uh...

165
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,918
I'm looking for a mass murderer
named Tamaki Anzai.

166
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,287
He massacred a lot of people.

167
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,355
He is your...

168
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,157
...genitor.

169
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,727
Geni‐tor?

170
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,862
[KIKUHARA]
He was sentenced to death...

171
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,865
but for some reason, he was
secretly released from jail...

172
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,500
and brought here.

173
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,068
(Gasp)

174
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,106
(Groan)

175
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,508
(Young Anzai scared)

176
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:11,845
(Devils banging on glass
and growling)

177
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,947
I don't like it here, let's go.

178
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,849
[KIKUHARA]
In a sense...

179
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,119
it's a type of darkness that
lurks inside all human beings.

180
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,521
(Young Anzai scared)

181
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,857
[KIKUHARA]
Everyone down here...
is a devil.

182
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,060
Just like you and me.

183
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,667
Uh...

184
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,170
(Roars)

185
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,539
(Young Anzai screams)

186
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,006
(Tamaki roaring)

187
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,442
This monster killed 15 people...

188
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:44,377
a devil in the truest sense.

189
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,979
Tamaki Anzai.

190
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,683
[KIKUHARA]
Your father.

191
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,184
A devil...?

192
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,153
My father...?

193
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,655
A murderer...

194
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:57,290
(Retching)

195
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,094
(Heavy breathing)

196
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:08,769
(Door opens)

197
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,271
[FENG]
Hey, none of that!
You have to lie down.

198
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,107
I'm your attending
physician, Feng.

199
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,509
How do you feel?

200
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:16,843
Hm? A hospital?

201
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,179
You're at Shirase
Hospital Basement 2,

202
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,048
the special wing used
for treating devils.

203
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,850
Your wounds have closed up,

204
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,619
but you lost a lot of blood,
so you still need to‐

205
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,921
Do you know if they happened to
bring someone else in with me?

206
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,023
A small woman with short hair...

207
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,892
[FENG]
You mean Tsukasa Taira?

208
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,995
She's here, they admitted her
to the third floor.

209
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,231
Don't worry; her injuries
weren't fatal at all.

210
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,332
[ANZAI]
Really?

211
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,767
[FENG]
Actually...

212
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,468
Her left arm was broken,

213
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,972
with lacerations and deep bite
marks, but she's been treated.

214
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,543
She lost consciousness, but
she's in stable condition now.

215
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:53,079
I understand she forced you
to bite her own arm.

216
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,480
(Anzai shocked)

217
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:58,118
[ANZAI]
<i>I... Tsukasa...</i>

218
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,422
<i>I was finally...</i>
<i>starting to control myself.</i>

219
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:07,027
<i>I thought... there was a light</i>
<i>at the end of the tunnel...</i>

220
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,263
[FENG]
Just remember this.

221
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,333
There was no time for her
to wait for medical help.

222
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,069
If she hadn't worked on closing
up that wound then and there...

223
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:20,206
If she hadn't been there,
you would be dead. Period.

224
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,307
[ANZAI]
Hm...

225
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,009
[FENG]
She made a call.

226
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,646
I believe it was the right one.

227
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,682
[ANZAI]
Hmm...

228
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,952
[MACHIDA]
It seems yesterday,
someone attacked Naoya Ushio.

229
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,355
But he escaped with
no serious injuries.

230
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,591
And this morning in the
detention center,

231
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,993
Kohei Nakamura,
also known as Zero Four,

232
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,995
managed to steal a gun
from a guard.

233
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,130
He was then killed
in the ensuing firefight.

234
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,900
It is my understanding
that Kikuhara came to
visit him yesterday.

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,935
[SAWAZAKI]
Kikuhara?

236
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,972
[ISHIMARU]
At the very least, we need
to immobilize Kikuhara.

237
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,874
[MACHIDA]
I'll put a guard on him.

238
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,376
But if Makimura
is indeed correct,

239
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,112
and there are multiple
government agencies
pulling the strings,

240
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:03,950
then I'm afraid restraining
Kikuhara will not
stop the murders.

241
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,886
You don't need to worry
about the rest.

242
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,922
As of today,
F Squad is dissolved.

243
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,124
[SAWAZAKI]
Hm...

244
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:17,197
Sir, might I ask... please
reduce Anzai's punishment?

245
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,200
Anzai was the one who
saved Ishimaru's life...

246
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,035
as well as mine.

247
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,207
We did take all that
into account when
making our decision.

248
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,342
[ASAMI]
I'm guessing F Squad is done?

249
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,912
[ISHIMARU]
That's a pretty good
guess, Asami.

250
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,747
I could tell from
the look on his face.

251
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,348
That's quite an impressive feat.

252
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,985
Sawazaki's face has always
looked exactly the same to me.

253
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,087
Yeah, well I've known this guy
a lot longer than you.

254
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:45,892
[SAWAZAKI]
We're all suspended...
for the next 20 days

255
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,361
Ishimaru and I are
taking pay cuts.

256
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,230
F Squad is going to
be dissolved...

257
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,933
and the remaining squads
will divide its jurisdiction.

258
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,802
I'm going back to Public
Security General Affairs

259
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,238
and you'll be returning
back to Division 1.

260
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,174
Sawazaki, will go to
Division 5, Section 1.

261
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,943
They plan to tie you
to a desk...?

262
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,411
Miss Lloyd will be
moved to Y Squad.

263
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:09,082
And Dr. Yanagi will go back
to the hospital he came from.

264
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:13,186
I will miss you all...
this is goodbye for now.

265
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,226
(Car beeps and unlocks)

266
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,402
[TSUKASA]
Mm...

267
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,907
Anzai!

268
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,909
[MIWAKO]
Hm...

269
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,177
[TSUKASA]
Miwako?

270
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:40,881
[MIWAKO]
Oh! You're up! Thank God!

271
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,449
[MIWAKO]
The man who saved you.

272
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,285
He was a devil, wasn't he?

273
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:45,986
[TSUKASA]
What?

274
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,387
I saw it on the TV.

275
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:48,655
He had long hair...

276
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,090
Oh, that's Lee.

277
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,058
[MIWAKO]
Everyone is afraid of devils,

278
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,228
and they have a
really bad reputation.

279
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,297
But I guess they're
not all bad.

280
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,398
Miwako.

281
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,667
I think I'm starting to
understand it now,

282
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,837
that there are devils out there
who can be trusted.

283
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,839
And I don't think
I'm the only one...

284
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,574
lots of other people
are getting it.

285
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,275
[TSUKASA]
Oh...

286
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,713
[ISHIMARU]
They've decided on
our punishments.

287
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:16,683
Anzai will most likely be
allowed to resign his position.

288
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,384
But after that...

289
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,154
He'll unfortunately be placed
under strict surveillance...

290
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:27,794
and prohibited from seeing
his human victim for
the foreseeable future.

291
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,996
After the Ikebukuro Incident
and this one,

292
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,399
public opinion is leaning in
a harsher direction.

293
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:38,438
The red‐eye protection bill
was recently submitted
to the Diet...

294
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:42,509
But all it will do is place
more restrictions on devils.

295
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,278
In the current
political climate,

296
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,915
the police had no choice but to
deal with it the way they did.

297
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,416
But...

298
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:53,787
if I had my way, I want you
and Anzai to be together.

299
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,257
I think that a human‐devil
couple like you two...

300
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:01,094
would be a symbol of hope for
those of us who want to coexist.

301
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,296
[TSUKASA]
Oh...

302
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,466
[ANZAI]
I see. So that's it...

303
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,569
[SAWAZAKI]
I asked them to come up
with a way...

304
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,337
that would lighten your
punishment, but...

305
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,139
No, it's okay.

306
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,042
If something like this
were to happen again...

307
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,211
I think I would...

308
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,445
(Grunt)

309
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,615
...kill Tsukasa.

310
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,249
Devils just don't...

311
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,184
(Sigh)

312
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:27,353
deserve to live
along side humans.

313
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,492
I knew... devils were...

314
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:39,332
[SAWAZAKI]
I'm not going to comment on
your relationship with Tsukasa.

315
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,770
And I don't have an answer
on whether we can coexist.

316
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,338
But, no matter what...

317
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:49,409
I want us to be able to
live our lives together.

318
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,277
Isn't that what you want?

319
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,847
[ANZAI WITH ANGST]
It is what I want!

320
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,517
But...

321
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,852
[SAWAZAKI]
Are you going to
talk to Tsukasa?

322
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,086
[ANZAI]
Huh?

323
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,322
[ISHIMARU]
Starting tomorrow afternoon,

324
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,626
you and Anzai will be
banned from making any
contact with each other.

325
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:07,694
If there's anything
you want to tell him,

326
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,663
you have until then
to see him.

327
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:13,099
[ANZAI]
Talk to her?
What would I possibly say?

328
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,267
I mean I still‐

329
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,102
[KANO] Anzai.
[ANZAI] Hm?

330
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,806
Have you had any more flashbacks
since we last talked?

331
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,543
Yeah, I was a kid.

332
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,178
I met Kikuhara at ONLO.

333
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,848
He took me down
to the basement...

334
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,416
And he showed me my father,

335
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,554
Tamaki Anzai.

336
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:36,857
He said he was a devil
and a mass‐murderer.

337
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:40,727
[KANO]
It might be best for you to know
that your father, Tamaki...

338
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:44,598
once had a human girlfriend
before he came to have
known your mother.

339
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:48,468
But she was tragically killed by
a bunch of cold‐blooded humans.

340
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:53,707
Your father hunted down
the men who had killed her
and took his revenge.

341
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,710
But after he drank the blood of
his victims, he lost control,

342
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,445
killing 10 innocent people
that unfortunately

343
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,282
happened to be at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

344
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,985
He lost his love and
murdered 15 people.

345
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,020
By the time they
brought him in to ONLO,

346
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,855
he was nothing but
a living corpse,

347
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,924
ruled by his
addiction to blood.

348
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:15,028
Your mother knew that's
the kind of man he was...

349
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:19,733
I don't know what she
ever saw in him.

350
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:24,204
She told me that she couldn't
really explain it herself.

351
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,439
[KANO]
But from the
first time we met...

352
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,442
[MIDORI]
...met he was always on my mind.

353
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,878
And by the time
I saw him again...

354
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,781
I had fallen in love.

355
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:39,319
You may be a devil,
but that's not all you are.

356
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,988
If you fixate on just
one part of yourself,

357
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,959
your thoughts skew too far
in one direction.

358
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:50,363
Be brave... and face
the woman you love.

359
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,200
(Footsteps)

360
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,105
Hm...

361
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,974
[ANZAI]
So did you hear about
my punishment yet?

362
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:04,244
[TSUKASA]
Yeah. I'm glad you called me out
here, I was worried about you.

363
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,748
There's something I really
need to say to you while
I still am able to do so.

364
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:09,115
Hm?

365
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,718
I'm really glad you
made it out alive.

366
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,355
You saved me... thank you.

367
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,357
Mm‐hm...

368
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,460
[ANZAI]
I was...

369
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:24,364
I was so close to finding
the key to confronting
the devil inside me.

370
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:27,200
If I'd had only
a little more time...

371
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,503
y'know I might have... found it.

372
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:32,939
I might have found hope
or a future at least.

373
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,308
Please forgive me!

374
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,442
No, Tsukasa...!

375
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:37,678
If you hadn't
given me your blood,

376
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:38,745
I would have died!

377
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,180
That's not what I meant.

378
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,483
You don't have to apologize.

379
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:46,019
I wouldn't have made it
this far without you.

380
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,621
If I lost you now...

381
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,455
I feel like everything
I've gained,

382
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,592
would just slip
through my fingers.

383
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,959
I'm scared.

384
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,761
Please, don't worry.

385
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,329
You'll be alright.

386
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,900
You know... I always hated
the devil that's inside me.

387
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,402
I always hated myself.

388
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,138
That's why I
couldn't understand,

389
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,473
when you said
that you liked me...

390
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,743
Your smile was just
so blindingly bright...

391
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:12,813
I guess I couldn't
quite accept it.

392
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,148
Would you let me hear it,

393
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,650
just one more time...?

394
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,519
How you feel?

395
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,022
I love you, Anzai.

396
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:24,858
[ANZAI]
Um... I love you, too.

397
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,728
[TSUKASA]
Look me in the eye
and say it again.

398
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:28,762
Uh!

399
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:32,766
Um... I love you, too.

400
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,968
Thanks.

401
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,939
Don't worry. I'll wait.

402
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,542
(Sharp inhale)

403
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,754
[TSUKASA]
<i>We have to move forward.</i>

404
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,624
<i>If Anzai is moving forward...</i>

405
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,764
<i>Then I'll... move forward, too.</i>

406
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:38,424
(Peaceful music)
(Typing on keyboard)

407
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,728
(Birds chipping)

408
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,867
[TSUKASA]
Oh!

409
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,282
I like your hair.

410
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,450
Very cool.

411
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:09,790
Hm. You're even more
beautiful than ever.
