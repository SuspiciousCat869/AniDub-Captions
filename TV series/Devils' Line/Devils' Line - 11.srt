We can boot it up and
get the member list,

five minutes to unlock it.

I did... but I guess
you won't be deploying,

so you won't need to
use it now. Um...

Yeah. Huh?

I thought you could put
the protectors here,

to get them on quickly.

that easy after all.

There is something
behind the CCC.

At first, I thought Zero One
was pulling the strings.

There's something bigger...
Like...

346
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,258
Maybe R2PC and the government

You shouldn't have done that.

You can cause
all the uproar you want.

351
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,475
Get people from all walks
of life to notice the CCC.

352

But it won't solve the
fundamental problem.

I didn't stop F Squad
or Section 11...

354
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,416
Because I was betting on
a one in a million chance.

The chance that they might get
to the truth of this matter.

356
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:18,491

their usefulness.

[KIKUHARA]
So you think you
can solve this...

361
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:34,340
by cutting off the lizard's head
instead of its tail?

362
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,110
But this lizard can
regrow even its head.

363
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,412
It's like grass;
you mow it down,

364
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,848
but you leave the roots,
so it grows back.

365
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:45,686
The roots are deep down in the
ground where you can't see them.

366
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:48,955
You can't pull them out,
and you can't control them.

367
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:52,559
On top of that, they all come
together in a large mass

368
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,995
to form a giant grassy field.

"shared consciousness"

In other words...

372
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,740
It's the stereotype that
"devils are dangerous."

As long as people
accept this stereotype,

it doesn't matter
if you crush the CCC.

step in and take their place.
