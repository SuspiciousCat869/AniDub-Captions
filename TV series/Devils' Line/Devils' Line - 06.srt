00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,172
[YANAGI]
Alright... I guess
I should monitor

308
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,041
Anzai's temperature
and heart rate.

309
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,110
What's the deal
with the tracker?

310
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,312
You've never had to
monitor me before.

311
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,182
Look all I know is
that ONLO asked me to
monitor Anzai's health.

312
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,318
I'm not aware of
all the details.

(Breathing heavily)

314
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,729
It's like tag,
except the devil is running.

315
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:32,432
As a kid, I thought it was weird
when there was just one "it."

316
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:35,869
I never understood why
the runners didn't just
all band together

317
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,804
to defeat the pathetic thing.

318
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:41,808
Sure, a transformed devil
is vicious, but it shouldn't
take long to figure out.

319
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:45,145
Humans are the ones
that have the devils
hopelessly outnumbered.

320

Now we're going to hunt down
all of you filthy devils,

321
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,783

even less of your kind.

Hey, don't make him bleed.

326
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,661
What? Come on. Not even
a little bitty nosebleed?

327
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:04,297
Didn't you know? Murderers don't
have human blood in their veins.

328
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,232
And that's not just
a silly metaphor.

330

His blood is actually nothing
but just simple ketchup.

331
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,874
Wha...? Ugh, at least you could
come up with something funny!

332
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,276
Well I did get it off your mind.

333
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,378
No more signs of transforming.

So I guess you only go

lusting after Tsukasa.

341
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:38,932
[ZERO FOUR]
Haha... Even blood from an old
man like me turns you on, eh?

342
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,934
I almost feel sorry for you.

343
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,603
Ah, you talk too much, Ketchup.

344
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:46,540
You really don't have to listen
to a ketchup‐head like him.

345
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,808
(Anzai groans)

346
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:49,142
Now, when you need
to pull it out,

347
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,376
you need to pull it out.

348

What?

349
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:53,847
A doctor once told me...

350
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,582
"Sexual lust
comes with bloodlust

351
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,151
and vice versa,
it's physiological."

352
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,087
"So instead of always
relying on just sedatives,

353
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,790
a more natural outlet
would be masturbation."

Got any handcuffs on you?

355
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:08,695
[ANZAI]
So you just accept we have
a lust that drives us to murder.

356
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,565
Yeah, well whether you
choose to accept it or not,

357
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,667
bloodlust is always
going to exist.

358
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:18,038
Question is how you're
going to control it
when it overtakes you.

Um! Are all the people
at the bar all right?

You said that he's an informant
on the Ikebukuro case.

Is that why that guy
was after him?

[SAWAZAKI]
Wha...?

372
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,303
Anzai, you need to hide
Katagiri at Bar Sakaki.

And don't answer any

Katagiri's tip is not

a child of the light

As he fell... I could hear
he was saying something.

say, "Traitor."

did that to yourself
