I won' be able to move much for
about ten minutes.

153
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,201
So we'll have to wait here for a
while. (small gasp)

154
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,738
[ANZAI]
(gasp)

155
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,074
[TSUKASA]
Oh um I'm sorry!

156
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,643
I just uh...couldn't help it.

157
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,115
[ANZAI]
Again.

158
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,284
[TSUKASA]
(shocked breath)

159
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,987
[ANZAI]
Will you do that...ain?

160
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,890
[TSUKASA]
(huh?) (uh) (oh)

161
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,699
[ANZAI]
Will you do that to me again?

162
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,067
[TSUKASA]
You want...to...

163
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,904
kiss you...in?

164
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,306
[ANZAI]
(going in for the kiss)

165
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,874
[ANZAI]
(startled)

166
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,543
[MAKIMURA]
This is Makimura, B Squad!

167
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,578
A unit discharged his weapon,
striking a devil.

168
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,914
We believe the devil was in the
crowd and transformed.

169
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,482
The officer' in shock. Probably
unaware of devils.

170
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,818
[TSUKASA]
What is it?

171
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,853
[ANZAI]
Apparently a cop just shot a
devil.

172
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:43,289
[MAKIMURA
Police officer! Everyone, please
calm down!

173
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,357
Alright now lower your weapon!

174
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,592
[MALE OFFICER A]
Uh, yes sir...

175
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,027
[MAKIMURA]
If you see anyone who looks

176
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,596
unusual, do not approach. Report
to us immediately!

177
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,199
[HANS]
(huh?) Tsukasa?

178
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:57,003
[ANZAI]
I'l get you out of this place
once I' able to move again.

179
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,105
I don't know if it's very safe
here.

180
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,306
[TSUKASA]
Okay.

181
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,777
What' wrong?

182
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,012
[ANZAI]
(uh!) Nothing.

183
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,482
[TSUKASA]
Oh! Wait! Lee is still down
there.

184
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,252
He might be looking for me.

185
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,254
[ANZAI]
Are the two of you like close or
something?

186
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,321
[TSUKASA]
No!

187
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,090
I was looking for you, Anzai.

188
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,993
I went back to that alley, and I
happened to run into him.

189
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:24,631
He said he dropped his cross and
was looking for it.

190
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,800
[TSUKASA]
I told him I was out there
looking for you

191
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,969
and he said he
would help me find you.

192
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,910
[ANZAI]
This is what he had on his
necklace, Tsukasa.

193
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,514
It' an elongated stylized black
cross.

194
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,915
It's the symbol of ONLO,

195
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,050
the orphanage that I grew up in.

196
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,152
[ANZAI]
It's near Obihiro.

197
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,222
They take in
devil orphans and raise them
there.

198
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,058
[TSUKASA]
I didn't know that.

199
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,259
[ANZAI]
No worries.

200
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,896
Probably better not to talk
about this stuff.

201
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,198
Though it doesn't really bother
me that much.

202
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,400
You know...I Still don't

203
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,569
know...very much about you.

204
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,171
So I'm just really happy to
learn anything.

205
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,807
[ANZAI]
(surprised)

206
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,041
[TSUKASA]
(smiles)

207
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,012
[TSUKASA]
Oh! But you don't have to tell

208
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,048
me anything you don't really
want voo...

209
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,082
[TSUKASA]
(uhh)

210
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,119
[ANZAI]
Want "oo"huh?

211
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,355
[ANZAI]
(getting hit in the face)
(laughing)

212
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,590
[TSUKASA]
(huh?)

213
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,858
[ANZAI]
Y'now it's been a pretty long

214
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,528
time since you'e clobbered me
like that.

215
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,029
[TSUKASA]
He laughed again.

216
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,397
It's so cute.

217
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:35,235
I wish he would laugh more.

218
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,337
[ANZAI]
So if he really had a cross like
this one...

219
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,741
Then there's a strong
possibility we're from the same
place.

220
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:44,911
But I don' think I remember
there being any foreigners like
him in my age group.

221
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,780
And all the other kids were
full‐devils;

222
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,115
I'm pretty sure I
was the only one there who was
half.

223
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,717
[TSUKASA]
Are half‐devils that unusual?

224
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,218
[ANZAI]
Yeah you could say that.

225
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,155
Having only one devil parent is
kinda...(realization)

226
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:59,359
Would that...even be possible?

227
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,695
Devils can't have sex with
humans.

228
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,130
So there's no way to conceive...

229
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,966
...a half‐devil child.

230
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,936
[TSUKASA]
Are you okay?

231
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,141
[ANZAI]
(angst)

232
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,119
[ANZAI]
How can you do it? How can you
stand being around me?

233
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,153
[TSUKASA]
(huh?)

234
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,822
[ANZAI]
It's just like the other day!

235
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:29,956
I attacked you. I could have

236
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,492
killed you...right then and
there!

237
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:33,860
Besides...might not be just

238
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,496
half, I mean I might end up
being a full devil.

239
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:37,397
[ANZAI]
How can y..‐!?

240
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,799
[TSUKASA]
(uneasy)

241
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,901
[TSUKASA]
It's...

242
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:42,636
Because...

243
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,871
I like you.

244
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,709
Um! That is...I mean uh...well,
you see.

245
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,376
It doesn' really matter...if

246
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:55,649
you're half or full...Or even
if you'e...if you're just
human.

247
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,218
It doesn't change the fact that
you are Anzai.

248
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,521
I'm really just more worried
about...

249
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:04,457
whether or not I'm a
good match for you. Or if you
need more.

250
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,927

[MALE OFFICER B]
The hell is going on?

254
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,303
[MALE OFFICER C]
The TV said something about
vampires!

255
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,806
[ANZAI]
This is bad.

256
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,842

yet.

You'll fall.

(gasp)

(quietly falling)

263
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,369
[HANS]
You know, you sure do seem to
fall down a lot.

264

(annoyed) It' you...

00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,678
[HANS]
Hey, are you sure you have any
devil blood in you?

267
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,546
Your physical abilities are
pretty weak.

268
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:03,349
[TSUKASA]
That' because I injected him
with a sedative.

269
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,719
[ANZAI]
So uh...what's the deal with
your eye?

270
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,353
[HANS]
You don't know that, either?

00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,353
[MAKIMURA]
About our next deployment, sir.

305
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,655
[KIKUHARA]
Right.

306
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:15,722
Well...Sawazaki.

307
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,624
I'll see you at the meeting.

308
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,896
[HANS]
Uh...are you okay?

309
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,831
[SAWAZAKI]
Is there something about
Kikuhara?

310
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,200
[ANZAI]
No no, it's nothing really.

311
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,671
[ANZAI]
His hand...

312
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:32,573
Was unusually warm.

313
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,045
[SAKAKI]
(relief) I'm so glad you're both
alright.

314
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,715
[SAKAKI]
I have a fire going, so hurry
upstairs.

315
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:42,883
[SAKAKI]
Oh?

316
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,751
[ANZAI]
We have two extra people.

317
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,052
This is Tsukasa Taira.

318
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,287
[SAKAKI]
Oh, your girlfriend!

319
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,089
[TSUKASA]
What?! Well, um...uh

320
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,924
[SAKAKI]
I'm Sakaki, the owner.

321
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,426
[TSUKASA]
It'... nice to meet you

322
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:54,861
[HANS]
And I am Hans Lee.

323
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,963
[HANS]
I'm a good friend of Anzai and
Tsukasa's.

324
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,200
[SAWAZAKI]
He's a witness in the sniper
case as well as tonight'
attack.

325
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,669
I need him to stay here until I
can get back.

326
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,507
Oh and Ms. Taira, I'll want to
get your version of what
happened, as well.

327
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:07,974
[TSUKASA]
Uh, yes, sir.

328
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,976
[SAKAKI]
I do have guestrooms available,

329
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,078
and the fireplace room is rather
large.

330
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,014
Please, make yourselves
comfortable.

331
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,381
[TSUKASA]
Thank you.

332
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,483
[SAKAKI]
In fact I own this entire
building,

333
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,020
I have tenants lease
out from the third floor up.

334
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,955
I've no vacancies at the
moment...

335
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:25,425
But Anzai is one of my tenants,
so you could always stay in his
room.

336
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:26,392
[ANZAI]
No.

337
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,861
[TSUKASA]
(reacts)

338
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,329
[ANZAI]
It's a mess right now.

339
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:37,470
[TSUKASA]
Oh yeah. I have to tell him it's
possible to acclimate himself to
drinking blood.

340
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:40,507
Would that make life a little
easier for him?

341
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,010
Then maybe...could spend more
time together.

342
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,948
[HANS]
What's the matter?

343
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,349
[TSUKASA]
It' just...

344
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,085
Well, I was...thinking about
blood tolerance.

345
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,319
[HANS]
Oh, right.

346
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,121
Yeah, you should probably go
tell him.

347
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,057
Could help him live longer, too.

348
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,191
[TSUKASA]
He' live longer?

349
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,526
[HANS]
You didn't know?

350
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,896
A devil's average lifespan is
only 39 years.

351
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,097
[TSUKASA]
What?

352
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,568
[YANAGI]
Wow, you really brought
everybody.

353
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,636
[SAWAZAKI]
I'm gonna go back to the scene.

354
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,071
[SAWAZAKI]
Watch them, please.

355
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,338
[YANAGI]
You're gonna be busy.

356
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,674
They'll want to set up an

357
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:15,241
investigation headquarters

358
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,476
[SAWAZAKI]
Yeah, well.

359
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:18,879
I won' be back until after
midnight.

360
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,213
I'll stay in touch.

361
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:25,085
[MALE ANNOUNCER A] It's
unclear...

362
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,920
[JILL]
I heard on the radio.

363
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,921
I knew they'd leave us devils

364
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:28,989
out of the decision‐making.

365
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,390
[ANNOUNCER A]
all over Japan.

366
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,858
[JILL]
This was the only line of work

367
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,359
where devils got any decent
treatment.

368
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,362
It won't be too long before
we're out of places to go.

369
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,499
[YANAGI]
Stop, you don't know that
they'e going to cut you off.

370
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,367
[JILL]
Oh no? They'e always thought us

371
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,738
devils were too much for them to
have to deal with anyway.

372
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,306
We're high maintenance. Freaking

373
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,742
out every time we see a little
bit of bl...(pain)

374
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:54,615
[SAWAZAKI]
This is where you belong.
Seriously, must I keep spelling
it out for you?

375
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:55,716
[JILL]
(stunned)

376
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:57,383
[SAWAZAKI]
You, too, Anzai.

377
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,920
Nothing is going to happen to
you.

378
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,455
So just sit tight, okay?

379
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:03,724
[JILL]
Sawazaki.

380
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,394
[JILL]
Sorry I almost attacked you.

381
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,430
[SAWAZAKI]
It wasn't your fault.

382
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,970
[ANZAI] Yanagi...need to talk to
you for a second. Now.
[YANAGI]
Hm?

383
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,705
[TSUKASA]
What if Anzai isn't a half

384
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,074
devil? What if he's full?

385
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,110
Can he develop a blood tolerance
like Lee?

386
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,112
[SAKAKI]
Hey guys, sorry to keep you
waiting!

387
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,682
[JILL]
I'll help. You're making food,
right?

388
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:29,816
[SAKAKI]
Thank you.

389
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:30,984
[TSUKASA]
Oh, me, too.

390
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,085
[HANS]
Me, three.

391
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,286
[TSUKASA]
What are we making?

392
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,655
[SAKAKI]
When I say "midnight snack,"

393
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:35,488
what do you think of?

394
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:36,757
[HANS]
Ramen?

395
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,826
[TSUKASA]
Oh, I'm Tsukasa Taira.

396
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,394
[JILL]
Officer Juliana Lloyd.

397
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,330
I'm a full devil; my parents are
American and Russian.

398
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,866
[TSUKASA]
So you're kinda half.

399
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,267
[JILL]
Ethnic‐wise.

400
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,202
[SAKAKI]
Here you go...apron for each of
you.

401
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,771
[JILL] (hmh?)
[TSUKASA] (oh?)

402
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,543
[JILL]
What' wrong?

403
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,244
[TSUKASA]
It' just you're just so pretty,

404
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,680
like one of those Hollywood
actresses.

405
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,582
[JILL]
(shocked) Why would you say
that,

406
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:02,482
that is so embarrassing!

407
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,250
[TSUKASA]
(startled!)I'm sorry.

408
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,822
I just...admire beautiful,
sophisticated women...so, um...

409
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,159
[FIFTEEN]
Please, let's just stop this
nonsense right now!

410
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,397
What good will it do to chase
me, the deed is already done and
over with?!

411
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:20,333
I know that Plan B was always
something you were against!

412
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,435
But it was our leader who made
the decision!

413
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,038
[NANAKO]
You're saying you bear no
responsibility?

414
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,773
What, when did I ever say that?

415
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,141
By sacrificing a few humans,

416
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,877
we call attention to the
existence of devils!

417
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:35,248
It' the vital first step needed
in order to eliminate them from
our society!

418
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,117
Stay right there and drop your
gun!

419
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,052
[NANAKO]
I don' have a gun on me.

420
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:42,856
You were always too trusting of
humans!

421
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:47,728
The truth is...I have another
mission to complete. (stab!)

422
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:50,897
[FIFTEEN]
I was told you might
try to interfere with Plan B.

423
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,133
[NANAKO]
(ugh)...Mura...(struggling)

424
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,234
[FIFTEEN]
I'm sorry but...

425
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,069
As long as you breathe...u will

426
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,739
only get in the way of our true
vision.

427
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,478
[YANAGI]
Sex between a devil and a human?

428
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,914
I'm sure there are ways to.

429
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,516
You could tie up the devil. And

430
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:13,086
probably gag them as well, so...
It's certainly not impossible.

431
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,588
[ANZAI]
Artificial insemination?

432
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:17,290
[YANAGI]
That might be harder, the way
things are now

433
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,525
[ANZAI]
(defeated)

434
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,561
[YANAGI]
Look, don't let it bother you.

435
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,462
No matter how they were
conceived,

436
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:24,898
the child didn't do
anything wrong.

437
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:27,534
[YANAGI] [ANZAI]
(notice)

438
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,470
[TSUKASA]
Um...sorry to bother you.

439
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,506
I'm checking what flavor ramen
everyone wants.

440
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:35,275
[YANAGI] Uh I'll have the miso.
[ANZAI] Shoyu, please.

441
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:38,912
[TSUKASA]
Um...ai, I...

442
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,614
[YANAGI]
I'm gonna head on back.

443
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,850
You two stay here and...ke out
as long as you want.

444
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,218
[ANZAI]
Wait, what?

445
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,953
[YANAGI]
Later, love‐birds.

446
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,859
[TSUKASA]
So Lee told me... that...

447
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,161
Devils only live to about 39.

448
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,763
[ANZAI]
What'e talking about?

449
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,398
[TSUKASA]
Well, you know that devils are

450
00:19:58,498 --> 00:19:59,966
always going without blood,
right?

451
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,334
He told me that's the reason

452
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,236
why their life expectancy is
low.

453
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,771
[ANZAI]
Listen Tsukasa, I've never seen

454
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,607
any sort of data on devil life
expectancy;

455
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,242
the government has never
released any of those numbers.

456
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:13,379
[TSUKASA]
That night...when you got hurt,
you drank blood and it healed
you.

457
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,015
[ANZAI]
Come on can you really trust
that guy?

458
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:16,617
[TSUKASA]
Listen! Lee drinks a little

459
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,451
blood every day to get used to
it.

460
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,421
Which means he can drink blood
to heal when he needs to!

461
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:23,156
That's why his wounds heal, and

462
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,892
why he's so strong. And he can
live longer!

463
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:30,030
[TSUKASA]
Anzai, please...

464
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,332
I want you to drink my blood.

465
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,537
Every day... give you some.

466
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,805
[ANZAI]
(stunned)

467
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:12,999
[FIFTEEN]
(surprise)

468
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,901
Zero Two...

469
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,402
[ZERO TWO]
I know that last job must have
felt

470
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,572
pretty terrible for you...
sorry.

471
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,173
[FIFTEEN]
Oh, no! I'd do anything...

472
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:22,609
I wanna help out you and the
team wherever I can! (reaction)

473
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:25,946
[ZERO TWO]
You've done well, Murakami.

474
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:27,413
[FIFTEEN]
(feeling good)

475
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,717

(surprise) (stabbed!)

Ren Murakami...unemployed.

477
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:36,356
Had been stalking weather
reporter Yuriko Hyuga.

478
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,224
Resented her for not
reciprocating his feelings.

479
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,528
But was struck by a guilty
conscience during his escape.

480
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:45,999
So he stabbed himself... jumped
off a building.

481
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:48,702
That is the entirety of Plan B.

482
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:51,171
[FIFTEEN]
No please...please don't...

483
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:53,039
[ZERO TWO]
A few sacrifices...

484
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,708
...l save society.

485
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:58,979
KATAGIRI
(fear) (gasp!)

486
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:07,453
[NANAKO]
Why...did you...need to kill
Murakami?

487
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,623
We don' ever kill humans.

488
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,224
We should...

489
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:14,127
only have to...kill devils!

490
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,200
[ZERO TWO]
(licking)

491
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,870
[ZERO TWO]
So...before you die tonight.

492
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:26,106
Tell me something.

493
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:30,844
Do I...look human to you?

494
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,758

[TSUKASA]
Devils' Line.

495

[TSUKASA]
Line 6.

496
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:47,861
[ANZAI]
[TSUKASA]
Dogmatic.
