1
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,272
[ASAMI]
They've made the new personnel
assignments.

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,775
So effective immediately...F

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,177
Squad is led by Lieutenant
Ishimaru.

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,478
In other words it looks like the

5
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:16,149
two of us will now be taking
orders from him.

6
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,251
[SAWAZAKI]
Oh so I get to work with you
again.

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,186
[ASAMI]
I demanded that I be assigned to
you.

8
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,421
[SAWAZAKI]

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,889
[ASAMI]
It was A Squad's Kikuhara

10
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,290
who pushed for the change.

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,060
At first they weren't going to
add anyone F squad.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,394
But then...out of nowhere, he

13
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:31,264
started claiming you can't
control your devils.

14
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,066
It didn't sit right with me.

15
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,400
I mean, something's off...I

16
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,236
don't trust him or the new
leader

17
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,371
he so eagerly replaced
you with.

18
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,473
[SAWAZAKI]
A new leader, huh? Well..

19
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,342
[SAWAZAKI]
If he's in charge now...I guess

20
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,110
I'll have to introduce him to
Anzai and Jill.

21
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,047
[ISHIMARU]
But you won't introduce me to
anyone else?

22
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,215
Based on the state of the scene

23
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,283
and witness testimony,

24
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,152
there's a strong possibility the

25
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,622
missing Ryunosuke Katagiri, was
shot and injured.

26
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,858
And yet there is no indication
that you, a former

27
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,595
investigator, have gone to any
hospitals to look for him.

28
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:05,566
In other words...You already
know where he is.

29
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,401
Officer Anzai took custody of a
hostage.

30
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:12,305
And he was seen acting in
concert with an unidentified
foreign man.

31
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,042
I want you to introduce me to
everyone involved.

32
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,143
That's an order

33
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,479
from your superior officer.

34
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,143
[TSUKASA]
Oh! Hey Anzai!

35
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,945
Want some coffee?

36
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,682
[ANZAI]
Sure that would be nice.

37
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:05,051
[TSUKASA]
I get to see his face like this
every day.

38
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,788
It's like we're living together.

39
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,256
[ANZAI]
There's talk about another base
of operations.

40
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,125
[TSUKASA]
Yeah. I heard.

41
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,528
Sakaki said he'll let you use
his warehouse.

42
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,263
Here y'go. Be careful, it's
pretty hot.

43
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,899
[ANZAI]
Yeah. Thanks.

44
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,301
[TSUKASA] <suddenly embarrassed>
[ANZAI]

45
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,468
[ANZAI]
C'mon...what are you doing?

46
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,404
[TSUKASA]
S‐Sorry.

47
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,007
[YANAGI]
Uh. Pardon the interruption you
guys but uh...

48
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,241
[TSUKASA/ANZAI]

49
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,343
[YANAGI]
Sawazaki wants you downstairs.

50
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,945
Our new boss is waiting for us.

51
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,648
[ANZAI]
Our new boss? What's that all
about?

52
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:35,916
[YANAGI]
I dunno.

53
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,450
But he wants everybody there.

54
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,385
I mean, normally he'd just want
the squad.

55
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:43,724
[ANZAI]
This is my fault, they must've
found out I ignored the standby
order.

56
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,831
<sigh> Now please don't you go
blaming yourself for this.

57
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,834
<breath> Don't you worry.

58
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,841
[ANZAI]

59
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,311
[SAWAZAKI]
This is Lieutenant Ishimaru from
A Squad.

60
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,380
He will be F Squad's new leader.

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,915
And I will be a member.

62
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,418
And Asami from Divison 1 will be
on our team temporarily.

63
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,588
[ISHIMARU]
I easily get tired of
formalities

64
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,123
so don't worry
about being extra polite.

65
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,792
Let me guess, you must be the
team:

66
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:22,863
Anzai, Miss Hostage,
Yanagi, Mr. Foreigner, and Miss
Lloyd.

67
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,131
I don't see Katagiri anywhere.

68
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,100
[SAWAZAKI]
Well he's...still at the

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,235
hospital. And I have more bad
news.

70
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,871
For the next two months, Anzai
and Jill

71
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,873
aren't allowed out
without a human chaperon.

72
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,240
[ANZAI]/[JILL]

73
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,209
[SAWAZAKI]
I know it used to be just for
work

74
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,044
now it applies to
personal reasons as well.

75
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,379
[JILL]
You're joking, right?

76
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,682
Why should we have to put up
with this crap?

77
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,751
And why a new boss? Sawazaki is
just fine.

78
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:49,122
[ISHIMARU]
You can't always do your job by
playing best buds, Miss Lloyd.

79
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,724
Not that I don't understand how

80
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:54,094
you feel. But right now we have
to focus on solving this case.

81
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,430
Why not start with you telling
me about what happened at the
hotel.

82
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,498
[TSUKASA]/[ANZAI]

83
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,666
[TSUKASA]
That reminds me.

84
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,167
What are we
going to do about...

85
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,603
[ANZAI]
Should we tell him?

86
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,305
What if he ends up being a spy,
like Ushio?

87
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,673
[ASAMI]
It is a dilemma, isn't it?

88
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,743
Wondering if you can trust him..
and tell him.

89
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,678
[ASAMI]
I know that I personally
wouldn't.

90
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,847
[ISHIMARU]
Alright then, Asami...I

91
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,816
want you to do a background
check on me.

92
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,083
[ASAMI]
Huh?

93
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,384
[ISHIMARU]
If you need to prove you can

94
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,385
trust me before you can

95
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,621
work on this case, then you

96
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,055
should go ahead and do it.

97
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,356
And you should investigate

98
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,792
Inspector Kikuhara while you're
at it.

99
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,827
[ANZAI]
Kikuhara?

100
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,895
[ISHIMARU]
Of course. It was Kikuhara's

101
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,130
idea after all to demote

102
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,365
Sawazaki and appoint me as squad
leader.

103
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,834
[SAWAZAKI]

104
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,236
[ISHIMARU]
Now go on and do your background
checks.

105
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,705
I'm just going to sit here and
shut up.

106
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,041
[YANAGI]/[HANS]

107
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,976
[TSUKASA]
Hey, um...Anzai?

108
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,044
Can we talk?

109
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,948
So, um...Nine gave me this.

110
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,750
He said it was an apology.

111
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,385
But...since Nine and Seven are

112
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,454
no longer involved with the CCC.

113
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,756
I was hoping that we could use

114
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,792
this without having to arrest
them, y'know.

115
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,093
[ANZAI]
Okay.

116
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,394
So how can we use this in a way

117
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,329
that doesn't royally screw them
over...?

118
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,031
[ISHIMARU]
Hm. You would have to contact

119
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,367
them and get them to want to
willingly come to us.

120
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,002
[ANZAI/TSUKASA]
How long have‐?

121
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,204
[ANZAI]
Wait you're not...you're not a
devil, are you?

122
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,973
[ISHIMARU]
If you're referring to my eyes,

123
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,976
this is because I stay up late
reading manga and light novels.

124
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:19,245
Unlike yours, my dark circles
are from poor health.

125
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,615
That being the case, Miss
Hostage.

126
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,017
You get a gold star for this.

127
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,055
[ISHIMARU]
Okay ...So you think the whole
Ikebukuro Incident was staged

128
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:33,860
by the CCC just to sway public
opinion toward eradicating all
devils.

129
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,895
[YANAGI]

130
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,564
[ISHIMARU]
Now, Zero Five aka Ushio:

131
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,299
Are we going to report him?

132
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,934
If we do... it will inevitably

133
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,469
make its way to general
commander Kikuhara.

134
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,708
[ANZAI]
Wait a second. Wasn't it
Kikuhara who deployed Ushio to
the Mino Hotel?

135
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,643
[SAWAZAKI]
If Kikuhara does happen to be

136
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,813
with the CCC... he would let
Ushio get away safely.

137
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,016
[ISHIMARU]
Truth be told...if it's going to
add to the number of guerilla

138
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,685
operatives needing to be
monitored, then it's best to

139
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,922
leave him in Division 5 where
others can watch him.

140
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,225
Kikuhara may be a person of
interest, but I'm not.

141
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:09,162
So here's what we'll do...I will
contact Zero Seven and Zero Nine

142
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,634
to negotiate and get them to
hand over information on the
CCC.

143
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,235
[SAWAZAKI]
But they're wanted criminals.

144
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,071
[ISHIMARU]
We'll decide whether or not to
arrest them later.

145
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,241
I'm counting on your help to
bring them to the table, Miss
Hostage.

146
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,844
[ANZAI]
You want to add her to
the investigation?

147
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,379
You have any idea how much
danger she's been through?

148
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,814
[ISHIMARU]
But she's the only one who has

149
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,983
established a trusting rapport
with them.

150
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,986
Besides, she'll be fine with you
there.

151
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,087
[ANZAI]
What?

152
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,756
[ISHIMARU]
Devils are stronger.

153
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,258
They're more reliable...than
humans.

154
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,226
[ANZAI]
You serious? Really?

155
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:44,130
[ISHIMARU]
If you're so worried then you
can join the negotiations team.

156
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,200
[ZERO SEVEN]
You gave her our web address?

157
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,635
[ZERO NINE]
I‐I'm sorry!

158
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,605
But...we did get her in a lot of
trouble.

159
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,707
[ZERO SEVEN]
What if she can trace us back
here?

160
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,642
[ZERO NINE]
I can easily erase the site
itself...

161
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:56,910
And I set things up to
make sure

162
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,712
no one would be able
to identify us.

163
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,615
[ZERO SEVEN]
So...What did she
say?

164
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:05,151
[TSUKASA]
Dear Nine...did you manage to
get away?

165
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,888
Is Seven healing okay?

166
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,424
Sorry for contacting you like
this. But...

167
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,659
It's possible that we can

168
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,795
provide protection for you and
Seven,

169
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,831
while still going after
the CCC.

170
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,767
[HANS]
When are negotiations going
down?

171
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:21,902
[TSUKASA]
In three days. I'm so

172
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,870
glad Seven
and Nine answered me.

173
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,007
[ANZAI]
Anyway...you wanted to talk?

174
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,775
[HANS]
Yeah...I just thought I might be

175
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,544
allowed a little free time is
all.

176
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,278
[ANZAI]
What are you going to do?

177
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,413
[HANS]
Just picking up some

178
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,648
necessities...that's all.

179
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,049
[ANZAI]

180
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,318
[HANS]
Don't give me that pouty look of
yours.

181
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,621
[ANZAI]
Alright...We'll be in touch.

182
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,989
I'll input my number into your
phone.

183
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,257
Your curfew is six pm.

184
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,458
[HANS]
That's early

185
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,527
Y'know you should probably give

186
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:47,994
me your number, too, Tsukasa.

187
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,631
[TSUKASA] Sure.
[ANZAI] You don't need her
number!

188
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,998
[HANS]

189
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,934
[HANS]
Don't tell me...When you saved

190
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,236
Tsukasa the other day and then
dodged me...

191
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:59,005
it was because you actually
thought I'd take her from you.

192
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,507
[HANS]
D'you think I was serious when I

193
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,375
said I'd take her... off your
hands?

194
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,544
[ANZAI]
What!?

195
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:04,678
[HANS]
Well, I'm off!

196
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,246
[TSUKASA]
See you later!

197
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,548
[HANS]

198
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,783
[ANZAI]
Come back soon or else.

199
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,256
[TSUKASA]
Are you feeling a little more
comfortable with Lee now?

200
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,659
[ANZAI]
I dunno...Maybe.

201
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,193
[FENG]
Here you go.

202
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,127
Two evening doses

203
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,729
and two morning doses.

204
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,666
[HANS]
Don't do that...you can't draw
that much all at once.

205
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,868
[FENG]
It's okay, I've got plenty to
spare.

206
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,402
[HANS]
You have to keep your promise.

207
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,504
[FENG]

208
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,038
[HANS]
Or I'll stop asking.

209
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,006
[FENG]

210
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,641
[HANS]
You're a doctor. You know a

211
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,242
person can only give so much
blood.

212
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,179
[FENG]
I know all of that, but I'll be
just fine< faint>

213
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,348
[HANS]
Ah! Now you just lie down here
for a while.

214
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,687
[FENG]
Single‐eye transformation...

215
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,789
So the transformation only
affects one

216
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,024
part of your body
and you keep your sanity.

217
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,794
Is that the special privilege of
a half‐breed?

218
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,696
[HANS]
Not really, I hear I'm the only

219
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,330
one who's ever been able to
manage it.

220
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,500
[FENG]
So maybe it's just like your own
special power then.

221
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,768
[HANS]
I hope that's not it.

222
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,504
I've been teaching this other
half‐devil

223
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,205
I know on controlling
blood tolerance

224
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,808
[FENG]
What?! You mean you've made an
actual friend?

225
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,676
[FENG]
That's great!

226
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,612
[HANS]
Uh...thanks.

227
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,213
[FENG]
So is that where you're

228
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,749
staying now, with this new
friend of yours?

229
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,251
[HANS]
Um...well...it's kind of a big

230
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,453
home, where lots of people stay.

231
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,388
[MIDORI]
This is not your home.

232
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,390
YOUNG [HANS]
Tell me...

233
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,059
just how big is the
sky?

234
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,362
Does it change color depending
upon the time of day?

235
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,865
It is said...The "sky" is an

236
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,769
endless space...stretching out
above the ground.

237
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,938
[MIDORI]
Why are you running?

238
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,140
[HANS]
I'll be back after I see the
sky.

239
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,742
Who are you?

240
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:43,744
[MIDORI]
If you come back, they'll never

241
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,712
let you leave again.

242
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,847
There's more you need to

243
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,349
learn about, than just the sky.

244
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,522
[MIDORI]
Decide for yourself...

245
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:56,657
[HANS]

246
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,592
[MIDORI]
...where you belong.

247
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,026
[TSUKASA]
See you later!

248
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,228
[ANZAI]
Come back soon or else.

249
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,898
[FENG]
Sounds like a big happy

250
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,100
family... this place of yours.

251
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,770
[HANS]
I'm not part of that family.

252
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,004
They're only keeping me there

253
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,640
'cause I can teach him blood
tolerance.

254
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,509
When that's over, they'll be
done with me.

255
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,344
[FENG]
So what's this half‐devil you're
teaching like anyway?

256
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,247
[HANS]
Um, he's a scaredy‐cat who tries
to act tough.

257
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,017
And well his girlfriend is
surprisingly impulsive.

258
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,653
They're just a couple of big
crybabies, really.

259
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,556
[FENG]
The polar opposite of
you, then.

260
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:33,193
[HANS]
Yeah.

261
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,299
[FENG]
Just try thinking of that place
as your home, alright.

262
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,735
[TSUKASA]
Welcome back!

263
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,169
[HANS]

264
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,075
[HANS]
<'touched'>

265
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,186
[HANS]
I'm home guys!

266
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,922
[ZERO SEVEN]
Let's get this straight.

267
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,691
[ZERO SEVEN]
We don't trust the police in any
capacity.

268
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,326
[ISHIMARU]
Just so you know...I don't

269
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,395
really trust you or your partner
100%, either.

270
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,899
Now allow me to present what we
have to offer you.

271
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,136
One...We will prepare an
apartment for you.

272
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:20,774
Two...We will provide living
expenses and all the necessary
funds.

273
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:25,211
And three: we won't arrest you.
For now.

274
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,982
[ZERO SEVEN]
"For now"? Well...that's a
cowardly phrase.

275
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,918
[ISHIMARU]
It is also an absolutely honest
one.

276
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,955
[ZERO SEVEN]
And? What do you get out of
this?

277
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,156
[ISHIMARU]
That's a good question.

278
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,792
Any information you have on the
CCC.

279
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,662
For example, a list or roster of
its members.

280
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,463
[ZERO SEVEN]
We don't have any such thing.

281
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:46,099
[ZERO NINE]
But I think I could get a look
at their financials,

282
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,301
if I hack into the hideout's
computer.

283
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,470
[ZERO SEVEN]
I need you to stay out of this,
Nine.

284
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,806
If we get a roster, both our
names will be on it.

285
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,140
[ZERO NINE]

286
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,009
[ISHIMARU]
In all honesty, if we so wish,

287
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,612
we could have you both arrested
right now.

288
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,146
We're just asking for a roster

289
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,983
so we can crush the entire CCC.

290
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,751
[ZERO SEVEN]
It's still not worth it.

291
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,653
[ISHIMARU]
Then give us some terms that

292
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,555
will make it worth it for the
two of you.

293
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,356
Is there anything you want?

294
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,892
[ZERO SEVEN]

295
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,829
[ZERO SEVEN]
I want to know something.

296
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:19,465
A devil died 15 years back,
Kenichi Morisawa.

297
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,535
What was the man like?

298
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,003
[CHIZU]
Nanako was...

299
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,638
a well‐behaved child.

300
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:29,610
But, for some time, she hated to
even simply see the word devil.

301
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,612
I don't know when it all
happened...

302
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:33,079
but one day she was
just over it.

303
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,615
[SAWAZAKI]
She was "over it?"

304
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,082
[CHIZU]
She was. All of a sudden she

305
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,685
would bring up the subject all
on her own.

306
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,722
But she did sound quite biased
against them.

307
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,957
I tried to tell her to stop...

[ASAMI]
Cases that are marked I, or

310

"inside," require special
permission.

311
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:59,740
Because they were done on the

312
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,576
Kenichi Morisawa, age 32 at the
time.

313
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,378
Division 5, Section 2, AR Squad.

Zero Seven's mother,

Sayuri Tenjo. Age 33 at the

Worked at Hachioji City Hall.

317
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:15,021
A widow who lived alone
with her daughter Nanako.

318
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,122
They dated for about a year,

319
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,457
and Morisawa eventually

320
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,726
started spending nights at Ms.
Tenjo's home...

321
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:23,163
where he spent more time playing
with her daughter Nanako.

322
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:26,432
Then one night...Morisawa gave
Nanako a hug.

323
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,068
When Sayuri Tenjo saw it,

324
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,937
she pulled out a gun and shot
him. And that's how it began.

325
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,508
[YANAGI]
If she shot him, does that mean
Morisawa had transformed then?

326
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:35,942
[ASAMI]
Most likely.

327
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,078
Her diary had a passage about
him consulting her,

328
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:41,047
concerning his bloodlust and
exactly what that means.

329
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,983
[SAWAZAKI]
Any records about his work
attitude?

330
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,450
[ASAMI]
Yeah.

331
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,087
He was extremely hardworking and
good at his job.

332
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,421
His personality was kind and

333
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:51,191
sociable and he didn't talk much
about himself.

334
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,026
[ANZAI]
Sayuri's bullet missed.

335
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,829
He immediately took the gun from
her and fired.

336
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,097
As she lay dying, he drank her

337
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,265
blood and raped her in front of
Nanako.

338
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,602
So she panicked and stole the
gun away.

339
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:03,303
She fired, "by mistake"they
said,

340
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,305
and shot Morisawa through the
head.

341
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,642
[TSUKASA]
Do you think that maybe Zero
Seven had a crush on Morisawa?

342
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:12,178
[ANZAI]
Huh? Don't you mean that
Morisawa had a thing for her?

343
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,881
[TSUKASA]
Oh! Well it's just a hunch.

344
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,282
But when you're little, you tend

345
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,952
to fall in love with the
grownups you're close to.

346
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,256
[ANZAI]
I don't know if it was a crush
or familial love...

347
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:27,460
But you may be right I think she
did at least...admire him.

348
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,997
[TSUKASA]
That must be sad...

349
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,433
being the one to kill the person
you care about.

350
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,335
I would be devastated.

351
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:40,674
<inhale> Let's go inside. We'll
catch a cold.

[ANZAI]

353
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,277
[ANZAI]
Killing someone I love...

354
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,548
I'm scared to even think about
it.

355
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,085
[ASAMI]
Whether she meant to kill him in
that moment or not...

356
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:55,155
...it wounded her deeply, and
she closed herself off.

357
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,557
Then, after a certain incident,

358
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:59,325
she started coming out against
devils. Why?

359
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,794
[SAWAZAKI]
The man who took her in

360
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,196
was a professor at East Bay
University.

361
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,666
He'd hold study sessions at his
home.

362
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:06,900
[ASAMI]
Did she have a chance to

363
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,569
interact with any of the
students?

364
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,004
[SAWAZAKI]
There was someone who
sparked in her

365
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,206
the justification for killing
devils.

366
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,409
Someone who convinced her it was
right to do so...

367
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,444
and to carry such hatred for
them.

368
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,281
Someone who gave her peace of
mind.

369
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,452

Do you think we should help
them?

[ZERO NINE]
Huh? Well, if we're going on the
run,

372
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,026
then it would put us at a
disadvantage. But...

373
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,494
You do want to stop Kikuhara
from

374

being able to kill any more

you maybe kind of liked him
somewhat.

One day, devils will be driven
out of our society.

Driven out? But where will they
go?

[KIKUHARA]
I don't know.

Maybe they'll just have to find
their own place.

[MORISAWA]
Nanako...

410
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,923
[ZERO SEVEN]
Because falling in love with
Kikuhara...

411
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,293
Made me forget my fear of
Morisawa.

Instead of thinking that she had
killed Morisawa...

Are you a devil?!

00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,302
[SAWAZAKI]
Stop! Police!

461
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,037
[ISHIMARU]
I assume the CCC has

462
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,405
nothing to do with this one?

463
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:07,574
[ZERO SEVEN]
You're probably right about
that.

464
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,777
But it's not like they let us in
on all of their plans.

465
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,779
[ISHIMARU]
Maybe we should go have a look.

[ASAMI]
I'll go!

I'm worried about our officers.

up with them there.

You're a devil; you cause

any problems under these
circumstances...

477
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,763
And you can bet your punishment

478
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:31,732
will be worse than just a house
arrest.

479
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:35,268
If anything happens, whatever
you do, do not get involved.

I can't just leave her okay!

When did I get to be like this?

The more I give chase, the

500

deeper the devils run into the
darkness.

501
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:18,679
I overpower them, arrest them,
and take them away.

The process is ingrained within
me.

Why can't I stop from going
after them?
