Hello there.

This gentleman is a friend of

Yanagi's, he's a doctor of some
sort.

00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,280
Apparently he used to work at a

00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,412
[ZERO SEVEN]
And devils are all that I kill.

Is that what your complex is?

When devils court humans,

40
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,641
they tend to be more self
conscious

41

of how ugly they feel
as a devil.

42
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,780
And they're not comfortable
unless they have a sedative on
hand.

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,283
They subconsciously avoid
communication with non‐devils

44
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,252
and eventually lose faith in
themselves.

If you feel like I am, then
maybe I am.

47
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,295
Was that your girlyfriend
earlier? She's a peach isn't
she?

I guess you think

52
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,670
she's too peachy to let outside,
eh?

67
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,472

I offered him my blood,

68

Look at him, Anzai.

side.

He doesn't worry about being a
devil or a human.

But you must understand he

wasn't born with this type of
outlook.

94

There's only one thing that
allows him to be so
unconcerned...

He has learned how to control
the devil that resides within

158
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,442
[TSUKASA]

159
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,877
[ZERO SEVEN]
This devil issue has been hidden

160
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,547
for years and our mission is to
expose it.

161
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:30,450
To warn all the people...and
eradicate the problem.

162
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,418
[TSUKASA]
Eradicate!?

163
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,987
[JILL]
Hey! Where are you going?

164
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,289
[ANZAI]
I can't sit around
and do nothing!

165
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,391
[JILL]
Devils are all on standby!

166
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,226
Besides, you don't even know
where she is.

167
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,828
You can't just
wander around and hope.

168
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,965
[HANS]
Wait. You talking about the
sniper lady from before?

169
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,933
I don't think she'd do anything
to Tsukasa.

170
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,603
She seemed like she
was a reasonable person.

171
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,104
[JILL]
Yanagi said the same thing.

172
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,940
That she didn't look like she
was going to hurt Skasa.

173
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,743
[ANZAI]
This is the same woman who just
killed five devils!

174
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,278
[HANS]
But that's the thing, isn't it?

175
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:59,780
She only wants to kill devils.

176
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,816
She probably doesn't even think
of it as murder.

177
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,052
It's possible she thinks of it
as a kind of pest control.

178
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,120
[ANZAI]

179
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,589
[HANS]
Look, you are a devil.

180
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,892
If you go, I think you'll only
end up provoking her.

181
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,261
[ZERO SEVEN]
Earlier, you said you liked a
devil.

182
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,731
How can you fall for a monster?

183
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,766
Did you not realize what he was?

184
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,769
[TSUKASA]
I didn't at first. I fell for
him afterwards.

185
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,305
[ZERO SEVEN]
If you knew, how could you fall
for him?

186
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,507
[TSUKASA]
How could I?

187
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,974
You see a difference between

188
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,677
devils and humans, to me they're
the same.

189
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,145
Some can't handle blood.

190
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,346
The only visible difference

191
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,948
is the circles under their eyes.

192
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:39,052
And the devils who drink blood
don't even have those anyway.

193
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,821
[ZERO SEVEN]
You're saying if they drink
blood,

194
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:44,224
the dark circles...aren't
there?

195
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,225
[ZERO SEVEN]

196
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,126
[ZERO NINE]
Zero Seven!

197
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,528
[ZERO SEVEN]

198
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,029
[ZERO NINE]
I'm getting something here.

199
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,832
Looks like Public Security found
the car you abandoned.

200
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,499
And the GPS for both Zero Six

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,435
and Zero Five has just gone
offline.

202
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,739
[ZERO SEVEN]
You were able to turn off our
GPS trackers, right?

203
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,240
[ZERO NINE]

204
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,542
That makes me wonder...

205
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,710
You think this means Zero
Six and Zero Five

206
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,646
have been ordered to go after
us?

207
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,913
[ZERO SEVEN]
Most likely.

208
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,449
Both work in Public Security
Division 5.

209
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,385
So they won't have a lot of
freedom to search.

210
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,520
[TSUKASA]
What?

211
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,755
[ZERO SEVEN]
I told you...

212
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:18,625
remember...You can't trust the
police.

213
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,801
[SAWAZAKI]
F‐Squad. Sawazaki here.

214
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,037
The devils' bar, "Cross" has
been attacked.

215
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,205
Two are dead.

216
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,607
B‐Squad's Sergeant Makimura had

217
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:37,210
been guarding the location, but
is now missing.

218
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,813
[ANZAI]
Are you telling me that Makimura
is the mole?

219
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,983
Dammit. I don't like where this
is going.

220
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,618
Just how many people

221
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,252
are we dealing with here?

222
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,889
[KIKUHARA]
This is where we found the
stolen car.

223
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,925
There are two convenience stores
nearby.

224
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,827
Go and check out their security
footage...

225
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,429
See if you can find any
witnesses.

226
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,998
And I want you to call the cab
companies

227
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,101
to see if anyone picked up any
injured passengers.

228
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,469
[TSUKASA]
You have people working inside
Division 5?

229
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,306
[ZERO SEVEN]
You're a civilian, the less you
know about this the better.

230
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,142
[TSUKASA]
The guy I like is an officer in
Division 5.

231
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,612
He's... he's the man you shot
the other day!

232
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:12,579
[ZERO SEVEN]

233
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,680
[TSUKASA]
I was there!

234
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,281
I was with him when it happened.

235
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,519
[ZERO SEVEN]
So then you were....

236
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,453
You're the one who ran straight
towards him.

237
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,355
[ZERO NINE]
Zero Seven, it's Zero Six.

238
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,259
He attacked a bar in Ikebukuro
and quit the force.

239
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,428
[ZERO SEVEN]
Do not meddle with this any
further.

240

[TSUKASA]
I'm in this pretty deep
already...too late.

[ZERO SEVEN]
Well are you sure your boyfriend

242
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,836
would want you getting involved
in all of this mess?

243
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,171
Police officers are all trained
and armed.

244
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,174
I'm armed as well, and I have a
lot of training.

245
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,143
But you do not!

246

[TSUKASA]

247
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,816
[ZERO SEVEN]
Listen...maybe someday...

248
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,153
there will be something safer,
that you can do to help.

[MALE DETECTIVE C]
Kikuhara sir... we've identified
the taxi!

250
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,460
Looks like it was heading
towards uh...

251
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,228
[KIKUHARA]
I found you.

252
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:05,732
[ZERO NINE]
Are you okay?

253
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,133
[TSUKASA]
I'm always at a loss,

254
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,302
wondering if there's anything I
can do to help.

255
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,939
But I was told to just stay
locked up inside.

256
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,709
I hate that, so I went out
anway.

257
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,246
[ZERO NINE]
When you like someone,

258
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,849
it's natural to want to be
useful to them.

259
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,191
[ANZAI]
Know myself so I'm not paralyzed
with fear, huh?

260
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:31,958
And to do that,

261
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,027
I'll need Tsukasa's help.

262
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,863
But I don't want to put
her in any danger.

263
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,231
That's why I've been trying so

264
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,734
hard to put some distance
between the two of us.

265
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:43,604
That girl. She really isn't the

266
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,072
least bit scared of me, is she?

267
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,710
No...she's never been scared of
me.

268
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,477
She always looks me right in the
eye.

269
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,313
And never hesitates

270
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,881
to do or say anything.

271
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:56,817
That's what I like about her.

272
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,719
She doesn't fear me.

273
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,220
But that's...

274
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,690
exactly why I must never, ever
hurt her.

275
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,426
I have to protect her. And to do
that...

276
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,996
[HANS]
If you're going to rescue her,
I'd like to help.

277
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,767
[ANZAI]
Even though I'm fully aware you
came from ONLO...

278
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,503
In no way does that mean I can
trust you.

279
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:17,804
[HANS]
Ah well, thanks a lot.

280
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:21,241
[ANZAI]
But...I can trust you as a
devil.

281
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,308
[HANS]

282
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,777
[ANZAI]
The more I want to protect her,

283
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,179
the less I feel like I can get
near her.

284
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,716
If I happen to transform while
in front of her,

285
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,185
can I count on you to keep her
safe from me?

286
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,087
[HANS]

287
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,922
[HANS]
So that whole "I want to protect
her"

288
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,592
thing is your excuse to keep
avoiding her?

289
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:43,664
I heard you were from ONLO, so I
thought you'd have some kind of
a backbone to work with.

290
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,099
Y'know Tsukasa is never afraid
to confront you.

291
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,500
But you refuse to talk with her

292
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,470
and you do whatever you can to
stay away from her.

293
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:51,572
Am I right?

294
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:52,906
I bet you haven't even explained

295
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,040
why you won't get near her.

296
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,976
Talk about immature, leaving out

the important stuff like that.

So if you're gonna keep spouting
that wishy‐washy garbage...

299
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,052
Then maybe I'll just take her
off your hands.

[MAKIMURA]
Zero Five? What are Zero Two's
orders?

Got it. Seven, Nine, and the

ago,

but I haven't heard any further
orders.

308
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,050
They must be giving out orders
over private channels.

309
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,053
We should move. This is where we
need to part ways.

Now, I'm going to call the

There's one thing you need to
know.

312
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,962
Watch for someone named Ushio in
Divison 5.

313
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,532
He has wavy hair and a birthmark
on his face.

314
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:53,567
He'll be the first one to show.

315
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,435
His codename is Zero Five.

leave?

Just...a while ago.

I'll go ahead and carry her out,

Uh. No, no I'm okay.

Alright.

332
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,346
Then we'll go together,

nice and slow.

I'll go check on the guys

downstairs. We'll split up, just
in case.

That was Zero Five.

You uh...think she'll be safe?

338
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,958
[ZERO SEVEN]
I don't think he has any reason

339
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,627
why he'd want to hurt her.

340
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,928
We lost our chance to get out.

341

downstairs.

Did your kidnappers say where

they were going? Or what they're
after?

me instead.
