Hey, guys, Akebi's here!

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
Awesome. Morning!

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center

Thanks, you two.

Morning!

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
Look at your red ribbon!

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.856 position:50% align:center
You'll get a bunch
of attention, won'tcha?

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.192 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Huh? That makes me nervous.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
Don't be! Just soak it up.

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:12.364 position:50% align:center
She's right.

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:14.741 position:50% align:center
Though we're gonna be in
gym clothes all day today,

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:17.452 position:50% align:center
so it's hard to say
who'll even get to see it.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:20.163 position:50% align:center
Yeah, not much class
time till the festival!

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.040 position:50% align:center
I'm totally lovin' that, though!

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
Yeah, ditto!

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.251 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.923 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Let's all go out
there and practice hard!

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
[YASUKO]
So, you start by doing this.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.855 position:50% align:center
And you wanna wrap it
around the chair legs

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
several times, see?

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
You mean, like this?

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
[YASUKO]
Mm-hm. Yeah, that's it.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
Then, when you're
finished wrapping,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
you just tie it up in the center

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:29.209 position:50% align:center
with a short length
of tape, like this.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
Next you take it off,
and cut the side ends.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.257 position:50% align:center
Finally, pull the
bundled-up tape pieces

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.009 position:50% align:center
loose with your hands.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.513 position:50% align:center
I did it!

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
They're so cute!

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
That was easier than
I thought it would be.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
[NEKO]
So soft and fluffy.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
[KEI giggles]

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
So cool, Nawashiro!

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
I mean, for the life of me,
I couldn't understand

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
what we were using
this vinyl tape for!

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
I figured cheering would
be more fun with pompoms,

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
so I looked up how to make 'em.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad! Okay!

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
Now, let's get out there
and cheer everybody on!

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
[YASUKO, KEI]
Yeah!

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50% align:center
[NEKO breathing deeply]

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:19.592 position:50% align:center
You're in the tennis club,
right, Shijou?

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
Yeah. What about you?
Have you ever played?

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Our summer house
has a court, so, a little.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
Summer house?

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.310 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Yeah. I was only
playing around for fun, though.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:34.649 position:50% align:center
Listen, don't worry, I'll do
my very best not to trip you up.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:36.109 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
Oh, you won't.

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
It's not like I'm
that good at it, either.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
Well, your tennis outfit
looks super cute.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, thank you.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
[RIONA gasps]

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Mm? Something wrong?

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
[RIONA gasps]
Uh. It's nothing!

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
Crap. I'm sorry.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
Let's take it easy at first
and get a good rally going.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
We can take our time
getting used to

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
the ball going back and forth.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
Just one problem.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
[BADMINTON CLUB MEMBER 10A]
One point!

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI]
Hm...

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
We ain't got near enough people.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
But if no students
show up to practice,

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
shouldn't that help in
the sense that it gives us

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
a higher statistical chance
of winning on game day?

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center
Let's beat 'em
to a pulp, dangit!

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI] I'll show 'em what a
table tennis club member's got!

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center

Is this it?

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center

Over there, I think.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center

Wait, what do you mean?
It was a cheer!

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center

really very together, though.

Huh?

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.038 position:50% align:center
Good question.

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:56.166 position:50% align:center
When I think of it,
I guess what I imagine

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
are the cheerleaders
in American TV shows.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
They hop and jump around
and do big lifts!

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.631 position:50% align:center
Lifts?

So cool!

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center
It means lifting
another cheerleader

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center
over your head.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
Of course! I've done that!

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Stop, stop!

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
You're gonna freak people out
if you open with that stuff.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
You need to start with
some simple choreography!

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.826 position:50% align:center
What kind of choreography?

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.912 position:50% align:center

seen the stand dances

volunteer to do this junk

most basic of the basics?

Oh, yeah.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.149 position:50% align:center
And I need to head
to the dojo later.

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
To the dojo?

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
All right, then!

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
[NEKO panting]

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
So nice and cool.

[sighs]

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center
Good cheering, everyone,

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.363 position:50% align:center
but I think I'm gonna go
watch Hitomi's practice now.

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
See you later.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.914 position:50% align:center
She's so hyped.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Definitely.

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
That was a pretty
tough practice, huh?

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.882 position:50% align:center
[NEKO] I can't move.
I just want a bath.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
[KEI giggles]

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Okay!

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
Akebi?

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shijou, looks like
a court just opened up.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
You ready to get started?

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
Um. Sure!

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.155 position:50% align:center
[RIONA] Until I started
studying for entrance exams

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
two years ago, I had
played hardball tennis

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
all through school.

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
Of course, I'm sure
everyone expects me

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
to do great in the
athletic festival.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
[RIONA] Can skills really
degrade this much

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
in just two years?

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
I spend my club time
picking up balls

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
and doing practice swings,
so I didn't notice.

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:28.558 position:50% align:center
[RIONA sighs]

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.440 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry I keep missing.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:38.068 position:50% align:center
Nah, don't worry about it.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.872 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Here, have some.

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:55.251 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
It's my very favorite black tea.

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
I think it should
help you calm down.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's so nice.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
It's good.

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center

Here it comes!

[ERIKA]
Oh. You took a two-year break?

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
I don't think
you lost your skills.

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:25.532 position:50% align:center
You just grew up, that's all.
Like your height and stuff.

00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're right!
I got a lot taller!

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
And it wasn't just my height!
Other things, too!

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50% align:center
My mom said that
I'm developing well,

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
better than most.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
That's not something
to feel bad about, though.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
She also said that, but...

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Fight on!

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
How was that?

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Sounded good.

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
Look at her.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
Akebi is so slender.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
Ah! Hey, Shijou! Looking good!

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
It's amazing that you can
serve from that high up!

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to send
lots of cheers your way!

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
Must be nice.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:25.759 position:50% align:center
Jeez! Sorry!

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
Shijou, I heard you
say "Must be nice."

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.349 position:50% align:center
You wanted to be on
cheer squad that badly?

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:33.600 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
Huh?

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
Why don't you help out
the squad by filling in

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
for the girls who went
to their other practices?

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
Kizaki!

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center

[RIONA]
What the heck do I do?

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] After that, my club
president said I should do it

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
'cause it would help my
club performance, too!

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
[RIONA] I don't know how
it even came to this.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center

who steered me toward that club.

Okay, let's do this!

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
But, I can't jump in like that!

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.944 position:50% align:center
We'll just do a little.

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
Try not to worry. Tougeguchi
just taught me, too!

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
Make an L! Another L!

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center

on video, Tanigawa?

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:16.411 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
She recorded it?

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.747 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] One of the competitors
wanted to see her performance,

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.457 position:50% align:center
so she asked her to.

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
Thing is, I'm not super
tall like Nawashiro

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center
or anything, so I figured out

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
that I have to reach my arms
and legs out farther

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
if I wanna look
nearly as powerful.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Neko is really good
at moving gracefully, huh?

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] And Tanigawa has
such beautiful legs!

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
So, when she dances,
she always looks amazing!

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
That inspired me.
I need to practice a lot more.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:52.947 position:50% align:center

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
Then, using that as
a base, we all discussed

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
how we could add
more of this or that

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
to it to make it
more interesting.

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
And then, I did a bunch
more dancing with Shijou, too!

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
Komichi, your
explanations are always

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.236 position:50% align:center
so full of weird little details

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.946 position:50% align:center
that I can barely
understand you.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.990 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Wow, seriously?

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:07.202 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess the point is,
I had a ton of fun today!

00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:10.705 position:50% align:center
Oh, "had a ton of fun," huh?

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:13.458 position:50% align:center
Well, then, why don't I give
you a gift that I think might

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:16.961 position:50% align:center
just be the icing on the cake?

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:18.129 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Huh?

00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:21.549 position:50% align:center
Huh?!
