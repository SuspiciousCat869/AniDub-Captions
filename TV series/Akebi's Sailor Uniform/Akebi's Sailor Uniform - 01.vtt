00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.283 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Hey there! Good morning!

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI grunts]

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
[inhales]

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.098 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.692 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] If I can be like
my favorite idol, Miki--

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
cool and successful
and carefree--

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
then hopefully, when I
start at my new school...

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:25.001 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] ...I can make
lots, and lots, and lots...

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.174 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
...of friends!

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.928 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Yes! I did it!

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.435 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Wow, that's cold.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.606 position:50% align:center
[TAIRA] I wondered who
I just saw fall down there.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.649 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Hi, Taira!

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:49.734 position:50% align:center
Should've known
it was you, Komichi.

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:52.070 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I was just, uh,

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:54.239 position:50% align:center
practicing swimming
while fully clothed.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:56.991 position:50% align:center
[TAIRA laughs] Well, c'mon,
I'll give you a lift home.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
Hop in the back.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:03.748 position:50% align:center
[TAIRA] I hear you got into the
middle school you tested for.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.334 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Yeah! Roubai Academy.

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:07.752 position:50% align:center
It's a private school!

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.963 position:50% align:center
[TAIRA]
I heard it's pretty tough, too.

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:11.506 position:50% align:center
Didn't your mother go there?

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:12.590 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Yep.

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm
so happy I got in!

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.678 position:50% align:center
[TAIRA]
Heh. Are ya, now?

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:17.887 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and guess what?

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
Each class has more
than ten students!

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
I can hardly even imagine it!

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.894 position:50% align:center
[TAIRA]
Not like Futaba Elementary, huh?

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.689 position:50% align:center
You were the only kid
in your class.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm happy for you!

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.360 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.535 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Thanks for the lift!

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.794 position:50% align:center
[KAO humming]

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:50.837 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI whispering]
I'm home.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.799 position:50% align:center
Ah! Mom! Big sister's back home!

00:02:56.134 --> 00:03:00.263 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] Hm... Sounds to me like
she might be up to something.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
I'll go investigate!

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:06.936 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Goodness, you're such a tomboy!

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
Wonder where you got that.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.109 position:50% align:center
Your dad sent you a message
to congratulate you.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.319 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.407 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Huh? That's weird.

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
How does he know about
that? He didn't see.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.745 position:50% align:center
[YUWA chuckles]
If you try scrolling up,

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
I think you'll understand.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Huh?

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.544 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.380 position:50% align:center
[whines]

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
My parents take
sneaky pics of me?

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
[KAO, YUWA]
Yay!

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.221 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I can't trust anyone anymore.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrates]

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50% align:center
Hi, Dad, how's it goin'?

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50% align:center
Mm. That's good,
and how is work?

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Mm-hm.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
Maybe so, but I wasn't
sleeping the whole time!

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center
Oh, no?

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I was studying,
I just dozed off!

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
Well, they'd better
take some cuter pictures

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50% align:center
of me next time, that's all.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
I just thought of something,
but it's a secret.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Mm. Mm-hm. Got it.
Talk to you later, then.

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.800 position:50% align:center
What did he say?

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:22.178 position:50% align:center
He's gonna do his best at work
so he can be home by next month.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] Well, kiddo,
are you ready for this thing

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
you've been waiting for?

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
That's right!

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
I chose Roubai Academy
mainly because I've always

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
wanted to wear a
cool sailor uniform!

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I was really nervous
at my exam and in the interview.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
But now, I finally
get to wear one!

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I wonder if it'll even
look right on someone like me.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
[giggling]

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
Stand up straight!
She can't measure you!

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
Uh? So, what do you think?

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Mm...

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
You've gained a little weight.

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50% align:center
Well, you've had to
sit around, studying.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] No! No way!
I'll drop it, I swear!

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
Get yourself changed.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50% align:center
It's time to go!

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
Time to go!

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
You gotta re-measure me later!

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I mean, you're going through

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
all the trouble of
making it for me.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.031 position:50% align:center
I obviously can't
let it go to waste.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50% align:center
Even in her sleep,

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50% align:center
all she's talks about
are sailor uniforms.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
It's crazy.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
Kao!

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.287 position:50% align:center
Nonstop. All night.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Well,
wearing a sailor uniform

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.377 position:50% align:center
has always been your dream.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
Guess I'd better do a
good job on it then, huh?

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] What were the
kids at Roubai Academy

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50% align:center
like when you were there?

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] Some of them were
really interesting.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
There were also lots of
rich, classy kids, too,

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
back when I was there.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.309 position:50% align:center
That's the total
opposite of me, though!

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
Will I be able to talk to them?

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
Well, this was my mantra:

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.899 position:50% align:center
"Time to flip the hierarchy!"
Like a little war.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] The thing is, I'm not
as strong as you are, Mom.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
You just be who
you are, Komichi.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.535 position:50% align:center
All you need?

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
Confidence and a smile.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's find the fabric.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] They have so many
bolts of fabric here!

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] One of these
is gonna be mine.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Here it is!

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
That was quick!

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
This type of fabric
is called "serge."

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
We'll be able to make
the sailor collar, skirt,

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
and cuffs all from this.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
So, this is about to
become my sailor suit!

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
And this one is
called "gabardine."

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
We'll use it for
the body and sleeves.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.197 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, there are
several shades of white.

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
It's just a matter
of preference.

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
I think I prefer that
bolder one on the left!

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
It's all so smooth and shimmery!

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center
I love it!

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.417 position:50% align:center
Isn't fabric shopping fun, Mom?

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.918 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Yikes.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] I think the ribbon
should be on the larger side.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.006 position:50% align:center
It'll look cute.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.632 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
You need help, sister?

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.926 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'm totally fine, thanks.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] It's the stripes that
really make a sailor uniform.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait for me!

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI gasps]
Mom! I like this one!

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI humming]

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.773 position:50% align:center
You've been humming all day.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:20.815 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
It's nice that you're happy,

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
but try to think
about how I feel.

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50% align:center
Oh. You're right.

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center
You had to be patient and wait
the whole time I was studying.

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
[KAO] But, sister,
aren't you a little sad

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
you won't get to go to
school with me anymore?

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Didn't you say you
were excited to go by yourself?

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.303 position:50% align:center
You totally did!

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI laughs]

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.434 position:50% align:center
The truth is it makes
me kinda sad, so...

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Let's see, you'll
be in third grade, huh?

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center
[KAO] Yeah and you'll be
starting your first year again!

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Yep, that's right.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center
Know what?

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50% align:center
I'm just as nervous
as I am happy right now.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I'll
be able to make friends.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
A lot of kids
from Tokyo go there.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:19.624 position:50% align:center
I can't help wondering

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:22.419 position:50% align:center
if I'll be able
to keep up, y'know?

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
[KAO] You don't have
to worry about that.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
Really, you don't,
'cause you're super cool!

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.260 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Well, thank you.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:34.014 position:50% align:center
[KAO] Hey! You don't even
believe me, do you?

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
Believe that!

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
Fine. I'll try to.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
We'll both be on our own.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
Let's do our best.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Komichi! You got a minute?

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
It's finished already?

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Nah. This is known as "tacking."

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
We use a different fabric
to get all the details set

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
before making the real one.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.003 position:50% align:center
I had no idea it was
so much trouble.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.724 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Mom! The laundry's all finished!

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.976 position:50% align:center
And I'm gonna do
the cleaning, too!

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.104 position:50% align:center
Uh, thanks, honey.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.733 position:50% align:center
I'll do the dishes,
don't worry about it!

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.902 position:50% align:center
Mom, I'm almost done!

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mom!

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
[KAO] Sister, careful,
you're wasting water!

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI yelps]

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Komichi. Come on over here.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
Now, with this last snip.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
It's done.

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
Here, try it on.

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
Uh. Okay.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
I'll be waiting downstairs.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:32.817 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
[KAO] Hey, Mom, I think
I like coffee like you do.

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
[YUWA laughs] Don't you think
you're a bit too young?

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
That's silly, it's fine!

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
My sister looks cool!

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center
How is it? Does it fit?

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much!

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
It's different,
but also the same.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
Brings me back.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
I'm just so nervous.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
I wonder if she's new, too.

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
Wait. Blazers?

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:31.918 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Komichi?

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
Is there some other kind of
event going on today?

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
No.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
[PRINCIPAL 1A]
Welcome!

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
Congratulations to you all
on your acceptance.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
As of today, you are
all officially students

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:45.640 position:50% align:center
of Roubai Academy.

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Oh, Komichi!

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Oh, Mom!

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
We're back.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
Sister! Welcome home.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
How'd it go?

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
Sorry, not now.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
What's wrong with her?

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] I didn't think
to confirm the uniform!

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
Please, forgive me.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.207 position:50% align:center
Well, they did
wear sailor uniforms

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
when you were here.
It's quite understandable.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.254 position:50% align:center
Besides, we've known ever since
that first interview

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
with Komichi
that one of her dreams

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
was to wear a sailor uniform.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
Honestly, this is our fault
for not informing her

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
of the change at that time.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:29.976 position:50% align:center
[PRINCIPAL 1A] I understand Yuwa
made it for you, herself?

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
Yes! We picked out
the fabric together.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.856 position:50% align:center
It was fun.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
I remember my mother
making my uniform.

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
And it made me
so incredibly happy.

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
Under the circumstances,
we will make an exception

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50% align:center
and permit Komichi
to wear her sailor uniform.

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
But, Principal--!

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
[PRINCIPAL 1A] It is an accepted
uniform of this school,

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
albeit one from the past.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
We have no reason to forbid it.

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:00.840 position:50% align:center
But I will leave
the final decision

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center
to Komichi and her family.

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
It'll only be me.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
That's just...

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
Your congratulatory
dinner's ready.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
You get two egg yolks.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Did you hear what happened?

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
Mm-hm.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I guess Blazers are cute, too.

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
Ow!

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.045 position:50% align:center
What was that for?

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
So now you hate the sailor
uniform Mom made for you?

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
No! I never said that!

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
And I thought you
were cool! Stupid sister!

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:58.273 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I swear,
it's not like that, though!

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
I love it.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
I don't hate it, but
I don't want everyone

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
to think I'm weird.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
[KAO] Really, you don't,
'cause you're super cool!

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I wanna be seen as "cool."

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
I also wanna be able to make
lots of friends early on.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] If I'm the only
one in a sailor uniform,

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.259 position:50% align:center
I know I'll stand out.

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
But maybe that'll be my chance.

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
Big sister? You're leaving?

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Kao.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:08.885 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Komichi. Are you sure?

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
Confidence, right? And a smile.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
I'm good!

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.183 position:50% align:center
Go get 'em, girl!

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Off I go!

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.868 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI grunts]

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Whoa! Kinda close.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Well, huh.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure about this.

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.221 position:50% align:center
Although...

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
I do think I've
calmed down a little.

00:16:57.058 --> 00:17:00.186 position:50% align:center
Okay! Here I go!

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Cherry blossoms!

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI panting]

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I think I might've gotten

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:36.097 position:50% align:center
a little too fired up.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] It's so big!
It looks like a castle!

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Am I the first one here?

00:17:56.826 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
Okay, so, I'm in
seat number one.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
Class three.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
This is it.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Someone's already here?

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
Oh, gosh. What if
she's really scary?

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
Wow, what a weird outfit!

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center
It is not weird!

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we should
try to get along!

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:31.069 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Why is my first
instinct to fight them?

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA sniffs]

00:18:58.013 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Uh. Just wanted
to say good morning.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi. Good morning.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Please promise to
forget you ever saw that!

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
You saw, didn't you?

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
I mean when I was smelling my
own feet on the nail clippers.

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:21.453 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Is that what she was doing?

00:19:21.536 --> 00:19:22.954 position:50% align:center
I won't tell anyone.

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:25.790 position:50% align:center
But, do your feet
really smell that much?

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
No! Don't ask about it!
I'm embarrassed enough!

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Well, now you've got me curious.

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Hey!

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:35.800 position:50% align:center
I ran here,

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
so I think they might
smell a little sweaty!

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
I can see how you'd
get into it, though!

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You're kind of
interesting, aren't you?

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
No way! I did it, Kao!

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
Someone just called your
sister "interesting!"

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:53.026 position:50% align:center
Hey, would you
mind hanging out

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
and talking with me
a little bit more?

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Oh. So, you're planning
to wear that sailor uniform

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:02.952 position:50% align:center
every day from now on?

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:05.497 position:50% align:center
Wow. That's pretty gutsy.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
You're Erika Kizaki, and
you're here from Tokyo, huh?

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
That's amazing!

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you're taking notes?
You're very diligent, Akebi.

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Uh. Your nail
clippers are really cute.

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.764 position:50% align:center
Do you carry them
around all the time?

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Mm-mm. It's the first time.

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:25.975 position:50% align:center
Back at home, in my room,

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
whenever I get a little
nervous or anxious,

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
I just end up
clipping my nails.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
There's something about that
clicking sound, I dunno.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
It relaxes me somehow.

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
[clippers click]

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Earlier, you were anxious?

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA gasps]

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Mm-hm. I knew that
today would be a big deal,

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center
so, I couldn't sleep.

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] I came early
because I couldn't stand

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
sitting around anymore, but I
just kept getting more nervous.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:05.306 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
It's that funny?

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
No! No, that's not it.

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
I guess I was just surprised
someone as pretty as you

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
would ever get
stressed out like that.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, of course I do!

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.317 position:50% align:center
And my looks have
nothing to do with it!

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:18.153 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know you're right.

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
I guess I was
kinda scared, though.

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
I've never really talked
to someone my own age before.

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
I didn't know what
I'd do if I didn't

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:28.747 position:50% align:center
think the way
everyone else does.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
So now I'm happy!
'Cause I felt the same!

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggle]

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I guess everyone
else will be coming soon.

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
Oh, right!

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
I just sat down
at a random desk.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.722 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Number one. This one's mine.

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] It's the closest spot
to greet everyone coming in.

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:51.770 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
I'm number five.

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:21:56.691 --> 00:22:00.945 position:50% align:center
[clippers clicking]

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I think I've finally
calmed down, at least a little.

00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:08.787 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I'll be okay now.

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:16.461 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Maybe I can do this.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.340 position:50% align:center
Good morning!
