I hope I'll be able to
lead everyone around okay.

Oh, yeah.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center
I guess it's a pretty
big mall, isn't it?

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I'm really
excited, though.

to catch the bus?

Plenty.

[YUWA] Did you check
the weekend schedule?

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI gasps]
Maybe I should check it again!

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:42.959 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Whoa, whoa, hold still.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Right, sorry.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:47.213 position:50% align:center
Wait! I'll go get the schedule!

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.299 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] It's on the shelf
in the living room.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
There, all done.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:00.769 position:50% align:center

[TOMONO]
Sorry.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
That always happens when
I get too absorbed in a book.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.543 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] That's some
amazing concentration.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
I don't know about that.

Mm-hm.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center

embarrassing.

Well then, are we ready
to go get some supplies?

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
I made a list of
the things we'll need.

Vinyl tape for the cheer squad,

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
and some cloth to make
all the class flags,

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
and just a few other little
necessities like that.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
There's a directory
right over there.

guide through this mall today!

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Wow. It's almost
like an amusement park.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
So cool. I've never
actually shopped

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
at a place like this before.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
It has a movie theater, too.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.639 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] I've never been to this
particular mall, either.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
It's super nice!

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
Do you have any favorite stores
you normally go to, Akebi?

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
Definitely!

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center

The grocery store!

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
so they feel really comfy
against your feet.

kind of dressed up for today.

play in that.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center

[TOMONO giggles]

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
I can totally relate, though.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50% align:center
I mean, I have a little brother,

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:30.557 position:50% align:center
so I used to play with him in
places like this all the time.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
Oh, you, too?

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Kao and I always used
to have the best time playing

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
in here when we were waiting
for our mom to finish shopping.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.443 position:50% align:center
Then Mom would buy us ice cream

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.278 position:50% align:center
or <i>taiyaki</i> or
something as a treat,

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:46.281 position:50% align:center
and we'd all eat together.
It was the best.

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.323 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
It sounds like you've got

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.367 position:50% align:center
a lot of nice
memories here, huh?

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:52.037 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Yeah! When my dad
had the day off work,

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
we'd always go play in the river
after all the shopping was done!

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
Sounds fun.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.462 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO gasps] I didn't know they
had a Mocking Bird in this mall!

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I've never been in there.

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:04.883 position:50% align:center
Really? They have all
kinds of cute accessories.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.634 position:50% align:center
Let's go take a look!

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center

about this place than I do!

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
This is the brand that Miki
Fukumoto modeled for!

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
Really? That's awesome!

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:21.733 position:50% align:center
Wow! I can't believe
that they sell these here!

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
And they aren't that expensive.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
I bet these would
look good on you.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
Mm-hm. Yep, I was right!

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Usagihara's amazing!

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.706 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh, look how cute.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Hey, they have
that brand here, too?

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.737 position:50% align:center
Cool, they even have
that store here!

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Ah! Oh, I love that one, too!

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
Shouldn't we be buying supplies?

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.453 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I like going to that
bookstore sometimes, too.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
Oh, you do?

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
I'd be into checking
out the bookstore.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Mm-hm!

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
That book. What a coincidence!

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.115 position:50% align:center
It's just, I actually
finished reading that

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.534 position:50% align:center
on the bus on my way here today.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] I've been curious about
this author's work for a while.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.665 position:50% align:center
You wanna borrow my copy?

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center
You mean that?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO] Sure! I'd be
interested in hearing

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
your thoughts about it
once you finish.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
So, do you do any writing,
yourself, Kojou?

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] The literature club
kinda gave me that impression.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.350 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] That's true.
There were kids in grade school

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
who liked reading and even
wrote books of their own.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Right?

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:25.774 position:50% align:center
Actually, I have been
thinking I might like

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:27.567 position:50% align:center
to try writing one.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.363 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO] I really appreciate
this author's literary style

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
and the choices they make.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
The whole time I was reading it,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
I wished I could express
myself that way, too.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
But then, when I actually
try to start working,

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50% align:center
I can't decide on a
theme to write about.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
A theme, huh?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center
I can see how that
would be hard to nail.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
What kinds of books do you
typically like to read most?

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:56.429 position:50% align:center
Well, let's see. I like essays,
and fantasies, and mysteries.

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
I read stuff from all
kinds of genres, really.

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
But what's your favorite?

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I think
I just like reading,

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:03.853 position:50% align:center
no matter what.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA, TOUKO]
Hm...

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
Uh, enough about me!

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:10.443 position:50% align:center
This isn't something you should
have to think about for my sake.

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
Reading and writing
are two different things.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
I mean, who knows, right?

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'm meant to be a
reader the rest of my life!

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
Pretty.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
Crepuscular rays.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
If I recall correctly,
the phenomenon

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
is also referred to as
a "pipe organ of light."

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center line:10%
[KOMICHI] That's a beautiful
way to describe it.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center line:10%
[TOMONO] It's from a line

[KOMICHI]
Oh.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
I didn't know
there were so many

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
different types of books.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
Some are all nicely
boxed up like these.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
And some are small enough
to fit right in my palm!

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
[giggles] You're right, one of
the most fun things about books

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
is checking out all
the different bindings.

is that bookmark

Huh? Uh, yeah.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
The pressed flowers
were really pretty!

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.844 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
My mom actually made it for me.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO] I've been using it
ever since I was little.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
To me, it's basically like a
good-luck charm at this point.

[TOUKO]
Whew, I'm beat.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
Man, that's my jam.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
We did take a lot of detours.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.409 position:50% align:center
I just haven't been
in a mall for so long.

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the food.

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:50.293 position:50% align:center
This is really a hamburger?

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Is this the first
time you've ever had one?

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
Yeah. And I've always
wanted to try one!

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
You hold it with the
wrapper around to eat it.

What've you got there?

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
Thread for friendship bracelets.

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Friendship bracelets?

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
They're essentially woven charms

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
that you wear around
your wrist for luck.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.617 position:50% align:center
Oh, how cool!

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Yeah. You wear
them when you have

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
something you're wishing for.

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center
And they say, when it
falls off on its own,

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
then it's a sign that your
wish is about to come true.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
Kizaki and I thought
we could maybe

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:33.795 position:50% align:center
use them in the festival

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:36.339 position:50% align:center
to help bring us together
during the competition.

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
Everyone gets a matching
bracelet to wear!

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center

Mm!

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
Oh, jeez. Don't make
it a big deal.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway, that was our idea.

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:10.081 position:50% align:center
Why don't we all work on making
the bracelets together?

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center
Later, at the dorm?

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
I'm so in!

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center

to the dorms before.

the bus is coming.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
Oh, Kizaki.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
Let me give you that book
right now, before I forget.

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
Great, thank you!

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO] It's gone.
My special bookmark is gone.

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
Have any luck?

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
I didn't see it anywhere.

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
That's a bummer.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
Yes. Okay.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
I see. Well, thank you.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
Anything?

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO] No one has
brought in any lost items.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
And the bus is
back at the depot,

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:54.853 position:50% align:center
but they didn't find it there.

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
Then, it has to be
here in the mall.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.733 position:50% align:center
I'll go look around
one more time.

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:02.819 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
Oh, don't worry about it.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
I mean, I really have been
using that thing forever,

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:08.283 position:50% align:center
so maybe it's just time
to get a new one.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
Sorry for dragging
you all into this.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
And anyway, the bus to the dorm

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:13.872 position:50% align:center
should be here pretty
soon, shouldn't it?

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center

Uh. Yeah, it should, but--
