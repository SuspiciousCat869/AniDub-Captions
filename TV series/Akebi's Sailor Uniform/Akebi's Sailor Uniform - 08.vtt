00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.234 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] You placed fifth
in our year, Akebi?

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:34.070 position:50% align:center
The top two are from our class,
which is pretty cool.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center
And Tanigawa?
She scored perfectly.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.074 position:50% align:center
Oh. My. God.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.493 position:50% align:center
I don't even wanna
know where I placed.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.288 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I couldn't
believe it, either.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.873 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
So, is this your first time?

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.208 position:50% align:center
Experiencing exam
rankings, I mean?

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.626 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Yeah, it is!

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.004 position:50% align:center
For our entrance exams,
I felt like I had to study a ton

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:54.758 position:50% align:center
or else I would never pass, so I
made sure to work really hard.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:55.967 position:50% align:center
But now that I think of it,

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.595 position:50% align:center
I never found out
what my rank was.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
Yep. That's so you.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.515 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Hi, everyone.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.310 position:50% align:center
May I have a moment?

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
[AI] Okay. All of you
who didn't score so well

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
on the midterms, there's no
time to waste dwelling on it!

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:21.326 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Here's the thing:
I think you're dwelling on it

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.869 position:50% align:center
more than any of us, Tatsumori.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
[AI] Stop unless you want
a swollen forehead.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
Harsh! Look, when the
top scorer pulls off

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center
a perfect score,
what can you do?

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
Don't feel bad!

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
Wow, could you be any
more condescending?

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Um, can we maybe
get to the point now?

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Today, I'd like us
to decide who will compete

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
in which events at this
month's athletic festival.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
Victory is the goal!

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
[KEI] First, we'll look at the
events each of you requested

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:54.234 position:50% align:center
and discuss what to do about
the ones that got too many.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
And you'd better not
have requested anything

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
just as a big joke!

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center
Keep in mind,
we've got the results

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
of your physical
exams right here.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.327 position:50% align:center
Multiple students can
play the same sport,

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
but each student should
participate in at least one.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
So, the first is...

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Table tennis.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50% align:center
And our two table
tennis participants

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
will be Tougeguchi and Ohkuma.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Next, on badminton,
we have Hiraiwa and Hebimori.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
[AI] For the cheer squad:
Nawashiro, Kamimoku,

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.986 position:50% align:center
Akebi, and...

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Tanigawa. That's our four.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:50.081 position:50% align:center
[KEI] And finally, for the
swimming event, Komichi Akebi.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Minoru Ohkuma.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Ai Tatsumori.

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
[AI laughs]

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
And last, Riri Minakami.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
[AI] Minakami, since you're
in the swimming club,

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
you'll be the anchor.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.226 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Mm?

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Oh, Minakami's
in the swimming club?

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Can I please say one thing?

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Of course. Go ahead.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.822 position:50% align:center
Komichi is actually a
really amazing swimmer.

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Specifically, freestyle,
the anchor's event.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thanks, Erika.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
--[thud]
--[gasps]

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
Are you serious? Why didn't
you tell us sooner?

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Because I just swim for fun!

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
I've never checked
my time or anything.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] If the goal is to win,
shouldn't you decide the order

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
after you've compared
their abilities?

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a good point.
What do you think, Minakami?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Fine by me.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Considering all
the upcoming practices,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center
we should probably
make a decision on that

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
as soon as we can.

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center
There could be a problem.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
I don't think the outdoor
pool's been filled yet.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
Minakami, do you think
we'd be able to borrow

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:07.283 position:50% align:center
the swimming club's pool for
a bit after school tomorrow?

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
I'll ask.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Okay, see you tomorrow, Komichi.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
Yep, see you then!

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:28.430 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Minakami, I look forward
to swimming with you tomorrow.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same here.

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:31.850 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
It's gonna be so cool!

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
The athletic festival, I mean.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
I didn't know middle
schools even had them!

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
So, if I may ask,

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
have you been swimming
for a long time now?

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
You're too polite.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.528 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry.

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.864 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
And call me "Riri."

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Sure. Riri.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.534 position:50% align:center
Swimming is my forte.

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
I even went to the nationals
in elementary school.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
Nationals? Oh, I see.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess I might not
have much of a chance

00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
after all, then, huh?

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Hm...

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
Here's the tea,
I actually came to Roubai

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
'cause I liked the blazer.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.723 position:50% align:center
But, when I saw you
in your sailor uniform,

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
it really got my heart pumpin'!

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:17.562 position:50% align:center
Hey, if I do
beat you tomorrow,

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:20.565 position:50% align:center
you should trade me your
sailor uniform for my blazer.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
And if you happen to win,

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
I'll be happy to do
anything you want.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50% align:center
Wait, hang on!
The school wouldn't let us

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
trade uniforms just
like that, would it?

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] Wouldn't it? I mean,
the principal let you be

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
the only one wearin'
a sailor uniform.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
So why not?

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.041 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
She's right.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.796 position:50% align:center
Well, just think it over, okay?

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
I plan to take this seriously,
even if you don't.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.271 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
What's up?

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:03.566 position:50% align:center
Even if you are confident
in your swimming abilities,

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
you think you should
have made that promise?

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:07.987 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Were you snoopin'?

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
That's a gross hobby.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
Not what I was doing!

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
I forgot something and came
back, so I overheard you!

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:17.122 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] Hm... Okay, we'll
leave it at that, then.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] So, I guess you're,
like, the serious type?

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Havin' a little bet goin' makes

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
the contest more fun,
don't you think?

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I didn't like the way you were

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center
instigating things with her.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
Well, folks can dislike
me if they want.

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
I'm all good.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.604 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
And the way you're so serious?

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.607 position:50% align:center
Actually, I like it.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
[AI gasps]

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
I know! If I win,
there's somethin'

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:52.490 position:50% align:center
I'd like ya to do for me
if you're willin'.

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.668 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Mom!

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.086 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Welcome home.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.212 position:50% align:center
This is important.

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
Do you know where
we put my swimsuit?

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.342 position:50% align:center
Your swimsuit?

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
Didn't you wear it when Erika
came over the other day?

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.556 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] Are pool classes
starting already?

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:27.192 position:50% align:center
Komichi, come here for a second.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
I see.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:34.657 position:50% align:center
She's in swim club and
went to the nationals.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
I guess the size
isn't much different

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
from your spring uniform.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.041 position:50% align:center
Hold on, what's that, Mom?

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Hm?

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:51.466 position:50% align:center
[YUWA chuckles]
Well, It's summer.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
You needed a different uniform.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] But I guess,
if you lose tomorrow,

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
Riri will be wearing it
from now on, won't she?

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
If that happens,
I'll have to alter it.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:08.358 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Mom,
why are you so mean?

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I want to wear this, too. But...

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Okay, arms up.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.625 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Just do your best.

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I will, 'cause I'll
never trade my uniform!

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] Well, you ready
to do this, Komichi?

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:03.496 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA gulps]

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
[AI]
The rules are simple.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
The one who touches the wall
first will be the anchor

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
in the sports festival.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
We only have the pool for
ten minutes, so, let's begin.

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
The 100-meter freestyle,
one heat only.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
So, any guesses?

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.941 position:50% align:center
Whose gonna win it?

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.486 position:50% align:center
It's hard to say.

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
[AI]
On your marks.

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
Set.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] But, I happen
to know for a fact

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
that Komichi can swim fast.

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Who's gonna come up first?

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:58.718 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
It's Riri!

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
Akebi's fast, too, though!

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:04.891 position:50% align:center
Wow, she's catching up!

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
They're at the turn already!

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:16.444 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
The turn widened the gap!

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:38.425 position:50% align:center
Don't let her win, Komichi!

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.387 position:50% align:center
You can do it!

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
The winner: Minakami!

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Oh, no. I lost.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Komichi! You're super-fast!

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
I was full throttle, too!

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I only
barely edged you out!

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:29.434 position:50% align:center
It's just my uniform.

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
Sorry! That was a joke.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.940 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] You're so happy-go-lucky
all the time, y'know?

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:39.027 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to make sure
you'd take this seriously.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] Truth is, I've never
had this much fun swimmin'!

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
So, thanks! I mean it!

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Me, too!

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
That's the first time
I've ever competed

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
so seriously with anyone!

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
I'll work hard to be
a faster swimmer!

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
So, next time, I'll win!

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
We'll kill that festival!

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
I hear ya.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
So, let's win it! You and me.

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
Really well done, both of you.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Tatsumori! Ohkuma!

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
Let's make sure that all
four of us practice a bunch!

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
'Cause we gotta win this thing!

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center
Yeah of course!

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Uh, actually, about that--

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] If I don't manage
to pass my make-up exam,

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:56.312 position:50% align:center
I can't go to my club
or any practices.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.858 position:50% align:center
Our club president's
pretty strict.

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.901 position:50% align:center
--This is--
--[TOUKO] Oh, hey, I know!

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
Just have Tanigawa tutor you!

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
I totally ended up
failing a subject, too.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:10.285 position:50% align:center
Tanigawa is one heck
of a good teacher!

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:12.996 position:50% align:center
Yeah? How interesting.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
I guess you and Komichi are
both smarty-pants, then, huh?

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
Thing is, I've already
asked for help.

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:21.546 position:50% align:center
Wha--

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50% align:center
Komichi said if I
beat her again,

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
she would be willing
to help me study.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
I'm serious about
this one. 'Kay?

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.221 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:31.348 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
That's the real reason why

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.184 position:50% align:center
I'm so determined
to beat Komichi.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
You actually put notes
together for me?

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:37.854 position:50% align:center
I'm so--

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] There it is! One of Ai's
hand-written textbooks!

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Your handwriting's so nice!

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Thank you. This is great!

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
It's... fine. It was
a good review for me.

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
Besides, the team
can't exactly practice

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
if you're not even there, right?

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
Just know, you will have
to pass this in one try!

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
Whoa, she's a really
tough teacher.

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
Ai! What about me?
I want you to teach me, too!

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
[AI] You're getting some help
from Tanigawa, aren't you?

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:10.595 position:50% align:center
But if I have
both of you helping,

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
that's twice the horsepower.

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.598 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Me, too! Me, too!

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Do you even need help?

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.267 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
[YUWA sighs]
The days are getting longer now.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
It finally feels like summer.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:57.100 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
All done.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.020 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI, KAO gasp]

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:04.357 position:50% align:center
It's so light! And it
still feels so warm!

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
[laughs] And the
jacket is adorable!

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] The navy blue
fabric is summer wool.

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
And the white parts are
polyester broadcloth.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.326 position:50% align:center
Both of which are lighter
and more wrinkle-resistant

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center
than your other uniforms.

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:18.621 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Wow.

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center
I made it all nice and purdy,
so don't get too crazy

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
and mess it up because you
love summer too much.

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
Not a single speck of dirt!

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] And wipe your
sweat off frequently.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.052 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] I know that's never
gonna happen, though.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
Hey, isn't it time
for you to go?

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Hm?

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.485 position:50% align:center
Komichi!

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
You'd better hurry up and
change before your dad leaves.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Huh?

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:36.783 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Mom! Can you come here a sec?

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Coming.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
I can't wait.
How 'bout you, Dad?

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I guess.

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
You know, when her first
sailor uniform was finished,

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
she didn't wanna try it on for
a while 'cause she wanted you

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
to be the first one
to see her wearing it.

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
Huh. Really?

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
Did you get the hook?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Huh?

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:01.808 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] Since you tend
to move around so much.

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
What? Could it be
you're still nervous?

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
Aren't you used to this now?

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:12.110 position:50% align:center
It's just a totally
different level of cuteness!

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
The chest is so much more open,
and the ribbon's so cute!

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm not sure
I should even be wearing it!

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.910 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're fine. Go ahead.

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Thanks again, Mom!

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
You're very welcome.

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.304 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Hey, Dad.

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.064 position:50% align:center
Whatcha' think?

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
Looks good!

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:55.070 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
Sister, come on, do a spin!

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
Just like Miki!

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine!

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Oh, right.

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
Your dad brought us a snack,
so let's eat it later.

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.268 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is it?

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:51.853 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Cake.

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.938 position:50% align:center
I told him how much you two
loved it the last time

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:56.358 position:50% align:center
and he stopped by the store
just to get some for you.

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:16.586 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Hey, Mom!

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.130 position:50% align:center
The bath's not full yet!

00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:22.300 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Really? Well, it'll be soon.

00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:24.552 position:50% align:center
Just start getting ready anyway.

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:26.262 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Okay.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.143 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:36.314 position:50% align:center
[chiming]

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:47.575 position:50% align:center
Kao, let's take our bath.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.330 position:50% align:center
Sister, look.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:23:00.213 position:50% align:center
[KAO] I... I don't think I look
half as cool in this as you do.

00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:06.803 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Listen, once you
get a little bit bigger,

00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:10.682 position:50% align:center
I think it'll look great on you.

00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:12.559 position:50% align:center
You mean it?

00:23:12.642 --> 00:23:15.812 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Yep. So, for now...

00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:27.824 position:50% align:center
There, you're all set.

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:31.661 position:50% align:center
See?

00:23:31.745 --> 00:23:34.330 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
