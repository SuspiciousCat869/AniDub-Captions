00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.151 position:50% align:center
There was always a big line.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.111 position:50% align:center
You'd have to wait
like a whole hour.

Ya made it!

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Good morning.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
It's pretty unusual for you

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:46.004 position:50% align:center
to just barely get here in time.

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:47.339 position:50% align:center
Hey, take a deep breath.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center

running late, too.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.968 position:50% align:center

Yeah, that's me.

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
You're dancing at the
after-party? For real?

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:01.186 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Oh. Yeah, for the drama club.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
I thought about joining
that, but I didn't.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.733 position:50% align:center
I'll come watch you for sure!
Can't wait to see it!

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center

I'll be there, too!

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.903 position:50% align:center
Thanks, you guys!

That's pretty cool, Komichi.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.657 position:50% align:center
Tell us what song
you're gonna dance to.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.743 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I've actually
already started practicing.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.496 position:50% align:center
I was doing that this
morning before I came here.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.665 position:50% align:center

you were running late.

I really shouldn't butt in.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Hey, Kizaki, you
play piano, too, don't you?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Huh?

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.006 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] I heard you playing
the one in the music room

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
when I was cleaning
a little earlier.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:03:00.013 position:50% align:center
Plus, there's even a piano
in your room, isn't there?

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:01.848 position:50% align:center
You know what you
totes you should do?

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.184 position:50% align:center
You should play for Akebi
to dance to at the party!

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.935 position:50% align:center
Everyone would be
obsessed with that!

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] You know, I have
a CD of the song by Miki

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
that Akebi's planning
to dance to.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.777 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Huh?!

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] It's a really cool song
with a piano accompaniment!

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
What?

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.366 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Yeah, so--

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm just sort of
wishing out loud here!

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.414 position:50% align:center
Please don't be upset, okay?
Just forget I said that stuff!

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, when I saw Ai in
the entryway today, she was--

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
Wait, I'm not mad!

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50% align:center
It's just that I'm a little
surprised, that's all.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Really? What a relief!

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.891 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, I made some snacks.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
You want some?

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
Sure, just one.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center

[ERIKA] I can't say whether
everyone would love it,

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:23.972 position:50% align:center
but I do play.
Piano, a little bit.

You two really are
pretty close, huh?

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.726 position:50% align:center
You have to keep
the ball in the air

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.769 position:50% align:center
or it doesn't matter.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center

working at all!

are so important, yet...

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.864 position:50% align:center
I know, they're worth
a lot of points,

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
and volleyball is the last
event of the whole festival.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.161 position:50% align:center
There'll be a lot
of people there.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.954 position:50% align:center
What do we do?

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center
Well, we could get all
six of us together

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center
for a training camp
on a day off.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
And everyone would be there?

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.881 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's a team event.
We need all six of us.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI gasps]
That makes sense!

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.219 position:50% align:center
I was only thinking about how
I should practice, myself.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center

place to practice, though.

Oh, right.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.727 position:50% align:center

a gym that we could use

Good evening, Mrs. Mako.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
This is Akebi Komichi.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
Oh, gosh, Komichi!
It's been too long!

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it really has.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.579 position:50% align:center
Are you available
to talk at the moment?

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
[MAKO]
Absolutely!

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
There's no need to be
so polite, you know!

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
Tell me, how is Roubai Academy?

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
I'm having an amazing time!

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
We're coming up on our
athletic festival soon.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:50.845 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, that sounds very fun.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:53.682 position:50% align:center
Actually, that's why
I'm calling you.

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
[MAKO] Ah! You want to
bring your classmates

00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
up to Futaba Elementary
to practice?

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
Well, yes! Of course,
you can use the gym.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thanks so much!

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
[MAKO]
I'm so happy.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Huh?

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
[MAKO]
You were always talking about

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50% align:center
how you wanted
friends, remember?

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
For six whole years,

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
I watched you grow into your own
without any other classmates.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
I always used to tell you
that I was sure you'd make

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
lots of friends someday,
but there was nothing more

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
I could do for you,

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:33.555 position:50% align:center
and that, it just...
broke my heart.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
[MAKO] I'm just so glad.
You really did go make friends.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
[MAKO]
That alone. It's the best.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
It makes me so happy.

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center

I appreciate it.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
How did it go?

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:08.882 position:50% align:center
Well, she said... we're
allowed to use their gym.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Oh, well.
That's fine, you can't help it.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
[YASUKO]
Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
So lame. I just don't get it.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:32.072 position:50% align:center
Why is our club
meeting on a Sunday?

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
Right? Am I right?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.700 position:50% align:center
[HITOMI]
Well, Roubai's volleyball club

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:39.329 position:50% align:center
is the most accomplished
of all the clubs.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
What're you working on?

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center
An application.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
Anyway, Akebi and
the other girls

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center
sure are motivated, huh?

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
It's just a dumb festival.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
Aw, come on, you shouldn't
call it "dumb."

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.262 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be in the
cheer squad, you know.

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
Right alongside Akebi.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.557 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.686 position:50% align:center
[YASUKO gasps]

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
So, those two can't make it.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.403 position:50% align:center
Fine!

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Oh. Uh-huh.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
Komichi's elementary
school on Sunday?

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
Sounds like fun.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:40.515 position:50% align:center
Sure, that works fine.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Great, thanks!

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
What? You'll bring fruit?

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
[laughs] That's awesome!

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, I don't have
time to sit here celebrating!

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
I've gotta get better
at volleyball!

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.540 position:50% align:center
Hey, I wanna go, too.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:09.127 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I have to work super
hard on my volleyball skills.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
I'm not just going
to play around.

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
Me neither! I'm also practicing!

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
Let me come.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
It's boring playing in the
gym by myself all the time.

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I said "playing."

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
[RIONA whines]

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
She's just so squishy!

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] I didn't know
you were a big sister.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
So smooth. So squishy.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Hey, guys!

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Usagihara!

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
Good morning!

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.295 position:50% align:center
Morning.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Nawashiro and Washio
had to go to their club.

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
They'll come later.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
[YASUKO] Whew. I'm so glad
we got here in time!

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Huh? Wait, how?

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
You're big!

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:18.530 position:50% align:center
[KAO squeals]

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
[HITOMI] What is this?
A little gremlin thing?

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap! The bus
is almost here!

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Okay, so,
what the heck happened?

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
Oh, that. Right after you
went back to your room...

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
You went to all that trouble?

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
You're totally just ditchin'.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
She just told them it was
for volleyball practice.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
It wasn't a lie. Of course
the captain approved.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
Are we asking too much?

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
You're weird. Why that face?

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
You should be happy that all six
of us are together to practice.

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.950 position:50% align:center
Wanna win, right?

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
[gasps] 'Course.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
And you said we're
going to win, right?

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.540 position:50% align:center
Did I say that?

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
What? Riri?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Yeah, I did.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.378 position:50% align:center
You're so gullible, Komichi.

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Hey, now! That was mean!

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
[YASUKO]
That was kind of the best!

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS laughing]

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
[RIONA] It looks like
a pretty old building.

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Like something
you'd see in a movie.

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
Okay. Everyone wait here

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
and I'll go get the key
from the teacher.

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kao, you should
show the way.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center
It's this way!

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Mrs. Mako.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.240 position:50% align:center
Komichi!

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.537 position:50% align:center
[MAKO]
Here you go.

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
The net and the balls
are being stored

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
in the equipment room.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
Think you can find it?

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
I think between all
of us, we'll be okay!

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
Good. How many friends
did you bring along?

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.051 position:50% align:center
I brought five.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.845 position:50% align:center
And Kao, of course.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:08.765 position:50% align:center
[MAKO chuckles]
Well, good luck to you.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
I'll be by to peek in on
you all a little bit later.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:15.605 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Great!

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
[HITOMI]
All right, let's get started.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.199 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO, KOMICHI]
Nice one!

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
One more!

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
Komichi seems to have
gotten a lot better.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center
She really has.

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
She's better than I am now.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a good thing!

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.489 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
One more, please! Is that cool?

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
Are you enjoying it that much?

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Yeah. I guess,
I'm just so happy.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.834 position:50% align:center
See, it always used
to be just me and Kao

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
in this gym, but now I've got
so many of my classmates

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:25.133 position:50% align:center
here with me, and we all
get to practice together.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.597 position:50% align:center
I hope you're good
outside of here.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
The main event's still ahead.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
That's right, but I'm starting
to enjoy it now, too.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:40.190 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Mm-hm. I haven't been
letting the ball drop as much!

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50% align:center
[HITOMI]
Last run before our break!

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.823 position:50% align:center
Akebi! Go for the attack!

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Break time!

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
I'm burnin' up!

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
No! What're you doing, Minakami?

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
This isn't the place
to take off your clothes!

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.131 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Huh?

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center
[RIONA screams]
Stop! I don't wanna! Wait, wait!

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] You're all sweaty, too.
C'mon, show me whatcha got.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
I'll change in the locker room
like a normal person!

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Kao, we've got an
undresser on our hands!

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
Pin her down!

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:23.817 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
Roger that!

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
Let's take her shorts off, too!

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
--[RIRI] Huh?
--[TOUKO] Now, now, hold still!

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Wait, seriously, don't!

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
So weird.

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
Wha...? You, too, Akebi?

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
You all ready to get to work?

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Akebi.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
Tell me where to
find the restroom.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
This one is out of order.
I'll go, too. Follow me, 'kay?

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.238 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
This school really is old, huh?

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
It is, and it's gonna
be closed down

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
once Kao graduates.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.129 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
That's why I'm so happy.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
'Cause now, my memories here

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
will include you guys.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I was terrified
to use the restroom

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:39.476 position:50% align:center
all the way up
until third grade.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.603 position:50% align:center
I always asked the teacher
to wait by the door for me

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.772 position:50% align:center
till I was done.

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center
So now, I wish that I could
tell my younger self,

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
"I'm here, washing my hands
happily, alongside a friend."

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:55.617 position:50% align:center
Aw, Akebi.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Well, maybe I'll
go peek in on them.

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
[YASUKO]
Remember to stretch.

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:18.515 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] What should we
do about the rotation?

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
[RIONA]
Let's use rock-paper-scissors

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.142 position:50% align:center
to pick teams for now.

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Oh, Mrs. Mako!

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
[MAKO]
Komichi. So many friends.

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Hm?

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Come on, Kamimoku!

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.698 position:50% align:center
You know you can't sleep here!

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Oh! They're made it!

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.578 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] When I heard
Nawashiro and Washio

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
wouldn't be able to make it,
I went ahead and put out a call

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:45.250 position:50% align:center
to everyone in class.

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
Look, sister!
Lots of people are here!

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
Usagihara!

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.616 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it's too hot.

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I really, actually get
to practice with everyone.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.012 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Sorry, though.
Kizaki was the only one

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
who couldn't come because she
had to practice something else.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] But it's still
for the athletic festival,

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:49.689 position:50% align:center
so try to go easy on her.

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA sighs]
I messed up again.

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] The tempo's so quick,
it's hard to play.

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
That's okay.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
Some things you need
to be alone to practice.

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
I totally understand!

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:18.968 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
I know Komichi will be great.

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:41.551 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Sharing this
time--it's the best.

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Here I go!

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:55.315 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
Hey, sister, today was fun, huh?

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
It sure was.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.360 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
Will you guys win
at the festival?

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:05.658 position:50% align:center
Yeah. If we're together...

00:22:08.203 --> 00:22:09.788 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
...we'll win for sure!
