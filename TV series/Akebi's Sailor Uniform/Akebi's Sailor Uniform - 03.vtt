I sort of have an idea, but...

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
I think we're gonna have
to decide pretty soon.

[AYUMI] Wow, you've been
playing basketball

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center
since grade school, Togano?

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center
Yeah. What about you?
Do you play?

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.788 position:50% align:center
It's always been
table tennis for me.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
I was all about
our volleyball club.

[TOUKO] Jeez, I can't
believe you did that.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Yeah, the teacher
actually kinda chewed me out

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.982 position:50% align:center
over how I could've hurt myself.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] And you had to pick up
rocks as punishment?

[KOMICHI laughs]

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.987 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO] You did have the
fastest time out of anyone

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:17.530 position:50% align:center
in the whole class, though!

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
I bet it was even faster than
most boys could've done it.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Really?

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center

Oh! I, um...

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
Who're those girls?

00:03:58.154 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
I think they're upperclassmen.

We heard she's the only one

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center

Akebi, get down!

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
You gotta hide!

Hey, that's her!

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 3A] We saw you
running out there last period.

Or are we too late?

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center

Excuse me, ladies.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
[KEI] I'm really sorry,
but we need to prepare

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
for our next class.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
Do you think you could
maybe try and recruit

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
new members some other time?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center

Sure, please forgive us
for barging in!

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center

Anyway, come check out our clubs

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.976 position:50% align:center

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Thanks!

Hey! No running in
the halls, ladies!

[AYUMI] The equestrian club
actually has horses.

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
I checked.

Can I help you? Akebi?

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
I don't know if you know this,
but you have nice legs!

Huh?!

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
Your skin looks so smooth,
like porcelain!

during PE earlier!

What're you...?

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Do you mind
if I lift your skirt?

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:56.022 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
Seriously, why are you
even asking me that?

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
It's just, Usagihara
is running a contest

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.699 position:50% align:center
to see who has the prettiest
legs out of everyone.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
Would you like to join in?

The teacher won't
like that, you know.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center
You'll get your uniforms dirty.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.331 position:50% align:center
I'll pass.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50% align:center
By the way, Akebi,
have you decided

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
which club you're
going to join yet?

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center
I'm actually still deciding.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
They all seem
interesting, though.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
So, thanks for what
you did before!

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
I really didn't do anything that
deserves any kind of thanks.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Club applications need
to be submitted this week.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
So don't be late.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I won't!

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Our class
president is so serious.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.193 position:50% align:center
She gives off this vibe of
a controlled, classic beauty.

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
Right?

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
She looked so cool setting those
older girls straight earlier.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Hm... I feel like
she could stand to have

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.119 position:50% align:center
a little more fun
in her life, though.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
It's kinda like she's Miss Rules
and Regulations in the flesh.

I can hear you.

care of this, please?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
I'm not trying to be

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:10.180 position:50% align:center
particularly serious
or anything.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
It's just, I don't
think anything

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.644 position:50% align:center
is worth getting in trouble
with the teachers over.

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:21.149 position:50% align:center
Great, Tanigawa.
You're always so prepared.

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:22.776 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.033 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 3B] Okay, who knows
the solution to this one?

Akebi is already so popular

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50% align:center
with the rest of the class.

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
She's friendly and super cute.

See ya!

[KOMICHI]
Ah! Tanigawa!

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Oddly enough,
she talks to me a lot.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
Heading home now?

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:23.253 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Mm... Yeah, I noticed you
were busy dancing before.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.381 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Mm-hm! Miki
Fukumoto's solo debut song!

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.800 position:50% align:center
It's so good,
I can't stop listening!

[KOMICHI]
What do you think?

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
[KEI] She's so close, I'm not
really hearing much of it.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
[KEI] I'm kind of amazed
you knew the dance to this.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.792 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Huh? Really?

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
I've watched the music video
over and over again to practice!

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.882 position:50% align:center
Some music shows, too!

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
I always try to guess
what she's thinking

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.177 position:50% align:center
when the look
on her face changes,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.928 position:50% align:center
like it does right here.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.599 position:50% align:center
You have a very
inquisitive mind.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center

Uh, thanks.

No problem!

What about you?

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center

I wanna know a lot
more about you!

[KEI] Oh, I guess there's
nothing I particularly like.

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
Well, have you decided on
what club you wanna join?

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.040 position:50% align:center
Not yet. I can't decide.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.500 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I know, right?

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.085 position:50% align:center
There are just too many
to choose from!

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
I don't see how I could

[KOMICHI] Tanigawa,
your legs really are pretty!

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.139 position:50% align:center
Not that again.

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
Show me! I really
wanna see them!

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
No, thanks.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.020 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.939 position:50% align:center
Because it's super embarrassing!

[KOMICHI]
Aw... Ah! I know!

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
You can take a picture
and send it to me!

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
How about that?

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.946 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
That's even more embarrassing!

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
And it would be saved
in my history!

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.866 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
So, that's a no.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
Well, okay then, but I'll
go ahead and give you

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
my contact info for now!

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:23.123 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'll give you mine, too.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:25.834 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center

all the time!

[KEI] She does things so easily
that I've always wanted to,

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
but couldn't.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center

I love it.

I'm home.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
Mom?

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.411 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's shopping.
I guess it's just me.

[KEI sighs]

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center

[KEI]
Ah! I did it! Oh! So risqué!

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
But it's not lewd
or anything, right?

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
I'm just taking
a picture of myself!

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
Nothing gross about it!

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
And yet, my heart's pounding.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
It's like I'm seeing a version
of myself I don't know.

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
It's kind of fun.

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.646 position:50% align:center
So, I might as well...

I think... I might be a pervert.

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
There's no way I could
possibly send any of these!

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center

Why haven't you changed
out of your uniform?

Why, why, why?

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
Oh no, oh no, oh no,
oh no, no, no!

Hm...

[KEI cries]

00:12:56.943 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
Oh, honey. Why are you crying?

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
Mom, it's just--

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
This is the most embarrassing
thing that could ever happen!

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center

All right.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
[KEI'S MOTHER]
Hm?

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, I'm so embarrassed.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 3D] That book is
really moving, isn't it?

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
It is.

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 3E] Hey, Tomono,
do you prefer to read or write?

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
Well, um, I do think
I'd like to try writing.

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:18.400 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 3E] Ah! There's the
literature club recruiter!

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
What are you planning to do?

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:21.528 position:50% align:center
I knew from the beginning

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:24.155 position:50% align:center
that I wanted to join
the literature club.

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Hm. I need some more
time to think about it.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
Akebi?

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI gasps]
You've already decided

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
which club you're joining?

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:41.089 position:50% align:center
I envy you.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
I keep waffling back and
forth between them all.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should just join
the literature club, too.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
No, you shouldn't
decide that way!

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:51.474 position:50% align:center
If you really have that
many things you wanna do,

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
then you wanna make sure
and pick the right one.

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Yeah, I guess.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
You should get a good look
at all of them first.

00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center
I'll go with you.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:01.693 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Thanks!

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
I never realized a school

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
could have this many clubs.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Yeah, I couldn't
believe it, either.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
So much for deciding,
since that just showed me

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.395 position:50% align:center
even more things I want to try!

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:45.070 position:50% align:center
Ah! Well, I'm sorry
I wasn't much help.

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
What? Why do you say that?
I had so much fun!

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.285 position:50% align:center
I guess I just need to go home

00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:54.371 position:50% align:center
and try my best to really
think it through.

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much for
doing this with me!

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.712 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
I seriously hope you find a club
that's just perfect for you.

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:24.067 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO, KOMICHI panting]

[TOMONO] Mm-mm. I'm more
worried about you.

00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:37.247 position:50% align:center
Aren't you cold
in those thin clothes?

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
Nah. I'm--

[sneezes]

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
Take those wet things off.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
This is a little embarrassing.

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.464 position:50% align:center
It's so warm.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO giggles] You look a
little more grown-up in that.

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's just--

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO] It's the novel
I'm going to read from

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
at the club's next meeting.

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
You're doing a reading, huh?
That sounds fun!

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:51.154 position:50% align:center
Hardly. It'll be my first time.

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
I can't read in front
of other people.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
C'mon, you're gonna be great!

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO]
Have you ever done it before?

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:03.208 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Mm-hm. Although, it
was only for my little sister.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
You know what my
favorite thing is?

The back of Kao's head while
she looks at the book.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
I'd like to hear it, too.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
The way your sister does.

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Sure!

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
