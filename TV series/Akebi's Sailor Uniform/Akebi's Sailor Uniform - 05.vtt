00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center
It's a sandwich!
That looks good!

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
[RIONA] Uh... I, It's just, uh,
I, missed breakfast today

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
because I overslept, so my
mom wrapped this up for me.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
Um, what're you doing?

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
I-I'm so sorry!

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
This isn't going
very well, is it?

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
I don't know, I've still
been able to gather

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:07.560 position:50% align:center
some very interesting data, so,
I think it all worked out.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
Wow, you're really good
at drawing, Minoru!

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
I guess I just kind of
naturally picked it up

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
since I've been keeping
a research notebook

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:22.367 position:50% align:center
every day for a while.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.953 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I'm so impressed!

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:28.540 position:50% align:center
What about you? Are you
finished drawing it yet?

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.294 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.380 position:50% align:center
Drawing something in a
simplified manner like this

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:36.423 position:50% align:center
can actually enhance

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center
the subject's unique
characteristics.

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
Another good call.

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
That feels nice.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
[MINORU]
Yes, it's a lovely breeze.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
We're lucky to have a chance to
observe in this kind of setting,

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center
considering we're usually stuck
at our desks during class time.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.367 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50% align:center
You can get a better look
at people's hobbies,

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:08.997 position:50% align:center
preferences, and
natural behaviors.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.043 position:50% align:center
For example, let's see
now... Look there.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.006 position:50% align:center
[MINORU]
Mai Togano.

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
[MINORU] The fact that she can
draw so many different species

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
of birds so distinctly tells me
she must be very fond of birds.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Wow, you're right.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
I hope I can manage
a chat with her sometime.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
[MINORU]
Riri Minakami.

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
Do you think she's
done drawing, too?

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
No, not yet.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
Probably looking for a subject.

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
See the way she patiently
searches for prey?

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.992 position:50% align:center
She's like a black leopard:
master of the hunt.

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.496 position:50% align:center
You're right!

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.498 position:50% align:center
Or, maybe it's just
that she's not so much

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
into big crowds of people,
the same as me.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.744 position:50% align:center
You've spent lots of time
watching everyone, haven't you?

00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:33.164 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Well, I wouldn't
say everyone.

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
Like, there's one thing
that interests me the most.

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what's that?

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well, I don't know.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
Komichi! Wondered
where you were.

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
Minoru, I totally didn't know
you could draw like that!

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Isn't she great?

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you captured

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
all those little
details really well.

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:01.359 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Wow, look at you,
you're red as an apple.

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
[GROUP giggles]

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
--[KOMICHI] An apple?
--[ERIKA] You're right!

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO, ERIKA, KOMICHI]
How cute!

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
[MINORU] Hey, Komichi,
did something feel kind of

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
strange to you
just a moment ago?

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
Strange how?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
As if someone was watching us.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:28.553 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
So yeah, that happened,

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
and I totally
laughed my butt off.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Did you really?

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
[MINORU]
I knew it.

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
The one watching was
my roommate, Tougeguchi.

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
[MINORU] I had no idea there was
someone else out there like me.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
See you tomorrow.

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center
Yeah, see ya.

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
[MINORU]
But, why would she?

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.461 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI sighs]

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
Well, today was another bust.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
I just never get the chance.

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.560 position:50% align:center
I mean, you'd think
an elite all-girls school

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center
in the country would be full
o' girls who ain't very popular.

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:23.441 position:50% align:center
But no, they're all so pretty,
and on top of that,

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:26.653 position:50% align:center
they're always with
their brilliant buddies.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
And here I thought I was the
only one on Komichi's side!

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.866 position:50% align:center
Dang it, Komichi!

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
You're nothing but a traitor!

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:43.003 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Man, nothing in the
world makes me feel better

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
than a really good scream!

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI gasps]

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.426 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI]
Komichi? And--And Minoru?

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
Wait, this is not
what it looks like!

00:16:58.226 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
I wasn't saying anything
about you, Komichi.

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
I mean, uh...

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:03.648 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI whimpering]

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.343 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI]
Why's a pretty girl like her

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
hafta take the test
for this school?

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
It's gonna kill my
middle school debut.

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.102 position:50% align:center
What am I gonna
do if this anxiety

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
doesn't get better
before the exam?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI gasps]

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.818 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI]
Great, I forgot my handkerchief.

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
I'm doomed.

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Here. Use this.

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
Thanks, you're so nice.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Why are you using
such a remote restroom?

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
Well, you are, too.

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center
Oh, I've just always
felt kinda uneasy

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.389 position:50% align:center
in crowded places.

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
There is a god. A kind one.

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI]
"Komichi... Akebi."

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 5A] The exam
will begin very shortly.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
--Students, please report...
--[KOMICHI] Sorry, I gotta run!

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:31.986 position:50% align:center
Hey, hang on!

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.281 position:50% align:center
Wait! What should
I do with this?

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:37.367 position:50% align:center
Keep it till I see you again!

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
Again? What does she mean?
That we'll meet again?

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
This is just the
entrance exam venue.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
There's no guarantee
that we'll--

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:52.257 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
Was she telling me
I have to pass?

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:59.556 position:50% align:center
I lent you this hanky!
Before the exam!

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'm so sorry!

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
I've been wanting to
return it all this time.

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Amazing!

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
So that girl at
the exam was you!

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
All this time, I've been
wondering who it was!

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy we got into
this school together!

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50% align:center
I guess I didn't
recognize you right away

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:25.206 position:50% align:center
in the uniform because it
makes you look so different.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI] To be honest,
I never thought the girl

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
in the silly PJs would
show up in a sailor uniform

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
on the first day, either.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:43.850 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI] Still, I'm convinced
that it's only because

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
I met Komichi and
realized someone else

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:47.228 position:50% align:center
was as nervous as me

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
that I was able to stick
it out at the exam.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
What should we do now, Minoru?

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center
The subject caught us again!

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
At this point, you might
as well call it talent.

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.788 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm gonna go now.

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Mm-hm.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:11.586 position:50% align:center
Uh, Komichi Akebi, I'm--

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
I'm, um...

00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
[AYUMI]
I'm glad to know ya!

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
Same to you, my friend!

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
It's funny.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
I guess Tougeguchi was
looking for the right moment

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center
to talk to you all along, too.

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
Aw... I just wish she would have
said something to me sooner!

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
[MINORU] There were some
blunders and accidents

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
along the way, but overall,
I guess we can say

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:58.883 position:50% align:center
our observation
mission was a success.

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.969 position:50% align:center
I was pretty excited to
explore a bit and learn

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:03.888 position:50% align:center
a bunch of new things about
our fellow classmates!

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
So, thank you.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
[MINORU] I never thought I'd
have a chance to talk to you

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:11.604 position:50% align:center
this way, so, needless to say,
getting to do some observing

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
with you has been a
great experience for me.

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
[MINORU] So, I--I really
wanna thank you, too.

You know, the truth is,

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
I always wanted to try to find

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
an opportunity to
talk with you, too.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:31.875 position:50% align:center
I've been curious about you.

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:35.295 position:50% align:center
I've wondered why you
secretly watched me.

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
Huh?! No way!

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.548 position:50% align:center
You knew about that?

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:41.259 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] But then, today, I was
able to learn so many new things

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
I couldn't have known about you.

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
You're knowledgable about living
things, and you can draw.

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.603 position:50% align:center
There's still so much
about you I don't know,

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
so I hope you'll teach me
lots more from now on.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:10.497 position:50% align:center
Well, then, next time,
wanna observe insects together?

--Yay! It'll be so fun!
