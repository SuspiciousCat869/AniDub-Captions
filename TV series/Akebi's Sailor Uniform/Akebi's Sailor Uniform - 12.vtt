Huh? Oh, Usagihara.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.868 position:50% align:center
This year we have
a special performance

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.412 position:50% align:center
by just one first-year member!

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50% align:center

And that first-year is the girl

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
who's been the talk
of the whole school.

Yeah.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
She'll always say "hi" if she
meets your eye in the hallway.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
And that sailor
uniform is so her.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] You're up as soon as
the broadcasting club girls

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center

[TOUKO, ERIKA]
Thanks for your time.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] So, she was all for
the accompaniment idea, huh?

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:57.839 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] I was kinda
surprised when she told me

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
to play right then and there.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
So, um, thanks a lot.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50% align:center
You know, for lending me
the CD and all.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
[giggles] It's fine.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
Akebi is gonna be thrilled.

[TOUKO]
The song you're dancing to has

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.860 position:50% align:center
a piano accompaniment,
doesn't it?

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it does!

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
And I really love
that piano part!

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be amazing
if you could dance

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.117 position:50% align:center
with a live piano
at the after-party?

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
Aw! That'd be amazing!

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.207 position:50% align:center
I can't even imagine it.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50% align:center
It'd be like a dream.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:57.399 position:50% align:center

[KEI]
Akebi's just constantly running.

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
I only saw her from behind

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:26.553 position:50% align:center
as she'd spring off
the ground, but now...

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Darn it, what was I thinking?

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
I'm such an idiot.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
I can't even see Komichi
dancing from here.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
But that's okay. I can remember.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Because, ever
since this morning...

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I can
do that move, too.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
You did spend all that time
practicing with her.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center

Akebi's always just been there.

[gasps] Poor thing!

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center

it way over there!

the only reason I was able to
enjoy playing like this again...

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.393 position:50% align:center
