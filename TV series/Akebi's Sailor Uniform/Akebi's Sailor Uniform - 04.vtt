00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] My guess is she's
probably not in her room

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
right now, since she's in charge
of dorm announcements today.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.734 position:50% align:center
That's a bummer.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.238 position:50% align:center
Come on inside.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.825 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Cute!

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:00.827 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Spacious, too.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI gasps]
Ooh, it's Miki's album!

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Oh, yeah!

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
Neko's my roomie.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Sorry, I was being so loud.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
I didn't know!

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
No biggie.

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
When she's out,
she sleeps just like a rock.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Really?

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Totally different from the
Kamimoku we saw doing <i>kyudo</i> .

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.689 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI giggles]
She does look like a kitty,

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
sleeping like this.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.193 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Okay, girls!

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center
Change and get comfortable!

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Uh? Change?

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
Oh, shoot, I forgot
to bring my PE clothes!

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
No problem!

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
I was gonna lend
you mine, anyway.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
And you, Tanigawa?

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
I'm fine as-is,
so don't worry about me.

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center
Well, this just means
we've gotta put some

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
extra thought into picking
your outfit, Akebi.

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:57.175 position:50% align:center
I'll go with
anything, really!

00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
Yay! Was hoping
you'd say that!

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
Well? Wanna try?
Take off your clothes.

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Okay.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.310 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] I was flipping
through this mag one day

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
and just had to buy it,
but it's not really my style.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
And too tight.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:15.568 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO giggles]
But I'm sure...

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
Yep! It's the
perfect size for you.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:22.909 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Done!

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.619 position:50% align:center
Oh, forgot the socks!

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
How do I look?

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
Knew it.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
It really suits you, just like
the model in the magazine.

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Yeah, looks pretty on you.

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
It's way too pretty for me--
I'll only get it dirty.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center
If I were you,
I might've gone to school

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
in Tokyo instead.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing!

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.867 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's wash that uniform.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sure.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Don't freak out,
don't freak out!

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
Hey there!

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.636 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Okay. We can
dry it in here, too.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
You do this often?

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center
Only always.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
Well? Ready to go?

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Mm!

00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
Hey! I have an idea.

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.272 position:50% align:center
I can make us
treats while we wait.

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.118 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Now, you two
sit back and relax

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
while I whip up the snacks.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:52.999 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Not fair, you clean
and you can cook, too?

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
Chores are rough, but it
comes with kitchen privileges!

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center

She's so casual about it.

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:25.699 position:50% align:center
Can't wait.

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center

Mm-hm!

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.368 position:50% align:center

Snack time!

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.495 position:50% align:center
Enjoy, girls

You made all these?

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center

Yep!

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
Go on! Help yourself!

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center

I'll try this one.

Oh, my gosh!

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
Like it?

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
Let me know if you
have any requests.

Can you even talk?

baking, Usagihara?

Any snacks today, Usagihara?

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:09.367 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! Hold on a sec.

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:10.535 position:50% align:center
Oh, oops.

Hi, ladies.

Hitomi's practice just wrapped,

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
Akebi? Thought you were an idol.

Usagihara is so popular.

She's made so many
friends already.

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:15.350 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO sighs] I've gotta change
it up a bit, find new recipes.

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:16.559 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Online?

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] My fam owns
a Western sweets shop.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.938 position:50% align:center

That's why they taste so good!

[TOUKO]
Oh, stop it!

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
You're just trying to get
more cookies from me!

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
It's a little complicated.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:28.697 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
I mean, when I lived at home,

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:33.076 position:50% align:center
I actually had zero interest
in making sweets.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
I only handled sales and
when my parents were there,

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.081 position:50% align:center
cleaning up the shop.

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
But you're so good at it.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Because I call home
and ask for the recipes.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
But half of the ones
I've tried have fallen flat.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
Kinda like when I moved
into the dorm, and said,

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
"I'm Usagihara!" while
wearing these bunny ears.

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center
Got no laughs.

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
I tried to break the ice and
it totally backfired on me.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
Huh?! I so would've
laughed at that!

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.395 position:50% align:center
Turns out the only thing
that works is flashing

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
your underwear to your
entire homeroom class.

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
Please let me enjoy
my treat in peace.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.445 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO laughs]
My bad, my bad!

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
So, to rebuild my shambled
reputation, I thought:

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
I'll make sweets!

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:14.909 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Oh, nice idea!

00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:17.037 position:50% align:center
But they won't let you buy
anything while you live here

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.539 position:50% align:center
unless you make
a special request.

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.458 position:50% align:center
So, some of the girls
were saying it'd be nice

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.585 position:50% align:center
if we could at least
be free to eat sweets.

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
That doesn't sound unreasonable,

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
unlike the dorm's restrictions.

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:29.632 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Yeah. Everyone
here felt the same way.

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
So, since I have the freedom
to buy food and use the kitchen,

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.888 position:50% align:center
I volunteered my services!

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
That sounds like fun!

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:38.433 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
It kinda is!

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
They all give me their pocket
change to buy ingredients.

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Lucky.

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
So, yeah, if you have
any special requests,

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
just let me know!

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I might
take you up on that.

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
Wow, it's like the dorm
has their own pastry chef.

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] You bake at home,
don't you, Akebi?

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't call it that.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
If she needs the help,

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.373 position:50% align:center
I sometimes pitch in
when my mom makes dinner.

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:03.375 position:50% align:center
You, too?

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center

[KOMICHI gasps]

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
If I can do it, you'll
pick it up in no time.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
If I burn down
the kitchen, I'm sorry.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Just act like
I'm not even here.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
Akebi in the kitchen
is a juicy scoop, huh?

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.893 position:50% align:center
Right! I will not be defeated!

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
Not all of it!

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.856 position:50% align:center
What are you,
attacking it? Easy!

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.566 position:50% align:center
Aren't these plates so cute?

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
Pay attention to the stove!

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Whoa, whoa,
whoa! Stop!

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
Just stop!

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Bon Appetit.

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Well, here we go.

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
How's it taste?

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
Um... Kinda like I'm
chewing through charcoal.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center
It's a crêpe.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:57.220 position:50% align:center
Wow, girl.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
I guess you really
are bad at this.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
See? Sorry it
turned out like this

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
after you helped me out.

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Mm-mm. I wasn't
exactly the best teacher.

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:11.192 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I've been such
a total mess today.

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a reassuring
thing to hear.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I just mean
that you seemed like

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:21.828 position:50% align:center
this perfect girl who always
did everything right.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
I'll bring my A-game next time!

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.541 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You mean I can
come over again some--

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
[burps]

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I'm so sorry.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:35.467 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Mm-- Huh?

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
[KEI] I only ate two,
maybe three at the most.

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Akebi? Did you
seriously eat the rest?

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
They were just so good!

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
No, I'm happy!

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
But don't eat too
much all at once!

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Oh, look, the burp
heard around the world

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
even woke up Neko.

00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:55.779 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Did not!

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
It was you laughing
so loud that woke her up!

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:00.283 position:50% align:center
[KEI, TOUKO laugh]

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
[NEKO]
Morning.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Morning!

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Yay! No stains!

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Ah, thank goodness.

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
Ah, it feels so nice and warm!

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
Huh? Weren't you
wearing socks before?

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:23.181 position:50% align:center
I don't remember throwing
them in the washer.

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Uh, yeah.

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
That's because you didn't.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:29.187 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I was too
embarrassed to show you.

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Girl, after our
adventures today, nothing you do

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
will ever surprise me,
and I mean nothing!

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Are you taking photos?

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
Yeah, look here!

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center
No! Get away!

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:47.038 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:57.507 --> 00:21:00.218 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I can't believe you took those.

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Thanks to Usagihara,

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
I think I have a better idea
of what your image is now.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Are you trying
to say I'm a slob?

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:08.643 position:50% align:center
Meanie!

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
I didn't say that!

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:14.024 position:50% align:center
But... you do have
your klutzy moments.

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI whines]

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
[KEI] The Akebi I see at school,
and the Akebi working

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
in the kitchen, they're both
straightforward, honest,

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
and always give their all.

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
So, I think these photos
capture both versions

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
of you perfectly.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.376 position:50% align:center
Like, you know how you
always wave at the bus

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
when you're on your
way to school?

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:37.380 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Wait, huh?

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:40.967 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I guess you
can't see inside it.

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
That's the bus I take to school.

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:49.392 position:50% align:center
[KEI] It's no wonder you
have holes in your socks,

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
running like that every day.

00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:08.244 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Komichi! Kao!

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:09.662 position:50% align:center
Coming!
