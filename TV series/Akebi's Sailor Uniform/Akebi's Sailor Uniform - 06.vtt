[KOMICHI] Erika has such
beautiful eyelashes.

[violin plays]

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
And she's so talented.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
That was so good, Erika.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
I've been playing my whole life.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
It better be.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.454 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
She's so cool.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
And she's my friend!

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:44.377 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Hey, Komichi, I've noticed...

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
You've been staring at me
a whole lot lately.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.059 position:50% align:center
[NEWSCASTER 6A] Up next,
the nationwide weather forecast.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50% align:center
The rain we've seen between
the Kinki and Kanto regions

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.439 position:50% align:center
will start letting up
tomorrow morning...

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:33.194 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI grumbling]

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.738 position:50% align:center
Okay! I will!

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.199 position:50% align:center
Next week, I'm finally gonna
invite a friend home with me!

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.118 position:50% align:center
Just one? How come?

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.163 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Because! I don't have
the guts to invite more yet!

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.123 position:50% align:center
Oh, good! Erika, right?

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
The one you knew was interesting
at your first glance?

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.837 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Mm-hm! Guess I
better go tidy up my room!

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.630 position:50% align:center
Wait up! I'll help you!

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Girls, wait!

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.216 position:50% align:center
Dinner's almost ready!

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Later, Mom!

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.844 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
Later!

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
A week ago, I was all good.

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
Chock full of confidence.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] But it's my first time
inviting someone to come over.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Wonder what I
should say when I ask her.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I kept thinking
we'd talk at school...

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
...or that we'd hang out

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
during breaks between classes.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Hey, Komichi.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I kept kind of
obsessing over it,

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.090 position:50% align:center
and then, before I knew it...

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.759 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA gasps]

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Hey, Komichi. I've noticed...

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
You've been staring at me
a whole lot lately.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?
No, I haven't!

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Yes, you have. You just were.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Mm...

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50% align:center
Is there something on your mind?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Well, I've been thinking,

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.445 position:50% align:center
there's no school tomorrow,
since it's Saturday...

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay. Wait, why so polite?

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, well, I, um--

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey!

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.583 position:50% align:center
How do you feel about houses
that have leaky roofs?

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Huh? Obviously, uh,
they should be repaired.

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
No one wants to get wet inside.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:21.386 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're so right!
Well, that's it!

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
That's the thing I've been
wanting to ask you about!

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
She's acting so weird.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I gotta fix that leak
before I can invite her over.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Hey, Komichi. I'm, uh,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
on my way to the
library next. Wanna come?

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
She's still looking at me.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
That clearly wasn't
all she wanted to say.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
That looks like a good
book you're reading.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
Tell me something.
Have you ever gone fishing?

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:05.388 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You have?

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
Yeah, there's a good
lake right by my house.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
The way I do it isn't
all that cool, though.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
Just a nice, bendy stick
and sewing thread,

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
and leftover squid
legs for bait.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.526 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Homemade gear?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
But all I catch is crayfish.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:23.531 position:50% align:center
I've still never once
caught an actual fish.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.033 position:50% align:center
So, when I go, sometimes I just

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
wade right into
the water barefoot.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Barefoot?

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
It's my job to corner them,

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
and then Kao takes
the net, and--

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
It's just, that's
something I wanna try!

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.464 position:50% align:center
I'm jealous.

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
You are?

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:47.055 position:50% align:center
Anyway. So, if you wouldn't...

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
--...mind...
--[KOMICHI] Now I get it.

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.309 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't just
invite her to my house.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
Let's go together!
Maybe tomorrow?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.898 position:50% align:center
Saturday?

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking,
there's no school tomorrow,

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
since it's Saturday...

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.074 position:50% align:center
Is this the reason you've been
looking at me so much?

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 6C clears throat]
Keep it down, please.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] A promise
to meet up this weekend.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.466 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
My first ever!

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.234 position:50% align:center
Can't wait to hang out.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggle]

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
I never knew this was here!

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
What a gorgeous place to meet!

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Oh, man, I'm a whole hour early.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
The weather's perfect.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] I wonder what Komichi
will do when she sees this.

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.833 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should get
acclimated to the water.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
I mean, I don't wanna look
silly in front of Komichi.

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Mom would flip all the way out

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center
if she saw me doing this.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:49.594 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA laughs]

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.513 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Oh, no! I can't stop.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:54.224 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI panting]

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.270 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I'm glad I'm finally
getting to wear this skirt

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
Mom made for me!

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.607 position:50% align:center
I'm meeting Erika, after all!

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
I can't just show up
in my usual old sweats!

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:11.282 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
I got here way too early.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
What's...?

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI gasps]
Erika!

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:27.841 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:52.824 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thank you, though.

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:55.118 position:50% align:center
You're a pretty good swimmer.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Now, I see!

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.749 position:50% align:center
You put on something
that you could actually

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
wear into the water!

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
No swimsuit, but yeah.

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Thank you so much for
coming to spend the day with me!

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
Same to you.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I asked where the best
spot to catch fish would be.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
It's a bit of a walk, though.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Really? Let's go!

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
You look really cool, Erika.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
Just bought this stuff!

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
But, I never get
a chance to go fishing,

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
it's my first time today.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
So, I'm, like, super-excited!

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Same! And the rod is cool,

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
but I was talking about
the whole ensemble.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:37.744 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? Well, thanks.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I hope Erika gets
to catch an enormous fish

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.306 position:50% align:center
beyond her dreams today!

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
This looks great!

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
We're bound to catch something!

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50% align:center
'Kay, guess I'll get ready, too.

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:12.862 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
You're fishing with that?
No rod or anything?

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.325 position:50% align:center
Yep. It's rice.

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:19.244 position:50% align:center
You can catch the
little fish with it.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.496 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna try right over here.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Oh! I got one!

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
You're kidding!

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.424 position:50% align:center
I wonder what this is called.

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Hang on! I'll look it up!

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
A--Amur minnow?

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
Minnow! Well,
that's a cool name!

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] She's amazing, catching
a fish with a thing like that.

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
I can do it, too!

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
There are fish here.

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
That's for sure.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
Ah! Got another minnow!

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
And yet, I...

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
It'll be hard to catch
with that bait.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:15.967 position:50% align:center
They can't eat it.

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
Well, it's the only
lure I have, though.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.139 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] How about the spot
where that bird caught a fish?

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Yeah, but it's kind of far away.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Hm... I feel
like it might be flying up

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
a little too high.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:33.735 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
I'll ease up a bit
and then cast!

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
Wow! Nailed it!

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
I think it's stuck.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.094 position:50% align:center
I can swim out
and get it, no prob!

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
I don't want you
to have to do all that.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
I'll see if I can't circle
around to get it loose.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.059 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay.

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Why am I so impressed
by something like this?

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What? Stuck again?

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA gasps]
No. Looks like a bite!

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Huh?! You're kidding!

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.229 position:50% align:center
I wanna go back,
but the water's getting in.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Erika?

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
Komichi! I got a bite!
I need help!

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
I'll be right there!

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
I'm here!

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
Thank you! Take over
while I get these off.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Okay!

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:16.796 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:25.764 position:50% align:center
What do I do? I've never
done this before!

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
I'm back!

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Sheesh, I had no clue
fish could be this strong.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:39.069 position:50% align:center
How the heck do I reel it in?

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
I can catch it!

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
In this!

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:46.076 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA, KOMICHI]
Almost there.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.704 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA, KOMICHI]
Almost there!

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:54.626 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp, laugh]

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
We did it!

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
'Kay, smile big!

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:21.277 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
I can't believe it! A real fish!

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
She's really having fun.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
The speckles on its
back are just so pretty.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
But I feel sorry for
keeping it in here.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
So long now. Thank you.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50% align:center
Look at it go.

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] We're gonna
play in the water now!

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:12.704 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Hey, Erika.
Did you have fun today?

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.882 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Yes. A lot!

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:29.763 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Need fresh clothes?

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.890 position:50% align:center
I have some.

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
I brought a set.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
Is there a place I can change?
Maybe, like a bathroom?

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.647 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] No one will see you if
you go over behind those trees.

00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:41.733 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[KOMICHI] Huh?

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
I was just kidding.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
We're almost to my house now!

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.205 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] I guess I'm heading
to Komichi's house.

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.669 position:50% align:center
Just to change clothes and
use the bathroom, of course.

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:03.338 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Oh! Kao!

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
Kao! Meet my friend, Erika!

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
A tiny Komichi?

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:12.347 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
Mom!

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
Big Sister is bringing her
new friend home with her!

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:24.984 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I can't believe
this beautiful place with

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:28.780 position:50% align:center
the red roof on the way
to the lake was your house!

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
Mom, look what
I found outside!

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] Wow, what
a big butterbur leaf.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll use it in a stew.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
It's not an umbrella?

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
Welcome.

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:43.211 position:50% align:center
You must be the beautiful Erika.

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
You really are.

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA gasps]
Oh, Komichi, please don't

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
describe me that way.

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
Sorry to show up like this--

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:56.474 position:50% align:center
Mom, it was amazing!
Erika caught a huge fish, see?

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Wow, how pretty.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
Huh, is it a male char?

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
--[KOMICHI] I think!
--[KAO] I wanna see!

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
--I couldn't believe it, either!
--[KAO] I wanna see!

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.566 position:50% align:center
--[ERIKA] Uh.
--My turn, let me look!

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm impressed.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA gasps]

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
Now, go on, you two.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
Go get showered and cleaned up.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
Looks like you went
a little nuts out there.

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:20.957 position:50% align:center
Erika, the bathroom is that way.

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.667 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Thanks.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] Kao, bring her
a towel, would you?

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:28.173 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
Okay! Wait right here, Erika!

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
Your mom is really nice.
I like her.

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Komichi?

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:37.766 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
You can use this.

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
Please, take your time.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
This towel smells so nice.

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
I'm a little nervous about being
naked in someone else's house.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
So, uh, Komichi,
you can go first.

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
They're both so weird.

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
Acting so familiar the
minute they first meet you.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:01.373 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Is how they address
me really that important?

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Well, I hadn't given
it that much thought before.

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center
But... when I saw

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
the way they were
treating you...

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
...I just felt...

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
...so jealous!

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
And I know it's silly.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:20.767 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Komichi didn't even hesitate.

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.272 position:50% align:center
Your skin is so pretty, Erika.

00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:28.149 position:50% align:center
You're lucky.

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:29.984 position:50% align:center
Is it getting in your eyes?

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
No.

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
How's the sponge, good?

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I'll try not to scrub too hard.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
Your turn. I'll wash your back.

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] No, you can get out
and put your clothes on.

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
I'll be out by the
time you're done.

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks. Sounds good.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.174 position:50% align:center
Kao!

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
Would you please come here
and show Erika to my room?

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
And have Mom bring up
some snacks, too!

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.851 position:50% align:center
You can toss your towel
in the washing machine

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
when you're done with it.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Komichi's good
at taking care of people.

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.067 position:50% align:center
I wonder if she's
always like this.

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] She hasn't even
dried her own hair yet.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
Thanks for doing this.

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:19.576 position:50% align:center
I'm used to it.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
She wasn't kidding.

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
You're lucky.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
You get your hair dried
like this every time, huh?

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, but she doesn't
use a brush with me.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
She ruffles it up more,
but now, she's acting different.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
It's like she's trying
a lot harder than usual.

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
Kao!

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
It isn't always necessary
to be that honest!

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA laughs]
Tell me something.

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
Do you mind?

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
What do you like best
about your sister?

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.146 position:50% align:center
[KAO]
Hm...

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Aw, they even
have the same mannerisms.

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Don't say anything weird!

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
Don't say anything weird!

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Komichi, I brought drinks.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
Can you open the door?

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:58.907 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm coming!

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Here you go. Snacks and coffee.

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Oh, awesome, thanks, Mom!

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Thank you so much.

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
Her butt always makes
a really good noise

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
when you smack it.

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
[stammering]

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
Kao! You know that's
not the kind of thing

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
Erika wants to hear about!

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
But why not? You do
it all the time.

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
Why exactly would you do that?

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.227 position:50% align:center
When Kao was born,

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center
she started doing it
to make her laugh.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
She's done all kinds of other
embarrassing things, too.

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
Look!

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.110 position:50% align:center
Aw, Mom, why?

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
[YUWA]
Here. And just look at this one!

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:44.244 position:50% align:center
That's cute, huh?

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] All I wanted was to
try and look cool for her,

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
and now this?

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:57.298 position:50% align:center
Sorry we couldn't offer you
much hospitality today.

00:20:57.382 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] No, the coffee was great
and now you're driving me home.

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
That's more than enough.
I'm so grateful.

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:08.893 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI, YUWA, KAO]
Come visit again sometime!

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.778 position:50% align:center
Thanks again. See you at school.

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:21.031 position:50% align:center
Yep, see you soon.

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Komichi! Komichi!

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
As of now, you're my very
best friend at school!

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
So, I'm gonna miss you!
Let's do it again, okay?

00:21:57.859 --> 00:21:59.444 position:50% align:center
Mm-hm!

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:04.574 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] Komichi, if you're going
to bed, cover up, it's cold.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.159 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
I will.

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:16.294 position:50% align:center
