[MIKI panting]

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
C'mon, have a drink!

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] It all started
with a commercial

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
starring the idol,
Miki Fukumoto.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.500 position:50% align:center
I couldn't get over
the way she looked.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
I was, like,
immediately obsessed!

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
Ah! I can't!

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
So cute! So cute!
So cute! So cute!

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
So cute! So cute! So cute!

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.845 position:50% align:center
So, when I found a
photo from when my mom

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:58.099 position:50% align:center
went to this school,
I thought it had to be fate!

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
[YUWA] If that's where you
really wanna go, that's fine.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
But it'll be tough.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
I'll work hard!

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.650 position:50% align:center
Also, if I do make it
into Roubai Academy...

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:13.448 position:50% align:center
There's one thing.

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.117 position:50% align:center
I want you to make me
a sailor uniform!

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:20.413 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I always admired
the way my mother looked

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:22.791 position:50% align:center
whenever she was working.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:26.628 position:50% align:center
Over the years, I only
had eyes for that uniform.

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:35.095 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
It was the entire reason

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.514 position:50% align:center
I wanted to go to the academy.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.811 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] The principal
was very kind and said

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:45.230 position:50% align:center
I could wear whichever
one I wanted.

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:53.947 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] So, I obviously
chose the sailor uniform!

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.086 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Oh, man!

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
I talked for way too long!

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
Now they're all bored!
I just know it!

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Akebi.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50% align:center
Anything else you'd like to say?

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI gasps] I think the best
feature about my body

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
is that I'm really flexible,

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.894 position:50% align:center
and there's one thing I do that
always makes my sister laugh!

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.355 position:50% align:center
I'd like to finish
by showing it to you!

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
Here goes!

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.828 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] After her big sister
tries so hard to look awesome...

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
Look at me!

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
I'm a ghost. Ooh.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy.

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
[TAMURA giggles]

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Um, thanks. I'm done now.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
[TAMURA]
Okay, thank you for that.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
[clapping]

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI groans]

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
Well, that was informative.
We all know you better now.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
And personally, I thought that
last bit was pretty funny.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50% align:center
Did you really?

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:51.249 position:50% align:center
It's just, as far as the
rest of them go, well...

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
They only noticed they
could see up your skirt.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
Hitomi Washio.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
I plan to play volleyball.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] So, in seat number
16, we have Hitomi Washio.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.730 position:50% align:center
Volleyball club.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.316 position:50% align:center
Not surprising since
she's very tall.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.531 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
All done!

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
[bell rings]

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
[MAKO] Well, shall we
have some lunch now?

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.300 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.679 position:50% align:center
[TAMURA] Okay, I want you
to move your desks together

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.682 position:50% align:center
to form groups the way
I've drawn on the board.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
So? What do ya think?

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah! You look really great!

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Thanks, you, too!

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
All right, here you go.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Thank ya kindly.

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] She thanked me
in a Kansai accent!

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
Oh! It's seat number
13, Riri Minakami.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Here you go--

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:18.420 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] It's seat
number 14, Hotaru Hiraiwa!

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
How cute!

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
Careful you don't
spill, it's hot.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Akebi, if you give
everyone that much,

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
then you won't...

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
There!

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:46.781 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Yep. See?

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Sitting around
our desks like this.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
It's almost like we're a family!

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.500 position:50% align:center
[TAMURA]
All right, let's eat.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
[CLASS]
Thanks for the food.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
That's gotta be rough!

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Um, here, feel free to use this.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.826 position:50% align:center
Huh? Ah! Thanks a lot.

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
It's a weird day.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
I forgot my glasses
case in my bag.

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
This is a huge help!

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:41.336 position:50% align:center
Glad to hear that!

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Wait.

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
Didn't I wipe my sweat with
that handkerchief earlier?

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:53.682 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Are you okay?

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
Hold on, that handkerchief was--

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry, I used
the part that's dry.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it's fun
just watching her.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
[TOMONO] Thanks so much
for the handkerchief.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:12.992 position:50% align:center
Komichi Akebi!

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.
Tomono Kojou, right?

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
You actually remembered my name.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.835 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
She's seat number six.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
Tomono Kojou.
And she's really nice.

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I would bet you're
pretty popular, aren't you?

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] She's seat
number two, Touko Usagihara.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
Heck, no! I've never
been popular in my life!

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
No way!

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.277 position:50% align:center
You're the only one in
a pure white sailor uniform.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
And you wear it so well, too.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
You're almost like an idol!

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
Uh... I... Look, you can call
me that as much as you want,

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
but it'll do nothing for you!

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Kao! She said
I look like an idol!

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
Seriously, look at you,
your face is just my type, too.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.756 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, no one's ever
said that to me before!

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Mm...

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
But look, the blazer
looks nice, too, right?

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
I was pretty excited
to wear this.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.848 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Yeah! It looks really mature!

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
I would like to wear
one someday, too!

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:21.311 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Well, then, tell you what.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
You wanna try it on now?

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO giggles]

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
There we go.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.614 position:50% align:center
We'll trade. Lend me yours, too.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
Wow! Such a treat!

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.413 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA gasps]

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA]
Uh-- Whoa! W-Wait!

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
Uh, she was just joking!
Don't do that!

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but if you
take that off,

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
won't you be in
just your underwear?

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Yeah, you're right!

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
Wow, I guess you must
be the serious type, huh?

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.262 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] You're just
such a smooth talker,

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
I walked right into it.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:01.851 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] No, you're just
super accident-prone.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
I need to guard her
against creepy pests.

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:07.190 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO] Talkie, talkie,
talkie, talkie, ta--

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.650 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.194 position:50% align:center
[TOUKO]
Wait, what?

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
You didn't go to
cram school, Akebi?

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
That's so unusual!

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's that weird?

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, it's just
most people applying

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center
to Roubai go to one.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
For instance, that girl
right over there!

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
Kei Tanigawa.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
She always scored the
highest on mock exams.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
Can't go wrong
with her as a friend.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
And that's Ai Tatsumori.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
She went to the same
cram school as me.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
She's short-tempered,
to put it mildly.

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
She called me out for talking
during study periods.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Wouldn't that have been
kind of your own fault, though?

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center

So, how was school?

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] I was kinda
nervous, but it was fun.

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:18.069 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Is that right?

00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:21.197 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI] Mm-hm. Oh, and there's
actually a bunch of stuff

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.408 position:50% align:center
I wanna tell you
if you have time!

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center

Komichi.

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:47.766 position:50% align:center
[KOMICHI]
Hm?

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:52.270 position:50% align:center
[SATO] In the morning, what time
are you leaving for school?

00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:53.688 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:21:53.772 --> 00:22:00.737 position:50% align:center
[SATO] Hm? Well, I'll have
to be out of here by six.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.031 position:50% align:center
Then I'll be up and
dressed before that.

00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:08.286 position:50% align:center
Can't wait to see it, honey.

00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Dad!

00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center

Yeah?

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:21.007 position:50% align:center
