1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,333
[CIEL] There is definitely
something dodgy

2
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,666
about this circus.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,083
I think it would
be worth our time

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,708
trying to get
some answers from him.

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,208
Why don't you go-- 

6
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,541
Come on, look lively!

7
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,125
We've got lots of work to do.

8
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,500
If you don't practice, Black is
going to show you up for sure.

9
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:27,541
[CIEL] Er, right.

10
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:28,583
Cheers.

11
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,000
[SEBASTIAN] Pardon me.

12
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,916
As you've been
here longer than I have,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,250
perhaps you could be
of assistance.

14
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,708
I'd be grateful.

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,125
I have no interest whatsoever

16
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,791
in offering you
my assistance.

17
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,541
You're just teasing me,
of course.

18
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,250
Shall we step outside?

19
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,083
Look at that!

20
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,416
They're best mates already.
I knew they'd get along.

21
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,708
The recruits have all been
a bunch of odd ducks lately.

22
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:06,541
[JOKER] Ah, yes, but mighty
talented ducks they are.

23
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,083
Listen, all of yeh.

24
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,541
Beast, Wendy, Peter, Jumbo.

25
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,166
 I spoke with Father.

26
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,625
He said that we
have not yet gathered

27
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,666
enough sweets
for the main event.

28
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,750
[JOKER] We'll do it tonight.

29
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,000
[JOKER] That'll be all, then.

30
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,208
Pass it along to
Dagger and Doll, eh?

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,166
[WILLIAM] Why am I here,
in a circus of all places?

32
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,625
[WILLIAM] Well, despite the fact
that I am an administrator,

33
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,875
I've been drafted to fill in for
a certain prat in Collections

34
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,958
while he's suspended.

35
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,625
Ridiculous, isn't it?

36
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,250
I curse my luck.

37
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,208
I didn't realize
graduating with him

38
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,750
entailed fixing
his numerous mistakes.

39
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,750
I have to assume there are
special circumstances involved

40
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,916
if a grim reaper is personally
doing undercover work.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,625
You cannot
believe I would reveal

42
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,208
soul-related
information to a demon.

43
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,541
That would be rather like
setting a bunch of rabbits free

44
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,375
at the mouth of a wolf den.

45
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,208
I'm afraid you mistake me.

46
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,375
I have no interest
in cheap souls.

47
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,041
My tastes are more refined.

48
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,375
Fine words from a
starving demon like yourself.

49
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,916
I know you must be
half-mad with hunger.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,541
Again, you are mistaken.

51
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,083
I have long since
tired of ripping into

52
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,416
every stray soul I happen upon.

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,916
After all, the hungrier one is,

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,750
the more satisfying
one's dinner shall be.

55
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,250
[WILLIAM] How perverse.

56
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,666
Not nearly as perverse as
that ginger friend of yours.

57
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,083
And you can rest easy
for the moment, at least.

58
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,916
I'm on a short lead.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,458
[WILLIAM] Oh, very well.

60
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,333
I shall speak plainly, then.

61
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,541
In the next few days,

62
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,791
we intend to review
a large number of souls

63
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,500
near this circus.

64
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,875
This is a very special case,

65
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,541
so I would appreciate it
if you didn't interfere.

66
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,875
Sounds quite taxing.

67
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,750
I would be happy to
offer you my assistance.

68
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,208
I've no desire
for unpaid overtime.

69
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,041
Interfere, and I'll
cut you down swiftly.

70
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,333
[SEBASTIAN] Just as well.

71
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,666
I have no wish
to spend any more time

72
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,958
in the company of
reapers than I must.

73
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,500
Especially as I've no interest

74
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,958
in the low-grade souls
you deal with.

75
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,875
[CIEL] Oi!

76
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,250
The show will
be starting before long.

77
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,583
That obnoxious
knife thrower wants you.

78
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,458
He doesn't look
very choice to me,

79
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,291
but to each his own.

80
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,208
I'll never understand
demons, I swear.

81
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,291
Stop that.

82
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,208
We should avoid
using that term here.

83
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,666
That lot took it for a feeble
jest earlier, but even so.

84
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,916
If you can't
blend in with the humans,

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,708
then you're even worse
than that ginger riff-raff.

86
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,791
Well said, my lord.

87
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,625
We won't deign interfere
with your business

88
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,375
if you don't
interfere with ours.

89
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,958
Does that sound like a
suitable arrangement to you?

90
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,291
It should serve.

91
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,750
I despise your very faces

92
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,125
and will happily stay
well away from both of you.

93
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,583
So it's agreed, then.

94
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,791
Our mutual antipathy
should prove most effective

95
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,333
in keeping us out of
each other's business.

96
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,625
Oh, and Smile?

97
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,458
Do keep your
pup here reined in,

98
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,666
if that isn't asking too much.

99
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,000
I won't be mocked by a man

100
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,291
who can't even maintain
his cover, Four-Eyes.

101
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,208
I'm not Four-Eyes, thank you.

102
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,833
My name is Suit.

103
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,291
Let's return to work, Sebastian.

104
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,333
Quite.

105
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,666
[CROWD cheering]

106
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,750
[JOKER] And now,
the moment I know

107
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,875
yeh've all
been waiting for!

108
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,125
Tent assignments!

109
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,958
Exciting, eh?

110
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,375
Very.

111
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,666
Hey, now,
what're yeh doin',

112
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,458
looking so down in the mouth?

113
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,416
Remember to smile, Smile.

114
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,166
Yes, sir.

115
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,333
[CIEL] This is even
more intolerable

116
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,125
than I thought
it would be.

117
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,291
All right!

118
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,166
The results of our
totally random lottery.

119
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,416
Smile, yeh're in
tent number eight.

120
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,458
[JOKER]
And here's yer flat-mate.

121
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,875
[CIEL] And now they have us
rooming with a stranger?

122
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,583
You must be joking!

123
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,125
As for you, Black,
it's Tent Nine.

124
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:15,291
Seba--You mean Black
isn't in the same tent as I am?

125
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,250
No. Why on earth
should 'e be?

126
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,666
[laughs]

127
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,458
You're tied pretty tight
to Black's apron strings, eh?

128
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,333
Time to strike out
on your own, mate.

129
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,958
No, it isn't
like that, really.

130
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,375
[CIEL] This is bad.

131
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,708
Being separated from Sebastian
will complicate things.

132
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,458
Only, since Black
and I know each other--

133
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,666
Moving on then!

134
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,375
Rooming in Tent Nine
with Black will be...

135
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,416
...Suit!

136
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,750
[JOKER laughs]

137
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,041
Look 'ow happy they are!

138
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,125
[laughing]

139
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,833
That's that.
Let's be off then, Dagger.

140
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,916
We'll just leave these lads
to get all settled in.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,583
Er... Wai--

142
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,625
[DAGGER] Cheers!

143
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,708
[FRECKLES] Oi.

144
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,625
No problem if I
take the top bed, is there?

145
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,666
Be my guest.

146
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,708
That should work well.

147
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,708
I fancied the
bottom one, myself.

148
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,333
[CIEL] I would just
as soon not climb.

149
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,708
[FRECKLES] That's something
I've been noticing all day.

150
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,833
You talk real proper,
not like most of us circus folk.

151
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,750
O-Oh, do I?

152
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,500
Well, I have been in service
for most of my life.

153
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,583
So perhaps that's why.

154
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,083
Ah.

155
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,750
Well, feel free to ask me
any circus questions you have,

156
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,541
me bein' more
experienced and all.

157
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,458
All right.

158
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,125
Oh! I know!

159
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,416
I'll give you one o' these
to celebrate you joining us.

160
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,000
They're right tasty!

161
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,416
Top-of-the-line Funtom sweets!

162
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,916
There's caramel,

325
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,750
That's sayin' somethin'!

326
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,333
Quite impressive.

327
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,208
[FRECKLES] Right. I'm done.

328
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,500
Time to head
to practice. Let's go!

329
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,291
A-Already?

330
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,500
[FRECKLES] What 'appened, mate?

331
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,500
You could balance better than
that during your audition.

332
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,083
And this is the easy stuff.

333
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,833
Get up, then.

334
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,083
[CROWD gasping in awe]

335
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,833
[CARNIE 4A] Black is brilliant!

336
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,291
[CARNIE 4B] Suit's doing
a bang-up job, too.

337
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,875
They really are amazing.

338
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,375
You'd better get your
skills back too, Smile.

339
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,583
Yes.

340
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,875
[FRECKLES]
They're bloody superhuman!

341
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,625
[CIEL] You don't even know.

342
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,833
[FRECKLES]
I'm sweatin' like a pig.

343
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,333
Why don't we go wash up?

344
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,041
There's a shower
in this place?

345
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,791
[FRECKLES] Course there is!

346
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,125
[FRECKLES] With how
cold it is at night,

347
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,416
you're much better off
showering during the day.

348
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,458
Oh?

349
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,875
Here we are.

350
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,375
Wait, what?

351
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,166
Bottom's up!

352
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,666
[CIEL] This is it?!

353
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,208
Well, go on then.

354
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll wash your back for you.

355
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,500
Er... outside,
in the middle of winter?

356
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,583
And isn't that water quite cold?

357
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,500
What'd you expect?

358
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,291
Now go on,
off with those clothes.

359
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,250
The trick is to get it
over quickly and towel off.

360
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,500
[FRECKLES] I hear there are
those among the nobility

361
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,541
who swim in midwinter
for their health.

362
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,375
If they do it,
how bad could it be?

363
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,250
[CIEL] All the same,
I think I'm going to pass,

364
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,000
--thank you very much.
--Don't be shy.

365
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:05,875
We're all friends here.

366
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,291
Get off me!

367
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,000
Blimey...

368
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,666
You're supposed to undress
and then splash on the water.

369
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,958
Would you kindly get off me?

370
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,375
You're soaked already anyway,

371
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,125
might as well
give in and scrub up!

372
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,458
No, please,
just leave me be!

373
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,625
You're going to catch
cold in these wet things.

374
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,666
Come on!

375
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,291
Let me go!

376
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,625
Smile! Wait!

377
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,916
[SEBASTIAN]
You'll catch cold, my lord.

378
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,583
I've brought
a change of clothing.

379
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,875
[CIEL] Enough.

380
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:52,750
Pardon?

381
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,916
I said I've had enough!

382
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,416
If I have to continue this,
I swear I shall go mad.

383
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,333
Goodness, my lord.

384
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,458
Giving up already, are we?

385
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,333
It seems I overestimated
your fortitude.

386
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,083
Allowing such trifles
to bother you.

387
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,375
Well, that isn't
like you at all.

388
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,541
Not like me, eh?

389
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,583
Indeed it's not.

390
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:27,958
I'm the head
of House Phantomhive

391
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,333
and the Funtom Company.

392
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,333
It's not like me
to live like this.

393
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,375
Still, there's a task to do.

394
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,000
We'll finish this
as swiftly as possible.

395
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,041
Indeed.

396
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,791
[WILLIAM] I can't believe I have
to share a tent with a demon!

397
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,041
[SEBASTIAN] Now, now, reaper.

398
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,208
Can't we find
a way to get along?

399
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,166
[WILLIAM]
What kind of rubbish is that?

400
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,208
[SEBASTIAN] Goodness!

401
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,166
Are you going
to break the rules?
