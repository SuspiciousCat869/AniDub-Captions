1
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,625
What do you think
you're doing, pervert?!

2
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,958
You wretch!

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,416
How dare you even think
about touching my lady's skin?

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,291
Bastard!

5
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,250
Even I haven't touched it yet!

6
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,125
[JOKER] Well!

7
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,375
That was quite a feat
of acrobatics there, sir!

8
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,208
I reckon I would hire yeh,
I would.

9
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,208
Right quick!

10
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,708
Is your offer sincere?

11
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,916
If he's anything like you,
I'm sure he'll work out well.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,333
I reckon we'll be wanting
to give him an audition

13
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,541
all the same, though.

14
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,333
[SEBASTIAN] But of course.

15
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,000
I shall return tomorrow, then,

16
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,916
and bring him with me so
you can see if he suits.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,958
Thank you for an excellent day.

18
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,916
Leaving us already?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
There's no need to see me out.
I'll be fine.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,583
[SEBASTIAN] Now, then...

21
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,333
[SEBASTIAN] I don't sense
the children at all.

22
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,375
However,

23
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,500
I do sense something
a bit... off.

24
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,000
What is it?

25
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:29,291
"I'm afraid this area
is off-limits, my friend."

26
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,916
That's what
Wilde says, at least.

27
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,083
[SNAKE]
"You'll find the exit that way".

28
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,875
Yes, that is correct, Goethe.

29
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,208
You're too kind.
I had lost my way.

30
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:06,666
"Ta-ta, now!"
Cheers, says Goethe.

31
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,250
What's your report?

32
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,958
I'm afraid I was interrupted
before I'd had the opportunity

33
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,000
to make a full
circuit of the camp.

34
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,666
Ideally, I would
like to penetrate

35
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,791
a bit deeper
into their organization.

36
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:38,833
And, in that vein, I have
a request to make of you.

37
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,250
Do you?

38
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,458
[CIEL] I would like to know
when precisely this

39
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,500
became part of the plan!

40
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,333
I don't recall giving you
any orders to that effect!

41
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,250
Does it inconvenience you,
my lord?

42
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,291
[growls]

43
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,958
Enough for now.
We'll argue about it later.

44
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,916
At the moment,
I find I'm exhausted.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,791
I shall go to bed straightaway.

46
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,333
Very well.

47
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,625
However...

48
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,541
[SOMA] Ciel?

49
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,708
Ciel! You're finally here!

50
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,625
I've been waiting for so long!

51
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,416
[AGNI]
Greetings, Lord Phantomhive.

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,125
And Sebastian, welcome home.

53
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,625
Oh, that's right.

54
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,625
How could I possibly have
forgotten that you were here?

55
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,625
[SOMA] I have truly
missed you, my friend!

56
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,583
--I hope you have been well!
--Why, Namaste.

57
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,250
Prince Soma, Agni.

58
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,416
[SEBASTIAN]
You may be a bit confused

59
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,083
by the appearance of these two.

60
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,083
I don't blame you.

61
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,791
If I may, I'll explain who
they are and why they're here.

62
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,791
This is Prince Soma.

63
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,416
His recent history
is rather tragic.

64
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,500
He's the crown prince
of an Indian state.

65
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,458
He came to England
in pursuit of a woman.

66
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:26,208
Unfortunately, upon his arrival,
he was discarded in grand style.

67
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,708
However, a blithe spirit
like his is quick to rebound.

68
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,416
My young master tricked him
into minding the townhouse,

69
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,583
and Prince Soma
has been here since.

70
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,541
I find it amusing that
he is prince of anything.

71
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,291
And this old soul is Agni,

72
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,125
Prince Soma's butler,
or "khansama."

73
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,750
In reality, he seems
forced to function

74
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,833
almost as a mother
for the hopeless prince.

75
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,750
They say a butler's fate
is determined by his master.

76
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,333
Watching Agni brings home
to me the full gravity

77
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,291
of those words.

78
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,791
[laughing]

79
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,791
I didn't expect to see you back
at the townhouse so soon!

80
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,000
You must have missed me
very badly, huh?

81
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,458
Poor Ciel, always lonely!

82
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,625
Sorry, but I'm very tired.

83
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,875
I'm not at all in the mood
to deal with you right now.

84
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,041
You're teasing me!

85
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,666
You can't be
going to bed already!

86
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,166
I've been waiting
and waiting to play

87
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,166
that "chess" game
you told me about.

88
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,750
You surely don't want
to dash my hopes, do you?

89
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,750
Get off me!

90
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,083
What's the matter
with you, Ciel?

91
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,541
You're being such a grump!

92
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:29,000
We're reunited at last!
Can't you summon a small smile?

93
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,458
No! I'm bloody tired, get it?

94
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,166
Just leave me be!

95
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,416
But don't you know you
won't attract good fortune

96
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,916
unless you smile?

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,458
Come, your Highness.

98
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,958
Those two are as
irrepressible as ever, it seems.

99
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,291
There's no chance
of getting any peace

100
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,041
with the two of them around.

101
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,875
But back to this plan of yours.

102
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,625
Would you care to
explain why on earth

103
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,958
I should be forced to
join the circus as well?

104
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,750
Firstly, I wouldn't say that
you're being forced to join.

105
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,250
You're giving an audition
and getting them to admit you.

106
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,125
You joining up with them
should give us plenty of access.

107
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,166
I do not fancy living
in a tent one bit.

108
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,083
Are you sure
about this, my lord?

109
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:16,041
Had you forgotten?
This is your game, not mine.

110
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,750
I'm simply a piece on your
chess board, after all.

111
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,208
Am I to decide my own moves?

112
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,875
I suppose you're right.

113
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,458
But circus performers
are required to do tricks,

114
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,625
are they not?

115
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,625
I don't know how
to do anything like that.

116
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,833
Oh, no?

117
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,583
I had always thought you
seemed rather adept

118
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,625
at moves like
"stay" and "fetch."

119
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,416
Pardon?

120
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,708
[SEBASTIAN chuckles]

121
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,291
Nothing, my lord.

122
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,125
I wouldn't worry
overmuch, though.

123
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,583
Just do the best you can
during your entrance test.

124
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,208
I'll be ever by your side,

125
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,000
just as any
good butler should be.

126
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,833
Fine. I'll do it.

127
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,708
I'll join the stupid show
with you, all right.

128

My lord.

129

Look at this fellow!

What an adorable
little sprog you brought us.

You are a boy, aren't yeh?

132

Yes.

133

I've been in service as a
page boy for some time now.

My name, uh, is Finnian.
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

135

That's quite an imposing
name for a sprat like you!

a proper stage name.

that yer a boy, though?

Quite sure. Yes, quite.

Well, being adorable won't
see yeh through a circus, lad.

So, what're you good at?

143
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,583
I don't know.
I'm good with darts, I suppose.

144
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,583
[JOKER] Hmm...
Knife throwing's closest, then.

Oh. Thank you.

All right, then.
Let's see you hit the target.

have put the target

in the next country over.

There's no way 'is tiny
little arms can throw that far.

I'm not being
cruel in the slightest.

right next to him, can I?

00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,958
That was an impressive feat,
ain't no lie!

162
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,333
[JOKER] You're more talented
than I reckoned, sprat,

163
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,208
but that was only the
first part of the audition.

164
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,000
Next we'd like to see...

165
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,375
[JOKER] ...your tightrope
walking skills!

166
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,000
That's really tight!

167
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,333
Tight is what you want.
Less likely to die.

168
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,708
How's it coming?

169
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,791
Don't be shy with those knots,
all right, Doll?

170
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:24,083
Little chap would be mangled up
right good if he fell.

171
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,833
Isn't there any other
test you could devise for me?

172
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,208
Oh, dear!

173
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,958
Not giving up already, are yeh?

174
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,625
[CIEL] N-No, not at all!

175
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,875
I'd simply prefer a diff--

176
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,750
[JOKER] Then stop yapping
and chivvy along.

177
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,750
Haven't got all day, have we?

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,666
I'll untie you.

179
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,708
Leave it on. I'm going.

180
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,750
[CIEL yells]

181
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,958
[JOKER] Blimey!

182
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,208
I don't know how he
recovered after that!

183
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,833
Damn you.
You're enjoying this.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,083
Ow!

185
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,458
[JOKER] That was amazing!

186
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,916
I didn't reckon you
were going ta make it

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,291
after that first wobble,
but here yeh are!

188
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,916
Yes. Here I am.

189
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,750
Looks like this poppet passes
all the tests, then, eh, Joker?

190
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,791
[JOKER] Not yet!

191
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,541
There's something
of the utmost importance

192
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,166
that you're missing still.

193
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,916
Yes, I'm talking about...
a big smile!

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,166
Uh, wha--?

195
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,583
Come on, then. Smile for me!

196
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,166
This is the easy part
Don't look so gutted!

197
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,333
What's wrong with yeh?
Go on! Big smile!

198
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,541
It can't be that hard!

199
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,333
Just give us one smile,
that's all!

200
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,375
Smile! Smile!

201
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,791
Everybody!

202
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,333
We have some talented new mates
joining our great show.

203
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,208
[JOKER]
Allow me to introduce Black!

204
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,916
Hello. I'm Black. It is
a pleasure to meet you all.

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,916
[JOKER] Then there's
the wee one over here.

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,291
Say hi to Smile!

207
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,750
Smi--?

208
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:33,791
Go on, now.

209
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,958
Let's give them a warm welcome.

210
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,583
[TROUPE] Hello!

211
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,833
Come now, Smile.

212
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,625
Wouldn't you like to say
a few words to everyone?

213
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,625
Yes. I'm, er...

214
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,750
...so happy to be here.

215
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,708
[JOKER] Come on, Smile, smile!

216
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,333
You'll need a backstage
tour before we get down to work.

217
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,875
Follow me if yeh please!

218
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,583
Our first stop:
right over there

219
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,000
are the tents that
you'll be sleeping in.

220
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,708
This area's for
second-tier folk.

221
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,250
Stage hands, newcomers,
and the like.

222
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,583
The sleeping arrangements are
about two or three per tent.

223
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,541
Over there yeh have the
storage tent and the mess tent.

224
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,541
Cooking's a big part of
the job while you're new,

225
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,583
so best be ready to work hard.

226
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,625
Furthest down the line
there is the infirmary,

227
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,875
where Black was yesterday.

228
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,166
Moving on.

229
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,500
Another set of tents.

230
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,083
These are the private quarters
for the main cast.

231
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,083
There are private tents?

232
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,125
Of course.

233
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,333
Big names get
places of their own.

234
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,833
They expect it, don't they?

235
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,500
Oh, and the first is Snake's,
so best keep yer distance.

236
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,458
I'd hate for yeh
to come to grief.

237
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,333
Snake lets his poisonous
beauties run loose, you see.

238
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,166
A bite from one o' them,
and ye'd be stone dead.

239
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,041
You'll discover that
Snake and his serpents

240
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,291
are mighty shy of strangers.

241
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,041
So I tell newcomers
to be extra careful-like.

242
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,541
[JOKER] Oh, by the by...

243
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,000
I was wondering, what happened
to that right eye of yours?

244
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,000
[CIEL] Oh.

245
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,708
Well, there was a...
an accident.

246
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,041
Ah, how terrible.

247
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,958
And you're so young for
such an awful thing to happen.

248
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,083
Uh, yes.

249
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,333
Well, we're all damaged 'ere,

250
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,625
so you should have
no trouble fitting in.

251
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,375
It's good friends we'll be.

252
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,375
Uh, quite.

253
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,750
[SEBASTIAN] Did all
of the performers join up

254
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,708
at various stops along
your travels, as we did?

255
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,708
Aye. Most did, anyway.

256
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,166
Although we
first-tier performers

257
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,250
all come from the same place.

258
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,708
We're childhood friends, see.

259
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,875
So you've known each
other for quite some time, then.

260
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:41,916
[JOKER] Aye!

261
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:50,041
[harmonica playing
"Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son"]

262
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,083
[song continues]

263
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,625
[CIEL] That's "Tom, Tom,
the Piper's Son".

264
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,833
Mother Goose?

265
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,666
Oh ho!

266
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,958
Got a good ear there, Smile.

267
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,166
I'm impressed with yeh.

268
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,791
Not many folk know that.

269
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:36,833
Oh, really?

270
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,458
My, uh, last master
liked that song.

271
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,250
That's why I'm familiar with it.

272
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,375
I admit,
I find it interesting.

273
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,041
So all the main cast
have been friends

274
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,333
since childhood, have they?

275
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,041
Well, almost all, heh.

276
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:51,541
Snake is quite a bit newer
than the rest of us, actually.

277
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,541
His snake-handling is tops,
and we needed a snake man.

278
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,625
So even though he wasn't
part of the original crew,

279
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,125
he made the jump
to first-tier quickly.

280
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,708
Being one of the
primary performers

281
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,083
has its perks, to be sure.

282
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,333
We get to eat first,

283
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,583
which means we aren't
fighting tooth and nail

284
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,041
for the best food.

285
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,291
And as you saw, there's the
private tents, of course.

286
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,750
So as you'd expect,

287
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,583
there's friendly competition
among the other performers

288
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,791
for first-tier status.

289
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,125
Just look.

290
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,083
You see how hard
they're working?

291
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,291
There's some time
before we open,

292
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,458
so the newcomers
are all practicing.

293
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,666
They'll spend
every moment they can,

294
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,125
hoping to earn a
prime spot in the show.

295
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,208
To move up, you have to
master the basics.

296
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,583
Just work on building
a solid foundation, and--

297
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,375
[BEAST] Joker? You got a moment?

298
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,666
Of course.

299
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,000
Right then, I have to go.

300
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,750
Best get to work, lads.

301
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,625
[CIEL] Only in a circus, eh?

302
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,916
The entrance to
the private quarters

303
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,833
is a tent of poisonous snakes.

304
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,458
I guess some people
have guard dogs,

305
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,958
and some, guard vipers.

306
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,208
Yes, my l--
Oh, not my lord, though, is it?

307
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,666
I must learn to call you Smile.

308
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,916
If you got a
touch more activity,

309
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,916
your muscles wouldn't be
so frightfully tight.

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,416
I don't believe I asked you.

311
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,750
We could try to gain
first-tier status.

312
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,791
That would give us
the access we need.

313
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,541
A few poisonous snakes
should prove

314
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,333
no challenge
for you, though.

315
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,916
We need to find those children.

316
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,500
We won't find them here.

317
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,708
[CIEL] What?

318
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,916
[SEBASTIAN]
I explored as much as I could

319
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,833
after my visit last night.

320
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,583
And then there
was our tour today.

321
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,500
At neither time did
I sense the children.

322
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,125
The fact that they
aren't on the premises

323
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,125
is hardly proof that
the circus isn't involved

324
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,791
in their disappearance.

325
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,041
We must conduct a
thorough investigation.

326
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,083
We stay until that is done.

327
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,500
[SEBASTIAN] Yes, of course.

328
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,958
After all, it's entirely
possible they've already moved

329
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,208
beyond the state
where I could sense them.

330
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,500
Well, we must hope
that isn't the case.

331
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:50,083
She desires their safe return,
and I don't want to disappoint.

332
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,625
I understand perfectly, my lord.

333
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,958
And, while I don't
sense the children,

334
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,666
there is something a bit...

335
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,625
Well...

336
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,166
Out with it, then.

337
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,750
What're you lads doing?

338
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,541
That's enough stretching,
it's time to practice!

339
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes, of course.

340
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,666
So sorry. Right away.

341
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,958
It's your first day.

342
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,791
So I'll be helping you along.

343
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,291
We'll need to decide
what your acts will be.

344
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,666
Any preferences?

345
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,166
If we're allowed
to make requests,

346
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,375
I would prefer something
less physically demanding

347
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,458
than the tightrope.

348
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,500
Greatly prefer.

349
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,625
[laughs]

350
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,666
Good idea.
You are pretty frail!

351
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,541
All right then, I'll teach Smile
here everything there is to know

352
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,125
about knife throwing.

353
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,208
Black?

354
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,166
No preference.
Anything will do for me.

355
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,750
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You're a natural, aren't ya?

356
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,250
Go on then and
try whatever you think

357
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,041
you can manage and I'll observe.

358
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,166
[SEBASTIAN] Very well.

359
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,458
[SEBASTIAN]
First up is the flying trapeze.

360
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,958
Careful!

361
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,083
[SEBASTIAN]
And now. Juggling bottles.

362
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,791
[SEBASTIAN] Then pole-climbing.

363
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,583
[SEBASTIAN] The rings of fire.

364
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:06,208
An exhibition
of aerial acrobatics.

365
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:10,250
The trampoline.
Skipping rope.

366
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,958
Contortions!

367
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,500
And now,
I shall swallow this--

368
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,958
All right, enough!

369
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,208
[CROWD cheering, chattering]

370
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,333
Hey, you're
getting carried away.

371
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,208
You need to act
more like a newcomer.

372
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,166
[DAGGER] Blimey!
I did not expect that!

373
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,375
Another wickedly
talented new performer!

374
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,000
I'd better keep my act fresh.

375
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,458
"Another"?

376
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,291
That's right. Black here's
not the only bright new star

377
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,791
to join our troupe recently.

378
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,541
Look. Up there.

379
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,958
He's a former civil
servant or something,

380
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,583
and he's very serious.

381
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,791
Hey! Come on down here,
would ya?

382
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,291
Oi, Suit!

383
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,750
That looks like...!

384
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,708
One of the reapers.

385
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,250
[SEBASTIAN] Grim reapers.

386
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,041
Their job is to harvest
the souls of humans

387
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,333
who have found themselves
on the brink of death.

388
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,458
In order to
carry out this task,

389
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,958
each is equipped
with his own death scythe.

390
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,541
They work from a list of souls,

391
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,875
ensuring that their harvesting
duties are properly performed

392
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,791
and they eliminate
anything in their way.

393
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,125
They are indeed grim.

394
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,791
And deadly reapers!

395
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,041
[SEBASTIAN] Their work involves
reviewing each dying soul's

396
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,000
kaleidoscope of memories,

397
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,541
what is also known
as the Cinematic Record,

398
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,750
to determine whether
or not the time has come

399
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,291
for them to die.

400
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,791
Yes.

401
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,625
Although it is an event I would
greatly prefer to forget,

402
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,958
my young lord and I encountered
the grim reapers before.

403
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,375
We dealt with them
during the affair

404
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:42,125
of Jack the Ripper,
that is, Madam Red.

405
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,750
I had sincerely hoped
never to see them again.

406
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,916
But if they are here then, well,

407
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,916
there's one thing
that is certain.

408
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,500
[SEBASTIAN] Indeed.

409
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,791
Before long, someone in
the vicinity is going to die.

410
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,333
[WILLIAM]
That explains it, then.

411
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,458
I thought I
sensed something foul.

412
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,333
How unfortunate.

413
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,791
[WILLIAM] I didn't
expect us to meet again,

414
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,041
but I guess I'm destined
to be disappointed.

415
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,041
What prey are you
in pursuit of this time?

416
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,208
Well, answer me, vile demon.

417
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,916
[MALE CARNIE 3C] "Demon"?

418
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,541
[FEMALE CARNIE 3B]
What does that mean?

419
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:27,250
[CIEL] Oh no! They'll
find out what Sebastian is!

420
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,875
Er... I say,
what is this madness?

421
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,166
[WILLIAM] It's bad enough
that we reapers

422
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,458
are in such short supply

423
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,875
without demons popping up
all over the place.

424
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,333
At this rate, I'll be stuck
working yet another late night.

425
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,583
[DAGGER] Did he say "reapers"?

426
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,500
Wait, Dagger. Hold on.

427
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,041
[DAGGER] Oi!

428
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,125
What have I told you,
you plonker?

429
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,041
You do these bits
with such a straight face,

430
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,208
and no one can tell
you're joking!

431
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,541
This bloke has been
cracking joke after joke

432
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,791
since the day he got here.

433
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,625
Going on about souls
and such-like.

434
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,625
He's obsessed with all that
ridiculous occult twaddle.

435
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,583
I'm not actually joking.
I'm entirely serious.

436
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,500
[DAGGER] Very funny!

437
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,583
Now, let's move on.

438
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,541
Introducing you
to our newest newcomers.

439
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,166
The little one is Smile,
and the big one's Black.

440
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,208
You're our rising stars,
so play nice!

441
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,500
I don't see how
I can possibly play nice

442
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,666
with vermin like that.

443
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,666
[DAGGER] How can--?

444
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,791
Circuses run on
teamwork, ya know!

445
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,375
I would like to know what
a grim reaper is doing here.

446
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,833
And undercover, no less.

447
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,625
It is most unusual
for one of them to do that.

448
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:33,708
However, this leaves me with no
doubt about one thing, at least.

449
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,416
Something's going on
at this circus.

450
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,458
Something deadly.

451
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,750
[GRELL] Bassy, it's tragic!

452
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,916
I'm still under house arrest!

453
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,041
I won't be able to make
an appearance quite yet.

454
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,833
[SEBASTIAN]
Yes, that's truly a shame.

455
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:17,875
[GRELL] You think so?

456
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,375
[SEBASTIAN] Quite.

457
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,250
I'd rather hoped you'd be under
house arrest for eternity.

458
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,958
[GRELL] Oh, you devil!
