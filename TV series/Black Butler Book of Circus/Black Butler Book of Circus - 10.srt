In the name of Phantomhive,
Her Majesty's guard dog.

162
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,916
You're the guard dog?

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,583
There's no way!

164
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:14,041
The Earl of Phantomhive?
Impossible!

165
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,375
You, Smile?

166
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,208
You're actually... Phantomhive?

167
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,458
No... Then it
was all just a lie.

All of it... Really?

169
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,375
[CIEL] Yes. That's right.

170
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,583
My name is Ciel, and I am
the head of House Phantomhive.

171
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,291
I have a singular
responsibility to the Queen.

172

I dispel her worries.

173
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,291
Which is why Kelvin
and Joker needed to die.

174
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,458
And so I saw to it.

No he's not. We can do it!

178

To be honest,

179

[UNDERTAKER]
Hee hee hee hee!

208
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,291
My lord.
What did I tell you?

209
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,041
You should take care
of your soul.

210
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,125
You only get the one.

211
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,791
You have great
power at your disposal.

212
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,041
Because of that,

213
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,625
at some point you
stopped feeling the weight

214

of doing that
which cannot be undone.

215
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,916
It has become
something you will notice

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,583
only as you are
crushed underneath it.

217
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,416
But I repeat myself.

I can't help but wonder
how many times

the same warning now.

Hmm... Perhaps you know,
Lord Phantomhive.

221
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,000
[YOUNG MAN] Oh dear.
Well, what shall we do?

222
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,250
It couldn't be simpler.

223
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,833
All we need do is report
what we have witnessed.

224
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,916
I'd wager the poor little Earl
may be punished for this.

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,041
I'm afraid that sort of thing
is outside our purview.

226
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,166
What happens next
is up to Her Majesty.

says Oscar.

Nothing like this
has happened before, has it?

233

I confess there is something
I don't quite understand.

255
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,291
[CIEL] What is it?

256
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,166
Why are you so interested
in visiting their old workhouse?

257
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,333
In case you hadn't noticed,
its patron is dead.

00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,875
It can't possibly
keep its doors open

for much longer without one.

260

Lord Burton and his lot would
probably be willing to donate,

261
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,125
and I don't mind setting
the wheels in motion.

Out of the
goodness of your heart?

263

Dealing with the aftermath
is part of a Phantomhive's job.

264
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,333
There's no need to
sacrifice innocent members

265

of above-board society to the
machinations of the underworld.

266
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,500
Then why did we burn the manor
with the children inside?

267

I've seen enough victims

sort of thing will play out.

returning to normal.

They're too damaged.

272

were better off dead

that kind of trauma?

whatever he's done,
he's our savior!

There are young ones

[CIEL] There was nothing
this whole time!

Everything they thought
they were protecting...

It was long gone,

What great fools
they all were!

332
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,375
They were so desperate
to preserve this place.

333

They even died for it!

Trampling each other

We're cowardly!
And we're base!

Petty and small and nasty.

I'm just like them,

I'm full of it.

my veins as well.

[SEBASTIAN] You are less
sophisticated than demons.

350
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:43,625
And yet the grudges
you hold are more complex.

351
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,541
Your compulsion
to lie is unmatched.

352

You struggle desperately
your entire lives.

And carelessly trample
those in your way.

You steal and are stolen from.

355

You are hopeless.

356
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:02,500
And yet still you strive to get
over the hill and far away.

But then, I suppose...

...that's why humans
are so interesting.
