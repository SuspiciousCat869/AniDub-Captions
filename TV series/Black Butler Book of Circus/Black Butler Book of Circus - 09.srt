1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,833
No! Father!

2
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,791
[yelling]

3
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,375
[SEBASTIAN] I'm afraid
I'll have to ask you

4
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,208
to please stay out
of my young lord's way.

5
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,333
[CIEL] You see,
there are only two kinds

6
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,458
of people in this world.

7
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,916
Those who steal,
and those who are stolen from.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,333
Today I am the former:

9
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,125
the person who has come
to steal your futures

10
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,250
away from you.

11
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,208
That's all this really is.

12
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,916
[laughing]

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,166
And I can't stop you!

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,750
But, you know...

15
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,458
You'll lose something
precious tonight, too.

16
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,333
At this point,
we're professionals.

17
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,000
If anyone crosses our path
on the job for any reason,

18
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,583
we eliminate them.

19
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,666
You're the target, of course,
but you're not there.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,583
I wonder how many will be killed
while they search for you.

21
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,625
Witness elimination?

22
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,958
Exactly. Everybody,
even the servants.

23
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,208
[CIEL] My servants?

24
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,416
[chuckling]

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
What's so damn funny?

26
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,041
[CIEL] Your friends
are in for a surprise.

27
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:30,708
They're not just any servants.
They're Phantomhive servants.

28
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,541
Now, please, my lady.

29
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,625
Get back into bed
before you catch cold.

30
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,916
There is nothing to
worry about, I can assure you.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
[ELIZABETH] All right.

32
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,166
Oh my goodness!

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,416
Has the party gotten
started without me?

34
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,750
Mighty impatient, aren't we?

35
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,958
Never fear!

36
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,708
I won't be much longer, Bassy!

37
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,250
[gunshot]

38
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,791
Did you hear that sound?

39
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,166
He must have bodyguards.

40
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,500
Yeah.

41
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,000
Shouldn't be a surprise,
him being a noble and all.

42
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,291
The others are better fighters.
We can let them handle that.

43
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,708
You and I'll focus
on finding the target.

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,708
Hi, there.
I've been waitin' for ya.

45
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,833
[BALDROY] Finny was
stationed at the back door,

46
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,750
and Mey-Rin had the
side entrances covered.

47
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,291
Leavin' you just
one place to get in, see?

48
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,916
[BALDROY]
Hey, now, that's not polite!

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,458
I was talkin'!

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,958
Oi!

51
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,791
[BALDROY]
Whips ain't my thing. Sorry!

52
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,750
[BALDROY] Dammit,
everybody's a Solomon Grundy,

53
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,166
tryin' to live fast
and die young.

54
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,833
It's a real waste.

55
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,583
Better to take it easy,
don't you agree?

56
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,500
[BALDROY] Oi, Finny! Mey-Rin!

57
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,333
Let's show 'em who
they're tangling with, eh?

58
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,333
Whoa!
Who gives their maid guns?

59
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,458
What kind of place is this?

60
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,833
[FINNIAN] Upsy...

61
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,625
...daisy!

62
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,166
Dagger!

63
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,833
Off ya go.

64
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,291
[BEAST]
We can take care of them later.

65
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,416
We need to locate the target.

66
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,750
Agreed.

67
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,625
It doesn't look like we're
gonna have any choice

68
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,375
but to check every single room.

69
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,958
A bloody trap?

70
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,791
Mey-Rin, the rats
have found their way

71
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:38,791
to the drawing room.

72
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,291
Go at 'em from the west wing.

73
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,791
[MEY-RIN] Roger that.

74
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,291
Finny, you can approach 'em
from the central staircase.

75
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,375
And don't get lost, all right?

76
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,625
[FINNIAN] Yes, sir!

77
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,000
[DAGGER]
Sorry about that.

78
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,625
Quick, stand back!

79
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,416
Oh, look!
I found some rats!

80
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,875
[DAGGER]
Not this freak again.

81
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,708
Here we go!

82
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,791
Catch!

83
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,666
[BEAST] This way!

84
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,458
[DAGGER] Ow! That hurt!
Who are these bastards?

85
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,916
[FINNIAN] It'd really help
if you'd stay still!

86
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,625
[DAGGER] This way!

87
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,583
[DAGGER]
You all right, there, Beast?

88
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,291
That was close.

89
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,541
[BEAST] Yeah.

90
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,833
This place ain't right,
I tell ya. Not at all!

91
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,666
Given how well-prepared
they seem to be,

92
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,250
I'd guess the earl's already
in hiding somewhere.

93
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,541
Our best bet is
to retreat and regroup.

94
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,750
Let's hurry to
the roof and catch up

95
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,750
with Peter and Wendy.

96
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,958
Joker just had to
be gone tonight, eh?

97
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,291
I hope he's okay.

98
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,708
[BALDROY] 'Allo!

99
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,125
Poor goose and gander.

100
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,333
Must be awful tiring, wandering
upstairs and downstairs!

101
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,458
This is no
lady's chamber, though!

102
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,625
Welcome to the end
of the road: the kitchen.

103
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,791
Why should we worry
about the end of the road?

104
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,291
You're the one who's unarmed.

105
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,333
That's where you're wrong!

106
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,791
The kitchen is
a chef's sanctuary.

107
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,708
Even the butler can't
interfere in my domain!

108
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,583
It's full of tools no
bloody butler knows about.

109
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,583
[BALDROY] For example...

110
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,833
What the hell is that?

111
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,958
Let's give this girl a go!

112
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,375
Yeah!

113
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,583
It's the latest.

114
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,708
Ol' Hiram brought it
over from the States.

115
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,958
Impressive, ain't she?

116
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,083
Mark my words.
With this baby available,

117
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,083
war'll be a lot different
than it was in my day.

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,125
I've got ya!

119
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,500
This is a treat from the chef
prepared special just for you.

120
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,750
I hope you folks enjoy it!

121
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,125
[BALDROY] Well, for sheer
destruction, it's tops,

122
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,416
but the accuracy
could use some work.

123
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,291
Better tell the master
it's got a ways to go

124
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,416
before it's ready
for mass production.

125
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,958
Dagger!

126
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,625
[BEAST]
Dagger... You idiot! No!

127
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,333
It was worth it.

128
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:07,250
You're alive. Now go. Run.

129
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,791
Please, tell Joker...

130
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,958
[breathing shakily]

131
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,166
How could you?

132
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,458
Why do somefin'
like that for me?

133
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,500
Oh, Beast...

134
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,125
I just wanted
to take you...

135
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:36,250
O--Over... the hill...

136
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,125
[BEAST] Dagger!

137
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,875
I wish we coulda
met in another way.

138
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,916
Like in a pub
over a good pint, maybe.

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,875
I think that woulda
been real nice.

140
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,041
I'll make you pay!

141
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,000
[BEAST] You think you
can get away that easily?

142
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,916
No... Finny!

143
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,500
[BALDROY] That's about it
for the mise en place.

144
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,125
I did warn ya, didn't I?

145
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,416
The kitchen's a place full
of all kinds o' secrets.

146
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,083
I'll even let you in
on one of them.

147
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,583
The finer you grind up
a flammable powder,

148
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,416
the easier it is to ignite.

149
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,875
Fascinatin', innit?

150
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,375
In fact, when you get
the right concentration,

151
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,208
it's so combustible
and so diffuse

152
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:34,416
that it might as well
be an explosive gas.

153
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,791
I mean, just look what
happened across the pond!

154
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,625
There was a flour mill
accident in Minnesota

155
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,875
that sent 18 men
to meet their maker.

156
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,625
Real sorry, darlin.

157
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,458
This is our job.
Nothing personal.

158
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,250
My servants...

159
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,958
Those are actually
private soldiers

160
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,250
who were hand-picked
to guard my manor.

161
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,458
No...

162
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,958
[CIEL] They'll protect
Phantomhive secrets

163
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,583
and Phantomhive pride
from anything.

164
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,875
[CIEL] After all...

165
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,750
That's what makes
a Phantomhive servant.

166
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,875
[BEAST] Joker...

167
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,458
[GRELL] First we have Mally,

168
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,708
daughter of the
scullery maid Amelia.

169
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,083
She was born on the
22nd day of May in 1864.

170
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,750
And she died on the
ninth day of February, 1889,

171
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,916
of multiple lacerations
and blood loss

172
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,291
caused by an explosion
of considerable size.

173
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,333
Ugh! How stultifyingly
dull this is!

174
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,666
And I had such
expectations, too.

175
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,166
I thought any job here
would involve Bassy,

176
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,666
but he's gone from the manor,

177
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,958
and there's nobody about
even remotely to my taste.

178
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,666
Dull, dull, dull!

179
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,041
Spare me.

180
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,791
I am supremely uninterested
in the life and times

181
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,083
of some homely woman.

182
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,833
Wha?!

183
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,291
W-W-W-Wait a moment!

184
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,708
No!

185
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,333
Is this Bassy's type, then?

186
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,708
Ugly wenches with nothing
to brag about but large baps?

187
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,916
Oh, poo!

188
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,250
If that's really what he wants,

189
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,291
maybe I should
try curling my hair.

190
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,750
No, no! Never!
Never, I say!

191
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,791
Ugh!

192
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,666
My turn!
Trade places with me, wench!

193
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,708
Ahhh! That's so good!

194
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,708
Just like I always knew
it would be with my Bassy!

195
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,500
Those cold eyes could freeze
over the steamiest night!

196
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,083
They send a chill to
the core of my very being!

197
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,791
I love that darling
brute to death!

198
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,791
You really are a demon
when you take off

199
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,458
that fancy tailcoat of yours,
Bassy my love.

200
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,708
Someday I want
to take off that coat,

201
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,625
and not on the battlefield!

202
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,291
Uh! Oh, darling,
who knew your dapper clothes

203
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,166
hid such a body!
Oh, my goodness!

204
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,208
[laughing]

205
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,375
I must stop!

206
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,875
It may be
in a woman's nature

207
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,625
to fall into the arms
of men she knows are cruel,

208
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,875
but this time 'round, my dear,

209
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,708
you fell into the arms
of the worst man alive.

210
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,041
Just be glad you
had fun before the end,

211
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,916
you ugly old sow.

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,583
"Completed.
Nothing of note to report."

213
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,666
Ugh. I've watched
so many ugly Records today,

214
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,416
I think I may actually be
starting to stink of ugly.

215
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,916
I'd love to nip home
for a hot shower.

216
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,083
As long as you remain
by that brat's side,

217
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,208
my darling death
will never be far away.

218
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,500
Here's hoping
we'll have the chance

219
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,708
to fight another
passionate death match

220
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,875
the next time
we meet, dear Bassy!

221
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,833
[chainsaw revving]

222
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,333
Private... soldiers?

223
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,375
The Phantomhives
are shadows that exist

224
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,833
to dispel any
concerns Her Majesty has

225
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,708
regarding the underworld.

226
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,250
Once you enter our den,
all hope is lost.

227
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,125
You shall never again
return to the light.

228
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,791
We're professionals too.
And quite good.

229
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,291
It won't be easy to--

230
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,375
[SEBASTIAN] You're free to
believe as you like, of course.

231
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,791
But lest you get too optimistic,

232
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,458
you should keep in mind
that I hired them.

233
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,041
[JOKER] You're my only family.

234
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,791
Please live. Even if I cannot.

[JOKER]
What choice did we have?

236
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,208
What else should we have done?

237
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:43,083
Like Tom the piper's son,
we can only play one tune.

238
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,583
All other roads
were closed to us.

239

[JOKER] If... If only...

240
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,208
If we'd been born
in some other country.

241
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,625
Or if...

242
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:02,625
If our bodies...
hadn't been broken...

243
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,916

[JOKER sobbing]

Don't cry, it's pathetic.

246
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,583
Crying won't change a thing.

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,875
It doesn't matter who you are.

Smile, please don't...

250
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,500
I only have one name,
and that is not it.

251
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,166
I am Ciel, Earl Phantomhive.

252

I'm late, but I'm
not empty-handed.

What's this?

You're here? That's odd.

Go, Doc!

257
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,000
Leave now. Hurry!

They work together
as the Queen's guard dog!

Oh? You're the ones?

260
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,083
How interesting.

261
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,708
[JOKER] Run, now!
Get out while you can!

262

[DOC] Me? Why should I?

263
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,208
You and your circus freaks
are the kidnappers.

264
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,666
I only performed the services

265
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,166
the good Baron Kelvin
hired me for.

266
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,541
I have no reason to run.

267
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,833
What's going on?

268
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,333
Your legs, they're not...

269
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,458
You can walk?

270
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,666
Sorry?

271
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,583
Ah right, yes,
oh they're perfectly sound.

272
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,083
I just find the chair useful.

273
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,916
Children seem to trust me
more easily when I'm in it.

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,333
Lord Kelvin!

275
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,458
Well... I know a
lost cause when I see one.

276
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,833
What a shame that is.

277
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,000
Do you know how long it took me

278
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,500
to find a patron
who shared my ideals?

279
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,583
Your ideals?

280
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,375
[DOC] Oh, absolutely.

281
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,333
I've been toiling away
for years now,

282
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,416
trying to create
the perfect prosthetic.

283
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,125
And I have!

284
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,458
Yes. After mountains
of research,

285
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:57,333
I finally discovered
the perfect material.

286
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,416
Something lighter
and stronger than wood

287
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,291
and possessing the uniquely
sterile beauty of ceramic.

288
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:07,750
I created what no crafter
before me had been able to.

289
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,833
Although...

290
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,208
There is a problem
with the material

291
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,416
in that it is a
touch hard to come by.

292
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,708
Yes, now that you mention it,

293
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,250
I do recall your
prosthetics having

294
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,583
the most marvelous texture.

295
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,333
I would have to say
the best comparison

296
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,875
would be bone china.

297
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm gratified that you can
appreciate its beauty, Black.

298
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,041
But sadly, you are off the mark.

299
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,625
You're comparing my work
to cattle bone china.

300
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,083
It's far more special
than that, you see.

301
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,416
Yes, of course.
How inconsiderate of me.

302
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,958
You had mentioned your use
of special materials.

303
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,458
Exactly, yes! Very special!

304
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,875
Materials I can only get here.

305
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:43,750
Hold on!

306
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,250
No... They're...

307
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,583
Yes. And it saves the trouble
of dumping them somewhere.

308
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,875
Waste not, want not,
I always say.

309
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,125
[JOKER] It can't be...

310

[screaming]

311
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,208
Why must all my
patients react that way?

312
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,458
Our prosthetics!

313
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,000
All this time
we've been wearing...

314
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,541
Come now, Joker.

315
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,708
You've always been so pleased

316
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,166
with the right hand
I made just for you.

317
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,791
If I had known,
I would never have wanted it.

318
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,333
You'd have turned down
a working hand?

319
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,916
Are you sure?

320
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,000
How tragic.

321
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,875
With Baron Kelvin's death,
I will find myself unemployed.

322
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,041
Oh, I say!

323
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,833
Lord Phantomhive, there's you.

324
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,416
Would you hire me, perhaps?

325
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,125
Better still, introduce me
to Her Majesty?

326
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,250
She is getting on
in years, right?

327
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,583
Surely she could use a little
maintenance, so to speak.

328
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,916
You've seen my work.
I'm very good.

329
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,291
You could give me
a reference, eh?

330
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,500
Don't you dare sully the
Queen's name with your mouth.

331
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,583
Oh, no!

332
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,166
Not another man
of limited imagination

333
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,083
who cares more about the process
than about the results.

334
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,375
Everyone always sings my praises
until they know the details.

335
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,875
Not the baron, though.
He was different.

336
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,000
His only concern was beauty.

337
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,166
He spared no expense

338
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,750
when it came to
my materials and costs.

339
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,458
He was the finest patron
a man could ask for.

340
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,583
He understood that
making the finest product

341
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,625
requires the finest ingredients.

342
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,000
Something one would think
was common sense.

343
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,708
[YOUNG CIEL yelling]

344
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,208
A cow's bones
are fine to use,

345
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,583
but a human's aren't?

346
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,416
[YOUNG CIEL]
Somebody... help me!

347
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,250
Now who decided that? Not me!

348
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,666
[YOUNG CIEL] Somebody!

349
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:56,791
[YOUNG CIEL] Anyone at all.
I don't care who.

350
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,333
Save us all!

351
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,541
[screaming]

352
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,791
[YOUNG CIEL] Stop it!

353
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,916
[retching]

354
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,208
Please, st--
Somebody...

355
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,250
[SEBASTIAN] My Lord...

356
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,625
Surely there is
nothing left to fear.

357
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,666
You're outside the cage.
Its bars no longer hold you.

358
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,875
It is over.

359
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,208
Now...

360
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,583
All you need do is call my name.

361
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,916
[CIEL] Se... bast...

362
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:43,791
Sebastian! Sebastian! Sebastian!

363
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,708
I want them to die!

364
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,250
Kill them!

365
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,000
It's over now, my lord.

366
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,791
Burn it down.

367
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,958
Burn it?

368
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,375
You mean this manor?

369
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,208
[CIEL] That's right.

370
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,583
Pardon me, master.

371
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,458
May I remind you of
Her Majesty's letter?

372
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,333
I was under the
impression that her desire

373
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,875
was that we locate
the kidnappers

374
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,333
and return the children safely.

375
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,375
The guilty are dead, but--

376
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,041
[CIEL] Shut up, shut up!

377
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,250
Don't leave anything!

378
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,125
Burn everything here
down to ash!

379
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,166
Do you understand me?!
Am I making myself clear?!

380
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,916
This is an order!

381
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,916
Burn it down.
Yes, my lord.

382
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,708
[SEBASTIAN]
Ladies and gentlemen!

383
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,041
There is only one act remaining

384
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,041
in this circus troupe's
performance.

385
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,458
Its end may be unpalatable,
even grisly,

386
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,541
but you mustn't avert your eyes.

387
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,875
After all, there is
a bit of them in you.
