1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,166
[CIEL]
Once we search the

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,750
first-tier performers' tents,
we can go home.

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,541
My initial plan
was to work our way

4
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,958
quietly up the ladder.

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,500
But with these
wretched conditions,

6
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,666
I simply can't last that long.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,958
I'm already
approaching my limit.

8
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,708
[SEBASTIAN] Personally,
I would find brute force

9
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,291
easier than infiltration.

10
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,041
The reaper keeps me
from moving freely at night.

11
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,208
Unfortunately, the fact
that the reaper is here

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,708
isn't enough to prove
the circus guilty of anything.

13
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,458
So behave yourself for now.

14
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,500
Yes.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,916
The time to strike
is during a show,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,333
when we can expect them all
to be away from their tents.

17
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,291
Before anything, I need
to find a way to slip free

18
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,458
of that freckled chap
who tails me everywhere.

19
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,541
If I can't assess the
tent's contents personally,

20
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,125
there's no point.

21
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,458
[CIEL] I want to go home.

22
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,541
I'm long overdue
for something sweet.

23
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,666
[SEBASTIAN]
I think you would benefit

24
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,125
from a nice hot
cup of tea, as well.

25
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,500
[WENDY] Where's my headpiece?

26
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,708
Has anyone seen it?

27
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,666
Here you are.

28
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,125
Oi, there aren't enough knives!

29
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,500
Hurry up with those spares.

30
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,541
[CIEL] Here!

31
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,333
Right, you lot!

32
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,333
It's almost show time,
so look lively!

33
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,375
Come on!

34
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,125
At this rate, I may
collapse from exhaustion

35
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,750
before I even have a
chance to check the tents.

36
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, sorry!
What can I do nex--

37
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,416
[CIEL] Sebastian!

38
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,333
I managed to
lose Freckles somehow.

39
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,708
Let's check the tents
while we have the chance.

40
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,625
We should only need
ten minutes or so.

41
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,458
Of course. Yes, my lord.

42
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,208
[JOKER] Black!

43
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,500
We've got a problem.

44
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,875
Wendy here seems to
have twisted her ankle.

45
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,750
Show's already started,
so I need yeh ta get in there

46
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,375
and take her place
on the trapeze.

47
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,958
[SEBASTIAN] But surely
I'm not a fit substitute.

48
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,083
From what I seen you do,

49
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,083
I'd say yer more
than fit for the job.

50
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,166
We're counting on yeh,
yeh understand?

51
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,708
And there isn't
much time afore the act,

52
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,791
so yeh'll need
ta be quick about it!

53
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,625
[SEBASTIAN]
He leaves me little choice.

54
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,666
My lord. I must attend to this.

55
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,208
We'll find another chance.

56
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,583
My lord?

57
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,791
We don't know if there
will even be another chance.

58
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,708
Freckles follows me around
every second of the day.

59
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,958
You may be
needed in the show,

60
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,125
but I should have some time.

61
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,041
The only trouble is the snakes.

62
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,375
All right, then.

63
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,000
Come. We must move quickly.

64
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,250
[SEBASTIAN] Yes, my lord.

65
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,208
I believe that
should be all of them.

66
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,416
According to the program,
your act ends at seven fifty,

67
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,333
and the encore
is at eight o'clock.

68
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,291
If that schedule is correct,

69
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,041
then that should allow you
roughly a ten-minute window.

70
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,041
To do what?

71
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,541
[CIEL]
As soon as your act ends,

72
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,541
come and release the snakes,
then return for the encore.

73
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,375
I'll take this opportunity
to look through their tents.

74
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,458
But are you certain you shall
be all right by yourself?

75
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,625
I'll be fine.

76
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,458
Now hurry on back
to the show tent.

77
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,250
They'll be getting suspicious.

78
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,375
[SEBASTIAN]
Very good, my lord.

79
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,500
At once.

80
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,791
I don't understand.

81
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,708
I thought Wendy
was the only one injured.

82
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,833
Well, yeah, but you
can't very well expect Peter

83
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:09,916
to hold your weight, can you?

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,625
And this was the best solution?

85
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,708
I can't begin to express
my distaste for this idea.

86
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,625
While I don't much
care for it, either,

87
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,041
what option have we?

88
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,875
[WILLIAM]
Working with vermin like him!

89
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,666
How could I have sunk so low?

90
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,708
Honestly!

91
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,833
[SEBASTIAN]
Half seven. Almost time.

92
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,250
[CIEL] These are rather
sparsely decorated quarters.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,250
[CIEL] An old photograph.

94
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,041
Are these the main performers?

95
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,791
[CIEL] Who is that?

96
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,333
What precisely are you doing?

97
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,875
They can tell me
to perform with you,

98
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:52,083
but I would sooner die than
take your filthy hands, vermin.

99
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,500
[SEBASTIAN] This won't make
for a very good show.

100
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,541
[WILLIAM] Hmph!

101
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,958
There just swinging up there!

102
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,500
What're they doing?

103
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,083
Ugh! My bodice.

104
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,208
[BEAST] Oh! My bodice!

105
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,291
Ah, nothing to see here!

106
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,833
Move along! Nobody look!

107
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,750
[DAGGER]
Er, you can go change, Beast.

108
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,166
There's time before the encore.

109
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,083
[BEAST] I suppose I should.

110
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,875
[SEBASTIAN] Oh dear.

111
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,750
[CIEL] That's him again.

112
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,625
This is the same man
who was in the other photograph.

113
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,541
Will you stop this nonsense
and put out your hands?

114
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,666
I meant what I said before.

115
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,250
I'd sooner die!

116
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,416
My fingers might rot off.

117
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,625
[SEBASTIAN] Oh, very well.

118
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,375
In that case,
I shall simply improvise!

119
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:51,000
[CROWD gasping]

120
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,125
[BEAST]
The crowd sounds mighty excited.

121
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,791
[CIEL] That sign behind them.

122
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,125
It says "workhouse".
An orphanage?

123
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,000
[CROWD gasping]

124
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,875
Unhand my death scythe now!

125
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,500
I don't think I will.

126
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,875
[CROWD gasping]

127
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,083
Careful!

128
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,791
[WILLIAM] I said let go!

129
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,250
Oh, all right.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,791
[CROWD cheering]

131
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,833
[cheering continues]

132
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,333
[JOKER] Although,
we first-tier performers

133
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,208
all come from the same place.

134
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,708
[CIEL]
So that's what he meant.

135
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,708
They literally came
from the same place--

136
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,250
The same workhouse.

137
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,958
[CIEL] Well and good.

138
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,166
But where is that, exactly?

139
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,416
Maybe there's a
better image of it in here.

140
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,875
[BEAST]
Blasted thing ripping on me.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,916
And it was my favorite.

142
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,375
[BEAST] Well, this'll do.

143
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,416
[SEBASTIAN] A good thing
I returned ahead of schedule.

144
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,833
I thought you might need me.

145
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,541
Yes. Now get off, will you?

146
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,750
[SEBASTIAN] Interesting.

147
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,208
You think these
photographs you've found

148
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,750
are important, then?

149
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,208
Yes. Here, take a look.

150
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,416
Do you notice anything?

151
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,041
I do, actually.

152
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,208
The imprint
from this signet ring.

153
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,708
I think I've seen it recently.

154
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:59,041
[CIEL] Signet ring? Imprint?

155
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,208
You mean you can make out
details that small?

156
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,083
[SEBASTIAN] Yes.

157
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,750
Now then, if memory serves,

158
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,333
this matches the seal at the
joint of Beast's prosthetic leg.

159
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,125
[CIEL] The signet ring,
the seal, the workhouse.

160
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,666
We need to know more.

161
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,333
Who is this man?

162
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,833
It's almost eight o'clock now.

163
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,041
I think we had
better stop for today.

164
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,708
I need to free the snakes
before the encore begins.

165
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,875
[CIEL] I still have to
look through Joker's tent.

166
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:25,958
[SEBASTIAN] My lord.

167
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,291
[CIEL]
I should be able to manage it.

168
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,583
I think the encore will
give me just enough time.

169
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,375
I want all of this
to be over today.

170
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,625
You'll need to go back
so they don't suspect us.

171
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,625
After the encore,
simply return to the tents

172
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,041
before they do
and set the snakes free.

173
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,250
Now move!

174
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,125
Yes, my lord.

175
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,250
[CIEL] His dress marks him as
either wealthy or a nobleman.

176
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,666
Given that he appears
in photographs

177
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,875
with workhouse children,
he could be a philanthropist.

178
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,833
A letter?

179
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,708
It's labeled
"Tom, the piper's son."

180
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,333
The Mother Goose character?

181
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,458
[gasps]

182
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,458
[CIEL]
What the devil is going on?!

183
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,166
This is my name!

184
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,041
Well done, everyone!
Good show!

185
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,458
Oi, where did Black go?

186
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,791
He ran off
right after the encore

187
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,750
without so much
as a "by your leave".

188
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,416
Maybe he needed
to go take a piss, eh?

189
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,291
[JOKER]
Haha, could be!

190
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,333
Might've even leaked
a little up there!

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,500
[snakes hissing]

192
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,750
[CIEL]
This doesn't make sense!

193
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,083
What is my name
doing in this letter?

194
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,958
Surely they aren't onto us.

195
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,708
[outside chattering]

196
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,958
Oh hell, it's the main cast.

197
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,416
Are they back already?

198
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,458
[JOKER]
I'm feelin' a mite peckish.

199
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,416
[DAGGER] Let's go eat, then!

200
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,166
[CIEL] I should've
stopped searching sooner.

201
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,375
I have to get back
without being seen.

202
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,458
[gasps]
[snake hissing]

203
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,250
Oi.

204
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,958
What do you
think you're doing?

205
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,375
[DOLL] Don't move.

206
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,541
Sebastia--

207
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,125
Be quiet.

208
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,916
Oi, Doll!

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,208
What are you waiting for?

210
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,750
Come on and get changed
so we can go--

211
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,750
One of Snake's
snakes was loose.

212
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,041
He needs to be more careful.

213
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,458
We've told him
not to let them out.

214
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,208
Snake! Get this
blasted creature of yours!

215
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,250
[DOLL] I don't like risking
my life just by walking around.

216
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,083
Please keep them
locked up, mate.

217
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,166
Well, I'm off to the mess tent.

218
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,375
Come with me.

219
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,166
Move faster.

220
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,166
[DOLL] Don't touch the rope.

221
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,875
[DOLL] Right, we should
be in the clear now.

222
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,041
[CIEL coughing]

223
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,291
Thanks, but why
did you help me?

224
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,250
You still haven't
figured it out, eh?

225
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,416
Let me show you.

226
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,791
It's me.

227
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,041
[gasps]

228
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,666
Freckle-face, it's you?

229
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,916
Hey, now, is that
any way to address a lady?

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,583
You're a bloke, but you
wear a dress on stage?

231
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,666
[DOLL] You are very rude,
aren't you?

232
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,666
I'm a genuine maid, thank you.

233
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,291
Here, I'll prove it.

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,083
There, see?

235
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,958
Want to have a look-see
down below while you're at it?

236
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,333
No, thank you!

237
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,458
So what were
you doing back there

238
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,000
around Snake's tent, anyway?

239
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,791
They must've told you
it was dangerous.

240
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,625
[CIEL]
Well, I--

241
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,875
[CIEL] I'll have to lie.

242
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,958
An unsavory cover story
will be most convincing.

243
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,458
You caught me! I'm sorry!

244
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,125
But I haven't stolen
anything today, I swear!

245
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,416
I'll be good, I promise!

246
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,041
Only please don't run me off!

247
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,333
What are you--Wait, "today"?

248
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,583
[CIEL]
I might as well tell you.

249
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,958
I lived on the East End
before I became a page.

250
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,583
I did whatever
I had to to get by.

251
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,416
I know that stealing is wrong,

252
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,458
but old habits
are hard to shake.

253
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,916
My last master gave me the sack!

254
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,375
If the circus turns me out,

255
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,541
I'll have to go back to
scraping by on the East End!

256
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,166
[CIEL] Oh, drat.

257
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,916
I may have laid
it on a bit thick.

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,500
[DOLL] You swear you didn't
take anything just now?

259
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,708
Yes! I swear on my life!

260
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,625
Well, all right.

261
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,250
I don't know
how to thank you!

262
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,666
[DOLL] It's fine.

263
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,958
Guess I owe you one, anyhow.

264
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,041
We've all got
our secrets, don't we?

265
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,750
I certainly understand that.

266
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,541
And I've been feeling rotten
about what I did to you earlier.

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,958
Tell you what.

268
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,666
I'll keep this quiet
from the others.

269
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,666
That'll make us even.

270
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,375
But no more sneaking about,
all right?

271
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,041
Or I will have to say something.

272
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,166
[CIEL] Got it!

273
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,541
[coughs]

274
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,416
So, uh...

275
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,125
If you don't mind me asking...

276
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,833
Why are you sharing my tent?

277
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,416
You're in the main cast.

278
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,166
[DOLL] Well, truth is...

279
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,166
I don't like sleeping alone.

280
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,458
It's easier for me to sleep when
there's somebody else nearby.

281
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,708
Hey, will you still
share a tent with me

282
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,125
now that you know who I am?

283
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,750
Yes. Of course!

284
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,583
[Oh, that's good.

285
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,916
Right then, what happened here

286
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
stays between
the two of us, yeah?

287
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,041
Yes.

288
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,541
[CIEL] Words are cheap.

289
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,500
There's no guarantee
she won't tell anybody.

290
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,625
Why wouldn't she?

291
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,208
Humans lie like
it's second nature.

292
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,000
[CIEL]
Myself included, of course.

293
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,083
[CIEL coughing]
[SEBASTIAN] My Lord!

294
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,125
Bastard!

295
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,708
One of those
blasted poisonous snakes

296
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,125
could have easily bitten me!

297
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,875
You knew I was
still there, didn't you?

298
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,708
[coughing]

299
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,458
Yes.

300
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,250
You did tell me to return
before the others and free them.

301
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,541
I was only
following your orders.

302
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,250
Is there a problem with that?

303
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,291
Really, now!
What are you glaring about?

304
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,000
Rest assured, my lord.

305
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,333
I won't let you die.

306
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,250
Not while our
contract is in effect.

307
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,583
But if you give
the wrong orders,

308
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,583
you may be in
for some suffering.

309
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,958
Of the non-fatal variety,
of course.

310
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,333
But you already knew that.

311
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,583
Every game should have
an element of danger to it.

312
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,291
You're such an
avid player yourself,

313
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,916
I just assumed you shared
my opinion on the matter.

314
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,166
Ha!

315
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,208
You know what I'd call
your stupid little game?

316
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,375
Demonic.

317
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,166
You do flatter me.

318
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,541
Oh, never mind.

319
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,625
What's of greater import now
is the letter I found

320
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,541
in Joker's tent
mentioning my name.

321
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,083
[coughs]

322
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,291
It included my rank and the
location of my family estate.

323
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,958
There was even a brief
biographical sketch.

324
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:15,875
As for the sender, he--

325
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,208
[WILLIAM] Mind yourself.

326
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,458
[CIEL] Ow!

327
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,125
You are three
centimeters into my territory.

328
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,916
That is unacceptable.

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,791
The master must observe
our agreed-upon boundaries.

330
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,375
If he fails to do so, what's to
distinguish him from the dog?

331
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,708
[coughs]

332
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,333
[CIEL] Come, Sebastian.
Let's go outside.

333
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,458
[SEBASTIAN] Certainly.

334
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,083
[CIEL] Anyway, as I was saying,

335
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,708
the sender used the name
"Tom, the piper's son."

336
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,375
[SEBASTIAN] A character from
a Mother Goose tale, isn't it?

337
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,291
[CIEL] Yes, though it seems
like a strange alias.

338
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,416
[coughs]

339
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,333
Also, the wax was
sealed with a crest

340
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,250
bearing a horse
and the letter K.

341
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,416
[SEBASTIAN] Indeed?

342
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,791
Then it's the same
as the seal that I saw.

343
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,583
Signet rings
are generally engraved

344
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,791
with a motif and
initial that represent

345
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,458
the bearer or his family.

346
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,375
[CIEL] Yes.

347
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,958
[SEBASTIAN] And that means...

348
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:08,250
Tom the piper's son must have a
coat of arms featuring a horse.

349
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,833
The equine motif could indicate
someone awarded a knighthood,

350
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,708
or perhaps even a soldier?

351
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,750
[CIEL coughs]

352
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,500
[CIEL] Possible,
but not necessarily.

353
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,333
He must have
some status, though.

354
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,875
If he is a philanthropist,
that would be essential.

355
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,375
The heraldic authorities
have all coats of arms

356
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,708
in their registers.

357
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,000
We have enough criteria
to narrow it down.

358
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,958
So however many there may be...

359
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,083
[coughs]

360
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,083
You should be able to
identify the correct one.

361
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,041
The missing children,
the circus,

362
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,708
Tom the piper's son, and me.

363
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,958
They're connected some--

364
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,083
[coughing]

365
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,416
My Lord?

366
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,625
[CIEL] We'll have to go back.

367
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,291
The town house will have--

368
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,750
[coughing]

369
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,708
[SEBASTIAN] My Lord!

370
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,041
My Lord! What is happening?

371
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,375
[CIEL wheezing]

372
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,208
What's going on? Smile!

373
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,416
What's wrong?

374
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,791
It's an asthmatic fit.

375
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,875
Asthma? Are you certain?

376
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,583
We've lived together
for three years now

377
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,333
and I've never known
anything of the sort

378
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,250
to afflict him before today.

379
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,791
[DOC] If he hasn't had
an attack in three years,

380
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,958
he may be more or less cured.

381
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,166
But sometimes patients relapse

382
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,875
if they catch a cold or
experience sudden stress.

383
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,250
He has had colds before.
They weren't like this.

384
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,875
[DOC]
It seems probable there were

385
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,083
multiple triggers this time.

386
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,250
And I hear he had
a bath outside earlier

387
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,083
with the rest of those loons.

388
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,916
It's no wonder he took a chill!

389
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,333
Wa... ter.

390
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,041
Awake, then, are you?

391
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,666
Here, drink this.

392
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,833
[coughs]

393
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,000
Tell me, Smile.

394
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,666
Has this sort of thing
happened before?

395
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,791
Were you asthmatic as a child?

396
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,875
Asthma can be deadly,

397
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,041
so even if he hasn't
had a fit in some time,

398
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,500
you must remain vigilant.

399
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,416
Aunt Angelina...

400
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,625
[DOC] Not good.

401
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,458
His mind appears to be muddled.

402
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,083
We shall have to keep a sharp
watch until the fever goes down.

403
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,916
I'll fetch ice!
Be right back!

404
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,708
And what about you,
then, Black?

405
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,416
I'd like to stay and help
if it's no trouble to you.

406
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,125
[DOC] I'd be much obliged.

407
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,625
[JOKER] What's that?

408
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,541
Black and Smile snuck in?
After what?

409
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,250
[SNAKE] "Now that I'm afraid
I couldn't tell you, my boy,"

410
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,583
says Wordsworth.

411
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,000
Are you serious?

412
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,916
You really think your serpent
friends speak to you?

413
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,916
"How dare you presume to
doubt my word, you simpleton!"

414
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,916
says Wordsworth Longfellow.

415
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,708
You might have mentioned
this ability before,

416
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,958
don't ya think?

417
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,916
"I did suggest that we
report it straight away,"

418
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,416
says Emily.

419
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,500
Well, never mind
that now, thanks,

420
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,958
and off to bed with all of yeh.

421
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,000
[SNAKE] "Good night, old chap."

422
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,208
"Do sleep well."

423
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,791
Come, Wordsworth Longfellow,
Emily.

424
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,125
[JOKER] This isn't good.

425
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,000
They might suspect something.

426
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,000
That Doll is a bleedin' fool.

427
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,166
I told ya we never
should've brung her!

428
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,708
She's too young to be anything
but a bloody nuisance.

429
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,416
So who are Black and Smile?

430
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,708
And what are they after?

431
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,791
[PETER] I say we should
get rid of them.

432
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:35,791
Maybe tonight.

433
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,375
No that's a bad idea.

434
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,250
[PETER] Why?

435
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,500
[JOKER] Jumbo's right.

436
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,500
If they're with the Yard,

437
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,000
killing them
will draw attention.

438
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,875
And that'd put us
in a right big bind.

439
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,333
[JUMBO] At the very least, we'd
have to break up the troupe.

440
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,833
Go our separate ways.

441
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,750
[JOKER] Right you are.
What to do?

442
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,000
I think I should be
asking Father.

443
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,666
I'll be on me way now.

444
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,000
But remember, what Father
wants most is the target.

445
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,416
So keep an eye on those two.

446
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,750
If they get up to anything...

447
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,333
[JUMBO] We know what to do.

448
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,208
[PETER] If they start causing
trouble, we'll move without you.

449
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,833
[CIEL coughing]

450
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,541
Sebastian.

451
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,791
[DOC] How is our patient doing?

452
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,375
[SEBASTIAN]
He still seems poorly.

453
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,875
I thought as much.

454
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,375
I just remembered that mint oil
can help with these fits.

455
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,750
I should have some.

456
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,708
If I can find it.

457
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,083
[CIEL] This is an order.

458
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,583
Go to the heraldic authorities
and identify the man

459
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,625
who was wearing the signet ring.

460
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,750
The registers are located
in London and Edinburgh.

461
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,166
If I attempt to go with you now,

462
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,250
the doctor will
likely make a fuss.

463
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,791
Come back in the morning.

464
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,125
Fetch me then.

465
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,708
[SEBASTIAN] Yes, my lord.

466
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,875
[DOC] There we are!
Found it at last.

467
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,958
Now we'll just pour
some on a rag and--Er.

468
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,000
Hello?

469
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,750
[DOC] Finally asleep, are we?

470
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,791
[SEBASTIAN] Very well.

471
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,541
I think I shall begin
with the clo--

472
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,166
[SEBASTIAN]
You're interfering again?

473
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,708
Well, this won't do at all.

474
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,416
[WILLIAM]
And where are you going?

475
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,250
You aren't to be
wandering about

476
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,666
without your master...

477
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,208
Now, are you?

478
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,166
[SEBASTIAN] You seem to
have a rather large number

479
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,666
of vipers, Snake.

480
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,791
Do they all have names?

481
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,916
[SNAKE] "Of course we do!"
says Wilde.

482
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,750
"I'm Goethe."
"I'm Emily!"

483
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,083
"Wordsworth Longfellow here!"

484
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,541
[SEBASTIAN] I could
