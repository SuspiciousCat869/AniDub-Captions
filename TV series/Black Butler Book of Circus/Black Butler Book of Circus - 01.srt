1
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,875
[CIEL]
Somebody, please help...

2
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,625
[CIEL]
Anyone at all.

3
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:27,208
I don't care who.
Please, just come!

4
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,708
Save us all!

5
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,875
[SEBASTIAN] You have
summoned me here today.

6
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,000
That can never be changed.

7
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:41,375
And nothing sacrificed
can ever be regained.

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,166
Now choose.

9
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,125
[CIEL]
Then I choose.

10
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,333
[SEBASTIAN]
A butler's day begins early.

11
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,041
He must set to work
before anyone else--

12
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,333
Ironing his master's newspaper,

13
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,875
and preparing the
morning tea service.

14
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,666
[SEBASTIAN] He does whatever
necessary to ensure

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,125
the continuity and comfort
of his master's daily life.

16
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,583
[SEBASTIAN] It is all part
of the butler aesthetic.

17
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:34,500
Young lord, 'tis time
to rise and greet the day.

18
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,500
[yawns]

19
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,583
Ceylon, is it?

20
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,208
Spot on, as ever.

21
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,416
I took the liberty
of bringing you

22
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,666
a Ringtons varietal
this morning.

23
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,458
Today begins
with a dance lesson.

24
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,583
Your instructor is Mrs. Mayerl.

25
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,708
After lunch,
you'll look over proposals

26
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:19,000
from the Funtom Company's
toy and confectionery divisions.

27
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,833
[SEBASTIAN] Finally, at six
o'clock you have a meeting

28
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,166
with Mr. Cedric Brandel
of the Brandel Tea Company.

29
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,083
Also in attendance
will be Mr. Lau

30
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,458
of the Chinese trading
company Kun-Lun.

31
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,208
What does Brandel want?

32
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,166
Apparently his company is
planning to host a tea salon.

33
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,333
He would like to acquire a
variety of Funtom products

34
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,416
to sell to the children
who will be in attendance.

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,166
We can't refuse an acquaintance
of Lau's out of hand.

36
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,375
Extend him every courtesy.

37
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,375
Quite, yes, my lord.

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,666
[CIEL] I can't say
I'm looking forward to it.

39
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,125
[SEBASTIAN] Indeed,
but it wouldn't do

40
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,208
to cancel the meeting.

41
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,625
[CIEL] No, not the meeting.

42
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,583
It's the dance lesson
that I dread.

43
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,041
Ah yes, of course.

44
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,875
We can cancel that
if you would prefer

45
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,625
to show the Lady Elizabeth your
patented "Staggering Waltz"

46
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,208
at the Queen's Ball next month.

47
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,416
I'm certain she would be duly
impressed with your originality.

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,166
Don't be so cheeky.

49
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,666
If you'll come along,
then, young lord,

50
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,166
your dance lesson
shall proceed as planned.

51
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,250
[SEBASTIAN] Today's breakfast.

52
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,250
We have here a ham
and grapefruit salad,

53
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,166
lightly poached salmon, a soup
of roasted root vegetables

54
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,041
and some flaky croissants.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,833
[MRS. MAYERL] One, two, three,
one, two, three!

56
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:35,916
Oh, heavens!

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,083
Rather clumsy footwork, my lord.

58
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,625
Strive for more grace.

59
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,333
[MRS. MAYERL] One, two, three,
one, two, three!

60
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,041
Your tasks are as follows:

61
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,875
Mey-Rin, collect
and launder all the bed sheets.

62
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,875
Right, Sebastian!

63
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,000
[SEBASTIAN] Finny, tend to
the plants in the greenhouse.

64
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,916
Yes sir!

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
[SEBASTIAN] And Bardroy,
you will see to the bread.

66
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,750
Consider it done.

67
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,583
[SEBASTIAN] As for Tanaka...

68
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,125
Just do whatever
it is you usually do.

69
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,875
Ho ho ho!

70
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,250
Listen carefully.

71
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,041
We are expecting
some guests this evening.

72
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,375
Crikey! You know
what that means, then!

73
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,875
I'll make a special--

74
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,875
[SEBASTIAN] What that means is

75
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,083
you three will stay
quietly out of sight

76
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,250
and you will not
do anything

77
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,125
unless you have received
my express orders.

78
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,375
Keyword, quietly.

79
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,666
Now, everybody
proceed to your stations!

80
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,708
[MEY-RIN, FINNIAN, BALDROY]
Right!

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,916
[CIEL sighs]

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,166
I want something sweet,
Sebastian.

83
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,750
A cake, perhaps.

84
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,291
I think not.

85
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,125
Best not to spoil your appetite
before your dinner meeting.

86
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,458
[CIEL] I said
I want something sweet.

87
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,583
[SEBASTIAN] I've prepared
some hot chocolate for you.

88
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,541
Can you make do with that?

89
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,041
Where's the cream?

90
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,958
I've served it with toasted
nuts and some caramel syrup.

91
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:06,916
Now then, I shall begin
preparing to receive our guests.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,208
[SEBASTIAN]
First, dish selection.

93
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,875
Herend dinnerware
is lively and colorful.

94
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,875
It will help set a tone
suitable for a meeting

95
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,750
about children's products.

96
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,208
Next, to polish the
silverware until it gleams.

97
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,875
[MEY-RIN yells]

98
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,708
Perfect. What now?

99
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,291
[SEBASTIAN] Mey-Rin, whatever--

100
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,125
Oh, Sebastian, there you are!

101
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,125
What happened here?

102
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,833
[MEY-RIN] I used
thirty cups of detergent,

103
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,208
like the instructions said to,
and it's a disaster!

104
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,541
It don't make sense!

105
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,208
Read the instructions again.
Carefully.

106
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,458
[SEBASTIAN] You'll find
it's three cups. Not thirty.

107
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,833
[SEBASTIAN] Honestly,
being far-sighted isn't enough

108
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,791
to excuse such foolishness.

109
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,583
No, "carelessness"
is more correct.

110
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,916
Now, step aside.

111
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,625
[SEBASTIAN]
There, that should sort it.

112
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,916
Now do you think you're capable

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,291
of cleaning up the
laundry room by yourself?

114
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,833
Yes! Yes, I am!

115
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:21,000
[SEBASTIAN] Naturally.
Always when I'm busy.

116
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,333
[SEBASTIAN] Next,
to set the perfect table.

117
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,416
The flower arrangement
is of utmost importance.

118
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,583
I'll use a refined mix of
snowdrops and Christmas roses,

119
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,208
to evoke winter.

120
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,875
[SEBASTIAN] And the
napkins shall be folded

121
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,083
into roses to match.

122
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,541
[FINNIAN yells]

123
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,291
Finny!

124
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,333
Why is it so hot in here?

125
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,875
I'm so sorry!

126
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,541
It looked like the roses
were right about to bloom!

127
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,750
And I thought I could, you know,

128
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,166
speed 'em up by
lightin' the stove!

129
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,708
[SEBASTIAN] Carrying a
stove to the greenhouse?

130
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,791
You must be utterly brainless--

131
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,791
No. I suppose "brawny"
is more correct.

132
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,541
There's nothing else for it.

133
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:13,833
[SEBASTIAN sighs]

134
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,291
This is unfortunate.

135
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,583
I had hoped to scent
the manor with roses,

136
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,666
but that will be
quite impossible now.

137
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,083
Go on.

138
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,583
I expect you can finish
cleaning on your own.

139
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,208
Yes, I can! Right!

140
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,750
For goodness's sake,
why ever must they vex me so?

141
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,083
[SEBASTIAN] The most vital part
is the main dish.

142
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,250
Tonight we have
freshly caught pheasant,

143
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,708
sautéed with a rich
rosemary and sage paste...

144
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:46,250
...which will pair quite nicely
with a Grand Cru Champagne.

145
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,916
[BARDROY yelling]

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,666
And of course...

147
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,916
[sighs]

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,125
Let's hear it, then.

149
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,791
You might as well
explain yourself.

150
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,375
Well, I was thinkin' that since
we 'ad guests comin' an' all,

151
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,625
we should treat 'em to a
new menu, all special-like.

152
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,500
Of course.
How many times must I tell you:

153
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:10,291
Cooking requires fire, not
firepower, you colossal idiot.

154
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,125
Yes, idiot's quite correct.

155
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,791
Wait, that's what you
said first off, though.

156
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,250
Nothin's changed.

157
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,000
Here we go again. Ugh.

158
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,416
Now, use these to
patch up the hole in the wall.

159
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,916
And, meanwhile--

160
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,291
I'll just be confiscating this.

161
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,958
[SEBASTIAN]
It's always something.

162
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,000
With all these interruptions,

163
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,166
I've barely
gotten anything done.

164
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,166
And look at that.

165
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,000
The guests will be
arriving at any moment.

166
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,958
I must pick up the pace.

167
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,916
It's almost time now.
Are you ready, Brandel?

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,666
[BRANDEL chuckling]

169
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,291
Something amuses you?

170
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,125
[BRANDEL] This'll work. Yes.

171
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,916
[chuckles]

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,458
When the dust settles today,
I shall be the victor.

173
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,875
Yes, that's right!

174
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,166
I shall succeed, even against
the Earl Phantomhive!

175
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,875
My, no need to work yourself
into such a lather, is there?

176
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,583
No, of course not.
You're quite right.

177
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,500
[laughs]

178
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,125
[LAU] Though it's
when your guard is down

179
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,625
that the dog is
most likely to bite.

180
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,041
[LAU] I confess,
I am most interested to see

181
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,833
how the events of the evening
will play out, my lord.

182
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,333
[CIEL] Welcome to
the Phantomhive estate.

183
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,375
[CIEL]
I am Ciel Phantomhive,

184
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,625
the current earl
and family head.

185
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,666
Such a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

186
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,666
I am Cedric Brandel.

187
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,375
I had not imagined you
quite so youthful, my lord.

188
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,208
I told you there was
no need to feel intimidated.

189
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,708
He's ever so small
and precious isn't he?

190
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,875
Quite.

191
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,916
I've had a small
dinner prepared for us.

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,833
If you'll follow me, please.

193
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,958
[BRANDEL] Oh! How lovely!

194
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,750
I could have simply set
out some aperitifs, of course,

195
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,000
but I thought this presentation
would be more the thing.

196
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,375
[MEY-RIN] Er, if you'll
excuse me, master.

197
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,916
I've the hors d'oeuvres.

198
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,583
[MEY-RIN] Shakin' like a leaf!

199
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,625
[yells]

200
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,583
So... what just happened?

201
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,041
Please pardon me,
lady and gentlemen.

202
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,833
This particular vintage
is a bit on the bubbly side,

203
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,208
so I made the
last-minute decision

204
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,041
to give it a nice decanting.

205
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,333
Please have a seat
and I shall bring you a glass.

206
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,291
[LAU] I say, good show!

207
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,416
You'd leap to stardom
in any acrobatics troupe

208
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,916
with that trick.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,833
Heavens! Me, a star?

210
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,291
Surely you jest.

211
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,666
I appreciate the compliment,

212
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,208
but I'm simply
one hell of a butler.

213
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,583
[BRANDEL] My lord.

214
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,666
I must say, your home provides
no end of surprises.

215
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,208
The manor is so beautiful.

216
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,833
I can hardly believe it
was in ashes three years ago.

217
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,083
I find small talk dreadfully
dull dinner conversation.

218
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,833
Let's move on to the
business at hand, shall we?

219
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,250
In the interest
of sustained profitability,

220
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,666
I'd like my company to begin
marketing to children.

221
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,208
And since children throughout
Europe know the Funtom name,

222
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,583
it would be
most advantageous

223
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,458
for me to work
with you, my lord.

224
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,791
[CIEL] Indeed.

225
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,041
Children are better
judges of both art and food

226
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,375
than most adults give
them credit for, you know.

227
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,125
Indubitably, and meeting you
only convinces me all the more.

228
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,375
I'm beginning to think
I've discovered the secret

229
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,666
to the Funtom Company's
success in that market.

230
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,416
[CIEL] Oh?

231
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,166
You're saying I'm a child, then.

232
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,250
And that's why my company
has been so successful.

233
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,250
Is that what you're
suggesting, Brandel?

234
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,375
Oh, no!

235
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,166
Why, I would never
imply such a thing.

236
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,708
Easy. I'm only joking.

237
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,958
[laughing]

238
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,291
My, my.

239
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,500
But you do have a
wicked sense of humor, my lord.

240
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,833
Damn that obnoxious brat,
making sport of his elders!

241
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,125
Lau, is that miserable twit
really the Queen's guard dog,

242
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,250
like they say?

243
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,708
Yes.

244
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,791
I told you as much, and you
know I'd never lie to you.

245
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,458
He ruthlessly hunts
all those who oppose him.

246
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,291
This "policeman of
England's underworld,"

247
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,666
this "villainous noble,"
this "rabid guard dog."

248
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,333
Impressive monikers for a boy.

249
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,583
We could move
weapons with little expense

250
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,208
using the trade routes
that have been established

251
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,625
by the tea companies, but no!
The ports are all too afraid

252
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:14,958
of the bloody Queen's bloody
guard dog to let me unload them.

253
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:15,958
Come.

254
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,625
Are you sure you
aren't just buying

255
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,666
into an overblown reputation?

256
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,750
How powerful
can he truly be?

257
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:26,291
Nobody will say what happens
when you oppose him.

258
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,791
I'd wager it's because
nothing actually happens.

259
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,541
What exactly do you
have planned for tonight?

260
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,583
[BRANDEL]
Why, a coup, of course!

261
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,333
At precisely eight.

262
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,125
The guard dog's
reign will be at an end!

263
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,833
England's underworld
will have a new order!

264
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,583
Sounds lovely.

265
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,958
I am so looking forward to
hearing how that plays out.

266
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh! Mr. Lau is no longer
by your side, I see.

267
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,000
He excused himself.
Pressing business to attend to.

268
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,458
You understand.

269
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,833
That man isn't
fit for polite society.

270
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,416
Indeed, it's a shame.

271
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,291
We have prepared a tasty sweet
to suggest for your tea salon,

272
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,791
and he will be
unable to sample it.

273
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,958
Most regrettable.

274
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,458
[BRANDEL]
Ah! You've piqued my curiosity.

275
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,833
[SEBASTIAN]
Allow me to present...

276
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,500
[SEBASTIAN]
...a galette des rois.

277
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,583
It should pair perfectly
with your company's

278
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,000
flavored tea selection.

279
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,000
A conventional
yet festive confection

280
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,458
served with a
thick crème de marron.

281
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,875
In accordance with tradition,

282
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,416
one slice contains
a doll known as "la fève".

283
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Whoever receives that slice
will also receive this crown,

284
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,458
and will be declared
the king of the feast.

285
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,458
Just the thing
for children, I say.

286
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,166
We think it will
be quite popular.

287
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,250
The younger set
so love to play games.

288
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,541
I know I do.

289
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,666
Oh, capital!

290
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,333
A sweet treat and a game,
all in one.

291
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,041
Leave it to a
little brat like you

292
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,458
to come up with something
an adult never would.

293
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,500
What?

294
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,083
[BRANDEL] They may call you
the queen's guard dog,

295
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,458
but all I see
is a brat showing off!

296
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,916
If there are two things in this
world I cannot abide,

297
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,833
they are cocky brats
and losing money

298
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,375
when I should be making it!

299
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,416
[clock chiming]

300
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,250
Eight o'clock!
Time for you to die!

301
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,291
[gunshot]

302
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,375
My Lord!

303
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,916
I did it! It's over!

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,958
I put down the rabid dog!

305
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,083
The underworld
has a new ruler now!

306
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:47,833
[clock chiming]

307
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,958
[gasps]

308
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,375
Sorry, Mr. Brandel.

309
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,583
Did you misplace
something of yours?

310
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,500
[CIEL laughs]

311
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,625
[CIEL] Oh, dear.

312
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,458
Had a bit too much
to drink, have you?

313
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,125
Have some cake, it should help.

314
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,833
And perhaps you should
forgo the champagne for now.

315
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes.

316
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,333
Do sit down.

317
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,333
[BRANDEL] I don't understand.

318
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,041
He should be dead by now.

319
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,583
Where are the men
I stationed outside?

320
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,833
[SEBASTIAN] Ah! My
congratulations to you, sir.

321
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,666
It seems la fève was
in your slice of galette.

322
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,541
Your friends left that
little token behind, you see.

323
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,416
I thought I should return it.

324
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,125
They arrived
earlier in the day.

325
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,041
Quite a bit before you
graced us with your presence.

326
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,500
Don't concern yourself.

327
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,458
I already gave them a
warm Phantomhive welcome.

328
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,333
[ASSASSINS gasping]

329
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,500
[ASSASSIN 1C] Who the hell?

330
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:58,958
[ASSASSIN yelling]

331
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,000
Look out!

332
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,291
It's all right.

333
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,166
I guess he didn't
notice us up here.

334
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,291
[ASSASSIN screaming]

335
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,458
[BRANDEL]
No... Th-That's impossible!

336
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,833
There were at least
fifty men out there!

337
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,916
And just--
And just one of you.

338
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,208
Lau informed me
of your side business

339
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,125
dealing guns on the
black market, you see.

340
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,166
That man actually
does have his uses.

341
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,416
Damn that rat!
He turned on me?

342
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,916
[CIEL] Not at all.

343
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
He was never actually on your
side in the first place.

344
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,958
Perhaps you are
unaware that Her Majesty

345
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,250
is distressed by the
spread of gun-related crime

346
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,041
among the underclasses.

347
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,500
Sebastian, make me
a new pot of tea.

348
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,125
These second-rate leaves
are positively foul.

349
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,166
[SEBASTIAN] Indeed.

350
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,833
I'll kill you, then!

351
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,291
[SEBASTIAN]
This simply won't do.

352
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,500
You must be more careful, sir.

353
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,500
You seem to keep
misplacing your belongings.

354
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,583
There, you see? Three more.

355
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,916
Wh-Wh-What's going on here?
What are you?

356
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,166
Oh, I'm no one
special, Mr. Brandel,

357
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,708
simply somebody
who cannot be killed

358
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,375
by the kind of toys
your lot carry around.

359
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,833
You've forgotten one
additional item, I'm afraid.

360
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,375
You're... a demon!

361
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,625
Oh my!

362
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,416
Very discerning for a human,
aren't you?

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,666
[SEBASTIAN] Yes.
As you no doubt suspect by now,

364
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,125
I am simply
one hell of a butler.

365
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,333
No! Stay away from me!

366
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,583
[CIEL] Brandel.

367
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,666
You've noticed nobody
talks about what happens

368
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,708
when the Queen's
guard dog catches you.

369
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,750
Any theories as to
why that may be?

370
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:46,125
Well, it's because dead men
tell no tales, you see.

371
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:58,958
[BRANDEL screaming]

372
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,750
I've returned, my lord.

373
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,333
All finished here?

374
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,375
Where were you all this time?

375
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,750
Well, as it happens,

376
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,875
I was waylaid by some
lads who gave me this.

377
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,875
Yes, I see.

378
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,375
Wait, who gave this to you?

379
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,708
Some funny ol' chaps dressed
in white, that's all I know.

380
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,666
They seem to have
taken me for a servant.

381
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,583
Can you imagine that, my lord?

382
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:29,916
[LAU] Curious...

383
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,375
Those appear to be tickets to

384
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,541
the traveling circus
that's coming to town.

385
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,625
The Noah's Ark Circus,
I believe they call themselves.

386
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,416
[JOKER]
Ladies and gentlemen!

387
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,250
Step right up!
It's here at last!

388
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,958
The Noah's Ark Circus
has come to town!

389
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,291
Forget the cold weather!
Let your cares slip away!

390
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,708
Get ready!

391
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,916
The show of the century
is about to begin!

392
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,375
[SEBASTIAN] You've worked
hard today, my lord.

393
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,833
You must be tired.

394
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,708
Today's game was dull.
It didn't offer any challenge.

395
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:45,208
That's likely as not because you
know that you can never lose.

396
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,041
Not with me as
your loyal chessman.

397
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,125
Loyal? Bah.
Don't make me laugh.

398
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,541
You just want my soul.

399
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,375
Yes, that is
correct, my lord.

400
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:59,083
I shall remain at your side for
as long as our contract lasts.

401
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,833
I'm yours
until the very end,

402
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,208
even should your wish
be a foolish revenge.

403
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,041
I will be here.

404
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:09,250
"Foolish revenge"? Huh.
Yes, I suppose it may be.

405
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,958
You have an extremely
full schedule tomorrow.

406
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,041
Best get a good
night's sleep, then.

407
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:23,916
[CIEL] Sebastian.

408
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,666
[CIEL] Stay in the room.

409
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,666
Just until I fall asleep.

410
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,375
Yes, my lord.

411
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,833
[SEBASTIAN]
A demon's nights are long.

412
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,000
He must keep a sharp
watch to prevent anyone

413
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,416
from harming his delicate prey.

414
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,416
Such purity must not be sullied.

415
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,333
He does whatever
necessary to ensure

416
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,791
that he will receive a soul
brimming with despair

417
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,916
when his master's
foolish desire has been met.

418
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:02,166
It is all part of the
demon aesthetic, you see.

419
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,583
[SEBASTIAN]
Good night, my lord.

420
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:07,833
Sweet dreams.

421
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,708
[CIEL] It's been
a rather long time

422
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,875
since I last
attended a circus.

423
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:14,958
[SEBASTIAN] Indeed...

424
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,708
You practice your
clowning so often,

425
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,708
I assumed you fancied
a good circus.

426
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,583
[CIEL] Pardon?

427
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,791
[SEBASTIAN] My apologies--

428
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,458
Those were dancing lessons,
weren't they?
