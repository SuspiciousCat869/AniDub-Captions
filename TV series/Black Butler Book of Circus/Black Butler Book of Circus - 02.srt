00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,166
[SEBASTIAN]
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,625
thank you for coming to visit
the Phantomhive manor today.

3
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,125
Alas, your timing
is unfortunate.

4
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,750
The master and I must be off.

5
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,291
We are traveling to London,

6
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,541
where we have some pressing
business matters to attend to.

7
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,916
Very serious business.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,625
It is fortunate that the
weather turned out so fine.

9
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,125
The perfect day
to go to the circus,

10
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,375
don't you think, master?

11
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,458
Circuses are generally
held in large tents,

12
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,708
aren't they?

13
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,666
Thus rendering the
weather quite irrelevant.

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,625
Bardroy. Finny. Mey-Rin.

15
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,708
The master and I will be
staying in Town for a while.

16
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,666
Do try to behave
yourselves, won't you?

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,750
Have fun!

18
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,125
You take care
of yourself, all right?

19
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,833
We'll be seein' you!

20
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,083
Please travel safely, master.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,041
[CIEL] You three.

22
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,708
[ALL gulp]

23
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,250
Remember why I hired you.

24
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,166
Look after the place well.

25
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,375
[MEY-RIN, FINNIAN, BARDROY]
Yes, my lord!

26
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,166
[QUEEN VICTORIA]
"Greetings, dear boy.

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,041
I hope you found your
Christmas holiday enjoyable.

28
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,583
My attempt to make
a Christmas pudding

29
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,875
with Phipps
was a great success.

30
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,958
I am pleased to report
that the results were met

31
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:40,416
with high praise
from John and Grey.

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,958
I hope you will have
occasion to try it sometime.

33
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:48,375
Now then, you must be curious
as to the enclosed tickets.

34
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,875
A circus is expected
to arrive in London soon.

35
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:55,208
It's a traveling troupe,
and supposedly quite good.

36
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,833
However, my sources inform me

37
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,250
that a startling number of
children have gone missing

38
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,291
from towns the
circus has visited.

39
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,083
The police are doing
all they can, to be sure.

40
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:11,416
But even so, not a single
child has been located.

41
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,916
The circumstances
are always similar.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,833
They vanish without a trace
in the middle of the night.

43
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,583
It's almost as if
they have been lured away

44
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,083
by the Pied Piper of Hamelin.

45
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,000
Is there any
sorrow that can compare

46
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,541
to that of losing
a family member?

47
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,916
Every moment must
be agony for them.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,625
It is my sincere hope
that these poor children

49
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,500
will be returned
to their families soon.

50
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,666
Victoria."

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,833
Where will you begin
your investigation, my lord?

52
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,500
The usual place, naturally.

53
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,541
[CIEL] Very convenient
that Sir Arthur is away

54
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,291
from the station
at the moment, is it not?

55
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,583
[ABBERLINE] Eh...
I'm begging you, please, stop!

56
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,291
If the commissioner
were to find out--

57
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,708
[CIEL] Best make sure
he doesn't then, eh?

58
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,875
How did you even
get up to the third floor?

59
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,041
No one asked for
your credentials?

60
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,583
Sebastian? Anything yet?

61
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,708
No bodies have been found

62
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,708
that match the
missing persons reports,

63
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,166
but I'm not certain
those reports are complete.

64
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,833
We'll leave when
you're finished copying.

65
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,791
And we might as well
borrow the photos.

66
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:48,833
--You can't do that!

67
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,125
--Ugh. Oh, tosh.
--You can't do that!

68
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,166
If you're found out,
just say that I took them

69
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,250
and you'll be fine.

70
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,916
That'd land me
in even more trouble!

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,166
Yes, well...

72
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,875
So sorry, Underline, isn't it?

73
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,541
[ABBERLINE] It's Abberline!

74
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,083
You've been very helpful,
and we thank you.

75
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,291
[gasps]

76
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,083
I am not for sale, my lord!

77
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,083
I just want those children safe.

78
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,833
And I will do whatever it takes
to ensure that happens!

79
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,125
You're willing to do
"whatever it takes," eh?

80
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,125
Very flexible of you--
You have a bright future.

81
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,666
Hey, wait!

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,500
[CIEL] I hope I'll be hearing of
your promotion soon, Abberline.

83
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,750
At least it seems
they're still being treated

84
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,041
as missing persons,
rather than murder victims.

85
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,041
Yes, as far as respectable
society is concerned.

86
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,416
But somebody in the underworld

87
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,625
may well have disposed
of them already.

88
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,833
[SEBASTIAN] Given that,
am I correct to assume

89
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,666
we'll be paying him a call?

90
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,666
I don't like it
any more than you do,

91
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,458
but when needs must, and all.

92
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,291
Let's be off.

93
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,333
Quite.

94
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,708
[CIEL]
Undertaker. Are you about?

95
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,000
[UNDERTAKER giggling]

96
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,500
[UNDERTAKER] Hello, my lord.

97
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,833
It's so lovely to see you.

98
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,875
[low rumbling noise]

99
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,416
What's it to be, then?

100
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,166
Do I finally have the
pleasure of fitting you

101
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,666
for one of my coffins?

102
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,708
[CIEL] Look, you--

103
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,666
Have a seat, my lord.

104
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,958
I've got a batch of biscuits
still fresh from the oven.

105
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,375
[UNDERTAKER]
Children's bodies, is it?

106
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,000
[SEBASTIAN] The authorities
still consider them

107
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,333
missing persons.

108
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,916
And no corpses have
turned up that we know of.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,666
Well, tragic as it may be,

110
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,750
dead children are part
and parcel of life

111
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,958
in the old underworld.

112
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,083
A fact I'm sure
you're aware of, my lord.

113
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,791
I have their
information here.

114
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,250
Look through these
and tell me if you've

115
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,750
"taken care of"
any of these children.

116
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,750
Have I seen that face before?

117
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,333
I don't know.

118
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,583
I'd wager my memory
would be a right bit sharper

119
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,875
if I had myself
a good laugh, though.

120
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,041
I think you know
what I'm after, my lord.

121
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,416
All you've got to do
is give it to me.

122
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,041
Just give me the
gift of true laughter.

123
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,208
One joke and all my
information is at your disposal.

124
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,500
[giggling]

125
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,666
See to it, will you?

126
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,125
Certainly.

127
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,541
[UNDERTAKER] Oh? Having him
do your dirty work, then?

128
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,875
That's the trouble with
you upper-crust blokes.

129
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,750
Can't do anything
without your butlers, eh?

130
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,500
Well, it's all the same to me.

131
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm only after a laugh.
Don't matter who gives it to me.

132
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:31,916
I'll take care of this.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,375
Are you quite certain?

134
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,458
[CIEL] Sebastian, wait outside.

135
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,458
Go!

136
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,125
Do not attempt
to listen to this!

137
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,541
That is an order!

138
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,750
As you wish, my young lord.

139
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,625
[UNDERTAKER laughing]

140
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,000
Who would've thought
the Earl Phantomhive

141
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,708
would have that up his sleeve?

142
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,000
That kills me!

143
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,041
[giggles]

144
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,916
Whatever did you do?

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
[CIEL] Don't ask.

146
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,125
Performing tricks
on command like that

147
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,125
for the Queen's sake, my lord.

148
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,333
You truly are a dog, aren't you?

149
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,125
Shut it. That's enough.

150
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,958
There. I've paid
your ridiculous fee.

151
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,291
Now, what do you know
about the missing children?

152
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,083
Well, nothing.

153
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,291
What?

154
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,333
None of these poor,
unfortunate little souls

155
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,875
have been my customers.

156
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,958
Nor have I heard any rumors
that match their descriptions.

157
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,083
So you're saying
you don't know a thing

158
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,250
about this, and I
came here for nothing.

159
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,916
That's not how I would put it.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,125
You see, what I know
is that I don't know.

161
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,958
[SEBASTIAN] A good point.

162
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,833
If he hasn't heard
anything about it,

163
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,333
that certainly
suggests that no one

164
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,708
in the underworld
killed them.

165
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,125
Would you not agree?

166
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,625
Yes.

167
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,125
And if their bodies haven't
been found in either circle,

168
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,291
then that suggests
they're still living.

169
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,750
In which case...

170
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,875
I suppose our only option
is to personally investigate

171
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,791
that travelling circus.

172
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,125
[CIEL]
We'll go there straight away.

173
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,833
Come, Sebastian.

174
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,125
Undertaker, contact me
if you learn anything further.

175
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,916
[UNDERTAKER]
Don't forget, my lord...

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,500
Each of us is
only given one soul.

177
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,333
Take good care of yours.

178
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,833
I hardly require such advice.

179
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,166
[UNDERTAKER]
Are you sure about that?

180
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,041
[UNDERTAKER giggling]

181
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,750
[CIEL] So this is it.

182
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
[SEBASTIAN]
It is quite elaborate.

183
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,916
[CIEL] Yes. But no more so
than any other circus.

184
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,166
[JOKER] Ladies and gentlemen!

185
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,958
Boys and girls of all ages!

186
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,083
Welcome to the
incredible, stupendous,

187
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,291
unparalleled Noah's Ark Circus!

188
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,375
I'm Joker,
this evening's ringleader.

189
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,166
A pleasure to meet yeh, it is!

190
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:19,791
[CROWD laughing]

191
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,000
A prosthesis?

192
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,833
Tonight, you're sure
to see performances

193
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,666
that'll stun and amaze yeh
and leave yeh breathless!

194
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,208
[CROWD applauding]

195
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,958
And now, with a great broze

196
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,333
from our very own
fire-breathing Jumbo,

197
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,541
the greatest show
of the century begins!

198
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,500
[JUMBO yells]

199
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,791
[JOKER] First up, we have our
two talented trapeze artists.

200
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,250
[JOKER] Peter and Wendy!

201
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,333
[JOKER] Our knife-thrower,
a perfect shot,

202
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,666
who never misses his target!

203
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:07,875
Dagger!

204
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,750
[CROWD applauding]

205
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,291
[JOKER] And now,
a daringly beautiful dance

206
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:20,041
by that rarest of rarities, our
serpent-man, the amazing Snake!

207
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,875
Their acts all seem
like standard fare to me.

208
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,875
Yes, and if there are children
being forced to perform,

209
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,416
there is no evidence
of it that I can see.

210
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,666
And our next performance...

211
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,375
If yeh'll look above yeh,
ladies and gents!

212
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,416
A death-defying walk
across the tallest tightrope

213
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,166
by the lovely
circus princess, Doll!

214
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,666
What would a circus
want with children

215
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,500
if they didn't intend
to use them as performers?

216
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,750
Could it just be a coincidence
that all the disappearances

217
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,541
happened on the
same route as the circus?

218
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,041
[CROWD gasps]

219
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,958
[JOKER] Last but not least, the
brightest star of our troupe!

220
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,708
I bring yeh the famous
tamer of wild cats!

221
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,125
[JOKER] Beast!

222
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,750
[CROWD cheering]

223
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,041
[JOKER]
This very special act

224
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,291
calls for some
audience participation.

225
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,750
Are there any volunteers, then?

226
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,208
[CIEL] It doesn't seem
as if there are any children

227
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,958
in the final act, either.

228
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,958
Excellent. This was a
complete waste of my time.

229
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,000
Why are you standing?
Did you see something?

230
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,375
[JOKER] Hohoho!

231
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,375
The gent in the tailcoat
there sure looks eager, eh?

232
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,041
Please, come up on stage!

233
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:41,000
Well? Step right on up, sir.

234
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,125
[CIEL]
I see what you're up to.

235
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,041
An opportunity for
a closer inspection.

236
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,333
Go on, then.

237
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,791
We simply must find a clue
to those disappearances.

238
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,166
And it seems our
best chance of doing so

239
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,708
is by learning all
we can about this circus.

240
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,833
All right.

241
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,291
You've established
initial contact,

242
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,500
but hundreds of eyes
are on you.

243
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:07,541
I'm curious to see how you
will conduct this investigation.

244
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,666
Very good, sir.

245
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,750
Now, if yeh'll please lie dow--

246
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,375
Ah!

247
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,958
Those big, round eyes
positively glow!

248
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,208
Your ears are so soft!

249
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,958
[CIEL] Of course!
Tigers are bloody cats!

250
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,333
I've never seen such
vivid black stripes before.

251
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,541
Breathtaking!

252
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,083
Oh dear,
your claws have gotten

253
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,916
a bit too big,
haven't they?

254
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,416
We shall have
to groom them, then.

255
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Attractively plump paw pads!

256
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,750
I hope you'll
pardon my saying so.

257
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,083
[CROWD gasps, screams]

258
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,666
Release that man
immediately, Betty!

259
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,583
She has done nothing
to warrant punishment.

260
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,125
The fault lies with me.

261
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,541
I was so overcome by her beauty,
I behaved rudely.

262
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,041
Furthermore,

263
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,708
I doubt that
indiscriminate whipping

264
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,041
will prove an
effective way to tame her.

265
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,458
[BETTY growls]

266
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,625
[CROWD gasps, screams]

267
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,291
[BEAST] Betty!
Spit him out this instant!

268
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,125
[SEBASTIAN] Goodness,
you're a feisty one, aren't you?

269
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,416
I admire that.

270
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,041
[CIEL] I didn't intend
for you to take it that far.

271
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,750
My apologies, my lord.

272
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,833
I've lived many years,

273
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,416
but cats are
such fickle creatures,

274
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,333
I still can't
quite read their moods.

275
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,708
I simply adore that about them!

276
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,750
What were you thinking?

277
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,208
You attracted
unnecessary atten--

278
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,791
[sneezes]

279
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,333
Damn it!
You know perfectly well

280
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,541
that I'm allergic to cats,
you idiot!

281
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,041
Stay away from me!

282
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,083
Yes.

283
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,750
[JOKER] Oh! I found yeh!

284
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,208
Hullo, sir!
Bloke in the fancy tailcoat!

285
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,333
[JOKER] I caught you!

286
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sorry for earlier.

287
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,166
No, please, it is I
who should be apologizing.

288
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,166
[JOKER] Frightened me, the way
you traipsed up to that tiger

289
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,625
like she was a kitten.

290
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,750
Sure yer all right, then?

291
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,500
Not hurt anywhere?

292
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,041
Best look you over.

293
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,916
Happens we have
a doctor on staff.

294
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,250
He'll be glad to take
a look at you, I reckon.

295
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,416
All right?

296
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,250
Please, come on back.

297
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,333
Thank you.
I don't mind if I do.

298
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,416
[JOKER] It's just
back this way a tad.

299
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,208
The 'ole place is a
bit of a mess, I'm afraid.

300
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,750
Well, good evening there, Snake!

301
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,291
Do you know if doc's
back in the medical tent?

302
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,791
Oh, maybe making rounds, then.

303
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,333
[WENDY] Say, isn't that the lad
that got bitten by the tiger?

304
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,750
[PETER] Aye, that's him.

305
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,833
What a stupid little boy.

306
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,625
Good. There he is!

307
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,000
Oi, Doc!

308
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,458
Yes?

309
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,291
Joker, what can I do
for you tonight?

310
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,750
Is your hand acting up again?

311
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,791
Ha, no.

312
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,416
I brought a
different patient. See?

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,666
Wait, him? He's that bloke
from tonight's tiger act!

314
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,625
He was the one that
got bitten by Betty!

315
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,375
Hold on. What?
Goodness, how terrible!

316
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,583
We need to get you
to the infirmary!

317
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,583
[DOC] Are you quite certain
you've been bitten by a tiger?

318
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:23,125
I don't see any
gashes or broken skin.

319
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,666
It was just an
affectionate nip.

320
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,750
Affectionate, eh?

321
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,250
Nip, eh?

322
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, I'm just glad
you're all right.

323
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,083
That could have been
a serious injury indeed.

324
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,750
[JOKER] Too true, too true!

325
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,083
Imagine, letting
a customer get injured!

326
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,208
If I did that,
the troupe leader would kill me.

327
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,500
I had the impression
you were the troupe leader.

328
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,750
No, not me.

329
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,625
Afraid I'm only the hired help.

330
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,333
The real leader's
downright scary.

331
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,750
Not someone you want ta cross.

332
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,125
Brave of you to say so.

333
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,916
That kinda talk
could get you in trouble.

334
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,166
Better be careful.

335
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,291
[BEAST] Hey Doc?

336
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,000
Do you got a minute
to look at my leg?

337
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,125
Hello, Beast!

338
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,083
Why are you here?

339
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,375
Same as you.

340
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,625
I came to have Doc
take a look at my leg, too!

341
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,000
It's just further proof that
we're destined to be together.

342
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,916
[BEAST]
You're that dandy from earlier!

343
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,333
What do you think you're doing?

344
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,375
After the way you ruined
my act, you ought to be--

345
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,875
[DOC] That's enough!

346
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,458
Speaking that way to a guest
is just plain unacceptable.

347
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,000
This wasn't his fault.

348
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,750
It was yours for not being
able to control Betty properly.

349
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,833
But he just walked up
and started touching her!

350
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:19,833
No excuses.

351
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,000
You are a professional, madam!

352
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,958
Let's take it easy there, Doc.

353
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,333
What's our guest
going to think of us,

354
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,958
yelling and screaming like this?

355
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,041
Joker's right.

356
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,583
Beast's leg is
what's really important,

357
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,375
so let's focus on that
instead of fighting, shall we?

358
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,875
You'll need to spend some time

359
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,875
retraining Betty
before the next performance.

360
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:37,500
Understood?

361
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,458
Yeah.

362
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,875
All right, then.

363
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,875
Show me your prosthesis.

364
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,125
A prosthesis?

365
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,958
You'll find us
Noah's Ark performers

366
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,041
are a bit of an irregular bunch.

367
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,791
Sort of a gathering of people
with a certain type of problem,

368
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,291
you might say.

369
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,333
Jus' look at me.

370
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,833
Missing an arm,

371
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,416
but the Doc 'ere gave me a
right fine replacement for it.

372
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,166
Pretty nice, don't you think?

373
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,041
That one needs
constant adjusting, though.

374
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,750
I should never have
let you choose the design.

375
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,541
Coming in every day,
asking me to look at it.

376
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,083
You craft prostheses
for the performers?

377
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,666
That is your main task?

378
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,583
[DOC] Essentially.
And quite a task it is!

379
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:21,500
I do everything, from carving
the parts to the final fitting.

380
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,916
What material do you use?

381
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,916
You said carving them.
Are they wooden, then?

382
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,291
Not wooden.
Ceramic, actually.

383
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,791
Ceramic?

384
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,458
I know what you're thinking,
but I use special materials,

385
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,166
so they're always
light and sturdy.

386
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,250
Feel this and
you'll see what I mean.

387
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,375
Indeed, I do.

388
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,208
Quite smooth
to the touch, as well.

389
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,750
[DOC] Of course.

390
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,708
And you'll notice that I use
spherical parts for the joints,

391
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,666
to ensure fluidity of movement.

392
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,333
[SEBASTIAN]
This is truly fine work.

393
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,291
I'm impressed.

394
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,208
What's this?

395
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,041
A seal of some sort?

396
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,708
What do you think
you're doing, pervert?

397
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,583
Oh...

398
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,750
I most humbly beg your pardon.

399
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,875
It seems I have
read you incorrectly.

400
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,375
I had not assumed
you were possessed

401
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,625
of such a
modest temperament.

402
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,875
Stop that!
Beast, stop at once!

403
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,541
Do something, you two.

404
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,958
You wretch!

405
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,291
How dare you even think about
touching my lady's skin?

406
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,250
Bastard!
Even I haven't touched it yet!

407
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,208
To be fair, I didn't
actually touch her skin.

408
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,291
It seems I did
touch a nerve, though.

409
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,208
Terribly sorry about that.

410
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,041
Put the knives away!

411
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,791
You'll shred the tent
at this rate!

412
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,208
I'm protecting Beast's honor.

413
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,833
That's more important
than some bloody tent!

414
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:42,750
[DAGGER] Blimey!

415
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,791
[whistles]

416
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,833
I'm gonna take you down a peg!

417
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,041
Ta-da!

418
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,208
All right,
that's enough fun for now!

419
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,916
What? That's not fair!

420
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,458
Come on, Beast.

421
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,541
Aren't you being a bit touchy?

422
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,375
[BEAST] Touchy?

423
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,208
But he's the one who--

424
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,416
[JOKER] Now, now.

425
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,291
It's such a handsome leg.

426
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,375
Can hardly blame the fellow

427
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,291
for wanting to feel it,
now, can yeh?

428
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,625
Go on, dear, take the flowers.

429
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,208
[JOKER] Well!

430
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,791
That was quite a feat
of acrobatics there, sir!

431
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,625
I reckon I would
hire yeh, I would.

432
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,625
Right quick!

433
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,041
Is your offer sincere?

434
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,416
[SEBASTIAN sighs]

435
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,916
Honestly, I might not
mind a change of occupation.

436
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,750
My current master is so spoiled,

437
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,000
I would be happy
to be done with him.

438
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,791
[sneezes]

439
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,541
[JOKER] Oh, "Master," is it?

440
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,833
A servant then, are yeh?

441
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,625
That's a bit of a surprise.

442
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,583
I thought for sure
you were one of the gentry,

443
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,125
dressed up all fine
and dandy as you are.

444
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,833
Me, one of the gentry?

445
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,208
Assuredly not.

446
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:53,208
Oh, no. You see, I am
simply one hell of a butler.

447
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,375
[SEBASTIAN] Now, then.

448
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,666
Was your offer a serious one?

449
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,458
If so, I would very much
like to take you up on it.

450
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,500
[JOKER] Not having
a jest at me, are yeh?

451
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,291
I think you'll learn
I'm not one for jests.

452
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,791
[laughing]

453
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,500
Funny ol' fellow, aren't yeh?

454
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,916
All right, me hansome.

455
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,083
Join us if yeh'd like.

456
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,500
We'd be happy to have yeh.

457
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,791
What are you doing?

458
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,125
You can't just make
a decision like that!

459
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,625
Hey, easy now.

460
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,708
You saw him.
He's got real talent.

461
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,500
Sorry.

462
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,083
If I may be so bold,

463
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,083
there's someone else I'd very
much like to introduce you to.

464
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,125
[sneezes]

465
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,125
If he's anything like you,

466
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,125
I'm sure he'll work out well.

467
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,625
I reckon we'll be
wanting to give him

468
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,750
an audition
all the same, though.

469
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,250
[SEBASTIAN] But of course.

470
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,000
I shall return tomorrow, then,

471
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,541
and bring him with me
so you can see if he suits.

472
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,916
Thank you for an excellent day.

473
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,708
Leaving us already?

474
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,083
There's no need to see me out.

475
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,333
I'll be fine.

476
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,041
[SEBASTIAN] Now, then.

477
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,416
[SEBASTIAN] Before one
reaches the medical tent,

478
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,958
there are nine tents,
and ten carts.

479
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,750
And further along, we have...

480
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,708
...tents of substantially
higher quality.

481
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,916
I'm already here.

482
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,583
Might as well inspect them.

483
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,083
I don't sense
the children at all.

484
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:21,458
However, I do sense
something a bit... off.

485
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,875
What is it?

486
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:34,208
[SNAKE] I'm afraid this area
is off-limits, my friend.

487
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,458
[UNDERTAKER]
What's this I hear, butler?

488
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,333
You're joining
the circus, are you?

489
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,083
I can't wait to see your act!

490
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,541
If you do the same bit
you showed me that time,

491
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,208
you'll bring the house down!

492
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,458
You know, the one where-- 

493
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,791
[SEBASTIAN] So sorry,
but we're out of time.

494
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,458
I'll just stop you right there.
