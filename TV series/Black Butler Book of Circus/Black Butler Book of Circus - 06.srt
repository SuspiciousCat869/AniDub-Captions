1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,208
[CIEL] Hello?

2
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,875
Isn't anybody there?

3
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,416
[CIEL] Father? Mother!

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,208
[CIEL panting]

5
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:31,916
Help me!

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,708
[panting]

7
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:37,875
Somebody please help! Anybody!

8
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,458
Ooh! Look at this one.

9
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,875
He's easily worth more
than two children, I'd say.

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,958
[screaming]

11
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,041
[CIEL] What is this?

12
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,875
Why are we in this cage?

13
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,083
Nobody is going to save us.

14
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,666
There is no God, is there?

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,333
[CIEL] Kill them!
Kill them! Kill them!

16
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:14,458
Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them! Kill them!

17
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,208
[SEBASTIAN] Goodness!

18
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,333
Look at you... so small.

19
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:23,791
I wasn't expecting
such a tiny master.

20
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,125
You have summoned me here today.

21
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,458
That can never be changed.

22
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,625
And nothing sacrificed
can ever be regained.

23
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:36,750
Now choose.

24
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,875
[CIEL] Then I choose.

25
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,333
[WILLIAM]
And where are you going?

26
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,125
You aren't to be wandering
about without your master.

27
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,250
[SEBASTIAN] I'm afraid that
my master is indisposed,

28
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,583
so it falls to me
to run his errands.

29
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,708
Surely even you
can understand that.

30
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,125
[WILLIAM] You must return
to the tent immediately.

31
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,166
I cannot allow you to move
independent of your master.

32
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,666
Even the smallest of mistakes
can lead to overtime,

33
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,833
and I so loathe overtime.

34
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,541
[SEBASTIAN] I am sorry
for the inconvenience.

35
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,000
However, I do have my duties
as a butler to consider.

36
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,000
Under no circumstances
will I allow you

37
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,875
to disturb my
young lord's sleep.

38
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,250
And, like me,
I feel quite certain

39
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,666
you would like to
avoid making a scene.

40
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,833
Would you not?

41
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,708
So I propose that
we make another deal.

42
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,791
You allow me one hour
free from your interference,

43
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,000
and in return I shall promise

44
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,666
never to eat a soul
in your territory again.

45
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,666
One hour is all I ask.

46
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,875
[WILLIAM] No, that won't do.

47
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,375
Demons seduce their prey
into darkness with sweet words.

48
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,875
It's the oldest cliché
of your kind.

49
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,958
I was afraid that
would be your decision.

50
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,125
Oh, well, it is no matter.

51
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,833
I shall simply explore other
means of getting what I need.

52
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,333
[DOLL]
Got the ice. How is he?

53
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,708
Asleep at present.

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,208
Seems to be having a devil
of a nightmare, though.

55
00:04:55,083 --> 00:05:01,291
[distant rain]

56
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,000
[ANGELINA] So why this?

57
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,083
What brought you here?

58
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,875
You must've had
other options in life

59
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,958
besides policing
England's underworld.

60
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,708
I'm sure my sister, your mother,
wanted something else for you.

61
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:15,500
And yet--

62
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,250
I did it for myself.

63
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,666
[CIEL] The need for
revenge is a funny thing.

64
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,250
It won't bring the dead back.

65
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,000
Nor will it
bring them happiness.

66
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,791
I want to find
the people responsible

67
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,375
and make them
experience the same

68
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,166
pain and humiliation
that I suffered.

69
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,375
That can't be too difficult
a motivation to understand.

70
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,875
[ANGELINA] My darling nephew,

71
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,750
how unfortunate
this turned out to be.

72
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,958
If only you had been
willing to let it go,

73
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,125
we could have
played chess again.

74
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,625
[ANGELINA] Damn you, brat!

75
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,250
You shouldn't have
been born in the first place!

76
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,000
[CIEL] Stop, Sebastian!

77
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,625
[ANGELINA] I can't kill him.

78
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,750
I can't kill
their beloved child.

79
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,916
[CIEL] One wrong move
can cost you your life.

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,041
Just like chess.

81
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,416
She hesitated and
lost sight of her next move.

82
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,791
That's all there is to it.

83
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,000
So I won't make the
mistake of hesitating.

84
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,958
Now that's what
I expect to hear.

85
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,000
Always skillfully
manipulate your pieces.

86
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,958
That's how you survive.

87
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,750
Use me and Madam Red.

88
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,416
Any piece within your reach.

89
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,541
Even if the bodies
of your pawns pile up

90
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,875
at the foot of your throne.

91
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:09,625
Because if the king falls,
this game is over.

92
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,875
I have already said
I won't hesitate.

93
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,916
Nor will I regret
the moves I've made so far.

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,750
That I vow.

95
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:21,208
As for you, you are the one man
who can never betray me.

96
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,458
The one man who can
never leave my side.

97
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,958
That is an order.

98
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,041
[SEBASTIAN]
Yes, my lord.

99
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,041
Sebastian?

100
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,708
That's right.

101
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,166
He's not here,
because I ordered him

102
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,500
to identify the
man with the ring.

103
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,250
It was just a dream.

104
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,666
[BEAST] Joker.

105
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,083
What's wrong, lass?

106
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,958
Having trouble sleeping, are ya?

107
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,875
[BEAST] Let's stop this.

108
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,791
[BEAST] We're running
a successful circus.

109
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,708
We don't need anything more.

110
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,958
We can start over together

111
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,125
and wash our hands
of the rest of this mess.

112
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,916
We'll run someplace
where Father can't find us!

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,750
Someplace "over the
hills and far away," huh?

114
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,416
Yeh know we cannot do that.

115
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,250
And I don't have time
to talk about it.

116
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,375
Sorry, lass.

117
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,000
[BEAST] Please wait!

118
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,333
[JOKER] Yeh all right?

119
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,625
This isn't like you.

120
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,875
We made this here decision
together, didn't we?

121
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,166
Said we'd do
whatever we had to,

122
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,291
no matter how hard it was.

123
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,500
To protect what really matters.

124
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,500
I know, but I hate this.

125
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,958
I can't stand to
watch you suffer so.

126
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:00,958
It hurts me.

127
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,583
Joker, You must know that I--

128
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,791
[JOKER] That's enough!

129
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,208
There's no turning back.

130
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,166
You know that, same as me.

131
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,458
Here, take this.

132
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,375
It's a mite bit
chilly out tonight.

133
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,208
Please, Joker.

134
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,708
Good night, Beast.

135
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,791
[BEAST sobbing]

136
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,041
[SEBASTIAN]
Oh, my. What happened?

137
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,958
Do I hear someone weeping?

138
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,291
It's none of your
damn business, Black!

139
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,791
Just piss off, all right?

140
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,416
It's no use, my dear,
I'm so sorry.

141
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,458
Pursuing a man like that
is a waste of time

142
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,583
for a lady like you.

143
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,125
He can't return your feelings,

144
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,208
so he decides to be kind and
play the considerate gentleman.

145
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,375
All the while knowing such
behavior only hurts you more.

146
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,500
Rather cruel of him,
don't you think?

147
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,750
How long have you
been allowing him

148
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,958
to make you cry like this?

149
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,750
Carrying on a one-sided affair

150
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,625
that will lead to
nothing in the end.

151
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,791
And what would you
know about it, huh?!

152
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,708
Not a thing, I'm sure.

153
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,750
However, there
is something I do know, my dear.

154
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,541
If you would be interested,

155
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:25,250
I know how to take your mind
off the pain for a while.

156
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,875
That's rubbish! Let me go!

157
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,416
[SEBASTIAN]
I am serious, I assure you.

158
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,958
What good is constant sadness?

159
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,708
Why should you suffer
this kind of agony?

160
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,416
[SEBASTIAN]
He has trapped you, my dear.

161
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,750
Unable to move forward.

162
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:50,625
Shout all you like, but he'll
never turn to look at you.

163
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,833
You poor, sweet thing.

164
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,375
Haven't you been through enough?

165
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,125
Wouldn't you like to
forget him for a while?

166
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,583
Forget his cruelty
and his kindness.

167
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,333
[BEAST] I don't...

168
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,416
[SEBASTIAN]
Why not forget everything?

169
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,416
Even if it won't last
any longer than tonight.

170
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,291
Choose pleasure, not pain.

171
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,791
It is a sweet poison.

172
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,416
Take it into
your deepest depths.

173
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,541
[WILLIAM] You seduce your prey
into darkness with sweet words.

174
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,458
You whisper and cajole.

175
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,375
Cleverly, sweetly, softly.

176
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,458
So that it won't notice
the monster behind the mask.

177
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,250
And then, you devour it.

178
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,708
You... You have
a demon's tongue.

179
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,833
[SEBASTIAN] I simply want
to know that secret place.

180
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,791
The one you keep hidden.

181
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,875
Deep inside.

182
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,500
This is the way
he's always been.

183
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,833
The words I need are
the only ones he can't say.

184
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,416
Things changed when Father
put him in charge of the circus.

185
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,750
He grew distant,
even from his closest friends.

186
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,041
[SEBASTIAN] Who is "Father"?

187
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,791
That's what we call
the man who's our patron.

188
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,375
He paid to develop
our prosthetics.

189
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,416
He gave us new bodies,
made us whole again.

190
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,166
[SEBASTIAN]
Is that what this is, then?

191
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,250
Father's seal?

192
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,250
[BEAST] Yes.

193
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,250
The seal marks us
for who we are.

194
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,208
We all belong to Father.

195
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,000
Very interesting.
And what might his name be?

196
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,000
Why do want to know that?

197
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,625
[SEBASTIAN]
I want to know all about you.

198
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,958
He's an important part
of your life.

199
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,708
[SEBASTIAN] Besides,
we're on intimate terms now.

200
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,166
Are we not?

201
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,125
[BEAST gasps]

202
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,000
[SEBASTIAN]
You can tell me his name.

203
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,500
What's the harm?

204
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,666
His name is...

205
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,916
Father's real name is...

206
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,125
You?

207
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,666
And a good morning
to you, my lord.

208
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,708
Yes.

209
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,041
[SEBASTIAN] Your fever
seems to have come down.

210
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,541
[CIEL] Freckles must've
gone off to breakfast.

211
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,458
Are you on the mend?
How are you feeling?

212
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,583
Not well yet, but I am
better than yesterday.

213
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,583
[coughing]

214
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,291
[SEBASTIAN]
Here, drink some water.

215
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,166
You appear to be
missing your gloves.

216
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,708
Your nails and our
contract seal are showing.

217
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,166
Ah, yes...

218
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,375
I'm afraid I might have
soiled them just a touch.

219
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,041
The errand I gave you.

220
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,416
I assume you have been able
to complete it by this point?

221
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,791
[SEBASTIAN] Yes, of course.

222
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,666
There's no need to
remain here any longer.

223
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,958
We can leave unobtrusively while
everyone is breaking their fast.

224
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,625
Did you sleep well?

225
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,708
Not to worry, my lord,
your secret is safe with me.

226
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,291
I shan't inform Lady Elizabeth
that you shared your bed

227
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,875
with another young lady
last night, I assure you.

228
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:57,916
Wha--

229
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
[SEBASTIAN]
Have a care, my lord.

230
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,208
We can speak more
once we're home.

231
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,666
[SEBASTIAN] We've finished
our business here,

232
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,250
so we'll be taking our leave.

233
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,625
I trust that's not a problem.

234
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,666
Not at all.

235
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,750
So long as your master
is with you,

236
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,083
where you go is
of no concern to me.

237
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,333
By all means, be on your way.

238
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,208
Now, without those distractions,

239
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,041
I can get my work done
in an orderly fashion.

240
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,291
[SOMA]
Ciel! Where have you been?

241
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,625
You left for two whole days

242
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,000
without even bothering
to tell anybody!

243
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,041
It's very good to see you.

244
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,125
Where I have been
is none of your affair.

245
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,416
[coughing]

246
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,583
[SOMA] What is wrong?

247
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,208
You look as pale as a ghost.

248
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,958
[CIEL] It's nothing, I'm fine.

249
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,208
Leave me be.

250
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,708
It sounds serious!
I think you're lying!

251
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,958
You've obviously
caught a very bad cold.

252
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,333
Do you have a fever, too?

253
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,041
No. I've no fever.

254
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,250
You're lying again!

255
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,666
[CIEL] No, I'm not.

256
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,083
[SOMA] Ciel!

257
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,000
I am surprised, my lord.

258
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,041
You're even fonder of secrets
and lies than I'd thought.

259
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,416
To think you've been
chronically ill since infancy

260
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,208
and I'd no idea.

261
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,166
That is quite a secret
to keep, indeed.

262
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,458
I'm curious as to why
you didn't tell me.

263
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,208
You didn't ask,
so I didn't tell.

264
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,208
It's as simple as that.

265
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,500
And I've grown
out of it, anyhow.

266
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,416
[SEBASTIAN]
A childhood affliction, then?

267
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,791
Perhaps.

268
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,500
Still, there's no harm
in being cautious, is there?

269
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,875
I'll acquaint myself
with the latest

270
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,041
medical texts on asthma,
just in case.

271
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,875
Is that part
of your "aesthetic"?

272
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,083
A proper butler is
prepared for any situation,

273
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,000
as well you know.

274
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,041
[CIEL] Hmm.

275
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,750
If we're done
chatting about my health,

276
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,583
perhaps you could
report what you've gleaned

277
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,708
from your research this morning.

278
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,125
[SEBASTIAN] There is a coat
of arms that matches the seal.

279
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,750
It belongs to the Baron Kelvin.

280
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,500
[CIEL] Kelvin?

281
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,416
[SEBASTIAN]
Do you know him, then?

282
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,083
[CIEL] Well, we certainly
don't have a close,

283
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,666
personal acquaintance,

284
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,291
as I don't much fancy
"philanthropists."

285
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,583
But I think we may
have been introduced before.

286
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,125
At a party the
previous earl took me to.

287
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,291
Well, no matter.

288
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,875
His name is the only thing
we really require.

289
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,166
[CIEL] We're going out.

290
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,666
Ah. Yes, my lord.

291
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,666
[CIEL] Uh...

292
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,708
[SOMA] Ohoho!
Not so fast, Ciel!

293
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,791
This townhouse is
under my supervision.

294
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,458
Do not think you will
escape it so easily!

295
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,583
[SOMA] Whatever you say, I know
you've caught a nasty cold.

296
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,041
As viceroy of this estate
and your dear friend,

297
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,125
I cannot allow you to venture
out in your current state.

298
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,458
[CIEL] Don't be daft!

299
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,000
Since when are we
"dear friends"?

300
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:03,875
Agni!

301
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,875
Do not let Ciel past you!

302
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,083
[AGNI] Jo ajna.

303
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,500
Listen, you bloody nuisance.

304
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,416
I have important work to do!

305
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,458
I haven't got the time
to play these infantile games!

306
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,541
[coughing]

307
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,750
Now, step aside!

308
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,958
A sick person's
only job is to stay in bed

309
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,041
and be looked after.

310
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,875
I've a stronger
constitution than you!

311
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,166
I can manage on--

312
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,291
[coughs]

313
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,541
Lord Phantomhive!

314
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,666
I beg you, please return
to bed, my lord.

315
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,250
Your symptoms suggest
that you suffer from asthma.

316
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,000
You cannot possibly
be well in this state!

317
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,750
Don't you presume to touch me!

318
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:46,333
Sebastian, get these two
out of my way!

319
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,291
Very good, my young lord.

320
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:53,375
[AGNI] Sebastian, you should
hang your head in shame!

321
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,791
You call yourself Lord
Phantomhive's khansama?

322
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,916
Sorry?

323
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,916
I speak as a
fellow khansama, and more,

324
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,625
as your friend
and one who respects you.

325
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,291
The health of our masters
is our first concern!

326
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,083
Don't you think you
are bound by duty

327
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,791
to stop Lord Phantomhive
for the sake of his health

328
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,041
even if doing so
goes against his orders?

329
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,500
We ensure our masters remain
in good spirits and good health,

330
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,750
no matter what we have to do.

331
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,125
As you know...

332
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,541
That is the butler
aesthetic, Sebastian!

333
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,458
[SEBASTIAN] I've long
considered my role to be

334
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,375
the fulfillment of
my young lord's wishes,

335
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,166
but you make
an excellent point.

336
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,750
Yes, indeed.

337
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,958
Perhaps there is something to
your way of thinking after all.

338
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,458
Wait!
Don't let him turn you!

339
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,708
My orders are--

340
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,000
Now that that's sorted,
let's get you to bed.

341
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,166
Come!

342
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,583
Nursed back to health
by a crown prince?

343
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,125
You should be flattered, Ciel!

344
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,125
Agni! Porridge and some herbs.

345
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,208
[AGNI] Yes, at once!

346
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,458
[CIEL] No, you can't just--

347
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,375
[SOMA] Ciel's khansama,
bring fresh nightclothes

348
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,583
and ice packs!

349
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,250
[SEBASTIAN] Of course.

350
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,458
[CIEL] Oi!

351
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,958
There.
I feel much better, don't you?

352
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes.

353
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,333
[CIEL] I've no time
to play invalid.

354
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,750
I'm busy!

355
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,208
We've made substantial
progress on the case.

356
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,791
Set your mind at ease.

357
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,000
You can afford some time
for rest and recuperation.

358
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,083
[SEBASTIAN]
My, you're burning up.

359
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,166
[SEBASTIAN] Rest now.

360
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,791
Let it wait until tomorrow.

361
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:43,833
[loud slap]

362
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,208
I told you not to
trust outsiders, didn't I?

363
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,333
But... But I thought--

364
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,125
I thought what was the harm?

365
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,916
He's just a boy and he said
he's got no place else to go!

366
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,625
And he promised me!

367
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,250
We even shook on it!

368
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,625
[PETER] I knew you didn't have
a thick enough skin for this!

369
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,083
[JUMBO] Peter, wait, hold on.

370
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,875
[PETER] What is it?

371
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,166
Smile's not the only one
who's disappeared.

372
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,625
Suit and Black
have gone missing, too.

373
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,458
[JUMBO] As far as we know,
they could work for the Yard,

374
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,541
which means it's dangerous
for us to stay here.

375
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,666
[DAGGER] Yeah, that's true.

376
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,875
So, what do we do?

377
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,541
Joker's already
gone to see Father.

378
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,333
[PETER] We agreed we'd do it
without him if we had to.

379
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,250
The decision's already made.

380
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,458
[JUMBO] We shouldn't forget
what Father said, either.

381
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,000
Something about
this target's special.

382
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,666
If we fail...

383
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,041
I imagine he'll be very angry.

384
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,250
[PETER] Jumbo's right.
It's time for us to strike.

385
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,041
We gotta get this thing done
before we pack up

386
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,458
and leave London, anyway,

387
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,833
'cause this is the closest town
to the target's home.

388
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,083
All right?

389
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,250
It's almost morning now
so we can't go tonight.

390
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,708
Tomorrow, then.

391
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,958
Everybody better be ready.

392
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,083
[PETER] Now that that's settled,
we should report to Joker.

393
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,916
[BEAST] I'll go after him.

394
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,166
[WENDY] No, not you.

395
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,125
If you go we'll be down
a fighter we might need.

396
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:05,000
Doll, you should go instead.

397
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,916
Whatever you say.

398
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,666
[BEAST] Come with me, then.

399
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,416
We'll get you a horse.

400
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,958
[horse whinnying]

401
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,875
I'm real sorry about this.

402
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,000
It's all my fault.

403
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,875
You're not to blame, Doll.

404
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:29,916
What?

405
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,125
Nothing. Never mind.

406
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,583
Off you go, now.
Best get to Joker.

407
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,458
[WILLIAM] Lovely.

408
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,875
It isn't enough I'm being forced
to clean up after a colleague.

409
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,458
No. It's also a task
that's outside

410
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,166
my administrative expertise.

411
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,833
[WILLIAM] Not to mention the
dreadful month of night duty

412
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,583
that no civil servant
should ever be made to suffer.

413
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,416
Honestly!

414
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,208
[WILLIAM] Ah, well.

415
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,125
At least it will
all be over tomorrow.

416
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,333
[SEBASTIAN]
Everything will end tomorrow.

417
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,333
[SEBASTIAN] Yes, indeed.

418
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,875
We shall end this tomorrow.

419
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,875
[SEBASTIAN] Agni, I am deeply
grateful for your advice.

420
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:12,750
[AGNI] No.

421
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,250
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn.

422
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,458
[SOMA] Not at all!
Ciel needs better care!

423
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,458
[AGNI] Well, maybe you
could sing him a lullaby?

424
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,708
[SEBASTIAN]
Ah, that might be nice.

425
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,208
[AGNI] Then sing we shall.

426
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,666
Ready, and...

427
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,250
