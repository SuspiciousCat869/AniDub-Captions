I've come home, Father.

[JOKER] I'm very sorry
for bothering you.

00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,458
Especially considering
the late hour.

00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,583
I needed to speak with you--

00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,750
[KELVIN] Ah!

6
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,625
Welcome home, my boy!

7
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:46,916
What a good lad you are,

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,750
coming back to your
old Father so soon.

9
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,166
Now, where is he?

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,875
He is with you, yes?

11
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:54,833
[JOKER] Ah, no.

12
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,083
That is, not yet.

13
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,416
[KELVIN] Oh, dear.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,875
Not such a good lad, then.

15
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,458
[JOKER] I'm so sorry!

16
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,041
We're afraid the Yard may have
us pinned as suspects, you see.

17
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,500
[KELVIN] Explain yourself.

18
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,833
[thunder rumbling]

19
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,083
It's all because of
one of the new performers.

20
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:15,000
He snuck into our
private tents during a show.

21
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,166
Unfortunately,

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,625
we think he may
have seen your letter

23
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,416
with the target's details.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,583
And if they
are with the Yard,

25
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,375
we can't just dispose of them.

26
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,291
That would put the
circus in danger.

27
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,666
Honestly...

28
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,500
I thought there was
something odd about those two.

29
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,083
But that child...

30
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,041
[KELVIN] A child?

31
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,666
[JOKER] What is it?

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,750
[KELVIN] You did say a child?

33
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,708
Not one with an eye patch?

34
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,250
Well, yes, he...
He did have an eye patch.

35
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,958
[KELVIN] And there were
two of them, you said?

36
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,125
Yes, Father.
He was with a man in black.

37
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,791
A boy and his butler?

38
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,791
The man did say he'd
previously been a butler.

I raised you, gave you
bodies that were whole.

You'd repay my kindness
with defiance?

I would never, Father.

You grew to be
such a good lad, Joker.

You want the little ones
you left behind

in the workhouse to grow up
fine and strong, too, don't you?

The boy doesn't
have parents.

161
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,750
Neither did I, really,
so I know what it's like.

162
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,708
However, I had Mina
and an elderly servant

163
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,541
to look after me and spoil me.

164
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,083
So you...

165
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,875
You should stop being such a
cold khansama and coddle Ciel!

166
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,875
Be nice! Is that so hard?!

167
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,458
Don't forget what I said!

168
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,375
My prince!

169
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,791
Oh! You are possessed
of a beautiful soul!

170
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,958
Be kinder to him?

171
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,541
Spoil him and coddle him?

[phone rings]

173
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,125
[SEBASTIAN] Hello?

174
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,500
Oh, Tanaka.

175
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,041
Yes.

176
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:32,958
Yes, yes.

177
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,666
It's all right, I understand.

178
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,541
I shall tell the young lord.

179
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,125
It's dark outside.

180
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,666
What time is it?

181
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,083
[SEBASTIAN] It is just after
seven in the evening, my lord.

182
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,791
You slept soundly.

183
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,333
That late?
Why didn't you wake me?

184
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,083
[SEBASTIAN] I felt it was
in keeping with my duties

185
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,166
as your butler to
prioritize your health,

186
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,083
so I let you sleep.

187
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,958
My health?

188
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,541
[SEBASTIAN] Tonight's dinner.

189
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,541
We have a creamy
three-mushroom risotto

190
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,458
and a pork and wine pot-au-feu.

191
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,000
And for pudding,

192
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,333
we have a delicately spiced
warm apple compote with yogurt.

193
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,625
Now, if you will.

194
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,958
Say "ah".

195
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,000
Wait! Just what the devil
are you playing at?

196
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,875
[SEBASTIAN] Oh. Is it too hot?

197
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,375
How very thoughtless of me.
I should cool it.

198
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:28,875
[CIEL] Ugh!

199
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,208
Goodness me.

200
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,958
Oh but you're acting
like quite the spoilt child.

201
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,208
And you are being
positively revolting.

202
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,083
I order you to stop.
Immediately!

203
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,333
I was only doing
as Prince Soma advised.

204
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,458
He told me that poorly children

205
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,875
should be lavished
with kindness.

206
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,750
You don't care for it, my lord?

207
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,625
I can do without
that kindness.

208
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,875
It makes my skin crawl.

209
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,208
Well, we certainly
can't have that.

210
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,458
So sorry.
It shall not happen again.

211
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,125
[SEBASTIAN] By the by...

212
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,166
Tanaka rang around four o'clock,
and I took a message.

213
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,708
He says Lady Elizabeth
is visiting the manor.

214
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,125
No, no, no!

215
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,166
Please!
You mustn't take my specs!

216
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,583
[ELIZABETH] Don't worry!
It'll be fine.

217
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,166
I promise I'll
make you adorable!

218
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,958
How long do you think
we'll hafta wear this?

219
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm startin' to chafe in places.

220
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,625
I'd say probably 'til
the master comes home.

221
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,000
We'll just finish dressing up.

222
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,208
Then it's time for a party!

223
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,416
[sighs]

224
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,708
[SEBASTIAN]
It appears that her intention

225
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,875
is to remain there
until you return.

226
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,208
And Tanaka asked if that might
occur sooner rather than later.

227
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,791
Good grief. What a mess.

228
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,375
You've been able to locate
Kelvin's estate, correct?

229
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,458
[SEBASTIAN] Yes.

230
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,875
I had time while
you were convalescing.

231
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,250
The Baron's
manor house is roughly

232
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,000
a day's travel
from London, my lord.

233
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,833
First by rail
and then by carriage.

234
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,333
[CIEL] You could get us
there in under an hour,

235
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,666
could you not?

236
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,208
[SEBASTIAN] If you ordered it.

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,458
[CIEL]
We're needed back at home.

238
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,208
Let's get this over with.

239
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,375
Quite, yes, my young lord.

240
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:01,125
[SOMA] Ciel!
You're trying to leave again!

241
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,916
Prince of the chatterboxes.

242
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,625
You are just bent on destroying
your health, aren't you?

243
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,625
[CIEL] Sebastian tells me
you were up all night

244
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,916
nursing me back to health.

245
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,541
Oh. Yes.

246
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,625
Thank you.

247
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,416
As you can see,
I'm fit as a fiddle now.

248
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,375
Because of you.

Fully recovered?

250
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,083
And it's all thanks to me?

251
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,083
I guess that goes
to show how much skilled,

252
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,125
compassionate nursing
can really do!

253
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,916
[CIEL] Right, so I'm fine
and I'll be leaving now.

you joining us.

There's caramel,
milk, and strawberry.

Which one do you want?

265

Caramel, then. Thank you.

like he'd be a good liar.

00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,458
If yeh'll come with me,
my lord, dinner is ready.

322
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,166
In here.

323
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,541
[wheelchair creaking]

324
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,541
[SEBASTIAN]
Baron Kelvin is joining us.

325
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,791
[KELVIN]
Ah! My Lord Phantomhive!

326
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,583
You truly are here!

327
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,791
Oh, it's like
something out of a dream,

328
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,333
having your noble person
so close to me!

329
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,166
Though I must admit
I'm quite embarrassed

330
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,583
to meet you looking as I do.

331
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,625
[CIEL] I assume you're
Lord Kelvin, then?

332
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,041
[KELVIN] Yes, that's right!

333
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,083
Though you needn't be so formal.

334
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,250
I hope you'll join me.
I've prepared a feast for you.

335
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,750
[bell ringing]

336
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,208
[KELVIN] This is a
very special 1875 vintage.

337
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,750
I'm sure you recognize
your birth year, my lord.

338
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,291
I do hope I
haven't gone too far.

339
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,916
There's no need to
fear being poisoned, my lord.

340
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,083
Oh, I do not
require a taster.

341
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,583
I've no desire to eat a meal
hosted by a filthy rat.

342
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,750
Just look at them.

343
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you see those children?

344
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,666
[SEBASTIAN] It seems
the police's information

345
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,916
was incomplete.

346
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There were more victims
than they knew.

347
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,916
And do you see
the look on their faces?

348
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,166
[KELVIN] Oh, I know!

349
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,583
A meal without entertainment

350
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,666
will be positively boring,
won't it?

351
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,625
Be a good lad, Joker,
and put on your show.

352
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,666
[JOKER] Er, I... My show?

353
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,833
Just do it, understand?

354
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,708
Yes.

355
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,000
Welcome, Lord Phantomhive!

356
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,291
I hope you're ready!

357
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,166
Tonight's a night like no other!

358
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,500
We'll whisk you away to
a world of enchantment

359
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,750
and great feats of daring!

360
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:53,708
[KELVIN clapping, giggling]

361
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,958
For our first act,
we have our tightrope walker!

362
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,208
And yeh'll notice
there's no safety net.

363
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,541
It's life or death, folks!

364
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,083
[CIEL gasps]

365
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,583
Next up, our lion tamer!

366
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,000
[JOKER] Watch as he masters
the savage beast!

367
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,833
[giggling maniacally]

368
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,583
And now, our
deadly-accurate knife thrower!

369
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,875
What'll become of this fair
maiden in his talented hands?

370
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
[CIEL] Stop him!

371
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,333
[SEBASTIAN]
This appears to be a girl

372
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,041
who went missing in Cornwall.

373
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,500
One Elary Nixon.

374
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,458
I'd say that's proof enough.

375
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,500
Right as always, my lord.

376
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,583
Abducting children and forcing
them to perform for you.

377
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,083
Despicable.

378
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,250
Had to find some way of bringing
the circus home, did you?

379
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,291
I'm sorry!

380
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,958
This show isn't
to your taste, then?

381
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,083
Joker, clean up
this mess at once!

382
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,958
[CIEL]
We're finished here.

383
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,833
I never realized
there was a form of life

384
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,708
even more vile than a rat.

385
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,958
I... What?

386
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,500
I don't understand...

387
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,666
This will do for
my report to the queen.

388
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,625
Just a short message.

389
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:21,333
"I found the vulgar,
unsightly, perverted brute,

390
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,416
hidden away in his foul nest.

391
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,166
And I saw fit
to dispose of him."

392
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,000
[KELVIN] But... My lord?

393
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,291
Joker!

394
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,791
What do you think you're doing,
pointing that at the earl?

395
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:40,791
Lower it at once!

396
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,458
But Father, I--

397
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,666
[KELVIN]
Surely you won't disobey me!

398
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,500
Now then, Lord Kelvin.

399
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,416
Where are the rest of the
children that you kidnapped?

400
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:53,958
Oh, I see now!

401
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,000
You wanted to meet
the other children!

402
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,958
They're in the cellar.
I'll take you there at once.

403
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,916
I have something
down there I want to show you,

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,333
and this is the perfect chance!

405
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,041
[KELVIN]
It truly is the fulfillment

406
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,833
of a years-long dream
chatting with you like this!

407
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,333
Would you please be quiet?

408
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,708
The only thing I'm
interested in is the children.

409
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,125
Yes, of course. Very sorry.

410
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,708
I'm just so happy, you see!

411
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,375
I've been filled with regret
ever since that fateful day.

412
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,208
The same question keeps
playing through my mind.

413
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,208
"Why, oh why, couldn't I
have been by your side?"

414
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,166
"Fateful day?"
"By my side?"

415
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,500
You loon. What the devil
are you on about?

416
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,250
[KELVIN] Alas, there is
no amount of regret

417
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,541
that can turn back time.

418
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,208
But I have realized something.

419
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,166
We can't go back, it's true,
but we can recreate history.

420
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,458
Here, take a look!

421
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,666
[gasps]

422
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,833
[KELVIN] It took me so long
to get everything just right.

423
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,875
[screaming]

424
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,916
[KELVIN]
Now, dear Lord Phantomhive.

425
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,375
After three long years,
we can recreate that day.

426
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,083
[SEBASTIAN] Joker, if you'll
pardon my question.

427
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,250
[JOKER] What is it?

428
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,291
[SEBASTIAN]
Are you the baron's butler,

429
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,958
or are you a member
of the circus?

430
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,333
[JOKER] Ah.

431
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,458
S'pose I don't rightly know
that meself nowadays.

432
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,250
But I reckon I play
the fool either way.
