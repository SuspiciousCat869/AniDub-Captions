00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:16,041
[ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT]
Grell Sutcliff,

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,583
we've reached our verdict.

3
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:18,833
Yes, sir?

4
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:19,958
[ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT]
As of midnight tonight,

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,083
you will be released
from confinement.

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,000
We expect you to be on your
best behavior from now on.

7
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,083
You will apply yourself
solely to your work

8
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,958
and never again will you break
our established regulations.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,375
[GRELL] Thank you.

10
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,833
[laughs]

11
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,375
[imitating chainsaw]

12
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,875
Oh yes!

13
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,833
Guess who's back? Me!

14
00:00:55,916 --> 00:01:04,333
[GRELL laughing maniacally]

15
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,833
You're really
wound up, aren't cha?

16
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,625
I take it you're
glad to be released.

17
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,708
[GRELL] The beasts made me
clean and do chores

18
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:10,958
for my entire confinement.

19
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,916
It was positively ghastly!

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,083
You can't know how
I've longed for this day!

21
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,166
And this!

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,083
It feels so good
back in my hands!

23
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,583
This is the best death scythe
a reaper could ever have!

24
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,250
You're lucky you
still get to use it.

25
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,958
Getting permission wasn't easy.

26
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,583
If I hadn't asked that girl
in General Affairs about it...

27
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,625
Yes, I know.

28
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,208
You don't have
to harp on about it.

29
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,500
I'll pay you back
by working diligently,

30
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:35,708
and besides, this mission is
special, I need the proper tool!

31
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,750
Oh yes.

32
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,208
I expect tonight will be
very entertaining.

33
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,666
It won't be long now,
darling Bassy!

34
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,875
I'm coming!

35
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:50,291
[laughing maniacally]

36
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,375
I've been filled with regret
ever since that fateful day.

37
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,000
The same question keeps
playing through my mind.

38
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,083
"Why, oh why, couldn't
I have been by your side?"

39
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,041
"By my side?" "Fateful day?"

40
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,125
You loon. What the
devil are you on about?

41
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,375
[KELVIN] Alas, there is
no amount of regret

42
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,666
that can turn back time.

43
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,250
But I have realized something.

44
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,250
We can't go back, it's true,
but we can recreate history.

45
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,041
Here, take a look!

46
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,041
[KELVIN] It took me so long
to get everything just right.

47
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,666
[KELVIN] You know, my lord...

48
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,833
I remember it perfectly.

49
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:20,541
The day we met is crystal
clear inside my mind.

50
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,125
Indeed.

51
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,333
This is the culmination of what
began that day five years ago.

52
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,958
[BURTON]
Ah! Lord and Lady Kelvin.

53
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,458
I'm so delighted you came!

54
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,125
We wouldn't miss it,
Lord Burton.

55
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,583
It's quite the soiree
you're putting on, old chap.

56
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,875
And of course, I look forward
to speaking with you later

57
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,375
on our philanthropic efforts.

58
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,500
[BURTON] As do I.

59
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,875
Oh, yes, and...

60
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,166
There's somebody here
I want to introduce you to.

61
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,791
Let me see.

62
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,250
Ah, there he is!

63
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,041
Over there.
The Earl Phantomhive.

64
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,750
I wanted you to meet...

65
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,458
This is the Baron Kelvin.

66
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,708
It--It's a pleasure.

67
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,333
The pleasure is mine.

68
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,875
[VINCENT] Go on. Introduce
yourself to the baron now.

69
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,791
Hi, Baron Kelvin.
It's so nice to meet you.

71
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,291
My name's Ciel.

72
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,458
Do excuse him.

73
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,875
He can be a touch shy, you know.

74
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,166
His health is a bit fragile,
so I don't take him out much.

75
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,250
[CIEL]
Oh! Uncle Chlaus is here!

76
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,916
[CHLAUS] Well, Ciel! Guten Tag!

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,083
It's good to see you.

78
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,416
[VINCENT]
Chlaus! You're finally back!

79
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,750
Vincent, my friend!
The whole family is here?

80
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,916
That's rare, indeed!

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,375
[VINCENT]
He insisted on coming with us.

82
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,000
He's still weak
from his illness, though.

83
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,208
I say!

84
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,583
Why, it feels as if
you left us ages ago.

85
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,333
German beauties
require some patience.

86
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,458
Find it a chaste lot.

87
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,166
[VINCENT] Indeed?

88
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,333
He's more sympathetic
to philanthropic causes

89
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,791
than most men
of his age tend to be.

90
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,250
Why, he was even generous enough

91
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,208
to invite my orphans
to his estate

92
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,375
on Guy Fawkes Day and Christmas.

93
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,375
[BURTON]
Are you quite all right?

94
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,333
[KELVIN] There are no words
to express my rapture.

95
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,708
I couldn't take
my eyes off them.

96
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,791
They were all
porcelain and ebony,

97
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,875
as quietly beautiful as
the moon in the coal-dark night.

98
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,333
Sublime and forever
out of reach.

99
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:34,208
I knew immediately
that they were special.

100
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,291
[KELVIN]
After that I devoted myself

101
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,833
to investigating everything
related to the Phantomhives.

102
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:46,625
I wanted to know what it was
that made them so special.

103
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,000
And, oh,
the things I learned!

104
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,375
I uncovered their activities
as "villainous nobles."

105
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,708
Roses all have thorns,
don't they?

106
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,250
I was utterly captivated,
flooded with a helpless yearning

107
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:02,458
for their life of
intrigue and mystery.

108
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,041
Well, then,
what was so important

109
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,750
you felt it necessary
to call me back from Germany?

110
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,500
As it happens,
there's a little job

111
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,833
I'd like your assistance with.

112
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,333
Your jobs are never little!

113
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,708
Well, perhaps not,
but I believe you owe me

114
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,833
for that little matter
in Windsor two years ago.

115
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,541
You will at least
hear me out, won't you?

116
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,666
All right, fine!

117
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,791
Let's hear about
this job of yours.

118
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,333
Oh, hello,
Lord Phantomhive!

119
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,500
It's such a pleasure to see you!

120
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,875
Hello.

121
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,041
I, er...

122
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,333
We should go somewhere else.

123
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,250
This place is full
of interruptions.

124
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,458
Now, now, Diederich.

125
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,666
There's no need to be
so testy, is there?

126
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,958
Er, uh, I...

127
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,000
I hope you'll excuse me.

128
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,625
[DIEDERICH]
Who was that Alter man?

129
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,500
[VINCENT] Hmm?

130
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,916
[DIEDERICH] Someone you know?

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,916
He did seem to want to
strike up a conversation, so...

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,291
Probably?

133
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,250
[DIEDERICH] I thought as much.

134
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,583
[KELVIN] Yes, I see it now.

135
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,916
Those who are special
will forever be untouchable

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,958
to those who are not.

137
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,375
[DOLL] What is it, Father?

138
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,166
[DAGGER]
Why are you up so late?

139
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,541
Just stay away from me!

140
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,958
[KELVIN] I've never
realized how hideous I am!

141
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,791
I don't belong among
those paragons of beauty!

142
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,125
It's no use.

143
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,291
An ugly, common man
like me can never hope

144
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:34,708
to become part of that enchanted
world of night and shadow.

145
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,500
And what about him?

146
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,791
Will the young rose
one day bloom bright

147
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,458
with beautifully
dangerous thorns?

148
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,708
Will he be
without peer, as well?

149
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,166
Will he shine coldly,

150
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,041
like the moon in the
infinite midnight sky?

151
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,083
Forever distant. Out of reach.

152
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,333
Phantomhive!

153
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,958
I want... to touch him!

154
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,083
[KELVIN] I want...

155
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,583
I can't change
everything at once,

156
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,333
but in time you will have
the face that you desire.

157
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,833
Trust me. You are in good hands.

158
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,125
[KELVIN] I want
to be someone special.

159
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,666
Like a perfectly
crafted bisque doll.

160
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,416
With porcelain skin,
big jewel eyes,

161
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,625
a slight, fragile body.

162
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,750
That's what I will become!

163
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,208
What do I care if
my hag of a wife leaves me?

164
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:43,458
I'll grow more beautiful
by leading a beautiful life.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,375
I'll become a man
worthy of his perfection!

166
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,791
[JOKER] Forgive me, Father.

167
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,250
I've distressing news to report.

168
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,583
It seems someone attacked the
Phantomhive manor last night.

169
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,333
No, it can't be!
Was anybody injured?

170
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,541
I'm afraid
they were all killed.

171
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,250
The earl, his wife
and child, as well.

172
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:12,083
[KELVIN] And that quickly, the
moon had vanished from my night.

173
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,375
How could this have happened?

174
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,083
Everything I'd done
had been for nothing.

175
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,125
My life had no meaning.

176
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,875
My days were dust,
and my nights were ashes.

177
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:23,833
Until...

178
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,250
What are you telling me?!

179
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,625
[PERVERTED NOBLE 8A]
Hush! Lower your voice.

180
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,125
You're shouting.

181
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,958
Just tell me. Is it true?

182
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,250
Yes. I am one hundred
percent certain.

183
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,166
It truly is the Phantomhive boy.

184
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,500
Our purchaser seems to have
happened upon him the other day.

185
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,416
Can you believe
our good fortune?

186
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,083
The chance to make
the Phantomhive heir

187
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,333
one of our lambs...

188
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,250
Everyone is simply having fits!

[chuckling]

190
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,708
Take me with you!

191
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,375
Surely you jest.

192
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,166
[KELVIN]
As quickly as it had vanished,

193
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,375
my lost moon returned to me.

194
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,625
Only now it was within my reach.

195
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,000
Lord Kelvin...

196
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,458
You can't, Father!
You've only just had surgery.

[KELVIN babbling]

198
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,208
Please, just take me with you!

199
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,833
I'm begging you!
I must be there!

200
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,125
Now, old chap.
No need to get so excited.

201
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,625
You were unlucky this time.
It happens to us all.

202
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,041
Wait, no!
Please, take me with you!

203
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,125
If it eases your mind,

204
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,916
the others and I
will be sure to lavish

extra affection
upon him for you.

If you'll excuse me.

You have to take me!
Please!

Stop this, Father!

209
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,958
You're not well.
You must take care of yourself!

210
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:30,791
I'm going! Just let me go!

211
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,375
[KELVIN] I've never
forgotten that pain.

212
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,458
I, who had given up
everything to meet you,

213
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,666
was the only one
who wouldn't be able to.

214
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,458
I couldn't understand
why cruel fate

215
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,333
was so bent on keeping us apart.

216
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,625
And then one day...

217
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,125
Just like that...

218
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,958
They were all gone.

219
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,708
You did it. You killed them.

220
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,708
It was you, was it not, my lord?

221
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,958
How I envy them
such a death!

222
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,583
To meet your end with the cold
moon gleaming above you--

223
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,916
How beautiful!

Please, I beg you!

Allow me to share their fate!

Look around!

227
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,166
I've prepared everything
exactly as it was then.

228
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,083
A perfect copy!

229
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,375
The ritual chamber.

230
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,041
The lambs in their cages.

231
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,333
And the most
important part of all...

232
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,833
You, my lord!

[SEBASTIAN] I'm afraid
I'll have to ask you

to please stay out
of my young lord's way.

It hurts, my lord!

Please, it's such agony!

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,125
Kill me. I'm ready to die.

242
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,166
Only give me the same
death you gave them.

243
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,500
Is that asking so much?

244
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,708
You want the
same death they had?

245
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,500
Then you'd best prostrate
yourself like the worm you are

246
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,208
and beg a demon to kill you.

Please don't shoot!
Let him live, I beg you!

Whatever else he may be...

00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:17,250
Whatever else he's done,
he's still our savior!

250
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,375
[JOKER] Abandoned by our
parents, ignored by the State,

251
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,208
we lived each day in fear of
starvation before he came.

252
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,500
And there are young ones
back at the workhouse still--

253
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,041
Our brothers and sisters
who rely on his support.

254
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,333
They'll die without him!

00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,875
So I beg you! Please--

256
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,041
[CIEL] I see now.

257
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,750
That's why you kidnapped
all the children.

258
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,833
You were only too
happy to obey this worm

259
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,291
and sacrifice others' lives
to save your own skins.

260
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,791
That's right, we were.

00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,583
[JOKER]
You nobles may not see it,

262
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,500
but England is a living hell
for people like us.

263
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,375
We had nothing--
No money for bread,

264
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,500
not even whole bodies with
which to protect our friends.

265
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,958
Then Father came.

266
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,333
He rescued us from the streets

267
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,541
and gave us the limbs we
needed to make our own way.

268
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,250
That's why we agreed
to do what he wanted.

269
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,041
Even if another hell
is waiting for us.

270
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,625
In all this time
I've never once doubted

271
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,583
that what we
were doing was wrong.

272
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,583
But I couldn't stop.

273
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,958
In my opinion,
it wasn't wrong.

274
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,666
You fought to
protect the only world

in which you felt safe.

What's wrong about that?

277
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,250
Really, justice is
nothing more than a line

278
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,541
drawn by those in power
to serve their own ends.

279
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,625
It falls to each person
to look after his own.

280
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,125
If you're careless,
you'll be robbed.

281
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,583
It's that simple.

282
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,875
You see, there are only two
kinds of people in this world.

283
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,375
Those who steal and
those who are stolen from.

00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,916
Today I am the former:

The person who has come to steal
your futures away from you.

That's all this really is.

You'll lose something
precious tonight, too.

Surely you don't
think it was pure luck

00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,208
that we managed to abduct
all those children

297

without getting caught?

No, you see.

All the witnesses disappear.

It's enormous.

we'll have a job of it

just finding the target's room.

Fine. Go.

All right, then,

We really do have
a lotta area to cover.

We need to find him fast and
get out before the sun rises.

At this point,
we're professionals.

If anyone crosses our path
on the job for any reason,

00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,166
we eliminate them.

322
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,333
You're the target, of course,
but you're not there.

323
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,208
I wonder how many will be killed
while they search for you.

324
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,166
Witness elimination?

325
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,625
Exactly. Everybody,
even the servants.

326
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,333
[CIEL] My servants?

327
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,958
[chuckling]

328
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,208
What's so damn funny?

329
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,583
[CIEL] Your friends
are in for a surprise.

330
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,958
They're not just any servants.

331
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,166
They're Phantomhive servants.

332
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,791
I hate doing this.

333
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,500
[FINNIAN] You can't go in there.

334
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,666
It's loads of trouble
I'll be in if I let you.

335
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,708
Those are the
young master's orders.

336
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,375
Not to mention Sebastian's,

337
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,083
and you don't want
to cross him, I promise!

338
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,541
So what it
comes down to, mate,

339
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,250
is you're not goin' anywhere.

340
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,833
[loud pounding noise]

341
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,333
Oh my goodness!

342
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,750
Has the party gotten
started without me?

343
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,833
Mighty impatient, aren't we?

344
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,000
Never fear!

345
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,833
I won't be much longer, Bassy!

346
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,708
Aw! Such a mess.

347
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,291
Look at all that blood!

348
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,708
You were mean, though.

349
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,208
That hurt. And it's
not nice to hurt people!

350
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:38,958
Peter, Wendy,

351
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,708
there's something
wrong with this place!

352
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,125
Get out of here
while you still can!

353
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,291
[PETER] Jumbo?

354
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,541
[WENDY] What happened?

355
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,625
Impossible!
He took out Jumbo?

356
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,333
Please don't shout like that.
It's the middle of the night.

357
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,791
You'll wake the
Lady Elizabeth if you don't--

358
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,625
Oi! You killed Jumbo!

359
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,708
You're gonna bloody pay!

360
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,333
[FINNIAN]
Now you've got me riled up!

361
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,625
That was my favorite hat,
you know!

362
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,041
I need it to hide
something important.

363
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,583
That hat was given
to me by the young master.

364
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,250
[PETER] What the hell?

365
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,500
The young master never
locks me up like an animal.

366
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,458
He never makes me fight
in death matches with me mates.

367
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,458
This place is my home, too!

368
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,583
He's some kind of monster!

369
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,291
Slower than us, though.

370
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,291
So no matter what...

371
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,333
I will protect it!

372
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,833
Let's go!

373
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,625
We'll cut you in half!

374
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,000
[PETER] Wendy!

375
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,291
What the--Damn it!

376
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,625
[PETER]
From the roof to the west?

377
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,750
Bloody hell,
it's raining bullets!

378
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,708
How big an army does he have?

379
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,625
The little brat's
gonna have to wait.

380
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,166
Sorry, Wendy.

381
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,250
[PETER] What's going on?

382
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,375
I don't understand it.

383
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,333
These rifles don't
even have scopes on em.

384
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,583
They got her in one shot at
this distance without scopes?

385
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,625
[MEY-RIN] Always follow the
young master's instructions.

386
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,250
Welcome the master every day

387
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,500
with a manor
that is spotlessly clean.

388
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,833
That is a maid's job, after all.

389
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,291
When this place gets dirty...

390
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,541
I get rid of the filth!

391
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,208
[MEY-RIN] I missed!

392
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,333
I can't get
anywhere close to 'em.

393
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,041
How many shooters
can they possibly have?

394
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,625
Just one? There's only one?

395
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:14,875
Then that means...

396
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,125
All those rifles up there

397
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,958
were so she wouldn't
have to waste 'er time

398
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,708
reloading any of 'em.

399
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,083
[PETER]
Jumbo had the right of it.

400
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,333
We gotta clear
outta here right now.

401
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,375
[PETER]
These people are bloody mad!

402
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,500
[PETER] Hold on, though.

403
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,333
Is it possible?

404
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,333
Roof full of rifles or not,

405
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,833
random shooting
wouldn't work at that range.

406
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,416
[PETER] This is bad.

407
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,916
[MEY-RIN] It's useless.

408
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,041
No matter how far
you run, you little rat,

409
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,791
I can still see you
clear as day.

410
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,291
[glass shattering]

411
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:01,583
What... was that noise?

412
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,666
Oh, you're awake,
Lady Elizabeth.

413
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,958
Whatever is the matter?

414
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,458
I guess I was just startled.

415
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,625
Did you hear a loud noise
just a moment ago?

416
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,458
Oh ho ho!

417
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,083
I haven't heard
a peep all night.

418
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,708
You must have dreamed it, Lady.

419
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,375
It seemed so real, though.

420
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,958
But I suppose if you
didn't hear anything...

421
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,125
Now, please, my lady,

422
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,416
get back into bed
before you catch cold.

423
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,250
There is nothing to
worry about, I can assure you.

424
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,791
[ELIZABETH] All right.

425
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,000
[SEBASTIAN] I hate to do this,

426
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,583
but I must leave
the estate to you.

427
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,125
[TANAKA]
Oh, stuff and nonsense!

428
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,958
I'll do whatever
needs to be done.

429
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:16,958
You see...

430
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,000
I am simply one
hell of a butler.

431
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:19,791
[SEBASTIAN] What?

432
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,458
[TANAKA] Something wrong?

433
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,416
[SEBASTIAN] No, nothing.

434
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,916
Yes. Quite right!
