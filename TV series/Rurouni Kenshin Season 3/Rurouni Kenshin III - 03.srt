00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:38,376
my father told me I had
to take care of you,

170
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,396
but one more mistake
and you're history.

171
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:42,376
You got that?

172
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:44,436
Hmm, I see.

173
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:46,386
They seem like a bunch
of pretty nasty people,

174
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,376
your family, and I gotta
hand it to you, kid,

175
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:50,406
you took a beating
and you haven't shed a tear,

176
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:52,616
but what I don't understand
is, why are you smiling?

177
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:55,606
(giggles)
Uh, I don't know.

178
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:58,446
I smile whenever I
get nervous or upset.

179
00:09:58,446 --> 00:09:59,556
I've been doing it for so long,

180
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:01,376
it's become a habit.

181
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:02,506
Now that I think about it,

182
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:04,636
I suppose it does
seem kinda weird.

183
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:06,626
I didn't use to be that way.

184
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:08,616
When they bullied me,
I get really upset

185
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:10,646
and when they hit me,
I cried my eyes out.

186
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:12,606
One day, they were
all yelling at me

187
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:14,486
and suddenly, they all
looked so stupid

188
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:16,376
I couldn't help smiling.

189
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,436
And they were so surprised
they stopped yelling.

190
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:19,626
So I just kept smiling.

191
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:21,596
Pretending I'm enjoying
whatever terrible things

192
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:24,516
they're doing to me
is how I get them to stop.

193
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,606
Even when that doesn't work
and they keep beating me,

194
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:29,416
smiling seems to
make it hurt less.

195
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,416
It's as if, somehow, if I
can keep smiling, I've won.

196
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,416
I don't really blame them
because I'm not a real member

197
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,446
of the family.

198
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:37,396
I'm an illegitimate
child, a bastard.

199
