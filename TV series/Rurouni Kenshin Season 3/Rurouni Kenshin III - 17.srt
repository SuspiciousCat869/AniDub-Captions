this could be down here.

328
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,250
According to the map that
Master Hyoei gave to me,

329
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,120
the main church is supposed to
be hidden deep underground--

330
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,060
Wait a minute, did you
just say a church?

331
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,040
During the Tokugawa era when
Christianity was illegal,

332
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,230
church members practiced their
faith in secret down here.

333
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,230
It was a safe place for them.

334
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,220
As a matter of
fact, Shira Amakusa

335
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,050
worshipped here 250 years ago.

I can't believe it,
that's amazing.

I don't understand
how they managed

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,180
to keep this place
a secret all this time.

339
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,120
All the worshippers
were sworn to secrecy.

340
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,090
Stop where you are,
you're right.

341

It is a secret, one that you
