333
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,110
I understand you had a
long talk with Tatsuma.

334
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,040
Yes, he said he
wanted to make up

335
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,000
for what he's
done and start over.

336
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,270
I have to believe that Tatsuma
must have always felt somewhere

337
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,070
deep in his heart that all his
plotting and scheming was wrong.

338
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,080
He hid it, even from himself,

339
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,160
always living in fear that you
or your father would find out.

340
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,000
So that's why he
organized the Beni Aoi

341
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,190
and made up a complicated
plot to obtain the map,

342
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,060
so he wouldn't be
suspected of anything?

343
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
His life had become
cloaked in mystery.

344
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,130
Daigoro got him
to see the light.

345
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,220
It looks like
he and Yoshi

346
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,270
are taking up studying
mysteries full time now.

347
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,070
This one's exciting,
I think the butler did it.

348
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,180
Mine's about the moon and stars

349
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,140

there are in the heavens.

My father says he has
a tremendous desire about

353
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,010
traveling to the moon in some
kind of flying ship one day.

354
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,240
He might just
surprise us and do it.

You know, we never did find
out where the map was hidden.

360
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,000
I wonder what
happened to it.
