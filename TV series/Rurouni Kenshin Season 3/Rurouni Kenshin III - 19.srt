00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,150
Can he really do that?

167
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,240
With God's love,
it's possible.

168
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,000
And our prayers will
help it to happen.

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,050
We must believe that
we, through our faith,

170
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,170
can make a difference
in these unsettled times.

171
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,220
With God and
Shogo's help,

172
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,190
we will have our
own place to live.

173
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,190
Sir, this is
the opportunity

174
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,150
of a lifetime for us.

175
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,260
The Dutch have
it in their minds

176
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,240
to make Japan into
one of their colonies.

177
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,060
Shogo Amakusa will create
such a disturbance here

178
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,030
that taking over the
whole country will be easy.

179
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,160
The Dutch are receptive to
the idea of us helping them

180
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,120
achieve this colonization.

181
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,020
Very receptive.

182
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,160
They will provide us
with any supplies we want,

183
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,210
guns, cannons, manpower.

184
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,100
And then after we have
helped them succeed,

185
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,110
we will both be made rich
and powerful officials

186
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,050
of the new regime.

187
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,050
Order 20 submarines.

188
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,090
And 10,000 soldiers.

189
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,230
Shogo's popularity
has given us thousands

190
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,040
of new followers.

191
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,280
And with our Dutch friends
so keen on supplying us

192
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,290
and all of Shimabara
ready to fight

193
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,130
in the name of
Shogo Amakusa,

194
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,270
we'll be ready once
the supplies arrive.

195
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,290
I'll tell them that we
want to cooperate, sir.

196
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,200
Wait a minute.

197

I am building
God's country here,

not some Dutch colony
to be ruled by them.

199
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,010
I only agreed to allow
foreign involvement

200
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,020
because we both
believe in the same god.

201
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,120
We will have no autonomy

202
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,240
if they provide us
with the means

203
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,100
to overthrow the
Meiji government.

204
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,030
It's not worth
giving them our country

205
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,080
for arms or submarines.

206
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,190
Explain to them
that we welcome

207
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,030
their financial support.

208
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,180
But we will not allow
them to colonize Japan.

209
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,210
Tell them that this
will be God's country,

Creating a country without
a soul is meaningless.

Lady Magdalia's eyes,

I saw a place of
serenity of love.

She has compassion
for all God's people.

has a charisma no

But to tell you
the truth Santo,

evil more than God.

Santo, you look as
though you're surprised.

Shogo a year ago,

ants that will do
whatever it takes

409

And that along with our
foreign friend's help
