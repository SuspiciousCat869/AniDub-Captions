We won't be able

for at least three days.

We'll have to

How come you don't have one?

Kenshin, what happened

It's on my face.

your lid or something?

You want a cross mark,
here's a cross mark.

Perhaps we've
been wrong all along.

What do you suppose
we should do now, boss?

Japan has been peaceful
for some time now.

to put my legendary

Hiten Mitsurugi sword
into retirement.

92
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,080
But I have no qualms
about using it

93
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,110
and if I'm tempted,

94
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,250
it can result
in a blood bath

95
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,260
like you've
never seen before.

guys is stupid enough

to take on
the wrath of Battousai?

99
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,120
Huh?

100
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Huh?

101
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,240
Hah!

102
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
I'm out of here!

00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,230
(yelling)

104
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,260
Come back here.

105
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,000
Count on this.

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
You may still rule the roost
around here, Battousai,

107
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,110
but we'll be coming back.

Hey, you bit galoot!

112
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,100
Huh?

113
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,120
Um, no need to thank me.

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,090
I was just doing
my job, that's all.

115
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,210
That's not what I wanted
to say to you at all!

116
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,050
I'm a man of peace now,
and my fondest desire

117
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,290
is for everybody
to experience happiness

118
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,010
in their lives.

119
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,050
I do everything in my power
to make that happen.

120
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,210
And hopefully I'll make up
for my sins of the past.

121
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,080
This is pretty weird, guys.

122
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,090
I don't know what
we should do about it.

123
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,260
Maybe we should ignore him.

124
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,140
Well, we better do
something, Kenshin.

125
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,000
Think of it
this way, Kori,

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,210
at least he isn't
doing anything bad.

127
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,280
Hey, look!

128
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,060
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

129
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,290
I insist, please
take this, Battousai.

130
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,160
I can't possibly take
any of your money, sir.

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,030
That just wouldn't be right.

132
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,130
Mm-mmm, Mm-mmm.

133
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,170
What a snake in the grass!

134
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,100
(throat clearing)

135
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,120
Change your mind?

136
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,080
But the man wanted
to give him money, Kori,

137
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,150
what's so wrong with that?

138
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,190
The guy's claiming to be you.

139
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,080
I don't think it's
worth the trouble.

140
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,100
Come on, guys, let's just
forget about the whole thing

141
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,130
and find somewhere to stay.

142
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,250
Oh, well, I'm gonna strip
the sheepskin off of that wolf.

143
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,240
Huh?

144
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,130
I can remember being
in Kyoto when all of a sudden

145
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,070
we heard the
swiping of a sword.

146
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,290
The enemy was
the Shinsen Group.

147
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,110
There must have been
a hundred of them

148
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,230
and they were
bloodthirsty thieves,

149
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,030
but Battousai prevailed

150
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,280
and slew every
last one of 'em.

151
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,270
(laughing)

152
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,040
It seems almost impossible

153
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,260
that one man
could slay a thousand,

154
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,030
but I slashed away
and I was finally

155
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,280
able to beat them
into submission.

156
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,230
Then I pummeled them
until they were all dead!

157
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,170
-Will you?
-Master.

158
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,260
Please, take this.

159
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,270
They're paying him
to protect them.

160
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,070
(door opening)

161
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,150
This place is awful, too.

162
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,080
I don't know where
we're going to stay.

163
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,090
Kori, listen,

164
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,290
the man's actually
collecting a bodyguard fee.

165
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,240
What?

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
But that could
be called fraud.

167
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,090
That means he's no better

168
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,080
than those awful
hoodlums we met.

169
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,220
Let's put a stop to this now.

170
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,230
It's fine with me.

171
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,060
He's just a common thief.

172
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,100
That's right.

173
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Are you sure?

174
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,090
It's as clear as day.

175
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,140
This place used
to be affiliated

176
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,080
with the Choshu Clan.

177
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
That explains
why everyone's

178
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,030
so familiar
with Battousai.

179
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,160
He was a hero to
the townspeople here

180
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,030
and they really worship him.

181
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,190
It would be easy for
someone to make a profit

182
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,280
by borrowing his name.

183
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,190
Yeah, but he didn't
look like such a bad guy,

184
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,250
maybe we ought to
check him out some more.

185
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,180
Anyway, that's
just my opinion.

186
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,090
I don't know,
I beg to differ, Kenshin.

187
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,120
The same here.

188
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
We'll check him out.

189
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,270
But let's find an inn,

190
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,270
my arm's feeling
sort of numb.

191
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,280
You must have eaten
a bad blowfish.

192
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,180
It's possible,
he was chowing down

193
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,220
like there was no tomorrow.

194
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,040
Come on, let's go.

195
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,080
To the doctor?

196
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,170
No, to that faker.

197
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,280

This temple looks
deserted and empty.

201
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,130
It could have happened
when the law to get rid

202
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,050
of God and Buddha
was forced into effect.

203

Oh, come on,

The tip is too low now!

247
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,200

your back, will ya!

Does this position
look any better?

Yes, but your
concentration is lacking.

You have to keep your focus.

they've laid low.

There's been no crime at all.

he's using it to look
after those little kids.

Apparently, these
kids are orphans.

It seems their parents
were put to death

because of political views

322

were then abandoned.

It's probably the only way

325

he could think of
to support and take care

327

Yeah, I guess
you're right, Kori.

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,230
Ahhh!

494
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,280
Take this!

495
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,020
(rocks smashing)

496
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,230
That was pretty darned good.

497

-Are you all right?
-Sensei!

499
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,260
Those bad men
are never coming back.

500
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm just glad
you're all okay.

501
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,100
Huh?

502
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,270
I'm so sorry, Mr. Battousai.

503
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,100
I had no idea
that you were the guy

504
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,220
I was pretending to be.

505
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,150
I hope you'll find it
in your heart to forgive me.

506
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,090
Get up, there's no need
for you to apologize.

507
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,260
But please tell us who are you

508
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,200
and how did you get here?

509
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,270
I'm Heizo Ogawa,
that's my real name.

510
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,270
My dream was to
always be a swordsman,

511
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,200
but I was never
very good at it.

512
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,140
So instead I sold snake oil

513
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,040
and that's when
I met all these kids,

514
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,140
but I didn't have any
money to feed all of them.

515
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,280
I was in a financial bind

516
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,230
and didn't have
any other options.

517
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,170
I had heard about Battousai
from some fellows in town.

518
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,000
I realized that
if I used his name,

519
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,090
I'd be able to make more
money than I normally could,

520
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,080
then at least these kids
would be properly taken care of.

521
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,110
Too bad, snake oil's a blast.

522
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,270
I see, so you put that
old cross mark on your arm.

523
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,140
Of course.

524
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,100
But don't knock
snake oil, it's great!

525
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,160
It will make any wound
heal a lot quicker.

526
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,050
Well, I bet you
haven't used this sword

527
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,090
since you got out of
the snake oil business.

528
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,090
Have you?

529
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,110
That sword is
impossible to pull out.

530
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,260
I'm really sorry.

531
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,250
How come you're sorry,
were you really bad?

532
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,180
He tried to pretend to be
somebody else, that's all.
