the whole incident is over,

he stares like this,

to the sky like he's
waiting for some answer.

Yeah, I think you're
right about that,

35
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,100
he's been acting
really strange lately.

What is it?

It's about Lady Magdalia.

48
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,060
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

49
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,210
She seemed nice.

50
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,210
And you tried so hard,
you did everything you could

51

to save her life.

52

You can't hold yourself
responsible this time.

53

It was just her time
to go, Sanosuke.

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,100
Sometimes things
are just meant to be,

55
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,260
and no matter how hard we try,
there's nothing we can do

to change them.

57
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,040
All I know is she's gone now.

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,030

Wait, Sano!

I'm going to see
Shogo at the jail

you would like to join me.

That's right,
Dr. Elsten

65
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,200
gave me a visitation permit
to go to the jail and see him!

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,120
I thought that maybe
he could use a little

67
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,210
cheering up.

68
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,080
I need you to help me out.

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,140
(gasp)

70
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,280
I really need you to
get this letter to him.

71
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,020
Could you do that for me, Kori?

72
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,000
What is it?

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,110
It's a letter.

74
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,080
Lady Magdalia asked me
to make sure he got this.

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,250
It's her farewell to Shogo.

Dr. Elsten?

That's really terrible.

82
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,260
Yes, but I'm afraid
it's true, Kenshin.

83
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,290
The Japanese government
is still debating

84
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,090
about what to do
with Shogo Amakusa

85
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,160
and the remaining 88 villagers.

86
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,000
I think that they will exile
all of the villagers,

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
but what I'm really afraid of

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,010
is that they will
sentence Shogo to death.

89
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,190
How unjust!

90
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,190
Hasn't he suffered enough?

91
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,200
His father was brutally murdered
right in front of his eyes,

92
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,000
his mother and his sister
died from a horrible disease,

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,080
he's made to renounce
everything he believes in,

94
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,090
and still they
want to punish him?

95
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,290
He should be allowed to live,
he should be shown compassion,

96
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,060
especially for all
those who love him.

97
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,070
Listen, Kenshin, I promise

98
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,240
that I will use all of my
influence to save Shogo.

the acting Dutch consul,

101
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,100
I have forwarded my request

102
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,100
to free Shogo to
the Japanese government.

103
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,230
They should reply today.

104
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,160

Shogo's release and freedom.
