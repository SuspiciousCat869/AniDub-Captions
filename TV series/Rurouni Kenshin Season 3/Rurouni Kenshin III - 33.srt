In our last episode,

5
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,030
Yutaro deciphered an
ancient Japanese script

6
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,080
that told of
a revolutionary medicine

7

that could cure all diseases.

We set out to find this
incredible discovery.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,130
We had to solve
several riddles

by the ancient writings.

11

We had discovered
the four dragons

12
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,250
that were symbolized by
four huge shaved logs,

13
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,070
when suddenly we were
attacked by Misanagi's ninjas.

14
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,020
What we didn't know
was that the ninjas

15
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,190
had joined together with the
secret deadly German order

16

called The Black Knights.

17
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,050
Together, they would
find the medicine

18
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,270
and use it for their
own evil purposes.

Yes, but I'm
concerned about

the moves of
The Black Knights group.

27
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,210
I can't believe those
people who got the map

So the reason why Sanada ninja
force's move was strange

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,030
was because they learned
about The Black Knight group

some of this, Yoshi.

Maybe it's because
he drank that water.

I told him to be careful.

58

Yoshi was excited
about the spring water.

Maybe he had too much
and it made him sick,

Thank you very much,

There is no need
to thank me,

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm sorry that
I frightened you.

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,210
Sometimes bad people
come here in search of gold

69
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,130
and in their greed,
they destroyed the hillside.

70
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,090
So tell me, have you lived on
this mountain for a long time?

71
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,260
I was born and raised here
and lived here all my life,

72
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,170
as did my fathers and
their fathers before them.

73
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,280
But tell me, my friends,
what is your business here,

74
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
what are you doing here
so deep in the mountains?

75
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,280
We've come here to
search for holy medicine.

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,190
We followed these words and
checked out the Suwa Shrine,

77
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,100
but I guess it's just
not the right place.

78
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,180
So tell me, have you
heard of it before?

79
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,220
I really can't
say that I have.

80
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,080
That's too bad.

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,040
But, uh, listen,
Suwa Shrine is a holy land

82
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,130
that is known to everyone,
and not only in Shinshu,

83
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,090
but all over Japan.

84
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,010
However, there is a
holy place, a secret place

85
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,050
that is known only
to the people of Suwa.

86
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,110
This place has been feared,
coveted and respected

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,110
for many generations.

88
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,150
Where is it, then?

89
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,190
There is a shrine
by Lake Riujin.

90
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,150
Where exactly
is this Lake Riujin

91
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,040
and just how
do we get to it?

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,200
If you must know, it is hidden
deep inside this mountain.

93
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,280
Sounds to me like
it's worth checking out.

94
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,070
I'll say.

95
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,030
I would urge you
not to do so.

96

Those of us who live here

97
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,130
are afraid of
this forbidden land.

98
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,020
It is cursed.

99

Oh, please, don't
call it a curse.

100
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,080
It's just superstition.

101
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,010
It's not superstition.

102
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,060
It's all true.

103
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,100
Very late at night, I myself
have heard the horrible howl

the direction of Lake Riujin.

105

If you're smart,
take my advice

this forbidden place.

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,110
Hmm.

164
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,110
The four dragons
must be the pillars,

165
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,070
but what does
"climb the moon" mean?

166
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,210
What do you think, Misao?

167
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,050
I don't understand that part
about God crossing either.

168
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,190
I think I know that one!

169
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,130
"God crossing" is a term
the locals use on Lake Suwa.

170
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,100
It means that when
the lake is frozen over,

171
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
sometimes you can hear
the ice crack really loud,

172
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,150
especially at night.

173
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,110
They call it
God crossing the ice.

174
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,000
But that's in
winter, isn't it?

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,020
Yeah, that's the
part I don't get.

176
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,060
Anyway, we should check
out those pillars first,

177
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,190
don't you think so, Sano?

178
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,100
Right, that much
I can agree with.

179
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,060

Hey, what's with the stone?

181
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,240
I don't know, looks like
a traveler's guardian deity.

182
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Hey, Kenshin!

183
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,250
Look, guys, there's
another one over here.

184
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,190
Four pillars around a shrine.

185
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,270
That must be
the four dragons, right?

186
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,010
Do you really
think these things

187
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,200
are the four dragons?

188
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I don't get it.

189
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,240
So tell me, how do
they climb the moon?

190
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,270
Moon...

191

No.

201

It's got to be
the moon's gravity.

202
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,090
The moon's
gravitational pull

203
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,150
also causes
high and low tides.

Maybe we should have
just gone right instead.

331
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,090
I say next time we do
the exact opposite

have let that boulder

flatten you like
a pancake, huh?

important to you
than your life.

pushing me, you know?

How about I push you right
off the edge of this bridge?

off and quit arguing?
