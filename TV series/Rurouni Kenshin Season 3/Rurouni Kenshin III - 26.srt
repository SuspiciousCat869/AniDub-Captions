Misao, it's nice to have
you traveling with us,

Okina will worry about you,

Say, Kaoru,
do you happen to know

325
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,190
where the kiku
room is located?

326

Kaoru, do you know?

327
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,060
Go find it yourself!

328
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,030
Whoa!

329
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,110
(crashing)

330
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,190
Insensitive cad!

331

You can see for yourself.

Those two aren't getting
along all that great,

333
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,230

feelings for Kenshin.

334

I'd like to give you
some friendly advice, pal.

the love of loves

338

your life over this thing,

Under one condition.

369

I knew there was a catch.

370
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,030
If you manage to defeat
Kenshin just once

371

are married and live
happily ever after.

But I've never
fought with a sword.

I've never studied
martial arts before.

the whole deal is off.

He was once called
Battousai the Slasher

395
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,010
and he's considered the finest
swordsman in all of Japan.
