something interesting.

329
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:33,623
Now I understand how you create
the Homura Dama flame effect.

330
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:36,493
(gasps)

331
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:37,523
Really?

332
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:39,393
Care to elaborate?

333
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:41,453
The friction caused
by the tip of your sword

334
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,403
creates the heat
which starts the fire,

335
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:46,393
but the sword itself
isn't what's burning,

336
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:50,363
it's some sort of substance
that you're coating it with.

337
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,563
The substance is
stored in the hilt,

338
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,493
gravity draws it
down onto the blade

339
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:54,593
where it can be ignited.

340
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:57,473
It must be some sort of oil,
but not regular oil.

341
00:18:57,473 --> 00:18:58,523
What is it?

342
00:18:58,523 --> 00:19:02,453
The smell of burning bodies
is all too familiar to me.

343
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:05,523
It's oil refined from the
bodies of those you've killed.

344
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:08,473
It's human oil, isn't it?

345
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:10,433
Human oil?

346
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,333
A brilliant deduction.

347
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,553
Your powers of observation
are quite amazing.

348
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,553
I assume that's a result
of your training

349
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:19,463
in the Hiten Mitsurugi
technique.

350
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:20,603
Himura figured out the basis

351
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:23,453
of Mr. Shishio's secret
Homura Dama technique

352
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,403
after receiving
just two blows.

353
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:27,613
He's a lot more clever
than I realized.

354
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,613
But there's a great deal
more to the secret

355
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:32,333
than you imagine, Battousai.

356
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,523
In a way,
our swords are brothers,

357
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:36,463
for they were created by
the same master swordsmith.

358
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:38,423
Shakku.

359
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,483
But that's where
the similarity ends.

360
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:42,613
You see, any sword,
including yours,

361
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:44,563
loses its edge with use,

362
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:47,353
and the metal
becomes more brittle.

363
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,553
But this sword is different.

364
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:51,443
Shakku called it
the Ginzuto,

365
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:53,373
the Constant and Everlasting,

366
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:54,623
and it was his
greatest creation,

367
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:57,573
for it can never lose its edge
and will always remain

368
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,603
as flexible and resilient
as the day it was made.

369
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:03,613
The blade is lubricated
by the oil of its victims,

370
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:07,343
which is absorbed through tiny
openings on the reverse edge,

371
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:10,413
and its steel is retempered
and strengthened by the flames

372
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:13,353
of Homura Dama.

373
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:15,493
So you see, my sword
feeds upon its victims

374
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:16,623
the same way I do.

375
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:19,423
Once again, the law
of nature is seen

376
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:21,543
in the survival of
the fittest sword.
