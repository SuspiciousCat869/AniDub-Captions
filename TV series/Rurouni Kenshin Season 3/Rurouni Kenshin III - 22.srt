because of my belief in God,

336
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,250
but your kindness
touched me so much

337
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,020
that it's allowed
me to see the truth.

338

I was so wrong,

339

are a lot of nice people

I refused to open
my mind to the joy

343
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,000
of loving people
without judgment.

344
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,200
I wish I could have
learned that sooner,

345
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,030

what I have learned.

that joy is here,
