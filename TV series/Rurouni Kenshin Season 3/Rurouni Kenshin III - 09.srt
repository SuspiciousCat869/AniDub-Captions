167

You must have patience, my dear.

169
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,050
He's got a lot on his mind.

170
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,010
He needs to be alone for
a while, that's all.

171

Take this food to Aoshi.

172

He needs more protein
to heal properly.

Well, now.

I'll find Kenshin Himura.

Oh well, so much
for fooling you.

How'd you get out?

185
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,220
I made a deal with the
government of course.

What are you doing for them?

Oh, the usual, spying,

make a living, believe me,

I'll quit, and have some fun.

Why not?

Since you were a late joiner
I guess you never heard

245
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,130
what the Juppongatana members

246
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,150
were supposed to do
in case we lost.

Huh?

248
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,120
When we first formed
the Juppongatana,

249
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,110
Shishio told us that there
weren't any guarantees

250
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,210
in a struggle like this,
that we had to have a plan

251
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,110
in case things
didn't go our way.

252

If Shishio failed
to take over Japan,

253
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,200
the Meiji government
would rewrite history.

254
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,050
They'd say that
everyone supported them,

255
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,230
that Shishio never existed.

256
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,280
It would be our job to tell the
public our side of the story.

257
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,040
Liar!

I'm from Kansai, we may joke
a lot, but we never tell a lie.

259
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,240
As a matter of fact, when
Shishio told us about this

260
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,170
he mentioned you specifically.

261
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,250
I gotta admit he knew
who was right for the job.

I can't think of
anybody from the group

public speaker than you.

Maybe you're right.

266
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,130
I've always had a way of
making people listen to me,

267
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,240

tell them about Mr. Shishio.

So now she has a goal in life.

269
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,150
I find it hard to
believe that Shishio

270
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,200
would have said such a thing.

271
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,260
Yeah, why would he plan
anything in case he lost

272
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,020
when he was always
so sure he would win?

273

You guys are as
gullible as she was.

276
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,020
Shishio was the man
of Kamatari's dreams.

277
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,180
She wasn't just in love
with him, she idolized him.

278
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,180
If she thought she was
following his instructions

279
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,220
it would give her
something to live for.

280
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,230
You're quite right.

281

I know him better than that.

285
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,230
I think he'd rather
go to prison.

286
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,240
You're right, he turned himself
in even though he expected

287
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,020
to get the death penalty for all
the terrible things he'd done.

288
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,290
But because he showed so much
remorse for what he'd done,

289
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,040
and because of the good
word you put in for him,

290
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,080
they sentenced him to 25 years

What caused his death?

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,140
He gave himself up to
the police like Anji did,

306
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,220
expecting to be put on trial
which is why he wanted

307
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,060
to be arrested, but
there was no trial.

308
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,220
A trial would've given
him a public forum

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,050
to speak on Mr. Shishio's
behalf, to tell everyone

310
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,290
that Shishio's goal was
to strengthen our country.

311
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,030
So, when the government
realized that Hoji wouldn't cut

any kind of deal with them,

they locked him in jail where
he couldn't talk to anyone,

and threw away the key, right?

315
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,230
And what's ironic is that of all
the guys they made deals with,

316
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,040
he was the one that
could've done the most

plan for the future,

00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,270
and that made him dangerous.

322
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,290
They threw him into
solitary confinement,

323
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,010
and probably would've kept him
there the rest of his life.

324
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,170
Finally, having completely
lost his faith in his government

325
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,170
and his country, and
without hope of ever seeing

326
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,270
freedom again,
he took his own life.

327

♪

328
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,080
Well, I guess there are
two sides to every story.

329
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,140
Even though he did bad things,

330
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,290
he was thoroughly
convinced that he was right.

331
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,000
That's what being
a fanatic is all about.

332
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,030
Yumi was like that too.

333
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,270
Do you mean that courtesan that
hung out with Mr. Shishio?

334
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,000
That's the one, Yumi Komagata,
a beautiful intelligent woman.

335
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,080
I once thought our
country was strong,

336
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,070
but Shishio has shown me
how weak we really are,

337
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,260
and that the world
is full of lies.

338
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,140
Like Kamatari, she was
in love with Shishio,

339
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,160
but in her case that
love was returned.

340
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,150
If Shishio trusted
anyone is was Yumi.

341
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,120
To most people, Shishio was
a power-hungry bad guy,

342
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,050
but to her he was
the savior of Japan.

343
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,200
Well, I'd better get going.

344
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,080
Thanks for the sashimi.

345
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,050
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

346
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,230
Two of the guys never got
caught, they got away.

347
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:08,200
One of them is that kid you
fought, Kenshin, Sojiro Seta.

348
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,290
I doubt they'll ever
catch him, he's too clever.

349
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,240
Right now he's probably
on the top of a mountain

350
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,010
at some Wayfarer's inn
eating litchi nuts,

351
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,020
and enjoying a cup of tea.

352
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,120
The other one is Iwanbo,
that big tub of lard

353
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,260
you took care of in
the battle of Aoiya.

354
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,190
Without someone telling him
what to do he's fairly harmless.

355
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,160
(laughing)

356
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,280
-Cho.
-Yeah?

357
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,180
Shishio's right hand man,
the one who killed himself,

358
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,020
I'd really like
to know his name,

359
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,250
and you never told
me what it was.

360
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,020
Hoji, Hoji Sadojima.

361
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,260
Shishio Makoto
and Yumi Komagata,

362
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,280
and the Juppongatana group.

363
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,180
Although their names won't
appear in any history books

364
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,130
please tell the spirit of
Hoji Sadojima that those names

365
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,050
along with his will be
remembered in my heart.

366
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,100
Sure, I'll deliver the message
for ya, though I don't know

00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,260
how happy his ghost is gonna
be to hear it coming from me.

Sayonara.

369
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,150
We won, right?

370
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,100
I mean, what they did
was wrong, wasn't it?

371
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,260
We did win, so we
must have been right.

372
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,130
If you're saying we
were right because we won,

373
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,190
then you're thinking the
same way Shishio Makoto did.

374
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,070
We fought and defeated
Shishio and the Juppongatana

375
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,200
because we believe that stopping
him was the right thing to do,

376
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,010
but everyone on their
side thought that fighting

377
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,040
for Shishio and his cause
was the right thing to do,

378
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,020
because they believed
in his philosophy,

379
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,200
and felt that Japan
needed him as a leader.

380
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,050
In that sense, we're the same.

381
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,040
We both fought for what
we thought was right.

382
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,090
Just because we beat them
doesn't mean their point of view

383
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,280
was any less valid than ours.

384
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,050
It only means they lost.

385
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,180
None of us can know who was
right and who was wrong,

not here, not now.

History will have
to be the judge of that.

However, there is
one thing I know

389
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,100
that Shishio was wrong about.

390
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,160
His so-called law of nature,
the survival of the fittest.

391
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,130
There can be no
such law among humans
