You want me to match up
with that nutcase?

326
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,000
Come on.

327
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,260
I'm not ready
for a match yet.

328
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,030
The best way to
learn how to fight

329
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,250
is to jump right
in and go for it.

330
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,050
Yes, but I think that I--

331
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,110
Quit making excuses.

332
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,260
This isn't about thinking,
it's about doing.

333
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,020
Come on, you don't
have time to waste.

334
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,010
We realize that this
is your first attempt.

335
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,200
Yeah, but I've been
watching him practice.

336
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,110
You better watch
your back, Yoshi.

337
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,200
Kenshin, are you
trying to tell me

338
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,060
I'm gonna lose
to this yahoo?

339

No way!

340
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,070
That won't happen
till pigs fly!

341
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,160
He's right, I'm not even
close to Yoshi's level.

342
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,040
He'll make
chop suey out of me.

343
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,190
And besides,
I'm so exhausted--

344
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,280
Quit doubting yourself.

345
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,250
Huh?

346
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,250
I'm willing to bet that
you have what it takes.

347
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,050
Mm-hmm.

348
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,280
Yeah.

He made a move that
was not a very good move,

371
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,250
and he froze up so bad

Hey, I just made that
story up about the fight.

What do you think?

383
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,050
You know I should
really write this all down

it somewhere.

Daigoro, tell me,

Why don't you beat
him up a little,

a fighter out of him.

Shh.

403

never let me do it.

405

I'm just not sure it's the
right thing to do, that's all.

Well, you're

second thoughts.

are you doing here?

to leave and go back to Sensei.

At the rate I'm going,

414
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,000

10 or 20 years

a master swordsman.

I'm not so sure I like him.

488
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,140
Tetsuma's not really stuck up,

489
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
but sometimes he
comes off that way.

490
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,000
He's just very focused
on what he's doing.

491

He's actually very smart
and skilled at his job.

After studying
with my father,

493
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,200
he went on to work
for the government.

494
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,220
He's a very serious man.

495
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,020
He's concerned with
the future of our country.

496

He always has my father's
best interest at heart.

But tell me, Itsuko,

498
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,090
do you prefer
a man whose dream

499
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,080
is to shoot himself
to the moon in a cannon,
