all those officials,

171

will be there?

I'm sure; I've got these
politicians under my thumb.

They've all been
handsomely paid off,

Usui, I will make
the journey north

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,060
and follow the ki's path.

507
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,100
You stay here and
take care of the city.

508
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,150
Yes, that's the plan
I had in mind.

509
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,060
The ki has started to
move at a rapid pace.

510
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,200
No one is capable
of stopping it now.

What's that?

Are you trying to tell me

514
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:15,270
we have absolutely no control?

515
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,060
Because the ki's spiraling,

516
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,150
it'll be hard to aim it
into the right spot.

517
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,040
They need to develop a
strategy to harness it.

518
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,000
We have to outmaneuver
their jin to beat them.

519
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,050
That means we'll have to
follow the path of the ki.

520
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,070
Which direction is it
heading right now?

521
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,260
It's heading northeast
right into the next town,

522
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,070
the town of Nikko.
