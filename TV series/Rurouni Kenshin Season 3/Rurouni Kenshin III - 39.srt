jin formation.

166
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,220
Hey, hold on
for a minute.

167
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,030
If they complete this jin,

168
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,070
what'll happen
to all the people

169
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,120
who live and work here?

170
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,060
Answer me that!

171
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,260
Everybody here
will be destroyed.

172
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,230
You're kidding me right?

173
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,090
Just for some jin?

174
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, how come, Jinpu?

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,030
The power of ki is awesome.

176
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,110
We believe that our
purpose is to maintain

177
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,210
and control the ki so that
it always remains stable.

178
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,070
The water family wants
to use it to control power.

179
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,110
That's very dangerous,
because they'll manipulate it

180
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,280
to suit themselves,
disturbing the harmony.

181
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,080
Although it is good,

182
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,040
jin can also be
a double edged sword

183
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,280
that is capable
of mass destruction

184
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,250
if it is used unwisely.

185
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,000
For example, when
China became involved

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,170
in that awful opium war,

187
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,230
the use of
drugs was widespread.

188
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,250
England invaded the country,
completely decimating it.

189
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,080
Leaving a horrible trail
of blood in its wake.

consequence of something else.

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,240
This is what happened.

193
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,040
Apparently the Chinese
couldn't control the flow of ki

194
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,160
and it backfired.

195

We must guard against this,

but I have to confess
that it's impossible for me

198
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,130

I'm telling you, sir,
we don't have time to wait.

204
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,020
We have to set up
a special force

205

to investigate this
before it gets any worse.

206

Oh, really?

And who do you think is
going to believe that report?

Sir, if you have any
doubts on my report,

that we go and talk

of the army.

I'm convinced, alright.

212
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,040
I'll set up a meeting.

213
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,010
Ah, well now, let me take you
to see a man named Mr. Jinpu.

214
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,060
He knows what it's about.

215
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,190
You'd really
make me do that?

216

Sir.

217
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,220
Yes?

218
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,070
We've just learned
that the Saeke company

219
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,220
is building a railroad near
the town of Musashino.

220
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,050
It's been under construction
for some time we believe.

221
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,060
A railroad?

222
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,120
Yes, sir.

223
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,270
We think that there
was fraud involved

224
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,270
to make the government actively
participate in the project.

225
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,290
Ha!

226
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,170
I thought this man's
primary business

227
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,140
was in real estate
and shipping.

228
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,230
That is strange.

229
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,110
This could be an
important problem.

230
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,230
Come on!

231
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,230
What now?

232
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,010
We can't waste
any more time

out something

234
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,140
we know nothing about.

Let's visit the Kamiya
dojo immediately.

Alright,

Yes, do you
think it's possible?

240
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,110
We imported engineers
from England to teach us

241
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,120
how to operate these trains,
so it seems odd to me.

It would be too
hard to pull off.

Of course, there
is the possibility

244
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,110
they got a little
help from China.

railroads all over China.

answer right there.

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,080
Do you know
where Kenshin went?

328
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,150
To the dojo.

329
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,290
He wanted some peace and
quiet so that he could think.

330
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,140
He bought into everything that
feng shui man had told him.

331
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,090
Sometimes he's so naive,
it makes me puke.

332
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,090
I'm tired.

333
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,290
I know.

334
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,190
You'd better get
your beauty sleep.

335
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,240
Would you let me go?

336
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,290
I don't see the
point of this anyway.

337
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,150
This is a waste of my time.

338
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,230
I want to go back.

339
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,140
It's extremely important
that you meet this man, sir.

340
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
He's a quack!

341
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,230
You men must be sopping
wet from the rain.

342
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,260
Why did you come
here on a night like this?

343
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,010
I'm sorry to disturb
you so late this evening,

344
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,140
but I wanted
Captain Koachi to hear

345
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,010
Jinpu's story for himself.

346
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,020
(growls)

347
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,190
Uh-huh.

348
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,060
Let's make this short, Jinpu.

349
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,290
Or whatever your
name happens to be.

350
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,120
Just excuse him.

351
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,230
Please, Mr. Jinpu.

352
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,280
If you don't mind, tell
Captain Koachi the same story

353
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,120
you told me yesterday.

354
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,220
Does he know
about Mr. Saeke

355
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,280
and how he's
been conning people

356
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,080
into selling
their businesses?

357
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
What?

358
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Did you tell him
all about that?

359
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,130
Huh?

360
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,240
I believe that
there's a connection

361
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,200
between Saeke's
company and a plan

362
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,120
to overthrow the government
by disrupting its jin.

363
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
Right!

364
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,260
You expect me to
believe this crap?

365
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,290
The man is a menace.

366
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,050
Huh?

367
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,100
I don't often find myself
helping the police,

368
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,000
but this time the
police chief is right.

369
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,010
He's supposedly building
a private railroad,

370
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,060
but it looks like
he's using it

371
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,230
to camouflage
something else.

372
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,200
We just received some
information about that.

373
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,130
So, who are you, anyway?

374
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,040
That's Tsunan,
he's my friend.

375
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,060
What else
do you know?

376
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,110
I did some
investigating of my own.

377
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,290
He's digging a big
tunnel that I'm convinced

378
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,160
he's got some
big plans for.

379
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,190
What did you just say?

380
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,230
He's building a what?

381
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,090
Take a look at this.

382
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,000
What a strange
looking map.

383
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,070
Why does it have all those
squiggly lines on it?

384
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,180
There's a spring where
the rumayagu flows freely

385
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,210
back to the town
of Musashino.

386
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,000
That makes the town
an important starting point

387
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,090
to manipulate the ki
and create a formation.

388
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,240
If Saeke builds
a tunnel there,

389
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,090
he will be able
to control the ki

390
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,080
from the spring
and its strength.

391
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,240
He can send it
straight into the city.

392
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,150
If that happens, the jin
that is protecting this area

393
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,050
will be crushed and everyone
living here will die.

394
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,050
(gasps)

395
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,200
-Everyone?
-Hey, wait.

396
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,010
How are you
going to prove that?

397
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,110
Tell me how this man
became a feng shui master.

398
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,040
From what I understand,

399
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,080
Mr. Saeke originally came
to this country from China,

400
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,210
and the feng shui expert that
appeared at the restaurant

401
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,160
used a flame technique.

402
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,010
In feng shui, the only
method that utilizes flames

403
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,230
is a technique out of China.

404
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,100
Tang feng shui.

405
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,290
Are you sure
about that?

406
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,250
Are you saying that
Saeke is collaborating

407
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,120
with the Chinese
in some way?

408
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,210
The name Yunoshin Saeke
is not his real name.

409
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,290
It's an alias he made up
when he came to Japan.

410
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,070
I believe his
real name is Yusui.

411
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,160
That's all I know
about him so far.

412
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,290
That name has an
ending that is similar

413
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,040
to all the other names
in the water clan.

414
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,240
Saeke must be a direct
descendant of that family.

415
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,040
What?

416
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,110
It's true.

417
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,200
After our families battled 270
years ago, they fled to China.

418
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,070
It was there that
they became familiar

419
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,030
with the Tang
feng shui method.

420
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,120
Koachi, you shouldn't
underestimate feng shui.

421
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,100
It was a technique practiced in
the Ming and the Tang dynasties.

422
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,260
In fact, it was practiced
even earlier than that.

423
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,080
When it is
practiced incorrectly,

424
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,250
it's a double edged sword
that can cause great harm.

425
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,070
I understand, sir.

426
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,110
I think we have more than
enough proof, don't you?

427
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,120
Well?

428
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,280
Well, I think so.

429
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,200
There have been too
many coincidences

430
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,220
that Mr. Saeke has been
directly involved with.

431
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,030
I'll help you.

432
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,040
(sighs)

433
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,010
Yes, I believe
it's a good cause,

434
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,110
so count me
in, Mr.Jinpu.

435
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,110
(gasps)

436
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,140
That's wonderful.

437
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,050
This bad habit of yours
is getting way out of hand.

438
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,220
We have no choice
in the matter, Sano,

439
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,290
I've thought about it.

440
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,020
Right now, Mr. Saeke
is after the restaurant

441
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,190
and the Kamiya dojo.

442
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,160
It would be awful if we
were to lose both of them.

443
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,180
Hmm.

444
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,250
There's no way
I'll do it.

445
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,280
Huh?

446
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,020
This is stupid.

447
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,070
Forget about feng shui.

448
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,080
It's a bunch of bunk
if you ask me.

449
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,110
Hmm?

450
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,200
(wind howling)

451
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,110
Who the hell
are those guys?

452
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,190
What do they want?

453
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,290
That guy in the center
looks like the one

454
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,090
who burned up
the restaurant.

455
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,090
(laughing)

456
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,150
That's right.

457
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,250
I head the water family.

458
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,070
My name is Reisui.

459
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,060
So, we have come back.

460
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,090
What's your purpose for
returning to Japan?

461
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,200
To get our ki back.

462
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,120
It won't be long until
we accomplish that goal.

463
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,160
And nothing is going to
stop us this time, my friend.

464
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,100
We've got you
where we want you.

465
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,250
Oh, yeah?

466
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,180
Take this!

467
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,230
How about that?

468
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,270
Had enough,
sweetheart?

469
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,110
Want more?

470
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,170
Aim for their side.

471
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,120
That's where their ki
is most vulnerable.

472
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Shut up.

473
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,080
I'll use the modern way.

474
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,020
I'll beat 'em up.

475
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,020
Wow.

476
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,060
Their sides are their
weak spots, Sano.

477
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,290
Yeah, I can see that.

478
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,160
(grunting)

479
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,180
(growls)

480
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,060
Keep your eyes
closed, Kenshin,

481
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,190
and don't look
at that stick.

482
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,090
Yamato feng shui,
enter the labyrinth.

483
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,020
Lose yourself in
the glowing light.

484
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,150
Nay, kneel.

485
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,280
Satsu!

486
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,270
(energy pulsing)

487
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,030
This is a
shijo in Kyoto.

488
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,120
How did I get transported
back to this battle scene?

489
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,130
Battosai.

490
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,180
Battosai,
the slasher.

491
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,150
You took our
lives, Battosai.

492
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,040
It's your turn to die a
horrible death like we did.

493
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,070
(ghosts yelling)

494
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,200
Kenshin, get a
hold of yourself.

495
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,070
You have to
snap out of it.

496
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,140
(breathing heavily)

497
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,140
(grunting)

498
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,130
(yells)

499
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,100
(groans)

500
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,180
Huh?

501
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,090
Kaoru!

502
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,230
Forget about her.

503
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,110
Poison air is
entering her blood.

504
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,020
She's halfway
to her death.

505
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,140
No!

506
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,070
(yells)

507
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:27,000
You haven't heard
the last of us.

508
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,170
Oh, Kaoru!

509
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,080
Come on, Kaoru, you've
gotta survive this thing.

510
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,280
It's all my fault.

511
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,270
Once they've wounded her, it
can't be undone by anyone.

512
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,040
I'm afraid
she's been poisoned.

513
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,000
(laughing evilly)

514
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,270
I destroyed
all five jin.

515
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,240
That will stop
the flow of ki.

516
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Now, I can do
whatever I want.

517
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,230
(laughing)

518
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,100
I don't need the
restaurant or the dojo.

519
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,290
Those things are
insignificant to me now.

520
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,220
I'm now free to
place the jin

521
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,040
anywhere that
suits my needs.

522
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,160
I will change the
flow of ki forever.

523
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,090
I will lead all Japan.

524
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,090

(whimpering)

528
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,070
Tell me, will she
make it or not?

529
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,070
I want to know!

530
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,240
Well, we can try
treating the wound,

531
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,070
but it might not help.

532
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,000
Poison air has
entered her blood stream

533
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,110
and it doesn't
look good for her.

534
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,080
Huh?

535
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,230
(Yoshi groaning)

536
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,060
I should've been there.

537
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,060
I can't believe that
she might not get better

538
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,240
and it's all because
I went to sleep.

539
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, Kaoru.

540
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,170
Himura.

541
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,000
Look, it's Mr. Yamagata.

542
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,230
The Ministry
of Construction.

543
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,110
It's all gone.

544
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,190
It just disappeared.

545
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,290
And how could that happen?

546
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,240
It's about to begin.

547
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,140
And we will have to
fight them in Nagunojn.

548
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,150
This is called a battle
of complete destruction.

549
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,120
Well, we're ready.
