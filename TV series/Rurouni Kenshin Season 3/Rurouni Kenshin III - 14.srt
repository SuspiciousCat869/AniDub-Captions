caught the really big catfish.

332
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,010
Huh?

333
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,230
Shiori, please forgive
me for killing myself.

334
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,010
What do you think you're doin'?

335
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,180
I'm gonna end it all!

336
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,240
Listen here, if you're
planning to kill yourself,

337
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,010
please do it somewhere else.

338
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,160
I don't want to have
to witness your death.

339
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,220
It could give me bad dreams.

340
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,000
You just don't understand!

341
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,190
I've acted so stupidly!

342
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,220
(sobbing)

343
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,020
Did somebody break
your heart or something?

344
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,230
I threw away
an engagement ring

345
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,130
I was going to
give my girlfriend!

346
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,060
A ring?

347
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,200
That's awful,
I think that maybe

348
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,100
you should tell me about it.

349
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, my girlfriend,
her name is Shiori.

350
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,260
We were going to get married,
but just a few days ago...

351

352
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,120
I've really missed you, Shiori!

353
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,160
I've really missed
you, too, Shinji!

354
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,180
I just couldn't believe
that she had somebody else.

355
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,160
It was like an knife
had stabbed my heart.

356
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,270
(water running)

357
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,220
This ring is meaningless!

358
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,230
But later, I found out
that the guy she was with

359
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,130
was a cousin she
hadn't seen in ten years!

360
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,100
Well, I think to say
that you overreacted

361
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,170
is an understatement.

362
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,200
This isn't a joke!

363
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,190
I worked two jobs for
five years to buy that ring,

364
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,110
and she was really looking
forward to me giving it to her!

365
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,120
Not only did I throw away
the ring, I mistrusted her.

366
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,000
What are you going to do?

367
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,040
I don't know.

368
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,120
I've looked all
over the river for it.

369
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,220
I wasn't able to find
the ring anywhere!

370
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,020
I feel so bad that I thought
if I would just end my life,

371
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,040
maybe she'd forgive me.

372
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,020
She'll find somebody else.

373
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,060
(grunting)

374
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,220
Stop that!

375
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,060
Tell me something,
that engagement ring

376
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,100
that you threw in the river,

377
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,230
does it have a blue stone in it?

378
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,250
Yes, it does!

379
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,140
Her birthstone
is a blue sapphire.

380
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,120
That's why I had
it made like that!

381
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,020
Hey, why are you
asking me that?

382
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,090
Oh, there's no reason, really.

383
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,050
Now listen!

384
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,270
I want you to wait here,
do you understand?

385
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,170
I might be able to help
you with your problem,

386
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,030
but if you kill yourself,
you'll break your girl's heart!

387
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,190
All right, I'll stay!

388
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,010
(birds and insects chirping)

389
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,110
Kenshin, we've
got a big problem!

390
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,060
So, you're saying that
the ring Kenshin found

391
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,090
in the catfish the other day

392
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,270
actually belongs to this guy?

393
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,050
Yes, that's right.

394
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,270
Then I'll have to
explain this to Kaoru

395
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,010
and get the ring back
from her right away!

396
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,070
Hold on, compadre, it's
not gonna be that easy.

397
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,050
Why not?

398
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,260
Kaoru will never
give back that ring!

399
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,090
I don't think Kenshin knew
what he was getting into before,

400
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,050
but Wadi can explain.

401
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,010
Tell them what the
ring really means.

402
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,020
Let's get this straight.

403
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,100
A boy gives a girl a ring,

404
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,110
and that means that
he wants to get married?

405
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,220
Yes, that's right!

406
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,250
So, what you're saying is

407
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,130
that when Kenshin
gave Kaoru that ring,

408
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,060
he was really asking
her to marry him!

409
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,020
That is correct.

410
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,080
But that's just not fair!

411
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,050
Kenshin doesn't know about all
of those western traditions!

412
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,030
The worst part about all this
is it happened on Tanabata!

413
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,260
I thought that I was
only giving her the ring

414
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,150
as a gift for her birthday!

415
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,050
The whole situation
is entirely my fault.

416
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,080
I just wanted
Kaoru to be happy!

417
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,050
Kaoru's birthday is actually
in the month of June.

418
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,110
I see, that's why Kaoru's
been so happy lately!

419
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,050
So I guess she thinks she and
Kenshin are getting hitched!

420
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,130
The major problem here is

421
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,200
how are we ever gonna get
that darn engagement ring

422
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,220
back to its rightful owner

423
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,020
without hurting
Kaoru's feelings?

424
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,200
Right, Kenshin?

425
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,070
He's fainted!

426
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,100
We gotta do something!

427
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,120
That's for sure.

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,270
to engage in
this shameful act?

494
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,040
You're the one who came
up with the stupid idea!

495
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,160
Do it yourself!

496
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,270
You told me I
could count on you!

497

keep their word?

Stay out of here!

Perverts.

(bells tinkling)

502
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,110
Hi there, Kaoru,
we're really sorry

503
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,000
about disturbing
your bath earlier,

504
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,220
but we were just
looking for something!

505
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,030
What were you looking for?

506
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,170
Oh, uh, nothing important.

507
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,280
Would you like
an ice cold drink?

508
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,020
What is this stuff?

509
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,210
It's a brand new
drink called "beer."

510
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,100
I just got it from Lenny's!

511
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,050
All the sophisticated
Americans drink it

512
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,230
after they have
taken a bath.

513
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,260
That so?

514
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,020
(slurping)

515
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,130
Does this stuff have alcohol
in it, by any chance?

516
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,210
Why, yes, it does
have alcohol in it!

517
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,260
But it is a special
day today, isn't it?

518
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,000
It sure is.

519
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,090
I don't feel so good.

520
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,280
Whoa!

521
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,040
-All right!
-Yeah, we'll get it this time.

522
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,060
Get it off of her!

523
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,120
All right, I will!

Hey, you guys.

530
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,160
As I recall, Kaoru has a
bad reaction to alcohol--

531
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,130
she turns into a raving lunatic.

532

It's Kenshin's fault.

539
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,290
He's the one who found
the ring in the catfish.

What is he talking about?

in the catfish?

Huh, Kenshin?

I'm sorry, Kaoru, I'm gonna
tell you the whole truth.

544
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,120
What?!

545
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,270
That's the whole story.

546
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,070
Sorry, Kaoru.

547
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,230
We need to get him back his
ring before he hurts himself.

548
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,020
Kaoru, just give him
back the ring already!

549
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,270
If the guy kills himself,
we'll be partially responsible.

550

None of us wants that, do we?

All right, all right,

-There you go.
-How 'bout some oil?

559
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,030
No, I got it, how
'bout some lard?

560
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,170
None of this stuff is working.

561

Why won't that thing come off?

562
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,110
The only way we're
gonna get this off

563
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,200
is to saw it off.

564
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,040
Maybe Kaoru's fingers are thick

565
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,230
from all of her
physical training.

566
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,240
Perhaps that's the reason

567
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,000
that we can't get
the ring off of there.

568

your stupid ring!

I'm sorry!

knocked it loose!

Yeah, now that
was a lucky punch!

I can't thank you enough.

577
