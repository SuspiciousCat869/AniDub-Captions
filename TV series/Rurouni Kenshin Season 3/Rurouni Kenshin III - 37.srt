Ow, that hurt!

Why are you kicking
in a sword fight?

5
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,110
Because I'm a ninja and
you dropped your guard.

6
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,040
It's your own fault
that you got kicked.

Now, I'm really mad.

No more Mr. Nice Yoshi.

like Misao could even be
a lot for you to handle.

I thought that
Misao's different style

would be a good
learning experience.

Yoshi, you're supposed to

at my dojo and just
take a look at you.

Uh, well, I guess so,
absolutely, Misao.

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,290
But maybe you need
to check back with Kyoto.

35
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,050
Okina must be
worried about you.

No, no, it's
not a problem.

If I know him,
and do I ever,

How about lunch?

Somehow, I could
just see that.

Sano, that's not
very nice to say.

More importantly, isn't
there one other person

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,180
who might be waiting
for you to return?

Huh?

53
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,210
How about Aoshi?

54
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,230
Don't you think he might
be a little worried?

55

I don't think so.

Really, Misao?

57
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,200
Well, but then as
head of the Oni gang,

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,020
I really shouldn't
be staying away

59
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,150
from Kyoto for too
long, now should I?

60
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,190
I should get on
the road right away.

Huh?

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,250
Yeah, great idea, Misao.

63
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,050
So, goodbye already.

64
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,270
You want some more?

65
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,090
They're kinda an energetic pair,
don't you think, Kaoru?

66
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,230
Sometimes they
make me very tired.

67
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,100
Hello,
hello?

68
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,150
Huh?

69
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,160
(gasps)

70
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,090
Yes?

71
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,080
I know that voice.

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,240
It's Omasu and Ochika.

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Hey, it's great to
see you gals again.

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,260
It's been a while.

75
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,260
Well, we're really happy

76
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,160
to be able to see
all of you too.

Omasu, Ochika!

Misao, shame on you.

79
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,290
We've been worried sick.

80
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,130
We haven't heard a word
since you left Kyoto.

81
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,250
Actually, I was just getting
ready to come back.

82
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,030
Is that why you
two are here?

83
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,050
Sure, but it's not just us.

84
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,020
-Huh?
-Huh?

85
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,040
Aoshi!

86
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,100
It is Aoshi, wow!

87
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,120
Aoshi.

88
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,010
You really made the
journey from Kyoto

89
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,230
to check up on Misao?

90
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,020
I came because
Okina's concerned.

91
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,140
He asked us to
bring you this.

92
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,120
A letter?

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,190
What?

94
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,190
"Sugar"?

95
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,140
"To my angel, Misao"?

96
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,250
How long are you going
to keep me waiting?

97
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,050
You know my heart
is pounding for you.

98
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,290
Every day I miss my little
flower more and more.

99
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,150
Come home, angel.

100
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,110
I sent these three to make
sure you don't get lost.

101
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,090
And bring me a
little souvenir, eh?

102
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,260
Love always, your Okina.

103
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,130
Ooh, that
insufferable old goat!

104
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,020
So, come on,
what do you say?

105
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Think it's time
to go home yet, Misao?

106
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,220
Heh, so you think it
takes three other people

107
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,200
to keep her from getting
lost on the way home?

108
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,080
Maybe you should
ask for some help.

109
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,180
Why you little--

110
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,200
Come on, boys,
settle down now.

111
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,040
You're such
a wise mouth.

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,050
Look, shorty!

113
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,150
Don't call me "shorty".

114
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,020
Guys, guys!

115
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,050
Sorry, I'm not going.

116
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,220
What, are you serous?

117
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm not going back
and that's it!

118
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,270
Misao!

119
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,230
But wait, Misao!

120
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, hello there,
I certainly hope

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,070
I'm not interrupting
anything of importance.

122
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,210
Megumi, come on in.

123
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,000
As if we didn't have enough
to deal with already.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,120
(groans)

125
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,180
You'd be Misao's
friends from Kyoto.

126
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,260
I've heard nothing but
good things about you.

127
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,220
Why, thank you very much.

128
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,130
And Okina has told us a lot
about your medical work.

129
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,230
Thank you for your
devotion in helping

130
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,180
all the sick
and needy people.

131
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,210
Oh, it was nothing, really.

132
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,190
Wow.

133
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,010
Good looking,
but not too perky.

134
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,220
Oh, I know, I've got just
the thing to pick him up.

135
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,230
(giggling)

136
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,190
My grandmother's recipe.

137
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,030
Oh no, Megumi, please.

138
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,030
Tell me you're still
not making that stuff.

139
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,280
Alright, now we've all met.

140
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,140
Everybody please
come right on in.

141
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,200
Misao, stop being so--
so pig-headed.

142
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,060
I said,
I'm not going home.

143
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,130
Why Misao?

144
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,020
Look, I'm head
of the Oni gang.

145
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,250
Kaoru, is there some
reason I'm sitting here

146
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,180
listening to all of this?

147
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,120
For a problem like
this, what's needed

148
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,080
is some female support
instead of nosey young boys.

149
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,200
(crash)

150
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,280
Another lesson learned.

151
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,050
Please pardon this
little interruption.

152
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,250
Now, Misao, I thought
you'd decided to go home.

153
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,140
Misao, we're sorry,
but we thought

154
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,240
that you would be
happy to see Aoshi.

155
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,200
That was Okina's idea, right?

156
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,210
Yes.

157
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,230
So, the only reason Aoshi
came to see me at all

158
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,080
is because Okina made him.

159
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,220
That's not the case.

160
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,280
She didn't have to
smack me on the head.

161
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,010
Yeah, I mean what's the
big secret in there anyway?

162
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,260
Something stupid for girls.

163
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,060
Hey, Kenshin,
whatcha doing?

164
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,200
I was trying to
find something.

165
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,280
Did you find it?

166
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,020
Is it food?

167
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,170
No, Sano, it's not food.

168
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,170
I was looking for some--

169
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,210
Hey, if it's not food,
don't talk to me.

170
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,270
Hey, you're kinda wound up.

171
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,230
The point is Aoshi
didn't come up here

172
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,050
because he had a
desire to see me.

173
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,000
Misao, I think you're
wrong about that.

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,270
It's obvious he
really is concerned.

175
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,270
She's right.

176
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,000
He'd never
say it out loud,

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,130
but Aoshi
worries about you.

178
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,200
Oh, really?

179
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,260
All this just because the
man she's got a thing for

180
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,010
came up for business
instead of personal reasons?

181
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,290
Hey, be nice.

182
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,020
Yeah, right.

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,100
Listen here!

184
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,250
I'm not a
teenager anymore,

185
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,170
I'm a woman with
a woman's feelings.

186
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,240
Yeah, you're right.

187
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
Sometimes other people
just don't seem

188
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,070
to notice when a girl
is all grown up.

(gasps)

190
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,250
But my impression
of this guy is that

191
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,200
he wouldn't do anything
unless it was something

That's it exactly.

194
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,080
All this time he's never
bothered to come up to Tokyo

195
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,200
but now suddenly he does

196

and he comes here
to see Misao.

197

Don't tell me that doesn't
mean something good.

That's an excellent point.

Then, tomorrow
we'll get a fresh start

leave for Kyoto.

Huh, what's that?

plot to get rid of the men,

to Tokyo, they're free.

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,120
Thanks for your
concern, Tae.

328
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,010
Kaoru, Tae is right.

329
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,040
You really like
how Kenshin cooks.

330
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,060
You don't want to be a
sumo wrestler, do you?

331
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,070
(growls)

332
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,080
Kaoru, honey, I'm
only thinking of you.

333
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,270
You can't afford
to let yourself go

334
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,140
just because you've
got a man in the house

335
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,200
and he feeds you too well.

336
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,000
You'd better consider the
wisdom of a diet, young lady,

337
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,070
while it might still
make a difference

338
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,020
in what we'll laughingly
call your love life.

339
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,070
Huh?

340
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,230
I'd go on a
diet for Aoshi,

341
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,100
if that's what he
wanted me to do.

342
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,210
Misao, honey, you'll never
have to worry about that.

343
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,210
Huh?

344
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,130
Trust me on this.

345
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,090
You have the body
of a little boy.

346
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,100
What?

347
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,260
How can you
say such a thing?

348
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,050
(women laughing)

349
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,140
What?

350
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,040
What?

351
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,010
Oh, sorry.

352
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,100
But Misao, I'm sure you'll
get the figure you want

353
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,090
before much more time goes by.

354
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,130
I think you just need to
be a little more patient.

355
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,220
You know, I was skinny all
through my early 20's as well.

356
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,010
Huh, 20's?

357
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,010
Twenties?

358
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,120
But I thought-- oh!

359
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,050
Is that what
everybody thought?

360
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,290
Misao,
the 12 year old.

361
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,160
The leader
of the Oni gang

362
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,210
and they all see me
as some little kid?

363
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,230
I'm a fighter!

364
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm supposed to be slender,
so I can move!

365
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,190
A big chest would
just be dangerous,

366
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,120
but the body
of a little boy?

367
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,060
Well, I've never had to deal
with this problem myself,

368
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,220
since I've always
been fortunate

369
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,210
in the figure department.

370
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,070
But let me give you a
little womanly advice.

371
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,230
Nutrition is
very important.

372
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,020
We need calcium.

373
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,240
Make sure you
drink milk every day

374
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,170
if you want an
attractive figure.

375
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,030
Honest, will
that really help?

376
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,170
Oh, yes, and to
promote your metabolism,

377
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,080
you need to
exercise and sweat.

378
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,170
Yes, and what else?

379
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,240
And I've always found

380
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,090
that a daily invigorating
massage is also helpful.

381
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,240
Massage, got it.

382
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,030
And make sure you whip
yourself with willow branches

383
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,020
to increase blood circulation.

384
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,060
But what if I don't
have a willow tree?

385
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,140
Well, then jump from
hot water to ice water,

386
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,100
over and over again.

387
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,120
Oh.

388
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,290
Is doing a little shopping
appeal to anyone else?

389
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,080
Of course, it does,
Kaoru, but first,

390
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,080
one last piece of
advice for Misao.

391
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Just in case all
those other methods

392
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,220
don't work for some reason.

393
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,260
Here's what you do.

394
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,000
What's that?

395
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,050
Go out and
find someone

396
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,140
who doesn't
want you to change

397
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,130
because he likes you
just the way you are.

398
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,280
(groaning)

399
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,140
Oh, that's better, thanks.

400
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,160
There are thousands of nerve
endings in your feet, Kenshin.

401
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,270
Oh, this is so cute!

402
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,110
-Oh, yes!
-Let me try it on.

403
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,010
That looks
great on you.

404
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,070
Well, what
do you think?

405
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,100
(whistles)

406
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,260
I don't think we need
to follow them anymore.

407
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,160
Let's go home.

408
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,280
Yeah.

409
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
(grunts)

410
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,220

Tsubame, you all right?

412
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,260
See that guy
in the green robe?

413
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,200
Go get him!

414
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,010
Uh, what exactly are
you doing there, Himura?

415
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,130
Some people
call it laundry,

416
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,170
and I try to get mine
done almost every day.

417
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,080
So, you do this voluntarily?

418
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,030
Only if it's not raining,
otherwise it won't dry.

419
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,190
You wash clothes?

420
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,080
I'm just a
wanderer lucky enough

421
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,190
to be given lodging here,

422
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,110
so I try to help out
in any way that I can.

423
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,190
They're good people,
and this is honest work.

424

Can't you wait until
I get this laundry done?

I wouldn't worry about him.

00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,110
Fortune finally
smiles on us.

492
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,260
Not much of an opponent,

493
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,210
but enough to get
some good practice on.

494
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,100
And practice makes perfect.

495
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,220
Hard crackers, please.

496
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,090
Do you like the
black purse better

497
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,150
or do you like
the white one?

498
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,040
Well, if you can't
make a decision.

499
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Yeah?

500
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,080
-Get both.
-Right.

501
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,150
Oh, I can't wait
to taste this sake.

502
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,090
Ladies,
if you don't mind,

503
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,080
we'd like your
attention over here.

504
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
In fact, we insist.

505
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,020
(both groaning)

506
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,060
You just won't give up.

507
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,190
Want us to
write this down?

508
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,080
You've got a
lot of nerve!

509
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,270
I'll say
that much for you.

510
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,120
Coming into our town
with your silly trick moves.

511
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,200
You're gonna
get a spanking.

512
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,230
"Silly trick moves?"

513
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,280
"Spanking?"

514
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,010
Would you get out
of the way, please?

515
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,040
I'm not through shopping

516
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,060
and there are
still some stores

517
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,220
that I haven't been in yet.

518
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,170
Ah, well, you're a
nice piece of merchandise.

519
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,060
Do me a favor
and don't touch me.

520
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,140
Don't make me mad.

521
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,240
Yeah, what's
gonna happen?

522
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,150

My goodness, these crackers
are harder than I thought.

525
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,100
Now you've done it!

526
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,230
Let's get 'em, boys!

527
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,080
May I borrow
this please?

528
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm a woman,
hear me roar!

529
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,250
(shouting and yelling)

530
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,230
Quiet now.

531
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,050
I think the ladies
could be returning

532
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,080
from their trip to
town at any time.

533
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,130
Shall we go for a walk and
join them on their way back?

534
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,110
A walk sounds pretty good.

535
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,020
It is a nice day.

536
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,040
Missed our chance again!
