giving them the money

kill me or my daughter.

Not really.

to do something rash.

I'm not sure how
this will end,

The truth is, Mr. Katsu asked me
not to tell you what occurred.

Still, I thought
you ought to know.

Yes, but they're
not impartial.

They've been keeping
an eye on Mr. Katsu.

If they think he's been
hiding the Tokugawa money,

214

they'll come in

problem by himself.

Come on, that's suicide!
