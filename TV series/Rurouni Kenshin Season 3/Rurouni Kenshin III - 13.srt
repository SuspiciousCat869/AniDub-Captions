this animal back here

me to examine him?

113
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,210
Well, considering how rudely

114
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,100
you've been acting
towards me, Sano,

115
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,130
I shouldn't help you.

116

I'll do it.

118
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,190
You surprise me, Sano,
I thought all you care

119
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,210
about is eating for free,
gambling, and having

120
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,000
a warm place to sleep.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,080
Don't you see this dog
forced me to help him?

122
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,180
Well, we better
take him out back

123
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,110
and let Megumi
have a look at him.

124
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,250
I've lifted water buffalos

125
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,010

than this thing.

126

Susie, maybe we can help
nurse this dog back to health

127
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,240

out pet forever!

Sure, Bow-wow better.

129
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,150
So, Sano, I guess this dog
isn't your pet after all.

130
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,000
The only pets I've ever had
was when I lived by the dump

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,190
and those were
cockroaches and fleas!

132
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,180
And his pet fleas still
live with him today.

133
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,220
So, tell us, Megumi,
what's the story

134
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,190
on our new friend?

135
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,220
He's overtired and starved,

136
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,260
but he'll be fine.

137
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,130
He had water in his lungs,
it looks like he almost drowned.

138
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,210
I'd say he had a rough
couple of days and he might

139
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,150
have accidentally
fallen into the river.

140
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,110
All he needs now
is food and rest.

141
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,100
Megumi, why don't you take
a break and have some of

142
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,180
that black oolong tea
that I made for us.

143
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,090
Yeah, let's eat,
'cause there's nothing

144
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,030
that tastes better
with tea than Megumi's

145
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,160
ohagi rice.

146
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,220

rice balls in town!

147
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,110

148
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,220
Thank you, let's eat!

149
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,210
Well.

150
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,220
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

151
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,020
Those are mine!

152
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,270
Look, he wants you to share!

153
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,130
Good dog!

154
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,180
Well, now, it looks like
your canine companion

155
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,010
wants to split your lunch.

156

Bon appetit, Sano!

157
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,020

158
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,240
Help me get this tub
of lard off my lap

159
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,210
before he makes really
short work of my lunch!

160
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,200
Oh, no, is he drooling?

161
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,230
He is drooling!

162

Oh, that's just great.

163
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,100
Now, I've got a rice ball feast

164
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,040
that's been covered
in doggy drool.

165
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,120
The first good meal I get
in weeks and this fleabag

166
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,140
reduces it to spitballs.

soulful eyes routine on me?

179

He's expressing he's grateful.

180
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,120
I think he's trying
to express that he wants

181
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,110
more food.

182
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,010
I'd say that this dog
must be related to Sano

183
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,090
because even after he's eaten,

184
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,140
he still wants more.

187

there's only one way to get it.

188
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,190
If you want more,
you gotta go straight

189
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,220
to the source.

190
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,200

Megumi extra nicely.

Hey, what are you up to?

192

Finally, a little
of your own medicine.

194
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
That'll teach you two.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,240
You sure would make
a good dog trainer.

196
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,290
He sure likes people.

197
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,240
He's too friendly

to be missing him a lot.

202

and post it on the street

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,180
Yup.

So, just what is this
doggy's name anyway?

209
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,080
I don't know.

210
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,090
Let's give him a name.

211
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,270
Since he's so big,
why don't we call him Husky?

212
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,060
Husky?

213
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,140
How about Furball?

214
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,220
Husky sounds like a perfect name

let's give Sano a new name.

216

Let's call him Musky.

Okay, Husky, go get her, boy!

That dog isn't housebroken.

He's just marking his territory,

It's really natural
for a dog to do that.

All dogs do it.
