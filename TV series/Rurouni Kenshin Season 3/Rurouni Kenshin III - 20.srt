00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,130
After they arrived in
China, his mother died.

333
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,040
Kaiou was left
orphaned and homeless.

334
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,160
He had a hard life
and cursed Japan,

335
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,140
which had taken his
nationality away from him.

336
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,080
During the upheaval at the
end of the Tokugawa Era,

337
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,050
he slipped back into Japan
and settled in Kyushu.

338
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,150
He's been here
ever since,

339
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,040
consolidating power and
waiting for the opportunity

340
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,010
to take his revenge.

341
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,000
Interesting.

342
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,070
Both Shogo and Kaiou
suffered as Christians,

343
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,200
and now each one
seeks vengeance.

344
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,280
Hmm, what's going
on over there?

someone over there on land.

If your information
is accurate,

376
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,100
the medallion might
be at Sir Kaiou's.

How perceptive of you.

378
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,180
That's why
I've been asking

to the people

Then I will become the
Archbishop of this church

and spread his
gospel far and wide.

Prophecy by Shogo Amakusa.

their fanaticism will

They'll turn this
country upside-down

442

and political power will
move into Dutch hands.

443
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,100
I will then step
forward and become king.
