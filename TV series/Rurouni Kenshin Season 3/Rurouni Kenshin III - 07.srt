Shishio, I'll tell you why.

I wounded Battousai,

he lost much of his strength.

67
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,190
He wasn't able to fight you
at his full strength.

68

You can't claim the title
of most powerful

when you defeat a man
in a depleted condition,

00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,200
it's meaningless.

71

72
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,100
Just what is he proposing to do?

73
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,280
I believe the man
wishes to compensate

74
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,260
for Battousai's loss
by competing with me.

75
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,080
That's ridiculous,
he wouldn't have had

76

77

in excellent condition.

78
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,050
It's obvious to me
that your power

79

outweighs his.

83
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:24,270

it's a foolish choice

would be icing on the cake.

the Juppongatana.

Kaiten Kenbu Rokuren
is very effective

179

when it's done correctly,

181

It's unfortunate for you,
because you came so close,

182

and my move

183

truly successful at it,

achieve that level!

going for you, Aoshi.

193
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,040
But apparently,
you've allowed yourself

194
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,140

195

use in you moving.

198

to get up and save you!

199
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,140
What?

200
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,270
That's a ridiculous notion.

201
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,150
Why, Battousai will never
be able to get up again.

Aoshi, then you've gone crazy.

205
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,040
Battousai's practically

206
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,422
a corpse.

207
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:41,190
He's never going
to get up again!

208
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,040
All he's good for now
is food for the worms.

209
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,250
There's no sense in
continuing the struggle,

210

it's useless!

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,220
Face it, Aoshi,
Battousai is never

212
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,200
going to come back to life,
so why don't you just forget it?

213
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,170
I hope that he listens,
Shishio won't be able

214
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,210
to fight any longer.

215
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,270
Ugh...

216
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,080
Can Battousai really be dead?

217
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,150
(clang)

218
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,230
My master once told me
the will to live

219
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,190
is stronger than anything else.

220
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,170
His enlightened words
have given me the power

221
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,070
and strength to continue on,
even when I was hovering

222
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,200
between the void
of life and death.

223
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,020
All I can tell you
is that my mastery

224
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,170
of the secret principle
is based on this belief.

225
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,150
The crimes I committed

226
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,180
as Battousai

227
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,110
can never be forgiven,
and so I've made up my mind

228
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,100
that it doesn't matter
if I live or die.

229
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,000
That's not important, right?

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,408
No.

231
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:29,030
I realize that
I deserve to be

232
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,080
punished for
the heinous sins

233
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,250
of my past.

234
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,060
But no matter
how much guilt I feel,

235
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,280
or how much pain
I've caused other people

236
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,070
by committing these
terrible offenses,

237
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,250
there's still
a powerful feeling

238
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,190
deep inside of me
that makes it possible

239
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,260
to survive!

240
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,270
It's the will,
the desire

241
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,110
to go on living.

242
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,080
And never, ever giving up.

243
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,240
That will is
my greatest secret,

244
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,090
Aoshi.

245
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,040
(panting)

246
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,070
Look, the man isn't
going to give up!

247
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,100
Why does he keep fighting?

248
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,270
His efforts will be futile!

249
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,290
I'm beginning to believe
he's possessed!

250
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,220
Don't be so hasty, Shishio.

251
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,120
I'm still willing
to take you on.

252
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,230
I'll finish you yet!

253
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,280
What a pity!

254
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,090
You remind me of Battousai,

255
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,050
I'd have to say that
you're more intolerant

256
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,240
than he is, but
you're just like him

257
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,030
when it comes to taking up
the sword for others.

258
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,070
Don't like hearing the truth?

259
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,130
Personally, I believe

260
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,080
you have the guts or the will
to become the most powerful!

261
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,030
And just like that
pathetic Battousai,

262
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,000
your desire to live
was already gone

263
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,260
when you came here
to fight me!

264
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,250
(whoosh)

265
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,140
It doesn't make a whole
lot of difference to me

266
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,100
whether you compare me
to Battousai or not,

267
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,210
but there is one thing
I have to say.

268
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,080
Listen to me, Shishio,
because I really believe this.

269
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,040
I'm more powerful than you are.

270

(wind rushing)

271
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,280
Hmph, you're desperate, Aoshi.

272
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,110
It sounds like the
howling of a dying dog.

273
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,130
Hmm?

274

There's no way, it can't be,

275
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,100
I killed him!

Oh, no, that's impossible!

280
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,260
He'd have to be immortal.

281
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,070
But just the same,
Shishio, he appears

282
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,260
to be unconscious,
now's your chance

283

to get rid of him for good!

284

Go ahead and give him
the final blow

He can't be,

One advantage is
that he's half-dead,

he's not as skilled as Shishio.

Kenshin insisted

334
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,010

but I thought

335
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,130
it was a bad idea.

336
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,160

to rely on him after all.

pleasant surprise.

341
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,080
Battousai, I do hope
you had a nice trip

342
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,160
to hell and back.

343
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,260
Tell me, are you staying, huh?

344
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,250
Or would you like me
to send you back again?

345
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, I certainly hope
that you'll recover

346
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,030
because I'm burning up
with fiery flames

347
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,260

that's going to feel the heat!

Oh, we've got to stop this.

355
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,290
He's past his 15 minute limit,

356
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,060
and it's dangerous
for him to continue.

357

Huh?

358

Think, Hoji,
you've forgotten

359
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,190
Shishio can't sweat
because of all the burns

360
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,210
on his body.

361
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,040
If he doesn't stop now,
his body temperature

362
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,180
will get so high
he'll become

363
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,060
a human bonfire!

364
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,140
You're right,
we have to stop him!

365
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,090
How is that possible
for a human being

366
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,250
to be so very hot?

367
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,000
I can get hotter
than any human.

368
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,389
You see,
when my body

369
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:27,030
was burned,
my sweat glands

370
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,160
were completely destroyed.

371
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,260
It's impossible to keep
this heat under control.

372
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,250
I can burn just
like a hot flame.

373
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,120
And when I become angry,
the temperature of my body

374
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,070
can become volcanic!

375
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,040
In other words,
the heat's intensity

376
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,240

I'm burning in hell.

00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,030
I fought for many years
to get myself to that point.

500
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,080
But I'm not going
to allow you

501
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,180
to inflict pain on others
or trying to live their lives,

502
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,200
it's not going to happen!

503
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,160
I won't allow you
to destroy everything,

504
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,240
because I know what you're doing

505
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,290
is wrong!

506
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,000
I'll rid the world of you!

507
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,190
Hiten Mitsurugi!

508
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,190
Nine-headed dragon, fly!

509
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,050
(grunting)

510
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,140
(gasp)

511
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,130
Ugh.

512
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,170
(panting)

513
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,130
Battousai is holding on

514
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,150
by a thread.

515
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,180
Every blow he receives
brings him closer and closer

516
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,270
towards death,
but somehow

517
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,050
he's resisted the flaming power
that rages within Shishio!

518
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,020
It seems impossible, but true!

519
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,090
And his commitment
to his cause

520
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,040
has given him the advantage,
at least temporarily.

521
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,140
Shishio was taken by surprise

522
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,160
and took a fall.

523
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,100
I can see why Shishio
wanted to kill him so badly.

524
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
Killing Battousai
would assure him

525
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,110
that he could take over
as leader of Japan,

526
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,150
but that's not what's
possessing him to do it.

527
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,180
No, it's more
profound than that.

528
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,020
The death of Battousai
would be equal

529
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,220
to taking over the country!

530
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,150
Meeting both of these goals
would be the ultimate conquest!

531
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,110
He must do it,

532
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,070
he must kill Battousai!

533
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,160
(gasping)

534
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,180
(whoosh)

535
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,040
What the hell's going on?

536
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,120
There are flames everywhere!

537
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,060
It's burning up
everything in its path!

538
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,110
The fire's a reflection
of Shishio's rage.

539
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,260
It's reacting to him
like the leaves reacted

540
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,260
to Kenshin.

541
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,020
Like Kenshin?

542
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,270
I think that leaves and fire
are very different things.

543
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,140
Are you ready for
the final showdown?

544
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,200
(gasp)

545
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,160
Oh.

546
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,170
You're alive.

547
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,070
Behold, the secret
sword technique

548
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,250
of Kaguzuchi.

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,230
Kaguzuchi?

552
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,220
It's truly a secret

553
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,190
if Yumi doesn't know about it.

554
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,030
This has to be
Shishio's most powerful

555
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,240
secret technique!

556
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,270
Kenshin will be forced
to use his secret principle

557
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,220
just like he did with Aoshi.
