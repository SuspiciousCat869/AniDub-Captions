I just don't understand
what could have caused this.

No one's reported
anything that was unusual.

Maybe you went

Yes, but that wasn't the only

a feng shui expert
suddenly appears

followed by a businessman
named Mr. Saeke.

192

He gives them some money

193

and then destroys
the building,

194
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,280

be any bad luck.

So, that can happen to us?

It might not be a
bad thing after all.

197
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,240
We can get
a lot of money,

and then we can use
it to build a new dojo.

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,250
Oh, it's too late.

332
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,130
Wow, this
place burned up

333
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,000
like one of
Kaoru's suppers.

334
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,120
Oh, well, at least
it's fortunate

335
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,180
none of the neighbors
houses caught on fire.

336
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,030
Some people think this
place has evil spirits.

337
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,280
That means I won't be able
to do business here anymore.

338
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,230
-Oh!
-Don't worry, Tae.

339
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,010
We'll help you
get through this.

340
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,230
I don't like
what's going on here.

341
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,190
I want to find out some more
about that feng shui guy.

342
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,220
From the way
that Tae described

343
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,260
his face and appearance,

344
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,000
I'd be willing
to bet that he's

345
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,190
the feng shui expert
that our friend,

346
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,180
Tsunan, had
talked about.

347
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,220
Is the owner here?

348
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,220
That's me.

349
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
May I come in?

350
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,040
Yes, please.

351
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,200
My name is
Yunoshin Saeke.

352
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,230
I'm the president
of the Saeke company.

353
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,130
Someone informed me
that you had a big fire.

354
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,270
I'd like to buy
you a talisman stone

355
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,060
to put on your property.

356
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,080
But why?

357
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,130
It's for good luck,

358
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,240
and it may improve
the flow of the energy

359
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,200
in this area if you
choose to move out.

360
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,290
I don't want to!

361
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,220
Sorry, I apologize for
coming here unannounced.

362
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,080
It was extremely rude of me.

363
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,270
Perhaps, I should
come back another time

364
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,040
when it's less hectic.

365
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,170
It's not my nature
to sit around

366
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,120
when I know that
others are in pain.

367
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,280
I appreciate your concern,

368
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,030
but I'm much
too busy right now

369
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,250
to give it much thought.

370
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,270
Come back at
another time

371
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,150
and we'll talk
about it then.

372
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,200
Okay, I'd be happy to
help you out in any way,

373
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,140
so don't be
afraid to speak up.

374
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,070
Being able to help
people achieve happiness

375
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,140
and prosperity is a very
pleasurable experience.

376
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,000
-You're a fraud!
-Huh?

377
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,050
That was mean!

378
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,140
I think that he's
trying to trick you, Tae.

379
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,050
No, I'm just
trying to help.

380
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,060
-I'm an honest man!
-Shut up!

381
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,200
We've heard all about you
and the way you've been

382
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,170
buying up everybody's
property around here.

383
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,270
(growls)

384
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,190
You've got
it all wrong.

385
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,270
I've never forced
anyone to sell anything.

386
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,000
If you were a smart guy,

387
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,040
you would high tail
it out of here

388
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,030
before I throw you out.

389
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,230
I'm very sorry to
have bothered you, Miss.

390
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,000
Just know that
I'm here for you

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,270
if you decide to
change your mind.

392
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,280
He'd better not
try coming back.

393
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,010
Tell me, Sano,
who was that man?

394
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,270
This makes the
formation clear.

395
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,080
It's pointing
towards northwest.

396
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,110
The flow of ki was
strategically designed

397
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,070
in a star shaped pattern.

398
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,070
(energy pulsing)

399
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,200
Now, I'm beginning
to understand.

400
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,020
Mr. Koachi, I want you
to listen to me carefully.

401
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,220
Don't underestimate
the power of feng shui.

402
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,180
It is a proven method
of domination

403
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,250
that has been used by the
Chinese for thousands of years.

404
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,120
The Qin dynasty
fell apart because of it.

405
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,280
It's all a bunch of hogwash
if you're asking me.

406
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,090
I disagree
with you on that.

407
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,230
It can be used as a weapon,

408
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,210
and that's why
the Qin dynasty failed.

409
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,130
Sometimes it can be
helpful if it's used

410
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,260
to enhance the quality
of people's lives,

411
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,140
but often times, it's not.

412
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,110
Excuse me, sir,
I'm about to close in

413
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,230
on the biggest
case of bribery

414
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,290
that's ever been uncovered
in Japan's history.

415
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,130
I don't have
time for this.

416
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,250
All this malarkey sounds
very frivolous to me.

417
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,270
I would respectfully request

418
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,290
the next time
you ask for me,

419
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,120
it's something
worthy of my time.

420
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,260
Chief.

421
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,180
Since Mr. Koachi is up to
his neck in bribery cases,

422
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,010
perhaps, you'd be
more interested

423
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,270
in heading up this
investigation.

424
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,290
Yes, sir.

425
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,290
You can't do that!

426
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,060
I'm in charge!

427
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,250
I'll have to
handle this.

428
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,280
The Ministry of the Army

429
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,220
has been taking
this matter seriously,

430
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,150
unlike the
police department.

431
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,240
Ever since we sent
our troops to Kagoshima,

432
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,280
we haven't been able to
rebuild our forces enough

433
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,240
to withstand another attack.

434
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,230
We must find a way
to strengthen our position,

435
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,140
or we wont be able to
ensure the security of Tokyo.

436
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,270
That sounds
pretty ominous, huh?

437
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,100
That's a bit of an
overstatement in my opinion.

438
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,280
(laughing)

439
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,230
You're acting like a
superstitious old fool.

440
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,250
You're the one who's
being ignorant, Koachi.

441
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,130
Feng shui is a powerful
force to be reckoned with.

442
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,040
If you aren't going
to take this seriously,

443
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,280
then I'm going to start
my own investigation.

444
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,120
Then you are mad.

445
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,280
You're abusing the
power of the military

446
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,070
by carrying this out.

447
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,070
I cannot believe you want

448
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,070
to humiliate the
army in this way.

449
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,150
And I'm not going to let the
police department lose face

450
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,100
if I have anything
to do with this.

451
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,050
In fact, if anyone
in my department

452
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,160
even touches this subject,

453
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,060
I am going to
have them fired,

454
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,230
do you understand?

455
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,220
(chuckles)

456
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,110
What's wrong?

457
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,120
How come you're only eating
the ones on that side?

458
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
I made this batch and
you haven't touched one.

459
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,280
They taste awful,
that's why.

460
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,050
(screams)

461
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,090
Thank you all for bringing
this food over here.

462
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,140
Have you decided
what you're going

463
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,090
to do about the
restaurant, Tae?

464
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,170
No, not yet.

465
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,170
I mentioned what happened

466
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,260
at the restaurant
to our friend, Tsunan.

467
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,190
He's been investigating
the situation.

468
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,100
Maybe he's got
some new information.

469
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,110
It wouldn't
hurt to ask.

470
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,110
-Hello again.
-Huh?

471
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,000
I was hoping that
I could visit.

472
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,230
What are you
doing back?

473
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,180
I was wondering if things
had calmed down a little

474
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,200
so we could talk.

475
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
I'm not giving up my business,
if that's what you want.

476
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,120
We've had this
area completely tested.

477
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,250
If you leave the
situation untreated,

478
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,230
I guarantee that something
horrible is bound to happen.

479
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,230
I can pay you a good
price for the property.

480
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,060
You can move and you won't have
anything more to worry about.

481
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,100
What do you think of that?

482
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,190
Huh?

483
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,010
Thank you so much
for your concern,

484
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,150
but I love
this restaurant

485
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,020
and have no intention
of leaving.

486
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,140
Please leave this place.

487
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,240
There is no more
you can do for me.

488
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,270
I've made my decision

489
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,080
and now I'm going to have
to deal with it alone.

Go away.

491

Forget we ever met.

I hope you're right.

I'll be going now.

Why'd you have to bow
down to that big creep?

502

You should have just kicked
him out on his butt.

I couldn't.

slapped him silly
