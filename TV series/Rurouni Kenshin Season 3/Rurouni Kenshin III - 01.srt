of you that still doesn't fully

understand the situation, so
out of the kindness of my heart,

50
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:58,782
I'm going to explain it
to you as simply as I can,

51
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,742
which is to say you're doomed.

52
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,962
In other words, you won't
leave this battlefield alive!

53
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:05,802
Based on our current situation,

54
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:08,772
there are three reasons
for this, all quite logical.

55
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,942
The first reason is
that you will never,

56
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:12,932
ever see Kenshin again.

57
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:14,752
He's not coming to rescue you

58
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:17,012
here in Aoiya,
you stupid fools.

59
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:19,732
Remember, those
who ignore history

60
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:20,862
are condemned to repeat it,

61
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,972
and Shishio has
never been defeated.

62
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,822
Himura will die and
the dead don't come here.

63
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:28,742
They go to the next world.

64
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:29,772
(grunting)

65
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,962
Now, logically speaking,
based on our current situation,

66
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,792
let us examine
the second reason.

67
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,952
You all deserve a tremendous
amount of credit for having

68
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:39,742
defeated the members
of the Juppongatana

69
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,952
you have faced up to this point
with a group of mere women,

70
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:43,842
teenagers, and children.

71
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:45,952
However, as a result
of this fighting,

72
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,752
you're on your last legs,

73
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:49,832
and you have no more strength
left to fight anyone,

74
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,742
much less a giant.

75
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:53,932
And now our conversation
leads us to the third reason

76
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:56,902
why none of you have a chance
of leaving here alive.

77
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:58,872
In case you're wondering,
his name is Fuji,

78
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:00,832
and though I could tell
you more about him, I believe

79
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:03,782
a simple demonstration
will suffice, right?

Are you ready?

488
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:10,101
'Cause there's no turning
back once you're inside.

489
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:13,941
What makes Sojiro unique is
his total lack of emotion,

490
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:15,061
which makes it nearly impossible

491
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:17,021
to know what he's
going to do next.

492
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:18,221
Sojiro also has another tactic

493
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,071
that makes him
almost invincible,

494
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:24,171
a secret move, which Kenshin
Himura doesn't know about.

495
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:27,101
That secret is what led to
the successful assassination

496
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:29,161
of Okubo.

497
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:32,091
Sojiro cannot be defeated,
he's the strongest swordsman

498
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:33,171
I've ever created.

499
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:35,171
Kenshin cannot win.

500
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:37,181
The moment has finally arrived

501
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:40,081
for the legend of
Battousai the Slasher

502
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:42,931
to come to an end.

503
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:45,211
Kenshin, how nice it
is to see you again.
