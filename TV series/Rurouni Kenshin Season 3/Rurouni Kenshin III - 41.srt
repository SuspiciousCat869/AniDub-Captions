Exactly what does

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,270
it can manipulate
all energy freely,

the energy may be.

all about until now.

What was weird about it?

171
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,100
Well, he asked me to make a trip

172
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,120
to every single shrine
from the Senate House

173
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,180
on up into the Northeast
Domain just past Tokyo.

174
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,270
Was there anything
about these shrines

175
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,090
he wanted you to check?

176
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,110
I had to count the number
of southwest gates, that's all.

177
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,230
The police didn't ask,
so I never told them.

178
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,010
That's all I can remember.

179
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,260
I've told you everything,
I'm quite sure about that.

180
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,270
There's nothing else.

181
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,220
Hm.

182
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,140
Hey, I think you're holdin'
somethin' back from us.

183
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,170
No, that's all!

Mm-hm, mm-hm.

187
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,010
He asked me to
talk to the Senate.

188
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,200
I was to get a copy
of the decree,

an order to separate
Buddhism and Shintoism.

I want a copy of that mandate.

Round up all your men.

We have to secure the entire

We don't know yet,

240
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,100
Saeki's business
manager to tell us

241
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,070
what he didn't tell the police.

242
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,240
He's been checking out
all the shrines near the Senate.

243
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,260
Actually, he found out
something very interesting.

244
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,210
There's a link
between the Ryu Myaku

and all the southwest gates.

248

target, the Senate.

Yes, that's me.

We don't have time to spare!

Take it easy, I'm old.

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,280
I'll never forget this.

307
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,020
It's a map of where
Toshogu's ki was removed.

308
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,230
Hm?

309
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,130
The Meiji government feared
the very existence of Toshogu.

310
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,040
They thought as long as Ieyasu
Tokugawa's tomb was there,

311
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,110
the ghost of Tokugawa Era
might rise up from the grave

312
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,020
and take over again.

313
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,160
So certain powerful
officials secretly removed

314
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,020
points of the highest energy

315
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,050
and took them to
a different location.

316
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,100
One item they
transferred out of Toshogu

317
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,040
has the might to manipulate
all energy that exists

318
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,200
in the ground.

319
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,210
This amazing tool belonged
to the wind families.

320
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,260
The officials that took it

321
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,230
never wanted the winds
to find it again.

322
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,140
I remember overhearing
them say just how difficult

323
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,100
the big thing was to bury.

324
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,090
They buried it?

325
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,200
Do you know where?

326
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,080
It was in Senjogahara.

327
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,180
But what is it?

328
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Mm, I was never really
able to find that out.

329
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,020
But I do know if you
make a mistake with it,

330
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,090
it could destroy us.

331

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,110

it in the roof facade

our former capital.

Kyoto is here,

burned it down on purpose

487

so they could turn it
into a gate for demons.

I'm sorry to drop in on you

498
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,270
at this late hour, Commander.

499
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,130
I forgot to tell you something.

500
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,130
Will you help me?

501
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,140
I've got it.

502
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,040
The shrines that
make up the five points

503
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,260
of the feng shui star
are Toshogu, Futarasan,

504
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,100
Okonomiya,
Manjanji, and Kazan.

505
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,110
These five energy points are
interacting with each other,

506
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,090
which means the ki
changes direction

507
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,010
directly below Lake Chuzenji.

508
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,000
Take a look.

509
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,160
See how the lake is
shaped like a bowl

510
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,180
at the base of the mountain?

511
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,240
It's acting like
a big basin of energy.

512
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,000
Are you able to figure out

513
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,040
just where Reisui
is hiding himself?

514

♪

515
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,200
That's got to be the spot.

516
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
Reisui has to be
in Senjogahara.

517
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,100
But before he went there,

518
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,240
he must have grabbed
the real device

519
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,020
and took it with him.

520
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,180
You're probably right,
but it's possible

521
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,010
somebody else has it.

522
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,040
The Ryu Myaku has to be
stopped before it's too late.

523
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,170
We have to go
to Senjogahara now.

524
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,190
Come on.

525
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,160
Jinpu!

526
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,290
Give your wounded foot a rest.

527
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,000
Take my horse.

528
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,030
Thanks, Sanosuke!

They don't have the slightest
idea what's going on.

00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,200
It's working out
just as I planned.
