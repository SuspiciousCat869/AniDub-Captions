else get hurt?

Yes, as a matter of fact,

103
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:08,206
another young man, named
Shiraishi, was killed.

He was one of the ones
who received a warning.

105
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:13,126
Now all of those who
were warned are dead.

106
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,226
Know who they were?

107
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,976
I checked out the background

108
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,096
of the three men
that were warned

109
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:18,156
and then later murdered.

110
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:20,976
I found out that they were all
prominent Christian leaders

111
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:23,026
during the Tokugawa era.

112
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,256
Christian leaders?

113
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:28,086
Yes, Christianity was banned
during the Tokugawa era.

114
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:29,246
It was a very dark era.

115
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:30,226
What do you mean?

116
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:31,236
What did they do?

117
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:33,136
During the Tokugawa era,

118
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:35,246
anyone who even believed
in Christianity at all

119
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,036
was severely punished.

120
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:39,166
And that included
women and children.

121
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,136
But in spite of that,

122
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:41,226
followers went underground

123
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:44,056
and continued to
practice their religion.

124
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:45,126
Some still hide.

125
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:46,146
So Kenshin,

126
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,106
are these killings
some kind of a payback?

127
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:49,226
I don't know.

130

00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,076
You have to stay in bed.

137

Otherwise, you'll get worse.

138
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:07,976
I can't stay in bed.

139
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:10,016
We got a note from
one of our agents.

140

It's about Master Hiko.
