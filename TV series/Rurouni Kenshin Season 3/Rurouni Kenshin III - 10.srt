bitter memories for Kenshin.

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,010
He needs to rest

52
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,290

from it for a while.

Kori's right, Kenshin
was once known as Battousai.

56
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,130
He's always going
to have to live with that.

57
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,230
But that was
all in the past.

58
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,170
Kenshin's not
like that anymore.

59
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,200
He's a new person

60
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,090
and he should
be proud of himself.

61
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,080
He needs to put those
memories behind him.

62
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,180
He's been through so
much, it'll take time.

63
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,230
Don't you understand?

64
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,060
Understand--come on, Kori,
it's time for Kenshin

65
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,140
to get on with his life!

66
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,200
He's got to quit
being so negative!

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,230
Otherwise, he's gonna
drive himself crazy!

68
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,280
I just don't want
to take a chance.

69
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,190
That's enough already,
quit making such a fuss.

70
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,010
You should trust your elders.

71
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,210
I'll tell you
what you should do.

72
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,270

doing up the town.

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,110
Maybe I'll get a geisha.

79
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,140
Excuse me,
what kind of tea

80
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,070
did you say
you were drinking?

81
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,080
Well, I suppose we do
deserve some fun after all.

82
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,180
I'll go wake up the others.

83
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,180
I'm sorry, but Kenshin
and Sano aren't here,

84
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,250
they've gone someplace.

85
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,090
Do you happen to know
where they went?

86
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,260
Did they go off together?

87
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,010
They weren't together.

88
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,030
Kenshin left first

89
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,270
and I have no idea
where they went.

90
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,190
You know, I think I'll do
some sightseeing myself.

91
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,000
What, where are you going?

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,030
Come back here.

93
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,000
The least you can do

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,130
is tell me
where you're going.

95
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,130
Mount Hiei.

96
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,110

97
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,090

wait a minute!

99
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,220
-Uh, Kori.
-Huh?

100
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,010
Where did Kenshin go?

101
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,060
What's the big idea,
you startled me, Megumi.

102
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm really sorry about
that, I didn't mean to.

103
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,200
But I was hoping
to talk to you.

104
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,020
Could we spend
some time together?

105
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,110
There's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

106
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,050
It's always hard
to leave friends behind,

107
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,120
but I really couldn't
wait to get back home.

108
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,040
Kenshin needed time to heal

109
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,040
and this city only held
grim reminders of the past.

110
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
But first he had to
make peace with himself

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,150
and pay his respects

112
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,210
to those that have
fallen along the way.

113
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,010
-Excuse me.
-Oh?

114
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,180
Those are very
beautiful flowers.

115
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,230
I'd like to buy some.

116
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,080
I'm taking them
to an old friend.

117
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,060
Kori!

118
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,170
Okina and I are getting
ready to go into town.

119
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,290
Where are you?

120
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,090
Huh, she's not here.

121
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,290
Oh, damn, the old man's
gonna be very disappointed

123
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,060

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,090
Aoshi!

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,260
I could help you,
if only you'd let me.

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,200
I've just got
to see it for myself.

127
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,250
The exact spot where
Kenshin fought Shishio.

128
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,000
Wow, what a mess!

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,140
This place used to be
Shishio's hideout.

130
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,270
Now look at it.

131
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,040
I guess this is
all that's left here.

132
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,140
Hmm.

133
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,190
It really burns me up

134
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,160
that I couldn't
be here to see it.

135
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,080
(insects chirping)

136
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,180
Huh, grrr!

137
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,270
Looks like someone
got left behind.

138
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,130
Huh?

139
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,050
You?

140
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,030
What in the heck
are you doin' here?

141
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,200
When Megumi asked
to speak to me,

142
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,100
I wasn't sure how to react.

143
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,050
We had never been
the best of friends.

144
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,010
I didn't know if
I could really trust her.

145
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,240
But we had something
in common: Kenshin.

146
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,150
I knew she cared about him
just as much as I did.

147
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,210
I could see there was
something troubling her,

148
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,010
but I couldn't
figure out what it was.

149
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,270
So, Yoshi, you're trying
to tell me you came here

150
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,050
just to have
a look at the place?

151
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,030
Yeah, that's right.

152
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,220
I needed to see it
with my own eyes.

153
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,100
Well, I'm glad you did,
because otherwise

154
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,110
I wouldn't have been able

155
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,030
to devour this
scrumptious lunch.

156
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,050
This is absolutely
delicious, who was the chef,

157
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,070
it wasn't you, was it?

158
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,260
No way, Omasu made it.

159
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,250
Well, that figures.

160
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,040
I wish Kori knew
how to cook like this.

161
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,200
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

162
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,020
Sano?

163
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,389
Hm?

164
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,010
It bothers me
that I wasn't allowed

165
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,180
to be there to help Kenshin.

166
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,200
It made me feel
left out, you know?

167
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,240
What are you
talking about, Yoshi?

168
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,210
You defeated a member
of the Juppongatana

169
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,170
all by yourself
and protected everyone.

170
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,190
How is it possible

171
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,290
that you feel as if
you've been left out, huh?

172
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,050
Because, I never
had the opportunity

173
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,160
to get a first-hand look
into that bastard's eyes.

174
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,120
and I'm talking
about Shishio.

175
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,280
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

176
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,100
Ow, what's that for?

177
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,150
Because you're a kid.

178
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,140
Sano!

179
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,130
I'm taking you to the place

180
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,290
where Kenshin and Shishio
had their battle.

181
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,190
Will that satisfy you?

182
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,290
(water lapping)

183
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,150
Megumi, before
you say anything,

184
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,060
I'd like to thank you
for coming all this way

185
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,170
to be with us.

186
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,130
I honestly don't know
what I would have done

187
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,140
if you hadn't been here
to treat Kenshin.

188
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,010
There's no need
to thank me, Kori.

189
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,170
You asked me
to come and I did.

190
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,290
I'm just doing my job.

191
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,000
I appreciate it.

192
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,040
It makes me
feel better to know

193
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,080
that I can rely on you
at times like this.

194
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,070
It means a lot.

195
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,070
That's all well and good,

196
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,170
but what's going to
happen the next time

197
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,250
Kenshin gets injured?

198
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,170
It may be much more
than I can handle.

199
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,030
Who'll take care of him then?

200
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,170
What do you mean, Megumi?

201
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,240
Just because Kenshin
is a superb athlete

202
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,220
doesn't mean that
he's a super human being

203
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,040
that's immune
from getting hurt.

204
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,170
It's just not true.

205
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,020
He's just an
ordinary human being

206
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,140
like the rest of us, Kori.

207
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,240
He can't go on
getting beat up

208
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,040
without it taking a
dangerous toll on his body.

209
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,200
If he keeps abusing himself,

210
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,070
the effects will
begin to accumulate.

211
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,150
This is serious.

212
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,210
He may have made
it through this fight,

213
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,020
but what about the next?

214
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,250
And Kori,
I wouldn't be surprised

215
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,250
if he managed to get himself
killed the next time.

216
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,080
What I'm telling you is true.

217
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,230
He was just lucky,
that's all.

218
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,220
He can't keep
pushing the limits.

219
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,060
This place hasn't
changed in ten years.

220
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,280
It's the same as
it's always been.

221
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,030
Dear friend, you've
gone on to a better life.

222
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,070
(insects chirping)

223
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,070
(wind blowing)

224
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,230
(rain falling)

225
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,160
Oh no, it's raining.

226
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,270
I sure hope that
Yoshi will get back

227
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,100
without getting all drenched.

228
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,030
Huh?

229
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,230
Misao, come back here.

230
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,130
Aoshi, he'll get wet.

231
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,290
I've got to hurry.

232
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,200
Aoshi kept mainly to himself,

233
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,030
often sneaking away
to meditate alone.

234
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,090
It was his way of coping
with the pain of losing,

235
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,070
and it offered some
semblance of comfort to him.

236
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,050
Yes, there must be a reason.

237
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,100
A reason that
I was placed here.

238
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
But I don't know why.

239
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,210
You know I have to admit
I was really happy

240
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,120
after I beat that
bat guy to a pulp.

241
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
You know I really thought

242
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,050
I was some kind
of a superman.

243
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,170
But I didn't know
how foolish I was

244
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,190
until Kenshin told me

245
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,000
that being strong
and being right

246
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,190
were two different things.

247
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,010
He made me come
to the realization

248
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,250
there's still a lot
of things out there

249
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,050
I need to learn about.

250
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,260
I learned sometimes we're
not as smart as we think.

251
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,240
Hey, I'm not gonna argue
with you about that one.

252
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,210
You won't be surprised

253
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,130
if he gets killed
the next time?

254
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,040
That's what I said, Kori.

255
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,160
Megumi, that's not
gonna happen to Kenshin.

256
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,190
It could.

257
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,240
Kenshin survived this time,

258
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,270
but his next fight
could have

259
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,110
an extremely
different outcome.

260
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,120
Huh?

261
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,180
A doctor will only
be able to do so much.

262
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,100
Eventually,
Kenshin's condition

263
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,260
will begin to deteriorate.

264
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,270
The strain of battle
will get to him

265
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,280
and he will become
weak and vulnerable.

266
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,020
And once he dies,
he'll be gone forever.

267
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,160
Impossible.

268
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,040
I knew Megumi was right.

269
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,280
No one can come
back from the dead,

270
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,100
yet Kenshin held a small,
impossible hope

271
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,290
that it could be true.

272
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,220
All those that he
had killed needlessly

273
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,180
were coming back
to haunt him.

274
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,090
I'm very surprised
to see you here, Kenshin.

275
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,250
Did you finally decide
to visit this grave

276
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,090
after ten long years?

277
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,280
I had to come
eventually, Hiko.

278
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,220
And I see you managed
to find some nice flowers.

279
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,200
They're beautiful now,

280
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,150
but these flowers will
dry up and become dust,

281
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,270
just like my friend
beneath them.

282
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,270
All life has
a beginning and end,

283
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,280
and we can never change that.

284
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,240
No, I must
respect his privacy.

285
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,070
I don't want to
chase Aoshi away.

286
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,190
(thunder rumbling)

287
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,260
Oh!

288
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,240
As you can see, everything's
been fried to a crisp.

289
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,030
You were lucky
you weren't there.

290
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,140
Very few of us were
able to make it out

291
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,080
of that blasted inferno.

292
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,020
Hmm?

293
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,070
Huh?

294
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,080
He must have been
looking for Saito.

295
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,090
Oh, that's why he came here.

296
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,160
He wanted to find out
if Saito was still alive.

297
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,120
Fire was exploding everywhere.

298
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,020
I could barely
find my own way out,

299
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,000
let alone know what
happened to the others.

300
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,190
(rain falling)

301
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't know what to think.

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,250
The fire made
many things unclear.

303
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,070
On the one hand,
it seemed hard to believe

304
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,040
that Saito could
actually be dead.

305
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,170
But it's even
more improbable

306
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,130
that he could
have survived.

307
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,010
You know what
Shishio would have said.

308
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,030
Huh?

309
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,180
"I was a winner
'cause I survived."

310
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,040
Come on, let's
get out of here.

311
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,150
Ever since the Meiji
government took over,

312
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,110
I've been wandering around
almost all of Japan,

313
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,120
except here.

314
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,040
It was too painful.

315
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,100
There were too
many people here

316
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,180
who knew me from the past,

317
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,000
and I didn't want to become
involved in a confrontation,

318
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,220
so I never attempted
to come back.

319
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,160
Tell me, is that
the only reason?

320
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,230
No, I'm afraid not.

321
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,250
The truth is that this
place also reminds me

322
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,110
of the people I killed.

323
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,090
Seems so senseless now.

324
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,240
The hardest part is that
none of them deserved to die.

325
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,260
And then...

326
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,230
Kenshin, let's go back
to Kyoto together.

327
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,060
Then everything
will be fine.

328
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,020
And then I was freed.

329
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,290
(moaning)

330
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,290
I was able to buy
these flowers.

331
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,240
That's something I couldn't
bring myself to do before.

332
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,150
Here, then go back to Kyoto
as soon as possible,

333
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,250
because I wouldn't want
to have to lend a hand

334
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,140
if some grudge
seeking enemy of yours

335
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,000
decides to pick a fight.

336
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,060
So long, Kenshin.

337
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,000
I guess I have to get
out of here, my friend.

338
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,030
See you the next
Obon Festival.

339
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,010
Till then,
rest easy.

340
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,130
I don't think Kenshin has
the desire to fight again,

341
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,220
but if he gets himself
into another situation

342
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,280
like the last time,

343
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,270
he'll give 100% of himself,

344
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,040
no matter what
his physical condition.

345
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,070
And that could
cost him his life.

346
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,160
How do you know?

347
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,030
He's not stupid,
why would he do anything

348
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,200
to hurt himself?

349
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,160
What can I do to
make her understand

350
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,270
the seriousness
of this situation?

351
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,100
He can't change now.

352
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,190
You're gonna have
to be strong

353
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,130
because Kenshin
needs your help.

354
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,070
It's important that
you give him a reason

355
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,170
to keep on living.

356
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,090
Your help alone will
ensure his survival.

357
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,200
Kori, I've seen
the way he looks at you.

358
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,140
There's something
special there.

359
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,190
You were the only one
that he said goodbye to

360
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,090
when he left Kyoto.

361
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,040
I can tell he cares
for you deeply,

362
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
even though he doesn't
always show it.

363
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,130
He'll listen to what
you have to say.

364
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,220
You're the only person
who can help protect him

365
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,030
from himself.

366
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,270
I want you to be
aware of how important

367
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,240
your position is
in this whole matter,

368
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,150
because I care
about him, too.

369
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,170
And I know that you care
about him even more,

370
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,000
so promise me that
you won't let him down.

371
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,220
All right, I've
finished my little speech

372
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,150
and I hope that
you understand.

373
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,220
I know you'll do
the right thing.

374
