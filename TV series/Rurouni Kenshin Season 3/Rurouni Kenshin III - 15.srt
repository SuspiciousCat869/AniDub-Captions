This week,
a body was found

32
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,280
floating in the river here.

33
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,020
There was something strange
about how the body looked.

34
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,060
It was an important man
that worked for the shogunate.

35
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,030
How could a man of influence

36
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,170
end up this way?

37
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,080
There are many rumors,
but I only know what I saw

38
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,130
when they found the body.

39
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,060
His body had strange markings

40
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,280
carved into it.

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,260
There was an almost eerie symbol
carved deep in his back,

42
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,240
I didn't recognize it.

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Maybe it's an occult symbol,
but no one's figured out

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,070
what its significance is.

45
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,140
I heard that this man
had received a letter

46
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,240
proclaiming that his death

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,090
was imminent and
absolutely unavoidable.

48
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,110
The question remains,
who did this and why?

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,090
Please, Aoshi,
name your price

50
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,070
and I will pay it.

And even though
I know you've retired

56
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,040
from being a slasher,
I know money can be

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,220
a powerful incentive.

58
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,140

is not going to convince him.

this note is written in

I first heard about
this legendary story

362
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,240
40 years ago.

363
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,150
It was first told
to me by my master.

364
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,050
He was Seijuro Hiko, the 12th,
and he was my predecessor.

365
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,070
There was this young man
who studied under him

366
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,100
who was expected to become
Seijuro Hiko the 13th.

367
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,040
His name was Hyoei Nishida.

368
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,240
But Hyoei didn't pass
his last training test.

369
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,200
He just broke under pressure.

370
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,140
During that test,
the pupil has to beat

371
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,210
the Master's
nine-headed dragon thrust

372
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,200
using Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki.

373
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,090
If he does not
succeed in besting

374
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,010
the master's Kuzu Ryu Sen,
there is only one fate

375
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,090
left for him.

376
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,020
That fate is death.

377
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,260
Whether this is
a fair test or not,

378
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,250
you understand that's how
Hiten Mitsurugi style is.

379
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,050
To fail is to die,
and Hyoei failed.

380
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,220
Ahh!

381
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,030
(yelling)

382
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,100
Hyoei had lost and fell
into the waterfall and died,

383
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,290
or so everyone believed.

384
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,120
A little over ten years later,

385
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,220
we heard a rumor that
Hyoei was alive in China.

386
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,060
He was alive.

387
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
Somehow,

388
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,200
he had survived the fall.

389
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,080
What?

390
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,020
We now know for a fact
that Hyoei is still alive

391
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,070
and he's over 70 years old.

392
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,200
We also know while
he was recovering

393
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,220
in China,
Hyoei Nishida

394
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,280
proclaimed he was a Christian.

♪

396
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,080
He made the perilous voyage

397

to Nanking,
and there,

398
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,180
he regained his strength,
physically and mentally.

399
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,130
So then, Nishida was
a Christian in hiding?

400
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,160
In China, he became renewed.

401
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,290

with no fear of
religious persecution.

403

But instead of following
the Christian precept

404
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,220

Hyoei returned to Japan

405

12 years later
with his heart

406
