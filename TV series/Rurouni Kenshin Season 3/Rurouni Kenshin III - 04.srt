55

any uncertainty or sympathy
when facing an opponent

what I'm talking about.

329
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,749
I tried for years
to incorporate that move,

330
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:26,619
but something inside of me
just kept resisting it.

331
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:28,639
Deep down, I never
had enough confidence.

332

Really?

333
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:30,739

334
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:32,789
when Himura was about to do it.

335
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:34,659
So you're warning Shishio?

336
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:35,649
(grunts)

337
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,729
Just think of it as
my farewell gift to him.

338
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,669
I don't want him to get hurt
when he fights Battousai.

339
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:41,699
So listen,

340
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,499
Himura's eyes and arms
are not important here.

341
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:45,499
He can't make this move

342
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,579
without first putting
his left foot forward.

When Shishio sees
that happening,

he should be able
to anticipate the maneuver.
