Hello there, young folks,

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,050
my name is Hans, and
I come from Germany.

60

It's nice to meat you.

61

Oh my, you speak English.

62

Sano, why didn't you tell us?

63
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,080
Not only does this
guy speak English,

64
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,020
but he's an expert at shogi,
you know, Japanese chess.

65
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,090
I'm pretty good,
but he's unbeatable!

66
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,080
I've lost five
straight games to him!

67

68

69

Germany, do you, Kenshin?

70
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,280
No, I sure don't.

71

72

I thought that you Germans
would enjoy a party,

that it couldn't wait

172

until the festivities
were completed?

Know this, from
this time forward,

this consulate is
under our command!

Anything that goes
through this consulate

176
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,120
will go through us first,
is that understood, minister?

177
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,020
-What, how can that be?
-No questions!

178
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,280
From now on, you will
take your orders from me.

If anyone asks you
anything, you know nothing.

180
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,100
You will be richly rewarded

181
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,100
or severely punished,

182
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,270
the choice is yours.

get away with that, anyway?

do anything that we want.

It can't be, that's the
symbol of the Black Knights!

So, you are
the Black Knights?

Sure I will!

If Yutaro is going to use
medicine to help people,

you can use a sword
to help people.

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,050
we would never have attacked you
in such an ungentlemanly manner.

491
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,210
Please come over to join us.

492
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,190
I hope we haven't upset you.

493
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,130
It would be an honor
for us to meet you

494
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,110
and discuss our future
business together.

495
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,220
My pleasure.

496
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,180
Hm.

497
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,120
I feel it, here it is.

498
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,090
This is the Doctor's journal!

499
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,200
What is that thing?

500
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,010
Looks like a regular stone.

501
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,100
Hey, Yutaro, what is
the miraculous medicine

502
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,070
that the doctor
was talking about?

503
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,200
Can you tell us?

504
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,280
Miraculous medicine, does
this have to do with drugs?

505
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,020
Well, I don't
know about that.

506
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,000
Right now, these are the
only two clues that we have.

Yutaro?

I don't know what
this is all about,

510
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,080
but we'll help you
any way we can.
