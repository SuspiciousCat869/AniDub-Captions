111
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,160
Excuse me, hello?

112
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,110
Don't you guys realize

114

I'm used to working in the dark!

115
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,120
It's not a problem for me,

116
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,170
so let me shed a bit
of light on the subject.

117
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,270
Whoa, it's a good thing
you came along after all!

118
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,250
You saved us!

Hold it!

120

Don't you dare light that match!

121
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,200
That smell is sulfur, and
if there are any dead bodies,

122
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,120
it could produce a deadly blast!

123
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,040
A chemical reaction
sometimes occurs

124
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,150
when sulfur is combined with
gases from a decomposing corpse.

125
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,020
The place'll blow up if
there's any type of spark.

126
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,060
Whoa!

127
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,210
If the volcano remains
inactive, we're relatively safe,

128
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,280
but you never can tell
about those things.

129
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,260
Huh?

130
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,110
Unfortunately, we don't
have time to run any tests.

131
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,140
We better find a way out of here

132
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,230
before the whole
darn thing explodes.

133
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,070
You know, Yutaro, you may
have a point about that.

134
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,250
We'll be stir-fried
if we don't find a way

135
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,200
to climb out of
this hellhole fast!

136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,260
Come on, let's think.

137
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,260
The gas is starting
to build up--look!

138
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,030
If we breathe too much of
this gas, it could kill us!

139
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,110
It's getting thicker!

140
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,260
Now it's really
starting to stink!

141
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,050
(groaning)

142
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,150
The path is blocked and
there's no way to climb out!

143
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,270
She's right, there's
nowhere else we can go!

144
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, no!

145
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,110
If we don't get out of here,
we'll all end up dead meat!

146
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,240
It's getting really
hard to breathe!

147
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,260
We're gonna suffocate!

148
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,050
Somehow we've gotta break
through that stone wall!

149
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,170
Hey, Sano, your fist is
our only hope right now!

150
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,090
If I thought I could
break through it, I would,

151
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,000
but that wall's much
too thick for me.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,060
But it's our only chance.

153
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,290
I gotta give it a try!

154
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,290
Hurry, before I choke!

155
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,180
Come on, Sano, if
you don't do it soon,

156
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,290
I'm going to pass out!

157
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,100
What?

158
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,230
Hey, what's that sound?

159
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,250
Huh?

160
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,842
We hit the jackpot!

161
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,881
It's a spring!

162
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:49,903
This is incredible.

163
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,040
Now we don't have to
worry about suffocating!

164

Thank you, Kori,
but if you don't mind,

327
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,290
I think we oughta get going.

328
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,280
Hmm?

329
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,080
Well, we have to go back
and find that medicine!

330
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
If the Black Knights get
a hold of that formula,

331
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,240
it'll be a disaster!

332
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,040
But Yutaro!

333
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,000
They're already
so far ahead of us!

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,130
I realized after I
performed the operation.

335
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,000
It's important we
find the medicine

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,110
so no one has to suffer anymore.

337
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,150
The Black Knights can't
keep the secret formula

338
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,020
exclusively to themselves.

339
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,270
I agree with you.

You can't get up!

341

You'll pull out your stitches!

342
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,280
There's no time
to worry about that.

343
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,250
Take me with you, please.

344
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,180

My name is Kaita, I'm a ninja,

347
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,190
but now, I'm exiled from Sanada

348
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,240

disagreement with our leader.

He might be trying to trap us.

351
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,160
He wants us to believe
that he's on our side,

352
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,010
and then he'll turn
around and kill all of us!

I know that you don't
trust me, but you have to!

Well, I guess I'd

Misanagi, why are you

Because emissaries of the ninjas
