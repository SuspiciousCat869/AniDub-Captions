I've seen Sojiro fight.

What you were practicing
just now is Shukuchi.

139
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:05,426
It's an even faster
technique than Shinsoku,

140
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,476
am I correct?

141
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,396
So, you're aware of
the Shukuchi technique?

142
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:10,466
Well, I've gotta say,
I'm very impressed.

143
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:12,466
Shishio told me
about this method.

144
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,266
Before then,
I'd never even heard of it.

145
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,276
Shukuchi, huh?

146
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:17,436
That sounds very interesting.

147
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:20,336
Evidently, that's Sojiro's
third element of power.

148
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,426
The first two being
his Heavenly Sword

149
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:24,536
and, of course,
his complete lack of emotion.

150
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:26,346
Yes, that's right.

151
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,356
The Shukuchi technique
requires powerful footwork.

152
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:31,416
Sojiro is able
to reach maximum speed

153
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,386
from the very first step,
similar to how a magician

154
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:36,406
goes about creating an illusion.

155
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:39,426
Each time he steps,
he disappears into thin air.

156
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,486
He can jump from one point
to the other without ever

157
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:42,486
being seen.

158
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:43,536
So, what you're saying is

159
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:46,296
Shukuchi means speed
that cannot be detected

160
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:47,466
with the naked eye,
is that right?

161
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,516
Not exactly.

162
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:50,336
What you're thinking of

163
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,476
resembles Battousai's
Shinsoku technique.

164
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:56,306
Sojiro's ultra-fast movement
cannot be detected period.

165
00:07:56,306 --> 00:08:00,436
That's what makes
a far more superior method.

166
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:01,516
It's quite simple:

167
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:04,416
Battousai fights
by reading emotions

168
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,336
and when those
emotions don't exist

169
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:07,546
or don't manifest themselves,

170
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:09,486
it's impossible to detect them.

171
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:12,556
So, there's just about nothing
Battousai can do about it,

172
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:15,556
no matter how much he tries,
because Sojiro will always have

173
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:17,416
a big advantage.

174
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,276
Sojiro may be a kid,
but his lightning-fast speed

175
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:21,416
will win out, you'll see.

176
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,456
That means Battousai's chances

177
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:25,416
of surviving
this competition are--

178
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,346
Absolutely zero.

179
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:28,526
(cackles)

180
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,306
Do you know what, Kenshin?

181
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,556
The move I made
wasn't really Shukuchi,

182
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,396
it was actually a bit slower.

183
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,496
That's probably why you were
able to detect my motions

184
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:39,496
and avoid me.

185
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:40,536
Huh?

186
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,276
Huh?

187
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:44,446
I obviously
underestimated your capability.

188
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:46,346
I must do better next time.

189
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:49,306
You see, I was remembering
your speed when we met back

190
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:50,386
in Shingetsu village.

191
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:52,356
You didn't seem
to be that fast at the time

192
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:54,456
and I wanted to save
my energy for the fights ahead.

193
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:56,306
I thought it would
be sufficient,

194
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:57,356
but I was wrong.

195
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:59,336
You've improved
significantly since then.

196
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:03,356
However, I feel I'm able
to live up to the challenge now.

197
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:05,386

484
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,893
Lemme ask you something, Sano.

485
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:57,893
What?

486
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:58,973
It's about Sojiro.

487
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:00,073
Do you really think
it's possible for him

488
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:02,903
to be incapable of expressing
or feeling emotions?

489
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:04,013
Can anyone be that inhuman?

490
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,903
It's possible,
but very unlikely.

491
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:08,023
Besides, I really believe
that you got to him this time.

492
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:10,993
It's kinda difficult to explain,
but when I looked into his face,

493
00:21:10,993 --> 00:21:13,013
I could tell something
was troubling him somehow.

494
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:14,933
Well, it's just that
I was remembering

495
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,053
when I was in battle
with Saizuchi.

496
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:18,953
At one point, I dropped my guard
and returned to being Battousai.

497
00:21:18,953 --> 00:21:21,973
I think that Sojiro's having
a similar experience as well.

498
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:22,993
How so?

499
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:25,113
Perhaps Sojiro's not
the monster he appears to be.

500
00:21:25,113 --> 00:21:27,913
You just may be right.

501
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,863
I think that something
must have happened to him

502
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:31,023
a long time ago
that's caused him

503
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,133
to keep his emotions
from coming to the surface.

504
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:35,103
He's gonna have
to face his fears.

505
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:37,853
He can't keep them
sealed up inside of him.

506
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:38,893
When he realizes this,

507
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:42,043
he'll become
an even better fighter.

508
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:44,853
Hopefully, Sojiro will be able
to understand that, Kenshin,

509
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:46,873
and then somehow, his feelings
will gradually come back.

510
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,853
Why didn't you kill him
when you had the chance?

511
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:50,093
And what are you
doing down there?

512
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:53,973
This is no time
to tie your shoes!

513
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:55,013
It's really funny.

514
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,123
I never expected
this fight to go so badly.

515
00:21:57,123 --> 00:21:58,923
But I'm sticking to my guns:

516
00:21:58,923 --> 00:22:00,963
I refuse to believe
that Kenshin is right.

517
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:02,943
Oh, come on, Sojiro.

518
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:04,943
I'll never forget the words
that Shishio told me:

519
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:06,863
"If you're strong,
you'll survive,

520
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:08,853
and if you're weak,
you will perish."
