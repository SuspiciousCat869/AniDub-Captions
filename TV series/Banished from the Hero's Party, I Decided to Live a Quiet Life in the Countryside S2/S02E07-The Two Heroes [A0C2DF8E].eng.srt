00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:17,895
Nothing major to report.

166
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:20,057
Only that the new Hero

167
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:22,810
is very different
from how milady used to be.

168
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:25,022
And what would
make you say that?

169
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,985
Suppose the best way
to describe it is:

170
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:29,407
as the Hero.

171
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,779
milady's emotions
were completely suppressed

172
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:32,910
by her Blessing.

173
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:35,823
But Van seems very expressive.

174
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,706
And that worries me
for some reason, I guess.

175
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:40,118
Yeah?

176
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:42,000
[TISSE] I don't know
if handing over the airship

177
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,042
is such a good idea,
Yarandrala.

178
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:45,123
Hmm.

179
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:47,836
But, whatever the case,

180
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,968
I'll continue
to keep an eye on Van.

181
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:52,510
I want to see
what kind of person he is.

182
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,013
Be careful. Understood?

183
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:56,304
Yep.

184
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:58,637
But how are things going
with the storefront?

185
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:00,098
You're not having trouble

186
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,980
running the apothecary,
are you?

187
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,443
The shop's not my concern.

188
00:08:04,603 --> 00:08:05,604
[gasp]

189
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:08,276
[YARANDRALA]
Truthfully,

190
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:09,988
the plants have been
acting strange

191
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:11,990
ever since
Van the Hero arrived.

192
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:14,363
They are petrified, you see.

193
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:17,035
Sensing a disaster
that draws closer.

194
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:19,908
[TISSE] Are they sensing
the new Hero's arrival?

195
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:20,999
Doubtful.

196
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:23,872
Hmm.

197
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:27,506
[YARANDRALA] I fear a presence
far more nebulous

198
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,378
has entered Zoltan with him.

199
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,171
[trumpet playing]

200
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:33,802
[MALE TOWNSFOLK 1]
So that's Van the Hero.

201
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,134
[MALE TOWNSFOLK 2]
How nice of him

202
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,595
to come all the way out here!

203
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,388
[MALE TOWNSFOLK 3]
We're so lucky!

[indistinct chatter]

205
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,604
Crowds of humans
are everywhere we go.

206
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,777
They're absolute pests! Boo!

207
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,188
Enough, Lavender.

208
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,610
It's only natural

209
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,321
that they take
an interest in their Hero.

210
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,444
Oh! Nobody asked you!

211
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:56,446
So tell me something, Van.

212
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:58,287
-Are we just sightseeing?
-No.

213
00:08:58,368 --> 00:08:59,869
As a Hero, I have to act

214
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:02,372
according to
the Almighty Demis's wishes.

215
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,625
And what does
Lord Demis want, exactly?

216
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:08,258
An answer
that I search for myself.

217
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:09,839
[grunts]

Uh...

[TANTA]
I'm sorry!

221
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,639
Listen, you know
the Hero can't walk

222
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,391
when you cling
to his leg like that.

223
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:23,523
Van.

224
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:25,525
Leave him be.

Oh.
Thank you for understanding.

[MALE CHILD 1] So lucky!
[MALE CHILD 2] No fair!

Man. I wish I could
talk to the Hero, too!

Same for me!

230
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,368
[TANTA] These kids
are all living at the church.

231
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,831
At the church?

232
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:44,124
Yeah! That's where I help
take care of them, too.

233
00:09:44,495 --> 00:09:45,956
I know
it's forward of me to ask,

234
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,628
but I'm sure
they'd really like it

235
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,550
if you stayed around
for a bit to chat.

236
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:52,132
Time is of the essence for us--

237
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:53,424
What a grand idea.

238
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:55,136
What?

239
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:56,307
Are you sure, Van?

240
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,598
Quite.

241
00:09:57,718 --> 00:09:58,929
How long could it be?

Tanta explained

245
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:08,609
you offered your time
at the children's request.

246
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:11,863
Let me begin by giving you
our sincerest thanks.

247
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:14,906
[VAN] Is it true the children
reside in this church?

248
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:16,027
Yes.

249
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,029
Children separated
from their parents

250
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,330
for various reasons

251
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,783
have a new home
here within these walls.

With help from
our former mayor, Lady Mistrom,

253
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:26,498
I ensure the children
are in safe hands.

I bid you welcome, sir.

It's an honor.
I extend my deepest gratitude.

I too would like
to be of assistance.

Anything to lessen
their burden.

Would please show our guests
to the children's quarters?

is a sight I haven't seen
in quite a while.

Our Hero is an extremely kind
and noble young man.

If only he were
so kind all the time.

what happened, didn't you?

Well, yes.

Van is an innocent boy.

Innocence
that has unfortunately

281
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,599
made him disregard people.

Or that's what I believed.

with the children, yes?

what kind of places
you've been to?

Yes.

I have seen plenty,

00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,670
and have encountered many foes.

00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:50,463
Last of which was
an evil dragon that I fought.

But weren't you scared?

296
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:55,929
Heroes don't fear.

297
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,971
Not the strength of an enemy,

298
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,263
nor uncertain odds.

299
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:03,306
A Hero must conquer them,
for that is his role.

300
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:05,639
And then,
press onward valiantly.

Take me on adventures
with you, Sir Hero!

Until you truly know
your Blessing,

one cannot possibly determine
how to live their life.

But Tanta's knows
what he's gonna do!

Yup.

that makes work
a lot easier to manage!

Wishing won't matter
if Lord Demis decides it.

316
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,134
Has it ever crossed your mind

317
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:42,516
that you could be granted
the Blessing of a champion?

318
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,518
Don't know about that.

319

I mean, I guess I've never

320

thought of it that much,
you know?

Still, no matter what Blessing
I end up with.

I know for a fact
