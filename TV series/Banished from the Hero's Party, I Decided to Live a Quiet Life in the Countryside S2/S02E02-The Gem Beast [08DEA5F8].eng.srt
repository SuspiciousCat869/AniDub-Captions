That's why it can reflect
physical and magical attacks,

322
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,651
and support its massive weight.

323
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:07,983
In which case...

324
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,825
You don't mean...?

325
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,451
[roaring]

326
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:16,832
[explosion]

327
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,428
[RUTI] Go!
Sacred Shield!

328
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,054
[clattering]

329
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:41,898
Did ya get him?

330
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,813
-Nope.
-[RIT] What now, Red?

331
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,156
We cut down
its Blessing level.

332
00:17:49,406 --> 00:17:50,697
Do that, and we win.

333
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:52,369
Then we need...

334
00:17:52,449 --> 00:17:54,201
Medicine from the wild elves.

335
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:56,623
[RED] Yeah.
It's our only shot.

336
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:59,707
[RIT] The same tonic
we used on Ademi?

337
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,329
[RED] Right. But making
it drink this won't be as easy.

338
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:05,002
Leave that to me.

339
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,754
[RED] Good luck.
[YARANDRALA] Thanks.

340
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,222
[YARANDRALA] O origin of mana.
Ruler of all creation.

341
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,895
Great spirit
of the mighty tree!

342
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:35,413
[shattering]

343
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:42,461
[YARANDRALA] Gotcha!

344
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,716
[clinking]

345
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:50,008
[shattering]

346
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,639
[thudding, rumbling]

347
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:06,235
[RED] Without the use
of its Blessings,

348
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:08,107
this thing can't even stand?

349
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,242
[explosion]

350
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:35,595
Phew. Sure didn't expect
to mine this hefty beauty

351
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,387
inside the guts
of that gem beast.

352
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:38,808
Stroke of luck, right?

353
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:40,730
I'm glad you got
the earth crystal you came for.

354
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:43,814
Well, shucks!
Reckon my missus' childbirth

355
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:44,935
should go mighty smoothly

356
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,737
now that I've got
my mitts on this!

357
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,238
But on the other hand...

358
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:49,740
[sigh]

359
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:53,614
[RIT] Wow.
What a view!

360
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:54,695
[RED] Yeah.

361
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,868
[MOGRIM] Here I come, darling.
Daddy's home!

362
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:58,949
[Mogrim laughing]

363
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,451
[All chuckling]

364
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:04,375
About my offer.

365
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,797
Will nothing I say
convince you to leave?

366
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:08,259
Sorry.

367
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,511
But my home
is right here in Zoltan.

368
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:12,803
Where Rit and I can
settle down together.

369
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,596
[YARANDRALA] And you can
find that nowhere else?

370
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:20,932
For the first time in my life,
I'm living for myself.

371
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:23,775
That's wonderful.

372
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:27,318
Well, then! That's that,
so I might as well

373
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:28,570
get comfortable here.

374
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,111
Wait, you're staying?

375
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,364
My curiosity is piqued
by this place

376
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:33,485
that brings you joy.

377
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:36,578
That's great!
Welcome to Zoltan!

378
00:20:36,948 --> 00:20:38,910
So, Ruti?
Is that okay?

379
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:40,542
Of course.

380
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:42,374
[RIT] Time to get
everyone together,

381
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:43,835
and throw a welcome party!

382
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,457
[MOGRIM] Hey!

383
00:20:45,797 --> 00:20:47,629
I'm gettin' older by the day
down here!

384
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:50,632
[VAN] Ljubo.

385
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:53,255
I am strong enough
to combat the demonic army.

386
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:55,217
As this world's hero,

387
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:58,060
I must take my place
on the front lines now.

388
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:01,894
Dear boy,
you mustn't rush things.

389
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:05,438
We should plan everything out
and execute it flawlessly.

390
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,611
I've a new challenge prepared
for you that requires

391
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:09,692
your attention.

392
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:12,945
Head out with Esta and slay
the monster that awaits.

393
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:15,077
-Come in.
-[door opens]

394
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,871
-[LJUBO] Proceed.
-[UNDERLING 202A] Sire.

395
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:21,454
There have been reported
sightings of the former

396
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:22,745
demon lord's airship.

397
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:25,338
[VAN] And to where
does this vessel fly?

398
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:27,250
[UNDERLING 202A]
It was supposedly headed

399
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,752
for the remote town of Zoltan.

400
00:21:31,504 --> 00:21:32,676
Right here.

401
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:34,848
Kiggith should have returned

402
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,800
from his scouting assignment
by now.

403
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:39,853
Find him and have him head
to Zoltan at once.

404
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:41,975
-[UNDERLING 202A] Sire.
-[door opens]

405
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:43,687
Ljubo-!

406
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:45,559
Build your strength
and level up

407
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:46,770
your Blessing for now.

408
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,313
As hero, that is paramount
above all else.

409
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:50,564
[LJUBO]
Precisely.

410
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:52,526
Adhere to our plan, Van.

411
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:55,409
Cull a few beasts with Esta
and wait for your time.

412
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,702
I will make sure Zoltan
is thoroughly investigated.

413
00:21:58,993 --> 00:21:59,914
[Van pouts]

414
00:21:59,994 --> 00:22:01,956
[LJUBO] Now.
No need to pout.

415
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,128
I'll draft up
a brand-new strategy

416
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,499
for you while you wait.

417
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,171
Great!
