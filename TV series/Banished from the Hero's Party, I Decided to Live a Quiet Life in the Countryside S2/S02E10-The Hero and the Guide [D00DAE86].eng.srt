during our travels.

490
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:32,065
Not once could I get them
to see my point of view

491
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:33,567
and change their ways.

492
00:20:34,438 --> 00:20:36,400
But you two managed
to do just that

493
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,273
in such a short amount of time.

494
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:40,776
I tried my best, I suppose.

495
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,327
And I'm so glad you did!

496
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,659
None of this would
have happened

497
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:44,870
if it were not for you!

498
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,914
[ESTA]
Really?

499
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:49,125
Yes, of course!

500
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:50,998
Don't forget,
this whole saga began

501
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:52,459
because you sent me
to fetch Red!

502
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:54,291
And now here we stand today!

503
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:56,714
This is true.

504
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:59,758
You donned a mask
to conceal your identity!

505
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:01,890
But make no mistake,
my good friend.

506
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:03,552
I was in awe of your work!

507
00:21:04,353 --> 00:21:05,354
Albert.

508
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,978
I didn't know you felt
that way about me.

509
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:09,980
Do you mean it?

510
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:11,982
I do!

511
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,654
What a pair.

512
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:15,907
You're being ridiculous!

513
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:17,238
Who, me?

514
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:18,740
No, wait!

515
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,783
By ridiculous,
I didn't mean to imply

516
00:21:20,873 --> 00:21:22,575
that you're unfit
to be my partner!

517
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:25,748
I-It's just. I...

518
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:27,921
Say no more.

519
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:29,633
I still have a long way to go.

520
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:31,886
Don't worry! I can try harder!

521
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:33,177
No!

522
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:35,089
I mean, sure? Yes?

523
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:37,512
Help! Me!

524
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:40,596
[chuckles]
Reel in the sweetness, guys.

525
00:21:40,686 --> 00:21:41,687
Honestly.

526
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,349
That's rich, coming from you.

527
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:44,731
-What do you mean?
-What do you mean?

528
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:46,102
Gosh!

529
00:21:46,193 --> 00:21:48,485
-[laughing]
-Hm?

530
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:50,818
[YARANDRALA] You lovebirds
coo worse than they do!

531
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:52,450
-[RED] That's...
-[RIT] Not true.

532
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:04,254
Stay the path, Hero.

533
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,506
Never falter.
