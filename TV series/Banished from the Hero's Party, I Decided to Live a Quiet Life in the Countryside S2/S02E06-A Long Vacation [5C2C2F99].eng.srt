one more time.

3
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:06,708
[RED] Albert,

4
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:10,091
has the Church officially
recognized Van as the Hero?

5
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:13,175
[ALBERT] Yes. Van's Blessing
was appraised by the Church.

6
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:15,307
He's under
Cardinal Loo-bo's watch.

7
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:19,021
Therefore, he officially
operates as the Church's Hero.

8
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,353
It's hard to believe
there's another.

9
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,065
Well, Red?

10
00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:24,977
[RED] If the Church
appraised him,

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,979
there's no reason
to doubt their assessment.

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,611
[RED] What I don't understand

13
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:30,733
is why he hasn't
shown up until now.

14
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:32,114
I don't either.

15
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,786
You know,
speaking of the Church,

16
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:36,869
remember when we visited
the Great Last Wall Fortress?

17
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,412
That's where we met
Theodora, isn't it?

18
00:00:39,912 --> 00:00:41,084
Time flies.

19
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:43,666
If memory serves,
this was before my arrival.

20
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:44,998
[RIT] Which makes me wonder.

21
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:47,500
Do you think the Church
was aware of Van back then?

22
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,094
Two Heroes existing
at the same time is not normal.

23
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:53,717
If that were the case,
they would've acted.

24
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,390
But they did nothing at all.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,933
So it makes more sense
to assume they didn't know.

26
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:01,355
[RED] Hmm.
[RUTI] Hmm.

27
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:06,150
[DANAN] Well! No point in
thinking about all that, right?

28
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,403
Come on. Didn't you say
that Van kid's on his way

29
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:11,115

30
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:12,827

31
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:46,754
[YARANDRALA] Tell us,
what all does the Church

32
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,966
know about Ruti?

33
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,298
Nothing, as far as I've heard.

34
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:53,221
In regard to
the former Hero's campaign,

35
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:55,383
they were unaware of it
to begin with.

36
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:58,687
Yeah. Because we were
making sure of that.

37
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:01,520
But Ruti took out
two of the generals,

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,482
and Theodora defeated one more.

39
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,394
[RED] The war with
the demon lord's army

40
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:06,485
is at a stalemate.

41
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:09,488

is at peace again,

42

43
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,401
Honestly, Ruti's absence

44
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,073
shouldn't cause
too much of a problem.

45

But the appearance
of a new Hero

46
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:18,247
complicates things.

47
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:19,659
We're in a tight spot.

48
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,211

49
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,583

50

is to take the airship, yes?

In that case,

how about the three of you

some backtracking,

495
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:54,403
but there is an island
inhabited by a salt dragon.

496
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,405
Tomorrow,
we will exterminate it.

497
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:58,077
[VAN] What creature is this?

498
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:00,830
A dragon of stagnation
and destruction.

499
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,912
So a sworn enemy of the Hero?

500
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:05,084
A salt dragon
will not attack people

501
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:06,376
if they keep their distance.

502
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:09,008
Its presence
is largely innocuous.

503
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,591
Does it really need
to be exterminated?

504
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:13,884
I believe it
to be the perfect fodder

505
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,305
to strengthen Van's Blessing.

506
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:17,808
It's said the salt dragon
is in possession

507
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:19,770
of the Fairy King's
beloved treasure,

508
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,392
which it stole and hoards
for itself to this day.

509
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:24,605
Having it won't hurt us.

510
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:26,146
-Even so--
-Be at ease!

511
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:28,319
Killing monsters
and assuming the treasure

512
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:29,480
is morally correct.

513
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,113
The Church's scriptures
declare this to be true!

514
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:34,445
Do not make enemies
wherever you step.

515
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:36,447
You will come to regret it,
Van.

516
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,580
Eradicating agents of evil
is the Hero's duty.

517
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,913
So long as wicked
thrives in this world,

518
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:43,454
I will be its adversary.

519
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:48,209
Come. Join me inside
before the food gets cold.

520

pairs quite well
