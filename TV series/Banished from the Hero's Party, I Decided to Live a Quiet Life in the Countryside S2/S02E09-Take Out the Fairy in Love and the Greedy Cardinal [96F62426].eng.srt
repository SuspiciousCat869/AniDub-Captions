That writing
is Ancient Elven...

490
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:09,029
explain!

491
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,492
[RED] I hear this ogre king
was highly intelligent,

492
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:13,123
and even wielded a club.

493
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:16,287
It may have been
a biological weapon

494
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,329
created in ancient ruins.

495

[LJUBO]
What?

496
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,923
[RED] In the mountains
to the north of Zoltan,

497
00:22:22,003 --> 00:22:25,216
there lies an elven monument
nearly buried in the wood.

498
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:27,389
It is supposedly home
to similar creations

499
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:28,510
as the ogre,

500
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,143
some of which look
remarkably humanoid.

501
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:32,554
[LJUBO] Then the girl
who attacked Van

502
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,726
is an Ancient Elven relic?

503
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:38,350
Small wonder she displayed
such terrifying strength.

504
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,232
She took down Van, after all.

505
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,566
[RED] There's a report from
the Thieves' Guild of Zoltan.

506
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:45,067
It backs up this theory.

507
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,739
It all makes sense.

508
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:47,910
The girl's sole purpose

509
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,363
is to protect
the Ancient Elven ruins.

Should the Demon Lord's army

00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:56,620
ever reach Zoltan,

513
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,423
these weapons will crawl out
of the woodwork to fight them.

514
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:03,006
[LJUBO] So you want Van
to withdraw from this fight

515
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:05,179
for humanity's future, as well?

516
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,300
Yes.

517
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,382
Consider this,
if Sir Van or the girl

518
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:09,974
were to die in battle,

519
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:12,556
it will be a massive loss
for mankind.

520
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:14,018
Catastrophic.

521
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:16,140
In that case,
I'll strongly advise Van

522
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,022
to leave Zoltan right away.

Please do.

Make no mistake...
he might refuse.

525
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:25,700
Getting Van to obey has been
a rather vexing challenge

526
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:27,112
