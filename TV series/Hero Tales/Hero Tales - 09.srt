1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,250
- ( owl hooting )

2
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,333
- I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET.

3
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,041
- WE FINALLY REACH
THE CAPITAL TOMORROW, HUH?

4
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,375
RIGHT INTO THE LION'S DEN.

5
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,916
- INDEED, HENCE
TAITO'S NIGHTMARES.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,291
THE CLOSER WE GET, THE MORE
VIVIDLY HIS BODY RECALLS

7
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,291
HIS FIRST CLASH WITH KEIRO.

8
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,166
- SO IS THIS GUY REALLY AS TOUGH
AS YOU MAKE HIM OUT TO BE?

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,000
- ENOUGH SO TO CONSIGN
OUR DREAMER TO THE GRAVE.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,208
- REALLY?

11
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,791
- ( theme song playing )

12
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,833
- IT'S BREATHTAKING.

13
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,958
- THIS PLACE IS GIGANTIC.

14
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,666
AND FROM HERE IT'S LIKE WE'RE
STARING DOWN AT JEWELS IN

15
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,416
A RIVERBED OR SOMETHING.

16
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,500
HARD TO BELIEVE
WE'RE FINALLY HERE.

17
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,625
IT'S LIKE A DREAM.

18
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,250
- COME, I'LL SHOW YOU THE
HALLOWED WALLS THAT SHAPED ME.

19
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,541
TONG YO SHRINE.

20
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,916
WE CAN SLOUGH OFF THE DUST
OF OUR TRAVEL THERE.

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,458
I THINK WE'VE EARNED
OURSELVES A REST.

22
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,125
- SOUNDS GREAT. LET'S DO IT.

23
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,291
- ( chuckles )

24
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,166
WE GET TO MEET THE GIRL
RYUKO'S SWEET ON!

25
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,958
- GOOD. EVEN IF ENTHUSIASM
OUTSTRIPS SKILL, AT LEAST

26
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,250
THE BOY'S ARRIVED INTACT.

27
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,458
HOW SELDOM IT IS THAT TWO FIERCE
WARRIOR GODS DANCE.

28
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,500
UNLESS WE PREFER THEIR IMPENDING
MELEE TO RESEMBLE A DIRGE,

29
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,666
I'D BEST STEP UP MY EFFORTS TO
HELP THE NEOPHYTE FIND HIS FEET.

30
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,583
( smirks )

31
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,875
AND FOR THAT,
I'LL NEED THE RIGHT BATON.

32
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,500
- WHOA, WHAT IN THE HELL?

33
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,791
HOW CAN THERE BE SO
MANY PEOPLE IN ONE PLACE?

34
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,833
THIS IS A STREET?
OKAY, I'M CONFUSED.

35
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,250
HOW DO THE BUILDERS
GET IT SO WIDE?

36
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,708
DON'T THEY RUN OUT OF ROOM?

37
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,208
RIGHT? HOW!

38
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,083
- KINDLY LOWER YOUR VOICE.

39
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,500
- ( chattering )

40
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,791
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT.

41
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,500
THERE'S A BANQUET FIT FOR A GOD
WITHIN ARM'S REACH AND I DON'T

42
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,083
KNOW WHERE TO START.

43
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,000
I'VE DIED AND GONE TO PARADISE,
THAT'S ALL THIS PLACE CAN BE.

44
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,083
- TAITO! WILL YOU GET A GRIP.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING US.

45
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,791
- BUT IT'S SO...

46
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:26,833
- IT'S A BIG STREET, SURE.

47
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,750
BUT, IT'S FOR WALKING,
NOT BAWLING.

48
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT!

49
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,166
LET'S GO UP AND DOWN IT RIGHT
NOW AND BUY WHATEVER

50
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,375
WE CAN LAY OUR HANDS ON.

51
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,500
- WAIT, WE DON'T...

52
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,833
- OH! AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT,

53
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,333
WE GOTTA FIND SOME
SOUVENIRS FOR DAD AND GRANDPA.

54
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,791
- ALAS, THE CHANCES OF
HIS GOING HOME ARE SLIM.

55
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,416
- WELL, WE'RE HERE.
SO WHAT'S THE BIG PICTURE NOW?

56
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,833
- TO BE HONEST, I AM
NOT ENTIRELY CERTAIN.

57
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,416
- YEAH, WELL, I KNOW WHAT'S
NUMBER ONE ON MY AGENDA,

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,791
SHIMEI'S BOSS.

59
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,416
I HAVE A SCORE THAT
NEEDS TO BE SETTLED WITH HIM,

60
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,000
FOR MY MASTER.

61
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,291
- WELCOME TO THE TONG YO SHRINE.
MY NAME IS RYUSHO,

62
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,791
THE TEMPLE'S HEAD PRIEST.

63
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,000
BUT I'M SURE RYUKO'S
TOLD YOU THIS.

64
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,250
- IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET
YOU, MASTER RYUSHO.

65
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,666
- THANKS FOR PUTTING US UP.

66
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,541
- SERIOUSLY.

67
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,583
- ARCHER HOSEI, DIVINE WARRIOR
PHECDA'S EARTHLY FORM.

68
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,583
AND TAITO, WARRIOR GOD
ALKAID'S FURY INCARNATE.

69
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,958
- UH, THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL ME.

70
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,916
- YOUR AURA IS A PURE ONE.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,333
A CREDIT TO THE CARE MASTER
SONNEI AND SOEI TOOK

72
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,458
IN REARING YOU.

73
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,750
- UH?

74
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,083
- SIR, YOU KNOW MASTER
SONNEI AND OUR FATHER?

75
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,041
- OF COURSE HE DOES.
EXCEPTIONALLY WELL,

76
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,416
TRUTH BE TOLD.

77
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,583
- FATHER HERE WAS APPRENTICED
TO MASTER SONNEI IN

78
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,833
THE SAME SEASON AS SOEI.

79
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,458
- Taito: FATHER?
WAIT, ARE YOU TELLING US

80
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,125
THE HEAD PRIEST
IS YOUR OLD MAN?

81
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,791
- WELL, MY ADOPTIVE FATHER, YES.
I WAS A FOUNDLING, YOU SEE.

82
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,958
-WHOA! YOU SERIOUS?

83
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,958
- I'M SENSING A THEME HERE.

84
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,666
- YOU TOO, HUH?
NO WONDER WE GET ALONG SO WELL.

85
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,500
WE'RE BOTH ORPHANS,
WE GREW UP IN TEMPLES,

86
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,375
WE'RE TIED TO
THE FATE OF THE STARS.

87
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,791
IT'S LIKE YOU AND I ARE
PRACTICALLY BROTHERS

88
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,125
OR SOMETHING.

89
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,458
- WHAT AN INCREDIBLY
KIND THING TO SAY.

90
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,083
- BROTHERS, SURE. I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT "GETTING ALONG SO WELL"

91
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,708
AFTER SEEING YOU TWO BICKER.

92
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,708
- GEE. THANKS FOR
SPOILING THE MOOD.

93
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,541
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, THOUGH,
I GUESS YOU DO HAVE A POINT.

94
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,875
- SUCH FRIENDS ARE
A TREASURE, SON.

95
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:23,916
- YES.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,333
- CONSIDER THIS ROOM YOUR OWN.

97
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,625
- WOW! THANKS, I WILL!

98
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,333
- MY QUARTERS ARE
JUST ACROSS THE HALL.

99
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,333
WHO'S THERE?

100
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,791
- WELCOME BACK, RYUKO.
YOU LOOK WELL.

101
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,125
- THANK YOU, UH.

102
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,958
YOU'RE LOOKING
EXQUISITELY WELL YOURSELF.

103
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,000
- ( chuckles )
HERE WE GO.

104
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,250
- THE ONE IS REVEALED.

105
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,916
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
WHO'S SHE?

106
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,750
- MY NAME IS RINMEI.

107
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,833
I'M AN ATTENDANT
HERE AT TONG YO.

108
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,666
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

109
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,875
- LIKEWISE.
- LIKEWISE.

110
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,500
- SO WHERE'S THE KEEPSAKE
YOU PROMISED?

111
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:13,666
- OH, UH, I DIDN'T BRING ONE.
MY APOLOGIES.

112
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,583
- UGH, COULDN'T YOU HAVE SPUN
THAT INTO SOMETHING LIKE

113
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,875
"MY SAFE RETURN IS A KEEPSAKE?"

114
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,041
I SWEAR...

115
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,333
- THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A MOST REFINED WAY

116
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,625
OF FRAMING IT INDEED.

117
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,625
AS I'D EXPECT
COMING FROM YOU, OF COURSE.

118
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:27,375
WELL DONE.

119
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,875
- YOU'RE JUST AWFUL, RIGHT?

120
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,791
-YEP.
- NO DOUBT.

121
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,083
- UGH, ALRIGHT THAT DOES IT,
ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP.

122
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,583
OUT WITH IT.

123
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,791
WHAT ARE YOU ALL IN ON HERE
THAT I'M IN THE DARK ABOUT?

124
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,166
- HOW CLUELESS CAN YOU BE?

125
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,750
THIS IS THE GIRL THAT
RYUKO HAS FEELINGS FOR.

126
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,125
- WAIT, RYUKO'S
IN LOVE WITH HER?

127
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,416
- STOP! WHATEVER YOU'RE
THINKING, JUST DON'T.

128
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,041
I AM A MONK OF THIS TEMPLE.

129
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,708
MY TRAINING DOES NOT
INCLUDE TIME FOR GIRLS.

130
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,541
AND THAT IS THAT!

131
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,583
- I'M CONFUSED.
- OF COURSE.

132
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,458
- INTERESTING. SEEMS YOU'VE
FOUND QUITE THE KINDRED SPIRIT

133
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,500
IN EACH OTHER, HAVEN'T YOU?

134
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,375
- ( knife chopping )

135
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,750
- AH, THAT SCENT.

136
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,791
HOW MUCH I'VE MISSED
YOUR GIFTS AT THE HEARTH SIDE.

137
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,583
- IS THAT ALL YOU'VE MISSED?

138
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,916
- ( gasps )

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,250
- ( giggles )

140
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,541
UH!

141
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,208
- RINMEI, ARE YOU INJURED?
HAVE YOU...

142
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,291
- RINMEI?
- YES?

143
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,250
( heart beat )

144
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,750
YES, WHAT IS IT?

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,583
- THE POT'S BOILING OVER.

146
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,791
- ( cracking sound )

147
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,375
- I HAVE TO DRAW WATER.

148
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,291
- I'LL JUST WAIT HERE, THEN.

149
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,166
- HEH, HEH. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

150
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,791
MUSCLE MAKES A MAN, YOU KNOW.

151
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,916
- AH, GIMME A BREAK.
YOU WANNA SEE SOME STRENGTH.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,750
TAKE A LOOK AT MY SHOOTING ARM.

153
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,916
- ( both grunting )

154
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,708
- UH, YEAH.
WELL, CHECK THIS OUT.

155
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,166
- NICE TRY.

156
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,833
- ALL LAUNDERED AND READY TO GO.

157
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,291
( gasps )

158
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,583
- ( wind blows )

159
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,750
- ( Laila screaming )

160
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,166
UGH, THOSE ANIMALS!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

161
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,500
- PLEASE, HOW BIG OF
A PRUDE COULD HE BE?

162
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,500
- IMBECILES MEN ARE HOPELESS!
- IMBECILES MEN ARE HOPELESS!

163
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,833
- HEY, GREAT MINDS, YOU KNOW?

164
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,958
- YEAH, RIGHT ON THE SAME PAGE.

165
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,791
- KINDRED SPIRITS!
- KINDRED SPIRITS!

166
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,416
- ( Taito munching noisily )

167
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,000
- HOW DO YOU EVEN
HAVE ROOM LEFT?

168
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,416
YOU'RE GONNA EAT THESE POOR
PEOPLE OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME.

169
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,041
- SORRY. I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.
IT'S RINMEI'S COOKING.

170
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,375
THANK YOU!

171
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,375
( exhales )

172
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,166
WELL, GUESS I'LL BE OFF NOW.

173
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,458
- WAIT. OFF TO WHERE?

174
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,875
- WHERE DO YOU THINK, LAILA?

175
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,416
COME ON, DON'T START
PLAYING ALL INNOCENT ON ME.

176
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,541
I'M GONNA GO FIND MOUSTACHE
AND GIVE HIM HIS DUE.

177
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,833
JUST BECAUSE I'M COMFORTABLE AND
EATING GOOD FOOD DOESN'T MEAN

178
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,375
THAT I'M NOT STILL PISSED OFF

179
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,583
ABOUT WHAT HE DID
TO OUR VILLAGE.

180
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,500
- I ABSOLUTELY FORBID
YOU TO LEAVE!

181
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,875
- WHERE IS THIS COMING
FROM ALL OF A SUDDEN?

182
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,291
- YOU STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU CANNOT FIGHT HIM.

183
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,416
NOT AS YOU ARE NOW.

184
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,458
- LIKE HELL!

185
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,333
- HE WOULD CRUSH YOU
LIKE AN INSECT.

186
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,875
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN
KEIRO'S POWER

187
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,500
AND YOURS
IS NIGHT AND DAY.

188
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,000
- WHATEVER. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
SO SHUT UP!

189
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,875
- I DO KNOW, AND BELIEVE ME,
RIGHTEOUS IRE ONLY GOES SO FAR.

190
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,833
IN THIS CASE,
FAR ENOUGH TO KILL YOU.

191
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,000
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT
ME HERE IF YOU DIDN'T

192
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,166
WANT ME TO FIGHT HIM.

193
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,500
- IT'S TOO LATE!
- EITHER WAY, COUNT ME IN.

194
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,416
- Ryuko: HOSEI!

195
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,250
- I DON'T CARE WHAT
THE ODDS ARE.

196
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,583
I'M IN THIS THING TO
AVENGE MY MASTER.

197
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,000
WE ARE DIVINE WARRIORS,

198
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,416
FOLLOWING THE PATH
DECREED BY THE STARS.

199
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,916
IF THE STARS HAVEN'T BEEN
LEADING US TO TAKE THIS GUY OUT,

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,375
WHAT HAS ALL THIS BEEN FOR?

201
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,041
- WHAT THIS HAS "BEEN FOR" IS TO
KEEP HE AND KEIRO FROM WREAKING

202
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,833
UNTOLD HAVOC ON THE REST OF US!

203
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,625
THAT'S OUR PATH!

204
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,625
- NO, RYUKO. THAT'S YOUR PATH.

205
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,291
I'M HERE TO KICK
LORD KEIRO'S ASS.

206
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,083
AND YOU'VE GOT NO RIGHT
BOSSING ME AROUND.

207
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,500
- IF THIS IS AS FAR AS YOU WANNA
GO, THEN STAY OUT OF OUR WAY.

208
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,333
- YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.
PLEASE, I...

209
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:36,291
- HM, TALK DOES NOTHING TO DOUSE
A FOOL'S PASSION, RYUKO.

210
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,791
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

211
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,416
I THINK IT'S TIME WE LET OUR
BODIES DO THE ARGUING.

212
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,166
- UH, RINMEI?

213
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,333
- UM, AND BY BODIES, YOU MEAN?

214
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,500
- THAT ACTIONS SPEAK
LOUDER THAN WORDS.

215
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,875
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WHAT THE
HECK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE

216
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,583
GONNA PROVE TO ME OUT HERE?

217
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,000
- DON'T WORRY.

218
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,250
THE NIGHT AIR IS BAD FOR
MY COMPLEXION, SO I'LL BE BRIEF.

219
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,708
- 'KAY. FINE.

220
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,125
- BEHOLD THE LIN SHAN HUA.
IN BATTLE, WE BECOME ONE.

221
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,458
- WAIT, SHE'S GOT A STAR SIGIL?
WHAT THE...

222
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,583
- YES. RINMEI'S STAR
IS A BRILLIANT ONE.

223
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,708
DIVINE WARRIOR MERAK.

224
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,708
- BUT I'M ONLY A GIRL,
AFTER ALL. HAVE MERCY, ALKAID.

225
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,541
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH
I POSE A THREAT.

226
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,625
LET'S BEGIN!

227
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,083
- ( gasps )

228
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,625
- OH, MAN.

229
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,833
- HER STYLE IS MOST FORMIDABLE.
UNFAILING BALANCE

230
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,208
ITS CORNERSTONE.

231
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,916
- NO WAY I'M GONNA
LET A GIRL BEAT ME.

232
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,291
( grunts )

233
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,000
WHERE'D SHE GO?

234
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,791
- QUITE IMPRESSIVE.
YOU'D BE HELL IN A LONG FIGHT.

235
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,458
- ( grunting )

236
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,208
( screaming )

237
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,500
- ( gasping )

238
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,333
- YOU'RE A HANDFUL,
I'LL GIVE YA THAT.

239
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,291
BUT STILL, ONLY A CHILD.

240
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,750
YOU SLUMP AT MY FEET,

241
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,333
AND YET WHAT I'VE
DEMONSTRATED

242
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,250
PALES IN COMPARISON
TO KEIRO'S MIGHT.

243
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,708
DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW?

244
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,500
- TAITO, YOU HAVE TIME.
THE MOUNTAIN WILL WAIT

245
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,791
TO BE CONQUERED.

246
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,541
AND THERE ARE MANY WAYS
TO REACH THE SUMMIT.

247
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,250
IF THE HEAVENS DEEM YOUR CAUSE
WORTHY, A PATH WILL UNFURL

248
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,291
BEFORE YOU OF ITS OWN ACCORD.

249
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,791
LET US HOLD A VIGIL FOR ONE.

250
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,416
- LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ERRING ON
THE SIDE OF PATIENCE, HUH?

251
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,833
- LOOKS LIKE IT.

252
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,750
TA-DA! IT'S OFFICIAL NOW.
WE'RE IN BUSINESS.

253
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,583
THE MEN ARE HOPELESS LEAGUE
HAS A FLAG!

254
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,500
- OH, LAILA, YOU'RE AN ARTIST.

255
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,291
IT SIMPLY EXUDES
"WHAT WOULD THEY DO WITHOUT US?"

256
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,416
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

257
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,333
- KINDRED SPIRITS!
- KINDRED SPIRITS!

258
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,750
- HEY LAILA, DO YOU KNOW...

259
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,416
( gasps )

260
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,041
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

261
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,500
WHAT EXACTLY IS MY
UNDYING DEVOTION TO YOU

262
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,250
COMPETING WITH HERE?

263
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,375
- NO, NO. IT'S NOTHING. WE...

264
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,958
SO, YOU, UH...

265
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,375
- OH YEAH. I CAN'T FIND
PRETTY BOY OR TAITO.

266
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,583
I'VE LOOKED.

267
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,583
- THEY WENT OFF TOGETHER
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

268
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:10,708
- REALLY? THEY'RE CHUMMY?
WHAT'S ALL THAT ABOUT?

269
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,250
HOLD ON!

270
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,833
YOU DON'T THINK THOSE TWO
ARE MORE THAN FRIENDS, DO YOU?

271
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,583
- NO! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- NO! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

272
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,791
- WOW. THIS PLACE IS
REALLY SOMETHING ELSE.

273
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,208
MAKES ALL THE OTHER TOWNS
WE'VE SEEN LOOK KINDA CRAPPY.

274
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,666
- IT SHARES MORE IN COMMON
WITH THEM THAN YOU THINK.

275
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN? LIKE HOW?

276
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,958
- ( people chattering )

277
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,416
- SO, RYUKO,

278
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,250
YOU'RE TAKING ME TO SOME
KIND OF COURTYARD?

279
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,333
- SHUNYI SQUARE.

280
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,666
KNOWN COMMONLY AS
KEIRO'S TRIUMPH.

281
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,125
- HIS TRIUMPH?

282
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,583
HOW THE HELL DID HE MAKE
A PIT LIKE THIS BY HIMSELF?

283
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,833
- YES, WELL, FOUR YEARS AGO
A MARTIAL ARTS TOURNAMENT

284
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,916
WAS HELD HERE FOR THE EMPEROR.

285
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,333
KEIRO WON
BY MAKING THIS CRATER.

286
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,166
BARE FISTED, WITH HIS LEFT HAND.

287
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,625
- BARE FISTED?

288
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,791
YOU THINKING WHAT I AM?

289
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,125
- HE'S MASTERED WHAT WE'VE ONLY
BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND,

290
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,625
THE INNER RESERVOIR.

291
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,875
- SO THAT'S HIS SECRET.

292
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,208
- TAITO, YOU HAVE ONLY TO
MASTER YOURSELF, YES?

293
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,500
ONE DAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
CARVE OUT A HOLE JUST AS BIG.

294
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,583
LET ME HELP YOU TRAIN,

295
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,375
SO WE CAN BRING THAT DAY
A BIT CLOSER.

296
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,875
I'D RATHER NOT SEE
ANOTHER FRIEND LOST.

297
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,416
- IT'S A DEAL.

298
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,833
- COME ALONG. THERE'S MORE.

299
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,000
- RYUKO, SERIOUSLY.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

300
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,208
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA IGNORE ME?

301
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,333
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU DRAGGED US?

302
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,041
AM I SEEING THIS?

303
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,458
THE THOROUGHFARE'S
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

304
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,250
I MEAN, THEY'RE SO CLOSE
TO ALL THAT WEALTH.

305
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:06,125
- RICH THOUGH THE CITY MAY SEEM,
IT DOES HAVE A SHADOW.

306
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,375
AND IN THAT PALL
ITS TRUE FACE.

307
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,125
- TRUE FACE?

308
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,666
- THE EMPIRE HAS CRUMBLED
TO BUT A HUSK OF

309
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,250
ITS FORMER GRANDEUR.

310
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,125
THOSE JEWELS IN THE RIVERBED
WERE NOTHING BUT REFUSE.

311
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,333
- BUT, THIS IS THE CAPITAL.

312
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,500
THE EMPEROR'S JUST
A STONE'S THROW AWAY.

313
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,250
THESE PEOPLE ARE PRACTICALLY
SUFFERING ON HIS DOORSTEP.

314
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,000
- EXACTLY.

315
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,833
- THEN THEY OUGHTA
STORM THE PALACE,

316
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,041
PEEL HIS MAJESTY OFF THE THRONE,

317
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,916
AND GIVE SOMEONE ELSE
A CHANCE TO RULE.

318
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,958
- IN THAT SENTIMENT,
YOU AND KEIRO ARE ONE.

319
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,875
- LIKE HE GIVES A DAMN
ABOUT THE PEOPLE.

320
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,833
I'D BE A BETTER CHOICE
THAN HIM, ANY DAY.

321
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,916
HOLD ON.

322
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,041
WHERE ARE WE NOW?

323
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,250
- THE KILLING GROUNDS.

324
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:50,083
I HOPE TO CAUSE LESS
COLLATERAL DAMAGE HERE.

325
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,583
SHOW YOURSELF, COWARD!

326
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,166
- BRAVO, MIZAR!

327
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,125
HOW THRILLING TO BE LURED
WHEN ONE THOUGHT

328
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,416
HIMSELF LURKING!

329
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,708
- BASTARD!

330
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,458
- SO IT WAS YOU.
I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED THIS.

331
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,833
- THAT'S IT.

332
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,291
YOU'VE SHOWN THAT UGLY FACE
TO ME FOR THE LAST TIME.

333
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,875
THIS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE
CHEAP TRICKS YOU LIKE TO

334
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,541
PULL OUT OF YOUR ASS?

335
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,791
- MY, MY. HOW THAT FOUL
MOUTH BETRAYS YOU FOR

336
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,250
A FEARSOME BEAST.

337
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,916
I'D BETTER MIND MY STEP
WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT,

338
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,333
BUT RATHER THAN TUSSLE,

339
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,458
I'D PREFER WE AVAIL OURSELVES
OF CIVILIZED DISCOURSE.

340
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,666
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS LITTLE TOY?

341
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,500
- THAT'S THE SWORD YOUR
BUTCHER OF A MASTER BURNED

342
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,833
HALF MY VILLAGE DOWN TO STEAL.

343
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,416
- XIAN JIA LAN WU, ALPHA AND
OMEGA OF MANY A DYNASTY.

344
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,458
KNOWN MORE COMMONLY
AS THE SWORD OF RULE,

345
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,208
FOR ONLY AN EMPEROR'S
HAND MAY DRAW IT

346
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,208
LORD KEIRO WRENCHED
IT FROM OBSCURITY

347
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,291
MUCH AS HE HOPED TO WRENCH THE
VERY BLADE FROM ITS SCABBARD.

348
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,666
OH, HOW THE PEOPLE OF THIS
LAND WOULD HAVE TREMBLED.

349
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,583
ALAS, HE COULDN'T SO MUCH
AS MAKE THE BLADE TREMBLE.

350
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,583
- SO WHAT?

351
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,041
- COME, DON'T BE DENSE.

352
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,041
HEH, NOT EVEN THE CURRENT
EMPEROR IS FAVORED BY FATE.

353
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,333
BUT SOMEONE IS.

354
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:09,833
HE WHOM THE SWORD
WOULD SEE RULE IS ALKAID.

355
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,000
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS.

356
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,625
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU'RE
THE KIND OF BLEEDING HEART

357
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,041
WHO'D SET THE WORLD TO RIGHTS
GIVEN HALF A CHANCE.

358
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,708
DO I ASSUME CORRECTLY?

359
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,375
IF SO, THEN WHAT BETTER MEANS
TO ACCOMPLISH IT THAN A THRONE?

360
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,250
- WHAT?

361
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,000
- YOU AND YOU ALONE DREW
THE SWORD OF RULE.

362
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,333
FATE HAS MADE ITS CHOICE.

363
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,875
THE HELM OF THIS
BROKEN LAND IS YOURS.

364
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,166
RISE TO THE OCCASION, BOY.
TAKE THE SWORD.

365
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,875
- SHUT UP!

366
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,333
I'M MY OWN MASTER,
NOT SOME OLD RELIC.

367
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,750
AND NOT SOME CREEP LIKE YOU!

368
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,458
- ( explosion )

369
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,875
- YOU DISAPPOINT ME.

370
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,958
OH, WELL!

371
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,000
I'VE NO USE FOR
A PETULANT CHILD.

372
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,708
- ( gasping )

373
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,875
- THIS MAY SEEM A BIT COLD,

374
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,833
BUT IF YOU CAN'T
KEEP ME ENTERTAINED,

375
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,916
WHAT REASON HAVE
I TO LET YOU LIVE?

376
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,416
( laughing )

377
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,791
( groaning )

378
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,916
- USE YOUR INNER RESERVOIR,

379
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,208
JUST AS LADY KOEI
SHOWED YOU. QUICKLY!

380
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,125
- ( yelling )

381
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,333
- TAITO!

382
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,666
- WELL IT WOULD SEEM THAT
THE BOY HAS FORCED ME

383
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,708
TO EAT MY OWN WORDS.

384
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,458
QUITE THE LARK.
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN, ALKAID.

385
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,541
- WHO WOULD HAVE DARED TO
STEAL THE SWORD OF RULE?

386
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,500
- WHAT COULD SUCH BOLDNESS
IN ITS THIEF PORTEND?

387
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,750
- IT IS MEANINGLESS.
THIS IS LIKELY SHIMEI'S DOING.

388
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,041
- SHIMEI?

389
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:09,916
- FORGIVE MY IMPUDENCE,

390
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,333
BUT I MUST QUESTION THE WISDOM

391
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,166
OF ALLOWING SUCH A CURIOUS
BEING TO DO AS HE PLEASES.

392
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,416
- NO MATTER.

393
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,541
FOR THE MOMENT, AT LEAST.

394
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,916
- THAT HE COULD INVOKE
SUCH A PLACE FROM SKY

395
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,375
AND THOUGHT ALONE.

396
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,458
THE ENEMY IS KEEN
TO OUR PURPOSES NOW.

397
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,500
THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.

398
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,125
( sighs ) WELL, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT AT LEAST, TAITO?

399
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,208
TAITO?

400
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,250
- ME, AN EMPEROR.

401
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,208
- SO SIX OF THE SEVEN
ARE GATHERED TOGETHER.

402
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,583
WELL, CAPTAIN,
THE CAPITAL WAITS FOR YOU.

403
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,833
- ( theme song playing )

404
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

405
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,166
- Ryuko: WHETHER IMPRUDENCE OR
DESTINY BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER,

406
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,458
NONE CAN SAY.

407
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,416
- Taito: WE CAN'T LET THAT
MONSTER BREAK FREE!

408
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,833
- Ryuko: CALM YOURSELF, TAITO.

409
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,750
- Hosei: THE IDIOT'S
ACTUALLY GONNA DO IT.

410
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:46,916
- Taito: SO WHAT'S ALL
THIS FOR THEN?

411
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,583
WHAT'S THE EMPEROR ACTUALLY DO?

412
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,625
- Taiga: HE PRAYS FOR
CONTINUED PEACE AND

413
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,375
THE PROSPERITY OF HIS SUBJECTS.

414
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,375
- Taito: THE WAY I SEE IT,

415
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,916
UNLESS THE POOREST
PERSON CAN SMILE

416
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,708
JUST AS OFTEN AS THE RICHEST,
THE COUNTRY'S JUST NO GOOD.

417
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,666
- Ryuko: NEXT, ON HERO TALES,

418
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,375
TAITO'S RIGHTEOUS FIRE
THAWS AN ICY HEART

419
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:05,000
IN CHAPTER TEN,
"THE LONELY EMPEROR."

420
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,291
- Taito: IF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
GAVE A DAMN, THINGS WOULD

421
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,916
HAVE NEVER GOTTEN THIS BAD.
