1
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,791
ALL FOUR OF US? YOU'RE RIGHT.

2
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,291
WE FIGHT TOGETHER, WE CAN
TOTALLY TAKE THAT BASTARD DOWN.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,125
- MUST WE FIGHT TO TRIUMPH?

4
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,333
- ( theme song playing )

5
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,958
- ( Man grunting with effort )

6
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,333
- WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

7
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,375
- HEY, THERE. UP WITH THE DAWN?

8
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,916
- AS USUAL. APPARENTLY,
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.

9
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,333
YOU CATCH ME OFF GUARD.

10
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,041
- YEAH, WELL, I WOKE UP EARLY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

11
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,500
- AH, RYUKO.
A VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

12
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,416
- WELL, WELL,
DISCIPLINE IS CATCHING.

13
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,458
- SO IS NOT BEING ABLE TO
GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

14
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,458
- HEY! ENOUGH WITH THAT!
I SAID I WAS SORRY!

15
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,208
- DON'T STAND THERE AND ACT LIKE
YOU DIDN'T INTEND TO WAKE US UP.

16
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,000
YOU PRACTICALLY APOLOGIZED
AND CALLED US LAZY

17
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,333
IN THE SAME BREATH.

18
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,583
- YEAH, BUT WE'RE FORGETTING
HE'S AN IDIOT.

19
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,375
HE PROBABLY MEANT
THE OPPOSITE OF SORRY.

20
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,791
- STOP CALLING ME AN IDIOT!

21
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,458
BESIDES, TALK ABOUT NOT GETTING
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP,

22
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,375
IT WAS YOUR SNORING
THAT WOKE ME UP.

23
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,125
- JERK-WAD! WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU TO SIT IN JUDGMENT

24
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,625
ON ANOTHER
MAN'S SINUSES?

25
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,583
MY SNORING
IS NOT THAT DAMN LOUD.

26
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,000
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE POOR LAILA ALL
NERVOUS ABOUT OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

27
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:16,958
- ARE YOU STILL ASLEEP?

28
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,041
'CAUSE YOU MUST BE DREAMING

29
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,750
IF YOU THINK I'D
EVER LET HER MARRY YOU!

30
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,750
- AND YOU'RE DREAMING
IF YOU THINK I CARE!

31
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,875
SINCE WHEN IS MY BROTHER
THE ONE MARRYING ME OFF?

32
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,916
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,375
- I BELIEVE THE LADY HAS SPOKEN.

34
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,125
AND IF WE WANT TO CONSECRATE
OUR UNION ONE DAY

35
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,333
BY MAKING LOTS OF BABIES,

36
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,583
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

37
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,583
- THERE IS NO "WE"
IN THAT PICTURE, HOSEI.

38
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,250
STOP BEING GROSS!

39
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,125
- WHERE'S HE GOING?

40
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,125
- AH, RYUKO, I THOUGHT
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

41
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,291
- YES, FATHER?

42
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,541
- ARE YOU TROUBLED?

43
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,750
- TROUBLED?

44
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,333
- I ASK BECAUSE SUCH
IS GENERALLY THE CASE

45
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,750
WHEN YOU SULK ABOUT
NURSING THAT DAGGER.

46
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,666
SUCH ARE THE TIMES
IN WHICH WE LIVE.

47
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,625
DUBHE AND ALKAID NEVER APPEAR
TOGETHER UPON THE WORLD STAGE.

48
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,750
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

49
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,291
- BECAUSE, AS GREAT WARRIOR GODS
OF OLD,

50
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,500
A HATEFUL BATTLE ENSCONCED
SAFELY WITHIN THE TILT

51
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,541
OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE STARS

52
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,791
WOULD PROVE ABSOLUTELY
DEVASTATING IF BROUGHT DOWN

53
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,708
TO THE EARTHLY SPHERE.

54
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,875
- AND YET, COME DOWN IT HAS.

55
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,625
THEY WILL LOCK HORNS,
IT'S ALMOST A CERTAINTY.

56
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,666
AND WHEN THEY DO,
IT WILL BE DEVASTATING INDEED.

57
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,000
YOU ARE ONE OF FIVE DIVINE
WARRIORS, A VITAL PART OF THIS.

58
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,166
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

59
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,333
- WHAT WILL I DO?

60
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,166
I'LL PREVENT THEIR COLLISION.

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,416
BY ANY AND ALL MEANS.
THAT IS MY DUTY.

62
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,041
KEIRO MUST BE SUBDUED.

63
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,250
- SO YOU SAY, AND YET,
WHY KEIRO?

64
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,875
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.

65
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,666
- THE ALKAID MAY BE SUBDUED
TO MUCH THE SAME EFFECT.

66
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,875
- ( gasps )

67
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,416
SO, YOU WISH FOR ME
TO STRIKE DOWN A FRIEND?

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,750
- WELL, OF COURSE
I DON'T WISH FOR IT.

69
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,041
BUT FATE CAN BE CRUEL,

70
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,166
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND
THAT BY NOW.

71
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,625
I SIMPLY WANT YOU TO BE
PREPARED FOR CHOICES

72
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,500
YOU MAY BE FORCED TO MAKE.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,250
I'M SORRY.

74
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,583
IT WASN'T MY INTENTION
TO HEAP FURTHER WOE ON YOU

75
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,083
BY BRINGING THIS UP.

76
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,416
- TAITO. COULD I DO IT?

77
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,333
- ( thump )

78
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,291
- ( staff flying
through the air )

79
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,666
- THAT NEVER HAPPENS.
YOU FEELING CRUDDY OR SOMETHING?

80
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,166
- I'M FINE. YOU'VE IMPROVED
A GREAT DEAL IS ALL.

81
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,083
- UH, IT'S NICE TO HEAR YOU SAY
THAT, BUT IT'S ALSO KINDA WEIRD.

82
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,541
IF I'M IMPROVING THAT MUCH,

83
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,291
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE I CAN BRING MOUSTACHE

84
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,750
DOWN TO HIS KNEES!

85
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,625
CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT DAY
TO COME, LET ME TELL YA!

86
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,375
I'M JUST KIDDING,
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING

87
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,916
THE OLD TAITO
WOULD HAVE SAID.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,041
I'M NOT THE HOTHEAD
I USED TO BE.

89
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,208
I GET IT NOW.

90
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,958
I'VE STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO.

91
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,958
KEIRO'S A HELL OF A LOT STRONGER
THAN ME.

92
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,041
IT'D BE POINTLESS
NOT TO ACCEPT THAT FACT.

93
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,291
- TAITO.

94
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,333
- AT FIRST ALL I WANTED
WAS REVENGE.

95
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,625
BUT THEN LOSING TO RINMEI
TAUGHT ME A VALUABLE LESSON

96
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,125
IN KNOWING MY LIMITS.

97
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,541
SHE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
THAT MADE ME FACE REALITY.

98
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,625
I HAD HELP ALL ALONG.

99
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:16,375
ACTUALLY, THE PERSON
WHO'S HELPED ME THE MOST IS YOU.

100
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,583
- MY FRIEND, YOU'VE GROWN
CONSIDERABLY STRONGER AND WISER,

101
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,416
IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO BEHOLD.

102
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,166
- AW, COME ON. STOP THAT!
HEH, I MEAN THE PRAISE IS COOL.

103
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,833
I'M JUST NEVER GONNA
GET USED TO IT.

104
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,875
- YOUR GROWTH IS
A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

105
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,083
ONE THAT MAY CUT DEEPLY.

106
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,041
- ( birds chirping )

107
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,250
- WHERE THE HELL IS THAT BOY?

108
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,875
THERE'S NO TRACE OF ANY OF THEM.

109
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,666
IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY'VE
COMPLETELY VANISHED

110
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,208
FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

111
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:03,250
BUT BY WHAT MEANS?
SOME ARCHAIC CHARM, NO DOUBT.

112
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,666
- Choka: WHEREFORE DO YOU
SLITHER, SHIMEI?

113
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,333
- AH, WELL, NO REST
FOR THE WICKED, YOU KNOW.

114
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,666
- NOR FOR PILFERERS OF IMPERIAL
RELICS, SO IT WOULD SEEM.

115
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,583
- WHY, MADAM,
WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

116
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,041
- WHY DID YOU TAKE THE SWORD?

117
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,416
THINK CAREFULLY
BEFORE YOU ANSWER.

118
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,208
- NOW, NOW! TRUTH CAN BE
PURCHASED WITHOUT BLOOD.

119
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,750
I'M AN UNFURLED SCROLL.

120
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,000
SUCH IMPLEMENTS ARE BEST
LEFT TUCKED AWAY IN THE FOLDS

121
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,375
OF YOUR EXQUISITE ROBES.

122
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,208
- TAKE HEED.
KEIRO WILL NOT BE MADE A FOOL.

123
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,750
YOU AMUSE HIM, BUT THAT IS
THE EXTENT OF YOUR APPEAL.

124
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,583
DON'T THINK TO OVERREACH.

125
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,583
AND, SHIMEI? RIFLE THROUGH
HIS PERSONAL EFFECTS AGAIN

126
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,083
AND YOU'LL ANSWER TO ME.

127
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,416
- OF COURSE.
I'D EXPECT NOTHING LESS.

128
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,583
- GOOD.

129
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,375
- SUCH VITRIOL, POOR THING.

130
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,541
WHEN HER MAN'S GONE AWAY,

131
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,250
SHE DOES TEND TO GET
A BIT OVERSENSITIVE.

132
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,541
- ( birds chirping )

133
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,791
- HEY. LAILA, DID I TELL YOU
THE MOON MARKET IS TODAY?

134
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,583
- WHAT'S THE MOON MARKET?

135
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,291
- YOU GUYS SAW THE RIVER
THAT FLANKS THE CITY'S

136
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,875
EASTERN QUARTER, RIGHT?

137
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,166
WELL, ONCE EVERY MONTH,

138
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,083
THIS FLEET OF CARGO SHIPS
COMES TO PORT THERE.

139
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,583
IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

140
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,458
TRUST ME, THE MARKETPLACE
THEY SET UP IS ONE OF A KIND.

141
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,708
- REALLY?

142
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,791
- YES. "EXOTIC" DOESN'T
EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE

143
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,666
WHAT A SHREWD
BUYER CAN FIND THERE.

144
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,000
- OH, WOW!

145
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,916
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
SHALL WE GO AND HAVE A PEEK?

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,375
- LET'S DO IT!

147
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,583
- HEY, IF THE LOVE OF MY LIFE
IS GOING, COUNT ME IN!

148
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,875
- SURE, WHATEVER.
TAI, DO YOU WANNA COME, TOO?

149
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,458
- UM, NOT REALLY MY THING.
YOU GUYS GO WITHOUT ME.

150
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,041
I'LL STAY HERE
AND KEEP TRAINING.

151
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,041
- OH, DID I NOT MENTION
THE GREAT FOOD?

152
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,041
THEY'VE GOT PRODUCE
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

153
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,541
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR,
HOSEI? GET OFF YOUR RUMP!

154
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,250
WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY!

155
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,666
- SO NOW YOU'RE COMING?

156
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,500
I SWEAR YOU'RE JUST LIKE A GIRL.
WAY TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.

157
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,458
- I ASSUME
YOU'LL BE JOINING US, RYUKO?

158
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,750
RYUKO? HELLO, RYUKO.

159
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,125
OF COURSE.
YOU WEREN'T LISTENING, HUH?

160
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,875
- NO. SORRY.

161
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,458
- WE'RE ALL GOING
TO THE MOON MARKET.

162
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,250
DO YOU WANNA COME
ALONG WITH US OR NOT?

163
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,291
- COME ON. YOU NEED A BREATHER
JUST AS MUCH AS THE REST OF US.

164
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,833
- THANK YOU, BUT IF YOU
DON'T MIND, I BELIEVE I'LL PASS.

165
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:17,666
- OKAY. WELL, THEN, I GUESS IT'S
JUST GONNA BE THE FOUR OF US.

166
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,833
- SEEMS LIKE IT.

167
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,583
- NOW, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME...

168
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,875
- IS IT JUST ME,

169
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,541
OR DOES THAT GUY NOT SEEM
MUCH LIKE HIMSELF LATELY?

170
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,666
- RYUKO, ARE YOU GOING OUT?

171
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,333
- I AM. I SHOULD BE BACK
AFTER NIGHTFALL.

172
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,666
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE ACTING RATHER STRANGELY.

173
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,125
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT,
I'M ALL EARS.

174
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,666
- I'M SORRY.

175
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,875
- WHY DO YOU
KEEP APOLOGIZING? IDIOT.

176
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,041
- PLEASE FORGIVE
THE SPARSE ACCOMMODATIONS.

177
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,583
I RARELY ENTERTAIN.

178
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,541
- NO, NO. IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

179
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,250
I REALLY OUGHT NOT TO
HAVE BARGED IN ON YOU

180
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,875
UNANNOUNCED LIKE THIS.

181
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,833
- I HAD A FEELING YOU'D PAY ME
A VISIT BEFORE TOO LONG.

182
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,125
YOU'RE CARRYING SOMETHING
A BIT DANGEROUS, AREN'T YOU?

183
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,041
- SORRY TO BRING
SUCH A THING HERE.

184
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,166
I DON'T USUALLY CARRY IT
ON MY PERSON.

185
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,708
- HMM.

186
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,666
A RATHER SPLENDID
PIECE, ACTUALLY.

187
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,375
- FATHER WAS A WANDERER.
IN HIS YOUTH HE TRAVERSED

188
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,125
MANY FAR AWAY LANDS.

189
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,333
YOU SEE, THAT'S HOW... WELL,
THAT'S HOW HE FOUND ME.

190
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,500
FROM WHAT I'VE GATHERED,
THIS DAGGER WAS ALL THAT I HAD.

191
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,041
WHERE IT COMES FROM
OR WHY I POSSESS IT,

192
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,166
ARE A MYSTERY.

193
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,208
- SO IT WOULD SEEM.

194
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,291
NOW THEN, WHAT DID YOU WISH
TO DISCUSS, RYUKO?

195
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,916
- THIS MAY SOUND STRANGE
COMING FROM ME,

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,083
BUT DO YOU BELIEVE IN FATE?

197
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,583
- IN FATE?

198
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,166
- IF WE'RE GIVEN ROLES TO PLAY,
IF THE STARS TRULY DECREE

199
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,000
HOW WE ARE TO CONDUCT OURSELVES.

200
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,791
IF IT'S REALLY
SO STRAIGHTFORWARD,

201
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,583
WOULDN'T OUR PATHS
BE SELF-EVIDENT?

202
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,041
- INDEED THEY ARE, IF WE HAD
THE WHEREWITHAL TO SEE IT.

203
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,291
UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF US
WOULD DENY FATE, TRAGICALLY.

204
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,625
IF, FOR EXAMPLE,

205
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,333
OUR PATH DECREES WE ARE
TO TAKE A FRIEND'S LIFE...

206
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,333
- THEN WHAT? WE COMMIT MURDER?

207
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,375
ARE YOU SUGGESTING SUCH AN ACT
WOULD BE JUSTIFIED?

208
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,041
- IT WAS ONLY AN EXAMPLE.

209
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,041
I UNDERSTAND. IT'S A FAIRLY EASY
THING TO PUZZLE OUT

210
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,500
WHAT'S BEEN TROUBLING YOU.

211
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,375
DUTY AND SENTIMENT
APPEAR TO BE AT ODDS.

212
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,541
- WHAT?

213
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,166
- YOU WOULD SALVAGE THE EMPIRE

214
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,458
BUT THE SACRIFICE
IT MAY WELL REQUIRE YOU TO MAKE

215
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,666
IS NOT ONE YOU'RE PREPARED
TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR.

216
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,541
- BUT YOU...
HOW COULD YOU KNOW?

217
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,250
- I KNOW YOU. YOU CHERISH
THIS LAND PROFOUNDLY.

218
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,875
YOU'VE SAID AS MUCH.

219
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,916
- THERE'S NO DENYING IT.

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,708
AND MY JOURNEY THESE PAST FEW
MONTHS HAS ONLY STRENGTHENED

221
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,833
MY RESOLVE TO CHANGE THINGS.

222
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,750
BUT ALSO, THE BONDS I FORGED
ALONG THE WAY ARE STRONG.

223
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,375
AND NOW IT SEEMS THE VERY PATH
THAT LED ME TO FORGE THOSE BONDS

224
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:50,625
DEMANDS I BREAK THEM, VIOLENTLY.

225
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,375
- THE XIAN EMPIRE AFFECTS THE
OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF HEALTH,

226
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,625
BUT ONLY BY WAY OF A VEIL
THAT HIDES THE MALADY

227
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,583
ROTTING AWAY ITS CORE.

228
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:01,500
THE PROGNOSIS FROM ANY PHYSICIAN
WORTH HIS SALT WOULD BE DEATH.

229
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,875
- THE LAND WILL DIE?

230
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,875
- I CAN SAVE A LIFE,
INDEED HAVE DONE.

231
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,750
IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH WHEN
ONE HAS THE PROPER MEANS.

232
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,583
HOWEVER, SAVING AN EMPIRE IS A
WHOLE OTHER ORDER OF MAGNITUDE.

233
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,166
ONLY SOMEONE CHOSEN BY THE STARS

234
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,083
CAN RISE TO MEET
A CHALLENGE LIKE THAT.

235
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:23,333
- SO, THEN, MY FATE...

236
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,666
- SPEAKING AS A DOCTOR,

237
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,833
I WOULD TRUST THE EMPIRE'S
HEALTH TO NO ONE ELSE.

238
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,000
PRECISELY BECAUSE THE PATH
BEFORE THEM IS FRAUGHT

239
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,833
WITH SUCH DIFFICULTIES.

240
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,208
- AH, WHAT LUCK!
I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

241
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,833
THE BROODING MIZAR
RIGHT AT MY FINGERTIPS.

242
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,125
- THE HEALTH OF THE EMPIRE.

243
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,250
- OH, MY, THINGS ARE GOING
TO GET INTERESTING NOW,

244
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,250
AREN'T THEY?

245
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,541
( chuckles )

246
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,375
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IS IT ME?

247
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,583
- OH, YEAH!

248
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,875
IT'S TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY YOU!
I'M JEALOUS!

249
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,833
- WELL, DON'T KEEP ME
IN SUSPENSE. WHAT'D YOU GET?

250
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,166
- FEAST YOUR EYES ON THIS!
IT'S A MAGIC POWDER.

251
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,416
ALL I DO IS SPRINKLE SOME ON
THE SOIL AND VEGETABLES GROW

252
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,916
TO TWICE THEIR NORMAL SIZE!

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,500
( giggling )

254
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,708
- GOOD FOR YOU!
YOU ARE A SHREWD ONE!

255
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,375
- HOW THEY GET SO EXCITED ABOUT
SHOPPING I'LL NEVER KNOW.

256
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,791
MUST BE A GIRL THING.

257
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,250
WHO THE HELL COULD SAY?

258
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,875
COULD THESE THINGS
BE ANY HARDER TO EAT?

259
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,375
- YOU DON'T LIKE 'EM?
THE GUY SAID THEY WERE BANANAS.

260
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,958
THEY COME FROM SOME DEEP, DARK,
JUNGLE COUNTRY IN THE SOUTH.

261
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,958
I THOUGHT IT'D BE COOL
TO TRY 'EM OUT.

262
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,041
I MEAN, SURE,

263
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:41,916
THEY'RE A LITTLE TOUGH
ON THE OUTSIDE,

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,333
BUT THEY'RE TASTY ON THE INSIDE!

265
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,208
- AH, LOOK
WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN.

266
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,125
- HEY, RYUKO! YOU WANNA TRY
ONE OF THESE BANANAS?

267
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,000
WE BOUGHT SOME AT THE MOON
MARKET THIS AFTERNOON, A...

268
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,625
- WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH HIM?

269
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,875
- EH.

270
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,666
- MOST OF US WOULD DENY FATE.

271
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,000
WE DON'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL
TO SEE WHAT MUST BE DONE.

272
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,083
- ALKAID MAY BE SUBDUED
TO MUCH THE SAME EFFECT.

273
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,666
- PERHAPS IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS,

274
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,666
BUT YOU LOOK
SOMEWHAT DISTRESSED.

275
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,416
- YOU VERMIN!

276
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,458
- EAGER AS YOU MAY BE, I DIDN'T
COME HERE FOR AN ALTERCATION.

277
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,625
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

278
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,750
( grunts )

279
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,875
WHAT?

280
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,458
- JUST CALM DOWN.

281
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,458
BELIEVE ME, YOU'LL REGRET NOT
HEARING OUT WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

282
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,125
SEE, MY FRIEND, I'M A VERITABLE
FOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE,

283
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,208
KNOWLEDGE THAT CONCERNS YOU.

284
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,375
- ANOTHER SCHEME? WHAT NOW?

285
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,458
- WHY MUST YOU BE SO COLD?

286
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,875
SO, LAD, I HEAR
YOU WERE A FOUNDLING.

287
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,458
- IS THAT SO?
AND WHERE HAVE YOU HEARD THAT?

288
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,083
- I MAKE IT A POINT TO
KEEP MY EAR TO THE GROUND.

289
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,250
FOR EXAMPLE, I HEAR...

290
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,291
WELL, I KNOW WHO
YOUR REAL FATHER HAPPENS TO BE.

291
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,541
- WHAT?

292
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,416
- SURELY YOU'RE CURIOUS.
HOW COULD YOU NOT BE?

293
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,416
- YOU'RE A LIAR! I REFUSE
TO LISTEN TO THIS NONSENSE!

294
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,291
- THAT MYSTERIOUS DAGGER YOU'VE
GOT STOWED AWAY IN YOUR POCKET,

295
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,250
YOU'VE CLUNG TO IT
ALL YOUR LIFE,

296
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,750
BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT
THERE'S QUITE A BIT MORE

297
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,583
TO IT THAN MEETS THE EYE?

298
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

299
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,541
- YOU SEE, IT'S THE SORT OF
BLADE A PARENT GIVES A CHILD

300
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,375
FOR THEIR PROTECTION.

301
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,208
IF MEMORY SERVES, IT WAS THE
ONLY THING IN YOUR POSSESSION

302
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,875
THE DAY YOU WERE FOUND.

303
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,250
UNSHEATHE IT.

304
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,000
NOW THEN, HERE'S THE FUN PART.

305
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,666
HOLD IT OUT, GO ON.
LET THE LIGHT HIT IT JUST SO.

306
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,750
- ( gasps )

307
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,750
KE... KEIRO!

308
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,875
- AND THERE YOU HAVE IT, MY BOY.

309
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,375
- IMPOSSIBLE.

310
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,791
- DON'T FRET, YOU COME FROM
GOOD STOCK. QUITE GOOD.

311
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,958
THE ONLY SON OF MY LORD, KEIRO.

312
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,625
- THIS CAN'T BE!

313
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,125
- ( Taito laughing )

314
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,833
- Laila: I SWEAR I'M GONNA
THROW YOU OUT A WINDOW!

315
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,958
- IT CAN'T BE TRUE.
I WON'T BELIEVE THIS!

316
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,625
- DENIAL IS YOUR PREROGATIVE,
ALTHOUGH THE FACT STILL REMAINS.

317
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,041
BUT BELIEVE AS YOU WILL,

318
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,375
WHY LET SOMETHING LIKE
TRUTH GET IN THE WAY?

319
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,583
( chuckles )

320
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,958
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT COMPANY.

321
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,166
WELL, THEN, IT'S BEST
I GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR

322
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,791
SO YOU CAN ATTEND TO THEM.

323
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,333
GOOD SPEAKING WITH YOU.

324
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,583
- ( clanging )

325
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,416
- THE TEMPLE IS BEING LAID SIEGE
TO BY THE XUAN LONG PLATOON.

326
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,166
CURRENTLY WE'RE SURROUNDED.

327
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,041
FOR WHATEVER REASON,
THEY'RE CLAMORING FOR TAITO.

328
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,791
- OH, THEY ARE, HUH?

329
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,708
- WHERE ARE YOU RUNNING OFF TO?

330
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:44,875
- IT'S ME THE BASTARDS WANT.

331
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,541
I'M NOT GONNA LET
THE TEMPLE GET INVOLVED.

332
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,791
- DON'T START.

333
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,375
LET MASTER RYUSHO
FINISH WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

334
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,000
- Ryusho: THIS GOES FOR TAITO
AND EVERYONE ELSE.

335
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,333
THERE ARE NO COWARDS HERE,

336
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,708
THE TONG YOU TEMPLE
WILL GIVE AS GOOD AS WE GET.

337
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,125
THEY CAN DEMAND ALL THEY LIKE,

338
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,750
BUT WE ARE NOT SIMPLY HANDING
OVER ONE OF OUR OWN.

339
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,583
THAT WOULD BE AN INSULT,
AN AFFRONT TO THE LIU JIA SECT!

340
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,375
EVEN IF THE EMPEROR HIMSELF
HAS ORDERED THIS TRAVESTY,

341
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,791
SO LONG AS THE TEMPLE STANDS,

342
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,625
TAITO WILL NOT BE DELIVERED
TO THESE THUGS!

343
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,166
- MASTER RYUSHO.

344
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,625
- GIVEN THAT THEY'VE ENCIRCLED
US, BUT NOTHING ELSE AS YET,

345
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,083
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

346
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,875
IT MEANS
THEY'VE NO LEGAL PRETEXT.

347
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,416
ENGAGING US WOULD BRING THEM
NOTHING BUT DISGRACE.

348
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,958
BUT STAY VIGILANT!

349
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,625
IF THESE MOUNTEBANKS ATTEMPT
TO BEND THE LETTER OF THE LAW,

350
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,333
MAKE DAMN SURE WE ACQUAINT
THEM WITH THE STRINGENT ESSENCE

351
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,250
OF THE EIGHT STYLES!

352
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,750
- All: SIR!

353
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,125
- THAT SAID, MUCH AS WE'VE
ENJOYED THE COMPANY OF YOU KIDS,

354
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,041
I THINK THE HOUR HAS COME
FOR YOU TO LEAVE.

355
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,375
- ( all gasp )

356
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,750
- HM.

357
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,416
- OPEN UP! THAT'S AN ORDER!

358
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,416
- ( scoffs )

359
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,750
THOSE IDIOT MONKS.

360
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,208
THEY'RE ACTUALLY
GOING TO RESIST?

361
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,208
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
MUCH FUN FOR YOU, DOES IT?

362
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,041
- SHIMEI, TARRY
ELSEWHERE, FILTH.

363
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,833
YOU'VE NO BUSINESS
WHATSOEVER HERE.

364
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,500
- ALWAYS SO STANDOFFISH.

365
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,666
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
THE MONKS BEING UNCOOPERATIVE.

366
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,750
SO I'VE COME ALONG TO GIVE YOU
SOME USEFUL INFORMATION.

367
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,166
- AND JUST WHAT EXACTLY
IS THAT, PRAY TELL?

368
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,625
- ( chuckling maliciously )

369
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,875
- ( quick footsteps )

370
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,416
- HURRY IT UP!
IT'S NOT MUCH FARTHER!

371
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,250
ONCE WE'RE THROUGH HERE,
IT'S STRAIGHT OUT OF THE CITY!

372
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,750
- DO YOU THINK MASTER
RYUSHO AND THE OTHERS

373
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,083
WILL BE ALL RIGHT?

374
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,375
- I HOPE SO.

375
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,916
- DAMN IT!

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,875
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M RUNNING AWAY
WITH MY TAIL BETWEEN MY LEGS

377
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,875
WITHOUT GETTING A SHOT
AT MOUSTACHE!

378
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,708
- I'M ACTUALLY KINDA HAVING
A HARD TIME BELIEVING

379
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,500
YOU WENT ALONG
WITH THIS WHOLE ESCAPE THING.

380
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,208
I FIGURED WE WERE GONNA HAVE TO
KNOCK YOU UNCONSCIOUS

381
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,333
OR SOMETHING.

382
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,625
EITHER THAT
OR LURE YOU WITH BANANAS.

383
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,458
- HEY, I'M NOT A TOTAL JERK.

384
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,000
MASTER RYUSHO DID ME A KINDNESS.

385
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,458
IF I'D REFUSED, I MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE SPAT IN THE GUY'S FACE!

386
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,250
- TAITO, REMEMBER
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY.

387
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,625
IN THE END IT WAS ALKAID
THE DIPPER BEARERS SAW FIT

388
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,000
TO RALLY ROUND.

389
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,833
DUBHE, KEIRO'S STAR,

390
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,333
DESPITE HIS GREAT STRENGTH, IT
WAS YOU THE OTHERS BEFRIENDED.

391
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,416
IN THE DAYS TO COME,
TAKE COMFORT IN THAT.

392
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,666
- YES, SIR.

393
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,166
- BUT THERE ARE MORE.
FIND THEM AND THE PATH

394
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,625
WILL OPEN OUT TO YOU.

395
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,333
AND RYUKO, TRUST IN HIM
AS YOU WOULD YOUR OWN ARM.

396
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,458
THAT'S ALL. GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

397
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,458
REMEMBER WHAT'S PASSED
BETWEEN US.

398
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,166
- TRUST RYUKO
AS I WOULD MY ARM, OKAY.

399
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,291
- I CAN SEE THE EXIT UP AHEAD.

400
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,333
- WE'RE FINALLY OUT OF THERE.

401
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,000
- HOPEFULLY OUR TRAIL
HAS GONE COLD.

402
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,333
- ALAS, NOT SO COLD
AS YOU MIGHT THINK.

403
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,666
- WAIT A SECOND,
YOU'RE THAT HAG!

404
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,125
- SURELY YOU DIDN'T COME
ALL THIS WAY TO TRADE INSULTS,

405
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,333
DID YOU, BOY?

406
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,750
- TELL ME! HOW DID YOU KNOW
WE'D BE HERE?

407
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,208
- I HAVE WAYS. EVEN A THORN
IN MY SIDE CAN BE USEFUL.

408
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,958
IN THIS CASE, IT ALLOWS ME TO
DEAL WITH ALL OF YOU VERMIN

409
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,583
IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

410
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,833
- ALL RIGHT THEN,
YOU WANT A FIGHT, YOU GOT ONE!

411
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:02,875
- DAMN RIGHT!

412
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,750
( grunting )

413
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,500
WHO THE HELL ARE THESE GIRLS?

414
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,541
- ( Laila screams )

415
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,250
- I'VE GOT THIS ONE, LAILA.
GET BACK!

416
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,375
- OKAY.

417
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,250
- ( grunting )

418
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,166
- COME ON! LOOK ALIVE!
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT!

419
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,375
- SCREW YOU! HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY?

420
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,083
THEY'RE CHICKS!

421
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,708
- OH, SO NOW
YOU'RE A CHAUVINIST?

422
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,958
THIS IS HOW!

423
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,583
OH, YEAH!

424
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,583
CRAP.

425
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,500
- I COULD REALLY USE
A LITTLE HELP HERE!

426
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,875
LET HIM GO, NOW!

427
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,125
ALL RIGHT, THAT DOES IT!
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

428
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,000
( grunts )

429
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,541
- RYUKO, YOU ALL RIGHT?

430
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,333
- I AM NOW. THANK YOU, RINMEI.

431
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,791
- Laila: YOU FORCE ME
TO DO THIS!

432
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,041
- WHOA! GOOD CALL, SIS!
YOU JUST SAVED OUR BUTTS!

433
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,416
- YOU SURE GOT
YOUR MONEY'S WORTH!

434
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,666
- EVERYONE! LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE WHILE WE CAN!

435
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,375
- ( coughs )

436
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,500
DAMN YOU ALL!

437
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,500
- ( panting )

438
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,541
- STAY WITH ME, GUYS.
ONCE WE'VE MADE IT TO THE RIVER,

439
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,041
I'M PRETTY SURE
WE'LL BE OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

440
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,125
- ALL RIGHT.

441
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,416
- HURRY IT UP, RYUKO!

442
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,083
YOU'RE FALLING BEHIND!
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

443
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,000
- I'M FINE. JUST KEEP GOING.

444
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,125
- ( both gasp )

445
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,333
- KEIRO.

446
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,833
- THE STARS...
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT.

447
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,083
- ALKAID, WELL MET.

448
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,875
DO YOU SEE NOW, BOY?
FATE WILL HAVE US COLLIDE!

449
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,916
- YOU BASTARD!

450
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,416
- ( theme song playing )

451
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,750
- Ryuko: HE BELIEVED THEY WOULD
REMAIN INSEPARABLE.

452
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,875
- Shokaku: I WILL DO ANYTHING
TO SEE THE LAND THRIVE.

453
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,791
- Koyo: ALKAID AND DUBHE ARE
ABOUT TO GO AT IT, FULL ON.

454
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,000
- Keiro: A MAN'S WORTH
IS MEASURED

455
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,166
IN VOLUMES OF BLOOD SPILT,

456
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,666
OF LIVES DEVOURED!

457
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,791
- Ryuko: IF SUCH IS YOUR
VERDICT, I AM PREPARED TO DIE.

458
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,166
- Rinmei: RYUKO! TAITO!

459
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,833
- Laila: WAIT, PLEASE! NO!

460
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,125
- Hosei: FAREWELL, RYUKO.

461
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,375
