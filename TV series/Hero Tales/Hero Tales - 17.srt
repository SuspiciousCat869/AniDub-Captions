1
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,791
- SO YOU'RE BACK.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

2
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,791
- OH, FATHER!

3
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,791
( crying )

4
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,750
- ARE YOU WELL, DAUGHTER?
- I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

5
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,291
- SO THAT BAD ASS OVER THERE
IS YOU GUYS' OLD MAN?

6
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,500
- HE IS A GREAT MAN.
LEADER OF THE QING LONG.

7
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,625
- AND A GOOD FATHER.

8
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,625
- HEY THERE.
- MASTER.

9
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,083
- Soei: TAITO.

10
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,125
- I'M BACK.

11
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,125
- YES.

12
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,125
- ( theme song playing )

13
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,416
- ( laughter )

14
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,416
- THE ADVENTURERS HAVE RETURNED.

15
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,125
BEARING WITH THEM NOT ONLY
NEW STORIES TO SHARE,

16
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,333
BUT NEW FRIENDS AS WELL.

17
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,333
EH, TAITO?

18
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,666
- YES, SIR. THAT'S TRUE.
BUT YOU SEE...

19
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,541
HE'S GONE. WE LOST RYUKO
TO MOUSTACHE'S ARMY.

20
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,458
I SWEAR I'LL AVENGE HIS DEATH.

21
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,916
- ON THE CONTRARY,
HE LIVES, MY BOY.

22
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,958
JUST LOOK UP.

23
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,333
ALL THE STARS ARE AS VIBRANT
AND RADIANT AS EVER.

24
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,833
THEY ARE ALL ACCOUNTED FOR,

25
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,333
INCLUDING OUR TERRESTRIALLY
ABSENT MIZAR.

26
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,208
- WHOA, NO WAY!
YOU MEAN HE'S ALIVE?

27
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,875
- HMM. YES INDEED.

28
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,041
AND WHAT'S MORE.

29
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,416
HIS STAR SHINES SO
BRIGHTLY IT COULD NOT

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,458
BE OBSCURED BY THE
DARKEST OF CLOUDS.

31
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,416
- ( LAUGHS )

32
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,208
ALL RIGHT!

33
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,250
- YEAH, I GOT TO SAY, THAT MAKES
A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE.

34
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,291
HE IS WHO HE IS AFTER ALL.

35
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,375
HE WOULDN'T JUST DIE WITHOUT
GIVING ME AN EARFUL

36
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,000
BEFORE HE KICKED THE BUCKET.

37
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,291
- YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

38
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,666
I THINK THE POOR GUY WOULD
HAVE GOTTEN LOST

39
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,625
ON HIS WAY UP
TO HEAVEN ANYHOW.

40
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,458
- WOW, HUH?
AREN'T YOU HAPPY?

41
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,000
- ( clears throat ) SO, TAITO.

42
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,333
SPEAKING OF FRIENDS,
I SEE YOU HAVE A NEW ONE.

43
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,333
THAT YOU'VE BEEN TOO RUDE
TO INTRODUCE.

44
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:02,333
- OH YEAH, SORRY.
GRANDPA, MEET RINMEI.

45
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,166
SHE'S AN ATTENDANT AT TONG YOU
AND KNOWS MASTER RYUSHO.

46
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,375
SHE'S THE EARTH FORM
OR WHATEVER OF MERAK.

47
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,583
BUT, YOU PROBABLY COULD
TELL FROM HER AURA

48
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,500
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

49
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,291
- PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

50
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,458
MY MASTER HAS TOLD ME
A GREAT DEAL

51
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,541
OF YOUR STRENGTH
AND WISDOM.

52
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,375
- THE PLEASURE IS TRULY
MINE, MY DEAR.

53
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,666
- TELL ME, ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT?
- WELL, I...

54
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,708
- OKAY NOW, SIMMER
DOWN GRANDPA.

55
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,458
RINMEI IS KINDA LIKE
RYUKO'S GIRLFRIEND.

56
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,166
- THAT SO?

57
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,625
IF I TOLD THEM HE WAS DEAD,
MAYBE I COULD HAVE HAD

58
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,500
A LITTLE FEMALE COMPANIONSHIP
FOR THE NIGHT.

59
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,208
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

60
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,208
- HELLO, SIRS! FIRST OF ALL,
LET ME TELL YOU HOW HONORED

61
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,208
I AM TO BE HERE IN THE
PRESENCE OF SUCH GREAT MEN AS...

62
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,875
- HEY, WHERE'D KOYO GO?

63
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,666
HE WAS JUST RIGHT HERE.
THAT'S TOO BAD.

64
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,625
I WANTED TO INTRODUCE HIM
TO FATHER AND MASTER SONNEI.

65
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,000
- KOYO, YOU SAY?

66
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,166
- YEAH, HE'S ANOTHER ONE
OF THE DIVINE WARRIORS.

67
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,166
HE PICKED US UP ON THE RIVER
IN HIS BOAT A FEW DAYS AGO.

68
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,583
I REALLY WANTED YOU
GUYS TO MEET HIM.

69
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,500
- HMM. IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
I'M SURE I'LL SEE HIM SOON.

70
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,291
WHETHER HE WISHES IT OR NOT.

71
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,291
- HELLO! MASTERS SONNEI AND
SOEI, LET ME TAKE THIS

72
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,375
OPPORTUNITY TO HUMBLY
MAKE MY INTRODUC...

73
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,791
- OH, HEY, FATHER DID A BUNCH
OF KIDS SHOW UP HERE

74
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,375
WITH A NOTE FROM ME?

75
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,041
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. THEY WERE
LIVING LIKE SCAVENGERS IN THE

76
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,000
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE SO WE
TOLD 'EM TO COME HERE.

77
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,125
THEY SHOULD'VE MADE IT BY NOW.

78
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,250
- Lien: HEY, TAITO.

79
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,250
- THERE YOU ARE.
- YOU'RE HERE. HEY.

80
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,250
- SLOWPOKES. WHAT THE HECK
TOOK YOU GUYS SO LONG?

81
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,000
- YOU KNOW, I WAS PRETTY
SURPRISED TO SEE THIS BAND

82
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,208
OF KIDS SHOW UP TELLING ME YOU
SENT THEM HERE TO LIVE WITH US.

83
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,416
- AS GROWING CHILDREN,

84
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,041
THEY CERTAINLY DO EAT
QUITE A BIT OF FOOD.

85
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,625
- ACTUALLY THEY EAT ABOUT
AS MUCH COMBINED

86
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,958
AS TAITO DOES BY HIMSELF.

87
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,541
( laughing )

88
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,250
- LIEN HAS PROVEN TO BE A VERY
HARD WORKER AND HAS MORE THAN

89
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,000
EARNED HIS KEEP AROUND HERE.

90
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,333
IT'S ALMOST LIKE I'VE GAINED
MORE SONS AND DAUGHTERS

91
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,000
THAN I EVER DREAMED POSSIBLE.

92
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,458
- WOW. THAT'S REALLY GREAT TO
HEAR DAD. THEY'RE ALL GOOD KIDS.

93
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,625
I GUESS THAT MAKES US THEIR BIG
BROTHER AND SISTER NOW.

94
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,583
- UH, YEAH I GUESS SO.

95
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,708
- ( both laughing )

96
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,333
- WHILE WE'RE ON
THE SUBJECT, I...

97
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,958
- SO, I IMAGINE YOU'RE ALL
PRETTY ROAD WEARY.

98
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,583
WHY DON'T WE GET
YOU SETTLED IN THEN.

99
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,791
AND TAITO,
NOW THAT YOU'RE HOME,

100
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,208
YOU SHOULD START THINKING
ABOUT YOUR NEXT STEP.

101
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,958
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
WITH YOURSELF?

102
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,500
- HI, I'M HOSEI. I'M ONE OF
THE FIVE DIVINE WARRIORS

103
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,875
AND YOUR DAUGHTER IS
HOPELESSLY IN LOVE WITH ME.

104
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,625
- HOSEI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
COME ON!

105
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,583
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU, SWEETHEART!

106
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,791
( laughing )

107
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,583
- WELL, WELL, WELL!

108
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,833
SO FATE HAS CHOSEN TO
BRING ME BACK HERE.

109
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,791
OLD MAN. YOU'LL GET WHAT'S
COMING TO YOU.

110
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,750
- AH, NOW, YOU SHOULDN'T
TROUBLE YOURSELF.

111
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,291
- YOU TOOK CARE
OF US AT TONG YOU,

112
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,000
SO I'M JUST
RETURNING THE FAVOR.

113
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,875
YOU'RE OUR GUEST AFTER ALL.

114
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,916
YOU SHOULD BE TREATED
LIKE ROYALTY.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
TRY TO RELAX. WHAT ARE YOU
SEWING OVER THERE ANYWAY?

116
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,750
DID SOMETHING GET TORN?

117
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,500
- NO. IT'S NOTHING. ACTUALLY...

118
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,166
- THAT'S RYUKO'S.
- YES IT IS.

119
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,000
I WANTED TO GIVE IT BACK
TO HIM IN GOOD CONDITION.

120
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,416
IT'S SILLY AND I'M SURE HE
DOESN'T CARE HOW IT LOOKS.

121
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,416
IF HE EVEN NOTICES AT ALL.

122
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,791
- WHAT GREAT NEWS.
ISN'T IT AMAZING?

123
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,291
- I THOUGHT I'D LOST HIM.

124
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,125
BUT NOW IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF TIME UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN.

125
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,791
- SO, UH. HERE YOU GO.

126
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,583
THANKS FOR LETTING ME TAKE IT.
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

127
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,416
I'M NOT. I'M NOT REALLY
A "WEAPON" KIND OF GUY.

128
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,333
I'M MORE OF, LIKE,
A HANDS-ON FIGHTER, I GUESS.

129
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,791
- I KNOW, MY SON. YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THE TYPE TO RELY SOLELY

130
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,541
ON YOUR OWN HANDS.

131
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,541
I IMAGINE YOU'VE GROWN
EVEN MORE SKILLED

132
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,041
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE.

133
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,125
BUT EVEN SO, YOU SHOULD
STILL KEEP IT WITH YOU.

134
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,833
PLEASE TAKE IT, TAITO.
NOT TO USE,

135
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,875
MORE LIKE ANOTHER
TRAVELING COMPANION.

136
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,416
- THANKS, DAD.

137
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,541
- IMPRESSIVE.
I'D EXPECT NO LESS

138
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,041
FROM AN EXPERIENCED
CHANNELER LIKE YOURSELF.

139
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,541
SUCH MASTERY.
SUCH CONTROL OF YOUR POWER.

140
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,583
- WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

141
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,208
- ALKAID AND HIS ENTOURAGE
HAVE RETURNED TO THE SAFETY

142
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,750
OF THEIR FAMILIAL DEN.

143
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,333
THEY AIM TO LICK THEIR WOUNDS,
MOURN THEIR LOSSES.

144
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,750
LET'S SMOKE THEM OUT AND COLLECT
THEIR HEADS AS TROPHIES.

145
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,541
MY LORD. I'M CONFUSED. YOU'VE
ALWAYS TAKEN THE MOST DIRECT

146
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,625
ROUTE DEALING WITH
YOUR ADVERSARIES.

147
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,041
BUT YOUR APPROACH
TO ALKAID AS OF LATE

148
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,750
HAS BEEN RATHER COOL.

149
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,333
THE IRON IS HOT NOW.

150
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,291
WE MUST STRIKE LEST WE LOSE
OUR OPPORTUNITY. FOR GOOD.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,291
- SHIMEI.
- YES, LORD?

152
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,708
- YOU'RE EITHER BEING DENSE,

153
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,083
OR PERHAPS
INTENTIONALLY CONTRARY.

154
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,375
YOU KNOW WHY
I LEAVE HIM BE FOR NOW.

155
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,125
- I DO?
THEN PLEASE REFRESH ME.

156
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,958
- ALKAID IS NO MERE OBSTACLE
TO BE STEPPED OVER,

157
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,875
NOR IS HE A STONE
TO BE KICKED FROM MY PATH.

158
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,083
ALKAID'S ROLE IS INTEGRAL.

159
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,125
MY PLANS ENGULF MUCH MORE
THAN THE XIAN EMPIRE.

160
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,708
AND THE BOY WILL WEIGH INTO
THOSE PLANS INFINITELY MORE

161
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,250
THAN YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE.

162
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,333
- ( chuckling ) SO WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS WE SHOULD

163
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,791
LET OUR GAME LIVE WELL

164
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,708
AND FATTEN ITSELF BEFORE
WE SLAUGHTER IT

165
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,291
FOR THE FINAL FEAST?

166
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,083
- RUN!

167
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,875
( all laughing )

168
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,041
- DON'T RUN. I'M SO HUNGRY,
AND I LOVE TO EAT LITTLE KIDS.

169
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,416
- YA CAN'T CATCH ME,
YOU STINKY OLD MONSTER!

170
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,833
- ALL THIS RUNNING
IS MAKING ME HUNGRY.

171
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,750
- THAT BOY.
HE'S AS LIVELY AS EVER.

172
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,541
- YEAH, IT'S LIKE HE'S
A LITTLE KID TOO.

173
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,333
( sighs ) IS HE EVER
GOING TO GROW UP

174
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,208
AND STOP BEING SO STUPID?

175
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,916
- NOW GO EASY ON YOUR BROTHER.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,583
TAITO JUST KNOWS HOW
TO ENJOY HIMSELF.

177
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,125
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

178
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,750
- OH, WOW. I CAN SEE WHERE LAILA
GETS HER INTELLIGENCE FROM.

179
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,875
THE THINGS YOU SAY, FATHER.
LIKE PEARLS OF WISDOM.

180
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,333
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?
- "FATHER," HUH?

181
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:21,166
- ARE YOU THIRSTY, DEAR FATHER?
I'VE GOT DRINKS!

182
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,708
- AH. SO YOU DID THAT
ALL BY YOURSELF, DID YOU?

183
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:29,583
- I HAD TO DIG DEEP INSIDE.
SOMETIMES I AMAZE EVEN MYSELF.

184
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:33,375
- GIMME A BREAK.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? COME ON.

185
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,791
- NOW, LAILA. IT'S TRUE.
I'M BOTH HEROIC AND HUMBLE.

186
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,833
FOR IF I CAN SOMEHOW
HELP MY FELLOW MAN.

187
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,791
I SWEAR I'LL ALWAYS LEND A HAND.

188
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,375
- NOW DON'T YOU FEEL
BETTER, FATHER?

189
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,458
- YES, MUCH BETTER.

190
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,208
- ( sighs )

191
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,666
- ( laughs ) EVERYTHING
IS GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN.

192
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,750
IF I CAN GET POPS HERE
ON MY SIDE. I AM IN.

193
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,916
- HOSEI. YOU HAVE COMPLETELY
AND TOTALLY WON ME OVER,

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,416
MY DEAR BOY.

195
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,125
- I THINK YOU'D MAKE A
WONDERFUL ADDITION

196
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,750
TO THE FAMILY.

197
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:07,166
- AS LAILA'S HUSBAND. I KNOW.
- OH MY, IT'S SO EMBARRASSING.

198
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,708
BUT STILL...
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. I WILL.

199
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,791
- I'LL MAKE YOU THE HAPPIEST
GIRL IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

200
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,583
( chuckling )

201
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,500
VERY HAPPY.

202
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,833
- SO IS THIS ONE A LITTLE
BIT SOFT IN THE HEAD?

203
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,625
- EXTREMELY SOFT.

204
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,958
- THERE'S NO NEED TO LURK ABOUT.

205
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,291
WELL, WELL. YOU'VE FINALLY
RETURNED. WELCOME BACK.

206
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,625
- IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE.
PLEASE FORGIVE THE RUDENESS

207
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,666
OF MY UNCEREMONIOUS DEPARTURE.

208
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,583
- I'VE MENTORED MANY YOUNG
MEN AT LIAN TONG,

209
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,333
BUT ONLY ONE HAS RUN AWAY
HIS VERY FIRST NIGHT.

210
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,625
KOYO, YOU ABSORBED MY
TEACHINGS WITH THE AVIDITY

211
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,041
OF A SPONGE THAT
THIRSTS FOR WATER.

212
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,500
I THOUGHT YOU TO BE WISE
WELL BEYOND YOUR YEARS.

213
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,916
- THANK YOU, MASTER.

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,583
- THAT WASN'T PRAISE.
TO THINK TAITO RETURNED HOME

215
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,666
WITH A PRODIGAL SUCH AS
YOURSELF IN TOW.

216
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,916
IT SEEMS FATE HAS A WRY
SENSE OF HUMOR INDEED.

217
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,875
- IS THAT SO?
I FAIL TO SEE THE COMEDY.

218
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,666
SCURVY WOULD GET MORE LAUGHS.

219
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,250
- NOW THEN.

220
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,625
LET'S NOT SIDESTEP THE
ISSUE FURTHER. GIVE IT BACK.

221
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,500
RETURN THE ITEM WHICH
YOU STOLE FROM ME

222
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,166
SO MANY YEARS AGO.

223
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,083
I'M SURPRISED YOU
HADN'T SOLD IT.

224
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,750
ISN'T THAT WHAT THIEVES DO?

225
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,791
- A RELIC OF THE LIAN TONG
TEMPLE WOULD FETCH SOME COIN.

226
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,708
I OFTEN CONSIDERED IT.

227
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,041
BUT ALAS, ONE HAS TO
CONSIDER THE FUTURE AS WELL.

228
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,041
I THOUGHT I'D SOMEDAY NEED IT.

229
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,166
AND HERE WE ARE.
IT SEEMS THAT DAY HAS COME.

230
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,250
- I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

231
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,541
- ( meows )

232
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,583
- ( gasps )

233
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,166
- ( laughs ) THIS'LL BE QUITE
THE STORY TO TELL MY PUPILS.

234
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,541
THE THIEF WHOSE GUILT DRIVES
HIM THIS FAR TO REUNITE

235
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,000
A CAT WITH ITS DISH.

236
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,958
- YOU MEAN IT WAS WORTH
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING?

237
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,083
- ASK THE CAT.

238
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:17,166
- ASK THE CAT? ASK THE CAT!

239
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,625
- ALL RIGHT, READY?
- TOO SLOW!

240
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,208
- ( all laugh )

241
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,583
- OW! OW! OW!
OW! OW! OW! OW!

242
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,666
- GEEZ, TAITO,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

243
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,416
YOU GOT TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

244
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

245
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,416
I'M AS SERIOUS AS
A SHARK ATTACK HERE.

246
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,958
IT'S YOU GUYS' FAULT FOR
COMING AT ME ALL

247
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,583
AT ONCE LIKE SOME KINDA
PACK OF WILD DOGS.

248
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,083
- BUT YOU TOLD US TO.

249
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,250
- YOU SAID THAT WE SHOULD ALL
COME AT YOU AS A GROUP,

250
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,833
CAUSE YOU COULD HANDLE
A BUNCH OF KIDS.

251
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,416
- I CAN. BUT YOU CAUGHT
ME OFF GUARD.

252
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,458
- HEY, IS TAITO ALL RIGHT?
I REMEMBER HIM BEING STRONG.

253
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,958
HE WAS, WASN'T HE?

254
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,791
- I AM STRONG.
EVERYBODY SAW ME, RIGHT?

255
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,166
WHEN I TOOK OUT THOSE
THREE BAD GUYS?

256
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,208
AND THIS IS FOR PICKING ON
SOMEONE WEAKER THAN YOU.

257
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,333
THEY WERE SORRY THEY MESSED
WITH ME, HUH?

258
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,416
- THAT'S TRUE. BUT MAYBE
YOU BEAT 'EM 'CAUSE YOU JUST

259
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,833
GOT LUCKY THAT
DAY OR SOMETHING.

260
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,250
- THAT WASN'T LUCK.

261
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,166
- OH HEY. I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

262
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,833
WE SHOULD HAVE TAITO
AND EVERYONE SHOW US ALL

263
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,916
THOSE COOL TRICKS THEY CAN
DO LIKE THEY DID THAT ONE TIME.

264
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,750
- AN EXHIBITION OF SKILLS, EH?
THIS SHOULD BE FUN.

265
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,291
- WE'LL FINALLY SEE WHAT
TAITO HAS LEARNED.

266
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,916
AND WHAT THE OTHER
DIVINE WARRIORS ARE CAPABLE OF.

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,916
- EVERYONE PLEASE DIRECT YOUR
ATTENTION TO THE COURTYARD.

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,125
TAITO AND DIVINE WARRIORS

269
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,458
HAVE GOT SOME AMAZING
THINGS TO SHOW YOU.

270
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,416
FIRST UP THE BEAUTIFUL RINMEI.

271
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,000
- ( grunting )

272
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:54,250
- NEXT IS MISTER
SURE SHOT, HOSEI!

273
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,333
- ALL RIGHT, THESE PEOPLE
WANT TO SEE A SHOW.

274
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,583
SO I GUESS I WILL JUST HAVE
TO GIVE THEM A SHOW.

275
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,250
THAT'S THE SHUANG CHAN BOW.
IN FULL BLOOM!

276
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,166
- MASTER OF THE
HIGH SEAS, KOYO.

277
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,250
- IT'S NOT A SOLO ACT I NEED
YOU TO BE MY ASSISTANT.

278
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,500
- OH, UH, YOU DO?

279
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,291
- UH, I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THIS.

280
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,833
HE CAN'T SEE THROUGH
THAT, RIGHT?

281
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,708
- YEAH, WHAT IF HE MISSES?
THIS COULD GET UGLY.

282
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,208
- BE CAREFUL, LAILA.

283
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,041
- LISTEN HERE, YOU OLD RIVER
RAT. YOU DO ANYTHING TO THAT

284
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,958
BEAUTIFUL FACE OF HERS,
YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE.

285
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,208
I AM NOT JOKING, YOU HEAR ME?

286
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,083
- I WOULDN'T HAVE ASSUMED
OTHERWISE, RELAX!

287
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,708
I ALMOST NEVER MISS.

288
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,208
- ( gasps )

289
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,208
- YUM! TASTY!

290
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,875
- AND NOW IS OUR VERY
OWN TAITO!

291
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,000
- YEAH, TAITO. SHOW 'EM UP.

292
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,458
- YOU CAN DO IT!

293
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,500
- ALL RIGHT.
NOW SHOW EVERYBODY THE

294
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,250
TRUE POWER OF THE
QING LONG SPIRIT.

295
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,083
- DON'T WORRY, YOU GUYS,
I'VE GOT THIS IN THE BAG.

296
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
RIGHT!

297
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,250
- I SEE

298
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,541
- HE'S GOING TO USE
CHANNELING, HUH?

299
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,791
- I'LL BE...

300
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,583
- INNER RESERVOIR CHANNELING,
IT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

301
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,916
HE'S EXTREMELY ADVANCED
FOR HIS YOUNG AGE.

302
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,458
- HOW'S THAT?

303
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,791
COME ON. NO CHEERS AT ALL?

304
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,333
YOU SHOULD BE PICKING
YOUR JAWS OFF THE GROUND

305
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,666
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

306
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,958
SO, MAKE SOME NOISE!

307
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,458
- UH, WELL, THAT WAS
REALLY AMAZING.

308
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,375
- OH YEAH. BUT STILL...

309
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,708
- BUT STILL IT WAS
ALSO KIND OF BORING.

310
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,708
- THAT WAS BORING?

311
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,083
- KIND OF. I MEAN, ALL YOU
REALLY ENDED UP DOING

312
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,791
WAS BREAKING THAT PILLAR.

313
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,833
- ALL OF THE OTHER ONES PUT
ON A SHOW FOR EVERYBODY.

314
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,708
YOU JUST KINDA STOOD THERE,
AND THEN YOU BROKE THE THING.

315
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,583
- YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE
ON THE SLOW SIDE, HAVEN'T YOU?

316
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,375
- HEY! I AM NOT
ON THE SLOW SIDE.

317
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,125
YOU GUYS THINK I'M
JUST SO UNKEMPT

318
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,291
THAT I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING RIGHT, IS THAT IT?

319
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,750
YOU WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED?
YOU WANT TO SEE A REAL SHOW?

320
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,166
WATCH THIS!

321
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,583
I'LL JUST, JUST, UH...

322
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,208
( imitates monkey chattering )

323
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,416
- NOW THAT'S GOOD!

324
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,666
- THAT'S IT.
NOW CLIMB THAT TREE.

325
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,041
YOU'RE SO FUNNY. MORE. MORE.

326
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,666
- OH, MY GOSH,
HE'S SUCH AN IDIOT!

327
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,166
- THAT BOY'S JUST NOT
RIGHT IN THE HEAD.

328
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,583
- ( laughing ) WHAT A SHOW!

329
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,083
- THIS IS MORE LIKE IT,
YOU AND ME WALKING

330
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,750
THE BEAT AGAIN, MAKING SURE
THAT THERE'S NO TROUBLE.

331
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,125
- I APPRECIATE YOU COMING WITH
ME YOU COULD'VE STAYED BACK

332
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,125
AND RESTED A WHILE, YOU KNOW?

333
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,500
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

334
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,083
I MAY BE TIRED, BUT I'M
STILL A MEMBER OF QING LONG!

335
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,083
I'D GO ON PATROL WITH YOU
ANYTIME, POPS.

336
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,333
- THANK YOU, SON.

337
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,000
- YOU KNOW, THIS
WHOLE THING HAS BEEN

338
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,041
LIKE SOME CRAZY DREAM I HAD.

339
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:21,416
TO GO FROM THE CAPITAL TO BEING
BACK HERE AT HOME WITH YOU.

340
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,041
HEY, GUESS WHAT?

341
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,083
WELL, WHILE I WAS THERE,

342
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,250
I ACTUALLY MET
THE EMPEROR HIMSELF!

343
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,541
- IS THAT TRUE?

344
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,583
- IT'S TRUE. I HAD SOME
SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT

345
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,833
THE GUY AT FIRST BECAUSE

346
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,375
THE EMPIRE IS IN SUCH
A SORRY STATE RIGHT NOW.

347
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,250
BUT I THINK HE'S ACTUALLY A
PRETTY GOOD GUY IN HIS OWN WAY.

348
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,500
YEAH. HE'S DEFINITELY
DOING THE BEST HE CAN

349
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,791
AT THE VERY LEAST.

350
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,541
- IT'S WEIRD.
- HEY, POP. SOMETHING WRONG?

351
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,000
- SO THE BLOOD ATTRACTS.

352
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,750
TAITO I FEARED THAT THIS
DAY WOULD EVENTUALLY

353
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,250
COME TO PASS.

354
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,750
LISTEN, SON,

355
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,958
HIS BLOOD IS MINGLED IN WITH
YOUR OWN, YOU BOTH SHARE IT.

356
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,583
YOU AND HE ARE BROTHERS,
TWINS TO BE EXACT.

357
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,541
- ( gasps )

358
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,125
- IT'S BEEN SIXTEEN YEARS.
THE TWO OF YOU WERE BORN

359
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,000
SCREAMING INTO THIS WORLD.

360
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,875
THE WORLD THAT ONE WAS
DESTINED TO RULE.

361
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,708
THE FATE FOR THE OTHER
WAS NOT SO FORTUNATE.

362
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,333
HE WAS TO BE DISPOSED OF,

363
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,625
TO AVOID A CONSTANT POWER
STRUGGLE FOR THE THRONE.

364
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,041
IN THIS CASE, THE ANSWER
PRESENTED ITSELF,

365
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,458
IN THE FORM OF A SACRED
AND POWERFUL SIGIL.

366
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,291
DURING THAT TIME IN MY LIFE
I WAS WORKING AT THE CAPITAL

367
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,500
AS A GUARD.

368
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,125
ONE NIGHT RYUSHO
SUMMONED ME

369
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,666
TO TONG YOU TEMPLE
ON AN URGENT MATTER.

370
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,708
HE ASKED THAT I TAKE
YOU TO LIAN TONG,

371
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,041
WHERE YOU WOULD
LIVE IN OBSCURITY,

372
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,375
IMMUNE TO THE MACHINATIONS

373
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,833
OF THOSE WHO TRY TO CONTROL
THE THRONE.

374
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,833
THE OFFICIAL STORY
IS THAT YOU HAD FALLEN

375
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,750
TO A CHILDHOOD DISEASE.

376
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,833
LEAVING TAIGA TO BECOME
THE NEXT EMPEROR.

377
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,416
OF COURSE YOU
KNOW THE REST.

378
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,750
I RAISED YOU AS MY OWN
FLESH AND BLOOD.

379
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,375
FORGIVE ME FOR NOT TELLING YOU.
I FEARED THIS DAY.

380
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,875
- AW, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, POP.

381
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,083
SO FANCY DRESS IS MY BROTHER.

382
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,375
IT ACTUALLY EXPLAINS
A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS.

383
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,041
AND HEY, I'M NOT UPSET
ABOUT IT AT ALL.

384
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,666
THE ONLY REASON I'M AROUND
TO HEAR THIS STORY IS BECAUSE

385
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,416
OF WHAT EVERYBODY DID FOR ME.

386
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,041
YOU ALL RISKED YOUR LIVES.

387
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,333
AND THANKS TO THAT
I CAN LIVE MY OWN.

388
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,958
YOU REALLY ARE THE
BEST, POP. I MEAN IT.

389
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,083
- THANK YOU, SON.

390
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,041
- ( children laughing )

391
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,583
- WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY DID YOU STOP PLAYING?

392
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,708
- UH, HOLD ON.

393
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,208
( gasps )

394
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,083
THEY FOUND US!

395
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,041
- I HAD PLANNED ON TAKING
THAT SECRET TO THE GRAVE.

396
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,916
I WANTED YOU TO HEAD
UP QING LONG,

397
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,708
AND NOT TO HAVE
YOUR MIND OVERRUN

398
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,416
WITH THOUGHTS OF THE EMPIRE.

399
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,625
YOU WERE NEVER TO KNOW
OF YOUR TRUE LINEAGE.

400
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,083
- SO IS THAT THE REASON YOU
WERE AGAINST ME GOING

401
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,208
TO THE CAPITAL
AT THE FIRST PLACE?

402
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,083
- YES. I DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO GO BACK THERE.

403
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,166
OUT OF MY OWN FEAR,

404
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,875
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D
LEARN THE TRUTH

405
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,250
AND NEVER WANT
TO RETURN TO LIAN TONG.

406
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,375
- REALLY?

407
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,208
GIVE ME A BREAK, POP.
I DON'T CARE IF THE EMPEROR

408
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,208
IS MY BROTHER, YOU'RE NOT
GETTING OUT OF BEING MY DAD

409
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,416
THAT EASY!

410
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,583
- STRANGE THE WAY
THINGS TURN OUT.

411
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,458
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU,

412
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,583
THE ONE WHO DREW SHAWN
GHEE LAN WU,

413
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,125
THE ONE DESTINED TO RULE
LIVES IN EXILE WHILE THE OTHER

414
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,250
IS GIVEN CONTROL OF THE EMPIRE.

415
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,416
- EMPEROR, ME?

416
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,666
( laughs ) THAT'S HILARIOUS.
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL 'EM.

417
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,875
THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT

418
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,416
WHEN LAILA AND HOSEI
FIND OUT THAT THEY'RE

419
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,625
CALLING THE GUY THAT SHOULD
HAVE BEEN THE EMPEROR STUPID.

420
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,500
- DON'T BOTHER. THEY'RE
NEVER GOING TO BELIEVE YOU.

421
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,500
- MASTER SOEI! TAITO!

422
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,791
- LIEN?
- WHAT'S WRONG?

423
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,583
- WHY ARE YOU JERKS EVEN HERE?

424
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,500
- WHY? WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO COME AND BURN LIAN TONG

425
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,875
TO THE GROUND?

426
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,916
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KILL INNOCENT
PEOPLE TO GET TO ME?

427
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,416
KEIRO!

428
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,125
- ( Japanese song playing )

429
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,166
- Koyo: WAN XIANG SHI MING.
FROM ITS EYE,

430
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,750
AN EVIL GLOW EMANATES.

431
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,458
- Soei: HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE
MOTTO OF THE QING LONG PLATOON?

432
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,291
- Taito: WE SWEAR TO WORK
FOR PEACE. TO HELP OTHERS.

433
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,500
AND TO LOVE OUR FELLOW MAN.

434
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,875
- IT'S HIGH TIME WE GOT
ON TO THE REAL SHOW!

435
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,125
- Taito: THAT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN STRONG

436
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,791
ENOUGH TO PUT A CRACK IN
THE SWORD LIKE THIS.

437
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,000
- COME ON, "SON."

438
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,750
NOW, GET ANGRY DESTROY
EVERYTHING IN SIGHT!

439
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,166
AND UNLEASH ALKAID'S
CLEANSING HOLOCAUST!

440
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,875
- Koyo: WILL ALKAID'S RAGE
BE THE BEACON

441
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,791
USHERING ON A NEW ERA?

442
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,041
IN HERO TALES,
"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN,

443
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,791
LIAN TONG TEMPLE ABLAZE."

444
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,583
- Laila: YOU WERE
RIGHT BY HIS SIDE

445
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:16,916
THE ENTIRE TIME
AND YOU STILL

446
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,500
COULDN'T PROTECT HIM
FROM THOSE MONSTERS.

447
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,000
YOU LET HIM DIE!
