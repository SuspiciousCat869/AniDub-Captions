1
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,500
FATHER.

2
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,250
( gasping )

3
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:39,875
RYUKO!

4
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,666
- ( wind howling )

5
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,125
- ( theme song playing )

6
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,208
- Hosei: COME ON, SERIOUSLY?

7
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,125
- YEAH.
- OKAY, BUT HOW CAN YOU BE SURE

8
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,416
YOU WEREN'T JUST HALF-ASLEEP?

9
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,375
- LOOK, I KNOW HOW
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE!

10
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,166
I SAW RYUKO PLAIN AS DAY!

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,166
- AND HOW THE HELL WOULD HE
EVEN KNOW WHERE TO FIND US

12
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,916
AT THIS POINT, HUH?

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,791
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

14
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,250
- LOOK, WE ALL WANT
TO SEE RYUKO AGAIN.

15
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,916
BUT IT'S JUST TOO BIG
OF A STRETCH FOR HIM

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,541
TO BE WALKING
AROUND OUT HERE.

17
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,708
USE YOUR HEAD. I SWEAR.

18
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,500
- MY HEART TELLS ME THAT RYUKO
WILL BE WAITING TO GREET US

19
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,500
AT THE TONG YO TEMPLE.

20
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,458
- YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

21
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,666
- AFTER ALL, THREE OF THE DIVINE
WARRIORS ARE ALREADY HERE.

22
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,208
SEEMS TO ME THE ODDS
ARE PRETTY GOOD

23
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,500
HE'LL MAKE HIS WAY
TO THE CAPITAL

24
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,125
WITH THE ONE WE'VE YET TO MEET.

25
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,833
- OF COURSE! YEAH! THAT'S JUST
THE KIND OF TWIST FATE PULLS.

26
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,333
- SO, WE'RE ALL
IN AGREEMENT THEN.

27
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,833
THE RYUKO YOU SAW ON
THE CLIFF WAS A DREAM, YEAH?

28
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,875
- IT SURE FELT REAL TO ME.

29
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,958
- THE WEST BANK, SIR!
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANNA SEE!

30
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,083
- YOU DON'T SAY.

31
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,291
- Taito: DON'T TELL ME ANOTHER
VILLAGE IS BEING ATTACKED.

32
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,041
- Enki: CAN'T BE.
THERE AREN'T ANY OUT THIS WAY.

33
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,125
- OKAY, BUT THEN
WHAT'S THE SMOKE ALL ABOUT?

34
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,333
- WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT DOES
YOUR GUT TELL YA TO DO?

35
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,791
- I GAVE THE EMPEROR
MY WORD I'D HELP FIX THINGS.

36
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,500
IF SOMETHING'S GOING ON,
I CAN'T JUST STAND HERE.

37
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,000
AND WHERE THERE'S SMOKE,
THERE'S MOST DEFINITELY FIRE.

38
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,875
- GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

39
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,666
ALL HANDS PREPARE TO DOCK!

40
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,916
- EVERYTHING SEEMS FINE,

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,583
BUT I GUESS WE'RE BETTER
SAFE THAN SORRY.

42
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,166
- WAY TO DRAG US OUT HERE
TO SATISFY YOUR GUT.

43
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,541
- AT LEAST THEY'RE SAFE.
WE SHOULD BE GLAD.

44
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,500
- SHE DOES HAVE A POINT.

45
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,041
- STILL, THOUGH, JUST WHAT
EXACTLY DO YOU THINK

46
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,208
THEY'RE UP TO DOWN THERE?

47
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,791
- Man: I CAN THINK OF
A BETTER QUESTION.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,125
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT US.
WE'RE NOT UP TO ANYTHING.

49
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,250
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME
IF I FIND IT DIFFICULT

50
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,625
TO TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD.

51
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,750
- AH, A CAUTIOUS MAN. LUCKY US.

52
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,208
- ( Man laughing )

53
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,666
SORRY ABOUT ALL THAT.

54
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,291
WE DO TEND TO BE A BIT
ROUGH ON STRANGERS SOMETIMES.

55
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,625
- OH, YEAH,
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME.

56
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,208
- YEAH, I GUESS.

57
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,000
- INTRIGUING. HOW HAS THERE BEEN
A MINE OUT HERE ALL THIS TIME

58
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,583
WITHOUT MY KNOWING ABOUT IT?

59
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,375
- OH? WE'VE NOT BEEN HERE LONG.
THE VEIN IS FRESH.

60
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,833
- SO, WHAT KINDA ORE
WE TALKIN' ABOUT?

61
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,583
- WHAT KIND? LOOK.

62
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,458
- ( men grunting )

63
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,708
- OH, WOW.
- ( Laila gasps )

64
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,791
- BEAUTIFUL, WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

65
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,208
- Both: MM-HM, MM-HM.

66
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,541
- NOW, KOYO, DON'T GO
GETTIN' ANY BRILLIANT IDEAS.

67
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,291
- GIVE ME SOME CREDIT, HUH?

68
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,250
I ONLY SEPARATE FOOLS AND
CRETINS FROM THEIR BOUNTY.

69
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,500
- NO DOUBT, BUT LAST I CHECKED
THE EMPIRE WAS IN CHARGE

70
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,041
OF ALL MINING OPERATIONS.

71
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,375
- IF THAT'S THE CASE, WHY AREN'T
THERE ANY IMPERIAL OFFICIALS

72
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,791
KEEPING AN EYE OUT?

73
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,666
- Man: BECAUSE THE WHEELS
OF GOVERNMENT TURN SLOWLY.

74
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,166
THE EMPIRE'S BEEN NOTIFIED
OF THE DISCOVERY,

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,458
BUT WE'RE ON OUR OWN
TO DEFEND IT FOR NOW.

76
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,083
- I SEE. THAT DOES TEND
TO SHED A BIT MORE LIGHT

77
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,666
ON YOUR PARTICULAR
MANNER OF WELCOME.

78
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,416
- YES, WELL, I SUPPOSE SO.

79
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,291
- Taito: WOW!
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY

80
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,708
BUSTING YOUR HUMPS OUT HERE!

81
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,250
- INDEED WE ARE.

82
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,000
WE'RE SCRAMBLING TO MAKE INROADS
TOWARDS HIS MAJESTY'S FAVOR.

83
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

84
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,375
- THIS IS ALL FOR TRIBUTE,
ISN'T IT?

85
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,666
- IT IS,
AND THERE'S LITTLE TIME.

86
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,333
HIS MAJESTY'S WEDDING DAY
IS ALREADY UPON US.

87
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,583
- THE EMPEROR?
- IS GETTING MARRIED?

88
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:11,916
- HOMAGE TO HIM,
BLESSED ONE, EXALTED ONE,

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,750
FULLY ENLIGHTENED ONE.

90
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,291
HIGHNESS.

91
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,666
- UNSHEATHE IT WITH
ALL THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE

92
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,416
YOU CAN MUSTER, DEAR BOY.

93
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,916
IT'S STILL NOTHING MORE
THAN A GILDED FORGERY.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,083
HOW SWEETLY WE LIE TO OURSELVES,

95
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,125
WHEN THE TRUTH DARES
BREAK OUR TENDER HEARTS.

96
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,500
- THIS SWORD SYMBOLIZES THE
LEADER OUR EMPIRE YEARNS FOR.

97
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:02,625
IT'S SCABBARD THE UNDYING LOVE
OF HIS DIVINE EMPRESS, TAKI.

98
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,458
- I THEN PLEDGE MY LIFE
TO YOUR MAJESTY.

99
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,041
- MARRIED LIFE, HUH?
IMAGINE THAT.

100
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,250
GUESS HE'S GONNA HAVE
HIS HANDS FULL.

101
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,291
- OH, HOW ROMANTIC! I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET MARRIED.

102
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,000
- WHY WAIT WHEN ALL YOUR DREAMS
COULD COME TRUE RIGHT NOW?

103
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,666
- I HOPE I FIND SOMEONE
WHO REALLY LOVES ME.

104
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,083
- I'M SURE YOU WILL.

105
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,625
BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S A LOT OF
OBSTACLES ON THE PATH

106
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,708
TOWARD FINDING THE RIGHT MAN.

107
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,250
- YEAH, I KNOW.

108
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,166
- THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE!

109
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,208
- YOU THINK THAT'S WHY KOYO
HASN'T BROUGHT HIMSELF

110
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,333
TO SETTLE DOWN YET?

111
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,458
- Koyo: WHAT?

112
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,083
- OH, JUST GIRL TALK.

113
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,083
- TALK MEN COULD
NEVER UNDERSTAND.

114
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,000
- Both: THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM
SO HOPELESS.

115
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,875
- TAITO? WHAT IN THE WORLD HAS
GOT YOU SO WORKED UP

116
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,208
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

117
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,625
- IF THEY HAVE A KID,
THAT'LL MAKE ME AN UNCLE.

118
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,958
HOW CAN I BE AN UNCLE
AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE?

119
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,375
THAT'S CRAZY! I'M NOT READY
FOR THIS RESPONSIBILITY!

120
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,250
- A CHILD WOULD SECURE
THE EMPIRE'S FUTURE.

121
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,791
WE MUST WISH THEM
A BOUNTIFUL WEDDING NIGHT.

122
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,250
- INDEED SO.

123
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,833
SUCH A CHILD WOULD ALSO SECURE
THE ROYAL PHYSICIAN'S FUTURE,

124
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,291
FOR A TIME.
- IT ONLY STANDS TO REASON,

125
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:14,500
BUT, SURELY THE HEAD GUARDSMAN
WOULD REAP SOME BENEFIT AS WELL?

126
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,833
- HMM, WORD TRAVELS FAST.

127
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,750
- MY CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
RECENT PROMOTION, SIR.

128
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,166
I KNOW I FOR ONE WILL SLUMBER
MUCH LESS FITFULLY

129
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,250
KNOWING A HERO OF YOUR CALIBER
IS KEEPING WATCH OVER ME.

130
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,125
IN FACT, I DARE SAY IT SEEMS
QUITE A PROPITIOUS ARRANGEMENT

131
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,500
FOR ALL.

132
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,541
THOUGH NO DOUBT LADY TAKI'S
SLEEP WILL BE SOUNDEST.

133
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,250
- YOUR EAR'S BEEN TO THE GROUND.

134
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,041
( scoffs ) I MUST WATCH
WHERE I STEP THEN.

135
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:50,083
- MY HEARTFELT CONGRATULATIONS
TO YOU BOTH, YOUR MAJESTIES.

136
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,208
- Both: HM.

137
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,375
- 'TIS, THOUGH, A CONSUMMATION
NOT OF OUR OWN HAPPINESS,

138
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,708
BUT THAT OF THE PEOPLE.

139
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,458
TO THAT END, YOUR LOYALTY
IS A SACROSANCT BOON.

140
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,083
IT SHALL SEE YOU AS MIDWIVES
TO A GLORIOUS AGE.

141
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,791
- YOUR HIGHNESS.
- YES, HIGHNESS.

142
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,166
- THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST PITIFUL
EXCUSE FOR A SECURITY DETAIL

143
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,708
I'VE EVER SEEN.

144
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,500
- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE SIZE
OF THE PILE THEY'RE SITTIN' ON.

145
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,250
- ( laughs )

146
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,750
LET'S GIVE 'EM A LITTLE TASTE OF
HOW FICKLE LADY FORTUNE CAN BE.

147
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,125
- I'LL MAKE THIS SIMPLE!

148
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,708
- ( all gasp )

149
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,166
- FROM HERE ON EVERY FLECK OF
GOLD SCRIMPED OUTTA THIS MINE

150
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,875
BELONGS TO THE
XUAN LANG PLATOON!

151
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,875
- Laila: WOW, THAT WAS AMAZING!

152
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,250
IT'S LIKE BEING ABLE TO
TOUCH THE STARS!

153
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,541
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

154
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,083
- BY WHAT RIGHT?

155
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,166
THIS GOLD IS INENDED AS TRIBUTE
TO HIS MAJESTY THE EMPEROR.

156
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,416
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE,

157
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,208
YOU CAN'T MARCH IN HERE AND...

158
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,875
- WITLESS FOOL! WHAT MIND
HAVE WE FOR THE EMPEROR

159
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,333
WITH HIS LORDSHIP KEIRO
AT THE HELM?

160
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,541
( groans )

161
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,208
- HEY! WHO DID THAT?

162
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,583
- BEFORE YOU GO
SHOOTIN' YOUR MOUTH OFF

163
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,791
ABOUT WHO RUNS THE SHOW,

164
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,083
I'D PAY MORE ATTENTION
TO WHO'S LISTENING.

165
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,708
- YOU INSOLENT LITTLE...

166
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,166
- YOU HAVE GOT SOME NERVE
CONDESCENDING TO US, BOY!

167
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,083
- AND WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT?

168
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,041
- WHERE THE HELL DO YOU GET OFF
CLAIMING TO BE WARRIORS

169
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,208
WHEN YOU ONLY DARE PICK A FIGHT
IN KEIRO'S SHADOW?

170
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,541
- ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP!
TAKE 'EM DOWN!

171
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,166
- ( yelling )

172
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,291
- Laila: BRING HIM DOWN
A NOTCH, TAI!

173
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,625
- Taito: ON IT!

174
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,375
HAVE YOURSELF A SEAT!

175
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,958
- ( screaming )

176
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,708
- WHAT HAVE I DONE?

177
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,083
- ( both gasp )

178
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,958
- HOLD ON A MINUTE. I KNOW
THAT STAFF. IT BELONGS TO...

179
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,916
- IS IT REALLY YOU?

180
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,916
- RYUKO?

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,708
- TAITO. IMAGINE
FINDING YOU HERE.

182
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,458
- I KNEW YOU WEREN'T
JUST SOME STUPID DREAM!

183
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,375
HOW MANY MORE OF THESE
XUAN LANG BASTARDS ARE THERE?

184
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,666
- PERFECT TIMING.

185
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,916
THESE GUYS WERE JUST LEAVING,

186
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,875
AND WE COULD USE A HAND
SHOWIN' 'EM THE WAY OUT.

187
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,500
- ( wind whooshing )

188
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,958
- ( gasps )

189
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,416
- RYUKO.

190
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,333
- HE'S BECOME ONE OF THEM.

191
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,875
- Ryuko: DRAG THESE MEN
TO THEIR FEET!

192
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:42,833
- Soldiers: SIR!

193
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,750
- IMPROPRIETY IS THE ENEMY.

194
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,750
EVERY MISSTEP OF OURS
REFLECTS ON HIS LORDSHIP KEIRO.

195
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,708
KNOW THIS IN YOUR SOUL.

196
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,833
- Soldiers: SIR!

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,791
- THE ARMY GROWS LARGER
BY THE DAY,

198
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:57,958
AND THESE NEW RECRUITS STILL
LACK DISCIPLINE. MY APOLOGIES.

199
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,916
- SERIOUSLY? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DEFENDING THEM FOR?

200
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,333
- BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE IT.

201
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,916
AND BECAUSE I NOW
COUNT MYSELF AMONG THEM.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,625
- ( wind whooshing )

203
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,583
- YOU COULDN'T HAVE...

204
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,333
BUT WHY?

205
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,250
- WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU
PLAYING AT HERE?

206
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,833
THIS JUST DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE!

207
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,666
- KEIRO IS A MAN OF VISION.

208
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,125
HE SEEKS TO USHER IN
A NEW IMPERIAL AGE.

209
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,250
ONE OF PROSPERITY AND HOPE.

210
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,250
I FIND MYSELF
SHARING IN THAT VISION.

211
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,291
THEREFORE IT'S ONLY RIGHT
THAT I SHARE IN ITS MEANS.

212
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,250
- MAN OF VISION?

213
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,666
ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS CARVE
A NICHE FOR HIMSELF IN HISTORY

214
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,166
WITH A BROADSWORD!

215
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,916
- THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE MAN
DESIRES PEACE MORE VEHEMENTLY

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,500
THAN ANYONE I'VE EVER KNOWN.

217
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,291
- YOU THINK KEIRO ACTUALLY WANTS
TO CHANGE THINGS FOR THE BETTER?

218
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,583
- I DO.

219
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,375
- HOW CAN SOMEONE AS
SMART AS YOU BELIEVE THAT?

220
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,833
- BECAUSE THE JUST PRINCIPLES
ON WHICH HIS ACTIONS

221
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,375
ARE BASED RING CLEAR AS DAY!

222
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,208
LORD KEIRO HAS RISKED
HIS OWN LIFE TIME AND AGAIN

223
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,666
TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED
PROSPERITY OF THE EMPIRE.

224
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,833
- Taiga: LET IT BE KNOWN TO ALL.

225
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,708
LADY TAKI IS NOW
EMPRESS OF THE REALM.

226
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:14,125
SHE IS MY WIFE.
LORD KEIRO MY SECOND FATHER.

227
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,458
HAVE THEY YOUR ABSOLUTE
AND UNWAVERING DEVOTION?

228
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,791
- All: LORD!

229
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,541
- KEIRO.

230
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,708
- LORD?

231
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,041
- YOUR ACTS OF LOYALTY
ARE BEYOND NUMBER.

232
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,083
FROM THIS MOMENT ON YOUR STATION
WILL BE MUCH KINDER.

233
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,666
- DOES YOUR MAJESTY
SEE NO MORE NEED FOR ME?

234
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,666
- THAT IS HARDLY THE CASE. YOUR
DUTY AS FATHER IS PARAMOUNT.

235
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,458
I DESIRE NOTHING SO MUCH AS YOUR
CONTINUED VIGIL AT OUR SIDE.

236
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,541
- YOUR GENEROSITY TRULY KNOWS
NO BOUNDS, MY LIEGE.

237
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,708
- Shokaku: GOOD EVENING.

238
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,833
ARE WE STILL AT AN IMPASSE
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

239
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,416
I'M TO BE TRUSTED?

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
- DO NOT PRESUME YOUR STATUS AS
ONE OF THE FIVE DIVINE WARRIORS

241
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,583
GRANTS YOU ANY SPECIAL CREDENCE
WITH ME, DOCTOR.

242
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,708
IN POINT OF FACT, IT DOES VERY
LITTLE BUT MITIGATE MY TRUST.

243
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,625
- I SEE.

244
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,750
HOW DOES A WOMAN SO CUNNING
COME TO BELIEVE A SIMPLE DOCTOR

245
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,166
TO BE A THREAT?

246
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,625
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WHY IS NOT LORD KEIRO'S DECISION

247
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,291
TO PLACE ME AT HIS HEEL
ENOUGH TO QUELL YOUR FEAR?

248
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,791
FOR ANYONE WITH EYES TO SEE,

249
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,708
IT'S PLAIN ENOUGH THAT
YOU LOVE THE MAN.

250
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,000
HIS LORDSHIP KEEPS ME
IN SIGHT TO ENSURE

251
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,500
I PLAY MY ROLE IN THIS
GRAND GAME TO HIS LIKING.

252
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,916
NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS.

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,541
HE'S LEERY ENOUGH OF ME
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

254
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,000
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
HE TRUSTS.

255
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,125
- AM I?

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,875
- ( coughing )

257
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,041
FORGIVE MY CONDITION.

258
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,875
- ARE YOU ILL?

259
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,916
- FAR BEYOND IT, I FEAR.

260
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,750
FAR BEYOND.

261
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,750
AND WITH WHAT LITTLE TIME
I HAVE LEFT,

262
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,375
I INTEND TO FOLLOW MY STAR.

263
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,208
- VERY WELL.

264
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,416
WHAT I DARE NOT DO THE WASTAGES
OF FLESH APPEAR PRONE

265
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,041
TO DO IN MY STEAD.

266
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,541
- QUITE.

267
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,208
- CROSS ME, HOWEVER, AND I WILL
NOT SHRINK FROM HASTENING

268
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,166
THEIR EFFECTS SUBSTANTIALLY.

269
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,041
- MY LOYALTY TO THE EMPIRE,
MADAM, IS ABSOLUTELY GENUINE.

270
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,791
YOU NEEDN'T TEST MY FIDELITIES
ANY MORE THAN YOU WOULD RYUKO'S.

271
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,750
- THAT THE LAD HAS CHOSEN TO
PLACE HIMSELF UNDER

272
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,916
KEIRO'S PROTECTION
DEFIES BELIEF.

273
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,208
- IF DESTINY COMPELS
HIM TO JOIN THE RANKS

274
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,541
OF THE XUAN LANG PLATOON,
IT IS NOT FOR US TO JUDGE.

275
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,416
UNDERSTAND HE REGARDS THE
CELESTIAL REALM GRAVELY ENOUGH

276
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,833
TO SHIFT TEMPORAL LOYALTIES
AT THE BAT OF AN EYE.

277
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,666
- Taito: WHO CARES IF KEIRO'S
THE EMPEROR'S FATHER-IN-LAW NOW?

278
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,375
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?

279
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,250
- WHAT DIFFERENCE?

280
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,083
ANY ADVERSARIAL ACT
TAKEN AGAINST KEIRO WILL BE SEEN

281
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,041
AS AN ACT OF SEDITION,
TO BE AT ENMITY WITH HIM

282
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,583
IS TO BE AT ENMITY
WITH THE XIAN EMPIRE.

283
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,041
YOU MUST STAND DOWN.

284
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,041
- SO, I TAKE IT
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY

285
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,708
KEIRO'S GOODWILL AMBASSADOR?

286
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,166
- I WON'T DEIGN TO ARGUE
THE POINT WITH A COMMON THUG.

287
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,500
- HEY, LET'S NOT GET HOSTILE.

288
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,625
- ENOUGH.

289
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,916
LORD KEIRO IS VITAL
TO THE EMPIRE!

290
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,041
HE IS THE ONLY HOPE OF LIFTING
ITS PEOPLE OUT OF THE MUD!

291
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,541
I WON'T ALLOW ALKAID'S
UNFETTERED BLOODLUST

292
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,541
TO SABOTAGE HIM!

293
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,875
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

294
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,833
- SO THIS IS ALL FOR
THE GREATER GOOD, HUH?

295
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:24,625
I SEE YOUR POINT. THE EMPIRE
SURE CAN'T GO ON THE WAY IT HAS.

296
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,500
BUT STILL...

297
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,250
IF A MURDERER LIKE KEIRO
IS ITS ONLY HOPE,

298
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,583
THEN MAYBE WHEN IT'S ALL SAID
AND DONE

299
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,833
THE EMPIRE DOESN'T
DESERVE TO PROSPER!

300
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,208
- DAMN IT!

301
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,750
- THEN JUST WHAT EXACTLY
DOES IT DESERVE?

302
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,666
- WHY TURN AWAY FROM TAIGA?

303
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,041
HE NEEDS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE!

304
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,375
HE MADE A PROMISE TO ME
THAT HE WOULD PUT THINGS RIGHT!

305
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,416
- HIS MAJESTY HASN'T THE POWER
TO HOLD TO THAT PROMISE!

306
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,458
- YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF!

307
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,125
HE'LL KEEP TO HIS WORD
EVEN IF IT COSTS HIM HIS LIFE!

308
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,500
- DON'T ALWAYS ASSUME
THE BEST IN PEOPLE.

309
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,000
EVEN IF HE WAS IN EARNEST,

310
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,250
THE FACT REMAINS NOT A
SINGLE MEANINGFUL CHANGE

311
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,125
HAS TAKEN SHAPE UNDER HIS RULE!

312
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,166
- YOU'RE WRONG!

313
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,000
HE'S CHANGED HIS OUTLOOK,

314
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,000
HE HAS FAITH IN HIMSELF
TO DO GOOD NOW,

315
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,250
AND I INTEND TO HELP HIM!

316
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,291
- A COUNTRY DOESN'T ENDURE
ON THE SELF-ESTEEM

317
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,708
OF ITS FAILED LEADER!

318
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,791
GOOD, GENUINE GOOD,
IS A FUNCTION OF POWER.

319
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,041
- AND I GUESS THAT'S WHERE
KEIRO COMES IN?

320
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,041
- INDEED. ANY OTHER CHOICE
WOULD BE NAIVE.

321
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,166
- YOU BASTARD!

322
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,166
( yelling )

323
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,291
- TAITO, NO!

324
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,833
- WHY WON'T YOU SEE?

325
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,708
THIS LAND'S PITIFUL
STATE BEGS FOR POWER

326
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,375
THE MAGNITUDE OF LORD KEIRO!

327
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,333
HIS BRUTALITY IS BUT THE OUTWARD
ARM OF A DEEPER WISDOM!

328
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,458
- WHAT KIND OF WISDOM
REVELS IN THE MISERIES OF

329
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,958
THE INNOCENT AND OPPRESSED?

330
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,791
- PEACE OBTAINED BY ANY OTHER
MEANS IS A HOUSE OF CARDS!

331
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,416
IF WE DESIRE LASTING PEACE,
WE MUST BE WILLING

332
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,625
TO PAY THE PRICE!

333
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,250
- AND JUST WHO THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE

334
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,833
TO COLLECT ON THAT DEBT?

335
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,958
SOMEONE SELF-RIGHTEOUS ENOUGH
TO BURN THE LIAN TONG TEMPLE?

336
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,166
( grunting )

337
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,083
- DON'T PRESUME
TO PASS JUDGMENT ON ME.

338
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,000
YOUR ONLY CARE IS FOR REVENGE!

339
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,541
- THAT'S A LIE! I USE MY
POWER TO DEFEND PEOPLE,

340
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,125
NOT TO SLAUGHTER THEM!

341
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,375
I'D LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR
THE GOOD OF THIS LAND

342
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,208
IF I HAD TO, JUST LIKE MY DAD!

343
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,750
- WAIT, YOUR...
YOUR FATHER IS DEAD?

344
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,875
- YOU BASTARDS... KILLED HIM!

345
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,166
- ( rumbling )

346
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,833
- I'M AFRAID IT'S TRUE.
FATHER'S GONE.

347
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,333
- I AM SORRY.

348
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,708
HOWEVER, FOR WHAT SMALL
CONSOLATION IT MIGHT BE

349
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,041
WORTH TO YOU,

350
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,833
HE'S HELPED LAY THE FOUNDATION
FOR A NEW EMPIRE.

351
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,875
- YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT.

352
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,458
HE FELL
TO YOUR NEW MASTER'S WHIM.

353
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,083
THE FOUNDATION OF
HIS RULE IS SLAUGHTER!

354
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,250
EMPEROR TAIGA WANTS TO END
ALL THE BLOODSHED.

355
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,875
I KNOW IN MY HEART OF HEARTS
THAT'S TRUE.

356
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,041
BECAUSE HE AND I ARE BROTHERS!

357
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,375
- ( gasping )

358
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,708
- OH-KAY, THAT'S IT.

359
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,416
TAITO'S MOST DEFINITELY
GONE OFF THE DEEP END NOW.

360
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,708
I MEAN, THAT CAN'T BE TRUE!

361
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,416
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS NUTS.

362
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,208
- HIS MAJESTY...
SO THEN...

363
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,791
- THE SKIES MAY DARKEN AND THE
HEAVENS MAY FALL UPON US,

364
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,000
BUT YOUR EMPEROR IS
HERE TO BE YOUR SHEPHERD.

365
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,208
WHATEVER WICKEDNESS MAY COME,
I WILL PROTECT MY PEOPLE!

366
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,791
- YOU'RE HIS TWIN!

367
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,791
- DOES THIS MOVE
STRIKE YOU PRUDENT?

368
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,250
MIZAR WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY
DENY YOU THE PLEASURE

369
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,833
OF FIGHTING WITH ALKAID.

370
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:30,125
- THEN FATE WILL HAVE DENIED ME,
AND ALL WILL BE AS IT SHOULD.

371
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,166
- SUCH EXALTED SENTIMENTS.

372
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,333
ONE WONDERS IF YOU'LL COME TO
REGRET YOUR RELIANCE ON THEM.

373
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,458
- REGRET IS FOR THE HOPEFUL.

374
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,791
- COME WITH ME.

375
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,833
ALIGN YOURSELF TO LORD KEIRO.

376
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,125
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

377
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,541
- YOU'VE DRAWN
THE SWORD OF RULE.

378
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,166
THE HEAVENS HAVE
NAMED YOU THE EMPEROR.

379
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,208
CLAIM YOUR BIRTHRIGHT.
ASCEND TO THE THRONE,

380
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,708
DEPOSE TAIGA AND ACCEPT KEIRO
AS ENVOY TO A GLORIOUS REIGN!

381
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,375
- THIS IS MADNESS.

382
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,625
- IT CAN WORK.

383
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,583
YOU BOTH TOIL TOWARD
THE SAME ENDS.

384
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,250
TOGETHER YOU WILL BE
AN INSURMOUNTABLE FORCE!

385
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,625
AGREE NOT TO ENGAGE HIM IN
BATTLE AND I SHALL INDEED

386
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:07,458
BE HIS LORDSHIP'S
GOODWILL AMBASSADOR!

387
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,166
YOU MUST BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY
HE YEARNS FOR PEACE EVERY BIT

388
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,791
AS SINGLE-MINDEDLY AS DO YOU.

389
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,125
HE WILL EXTEND
THE OLIVE BRANCH GLADLY!

390
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,000
- TAITO...
- YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?

391
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,875
BY NO STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION
DO WE TOIL TOWARD THE SAME ENDS.

392
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,625
- VERY WELL.

393
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:26,000
IF YOU WILL NOT LEAVE THE PATH
OF PETTY RETRIBUTION AND HATE,

394
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:30,583
NOR UNTANGLE ITS CONTOURS FROM
YOUR DESIRE TO HEAL THIS LAND,

395
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,875
THEN THE CAST OF MY SACRED DUTY
IS ALL TOO OBVIOUS.

396
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,416
( grunting )

397
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,166
IT IS NOT YOUR PLACE
TO INTERVENE!

398
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,541
- GET A GRIP!

399
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,916
IF YOU COULD HEAR THE WORDS
YOU'RE SAYING AS CLEARLY

400
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,083
AS WE DO, YOU'D BE ASHAMED!

401
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,333
- HOW CAN YOU STAND
IN JUDGMENT UPON ME?

402
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,208
WE ARE EACH OF US
MEMBERS OF THE FIVE!

403
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,291
- SO WE SHOULD ALL BE
KEIRO'S BLOODHOUNDS?

404
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,791
- HOW DARE...

405
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,791
- I THINK I UNDERSTAND NOW
WHY YOU HAVE SUCH A REPUTATION

406
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,416
FOR GETTING YOURSELF LOST.

407
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,166
- RYUKO, WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS
DEAL ONLY IN BARREN EXTREMES?

408
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,125
- EXTREMES, ARE THEY?

409
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,750
YOU SOUND AS THOUGH THE
RIGHT-THINKING MAN HAS A CHOICE.

410
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,791
- BUT SURELY THE
RIGHT-THINKING MAN

411
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,708
IS STILL FREE TO
ATTEND HIS HEART.

412
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,916
- HIS HEART IS NO LONGER
YOUR CONCERN.

413
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,708
TAITO, CONSIDER
MY OFFER CAREFULLY.

414
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,000
I'LL ONLY WAIT FOR SO LONG.

415
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,500
- ( crying )

416
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:34,250
ALL I WANTED WAS TO SEE HIM
AGAIN, BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

417
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,000
- HE'S NOT HIMSELF.

418
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,000
- AND SO WALKS A MAN ALONE.

419
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,666
TRY THOUGH HE MIGHT TO SWATHE IT
IN SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS,

420
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,458
THE HOLLOW WHERE
HIS HEART ONCE BEAT IS RAW.

421
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,250
A BLEEDING ECHO CHAMBER.

422
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,166
- HE'S A CALLOUS SON OF A BITCH!

423
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,625
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
RYUKO'S NO LONGER HIMSELF.

424
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,916
- ( continues crying )

425
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,833
- WHY?

426
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,416
( grunting )

427
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:04,000
( shouts ) WHY?

428
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,458
- ( theme song playing )

429
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,791
- Koyo: DUBHE'S MACHINATIONS
CHIP AWAY AT THE XIAN EMPIRE.

430
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:41,958
- Hosei: IF WE DON'T
DO SOMETHING,

431
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,500
THE BASTARD'S AS
GOOD AS CROWNED.

432
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,583
- Koyo: DAMN IT ALL! WE MAY
ALREADY BE TOO LATE TO STOP HIM!

433
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,208
- WITH THE POWER I NOW HOLD,

434
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,916
THE VERY HEAVENS SHALL
SUBMIT TO MY WILL!

435
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,875
- TAKE THE SWORD AND RULE AS A
GOD ON EARTH! A WARRIOR GOD!

436
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,666
- I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU. NO!

437
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,000
- Koyo: NEXT ON HERO TALES,

438
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,041
LIGHTNING RIPS
THROUGH THE DARKENING SKY,

439
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,500
IN CHAPTER TWENTY,
"THE TURMOIL BEGINS."

440
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,125
- YOU WANT IT THAT BAD?
COME AND GET IT!
