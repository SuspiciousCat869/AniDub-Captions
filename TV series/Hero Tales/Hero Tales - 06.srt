1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,125
- Taito: WELL, THIS IS SCENIC.

2
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,041
WHY IS IT I GET THE FEELING
EVERY TIME WE LISTEN TO YOU,

3
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,791
WE'LL WIND UP
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

4
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,708
- AH, QUIT CRYING, YOU BIG BABY.

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,541
A REAL MAN WOULD SUCK IT UP AND
KEEP HIS EYES ON THE ROAD AHEAD.

6
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,541
- A REAL MAN WOULD'VE GOTTEN US
TO THE CAPITAL BY NOW.

7
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,958
YOU KNOW, TEN WHOLE DAYS EARLIER
THAN THE NORMAL ROUTE

8
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,458
LIKE YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA DO?

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,875
- MY FRIEND, YOU HAVE REALLY
GOTTA LEARN TO LIGHTEN UP.

10
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,125
LAST THING THE LADIES
WANNA DEAL WITH IS A WHINER.

11
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,541
RIGHT, LAILA, SWEETHEART?

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,916
- COULD WE ALL JUST
KEEP MOVING ALONG, PLEASE?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,208
- NOW YOU SEE THERE?
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,583
- HOSEI. REMIND ME,
EXACTLY HOW MUCH FURTHER?

15
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,916
- OH, YOU KNOW.
ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO, I'D SAY.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,125
( chuckles )

17
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,750
IF WE'RE LUCKY.

18
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,000
- THAT BEING THE CASE I'D REALLY
LIKE TO TURN BACK NOW.

19
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,458
- Hosei: ( chuckling ) AW,
LOVE-CAKES. YOU'RE SO SCARED!

20
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,041
IT'S SO CUTE!

21
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,041
- Taito: THAT'S IT!

22
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,125
I'M THROWING YOU
OFF THIS MOUNTAIN!

23
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,833
- ( theme song playing )

24
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,666
- Taito: A SHORTCUT
TO THE CAPITAL. RIGHT.

25
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,125
- Hosei: HEY,
WILL YOU TRUST ME ALREADY?

26
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,500
I KNOW THESE PARTS
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

27
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,791
THERE'S NOT A BACK ROAD
AROUND HERE

28
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,333
THAT HASN'T SEEN MY BOOT HEELS.

29
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,625
THE WAY I'LL TAKE YOU
WILL GET US THERE

30
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,791
TEN DAYS QUICKER.

31
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,000
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THEN LET'S DO IT!

32
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,541
- TALK ABOUT A ONE-TRACK MIND.

33
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,083
"YOU'VE GOTTA GET ME
TO THE CAPITAL NOW."

34
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,208
"I WANNA GO TO THE CAPITAL."

35
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,958
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
YOU KNOW.

36
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,208
WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.

37
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,333
( laughs )

38
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,791
LAILA, SPEAKING OF MINDS,

39
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,541
HAVE YOU CHANGED YOURS
ABOUT ME YET?

40
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,833
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

41
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,625
- EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ATTITUDE
YOU'RE GIVING OFF IS CUTE.

42
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,458
- OKAY, SO ANYWAY,

43
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,375
IF YOU CAN GET US
TO THE CAPITAL THAT QUICKLY,

44
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,958
I'M ALL FOR IT.

45
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,833
THE SOONER MOUSTACHE AND ME ARE
LOOKING EACH OTHER EYE TO EYE,

46
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,541
THE BETTER FOR EVERYONE.

47
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,958
- ALL RIGHT.
JUST LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME!

48
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,083
- FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

49
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,875
EVERYTHING OUT OF
YOUR MOUTH HAS BEEN A LIE.

50
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,250
YOU'VE BEEN LEADING US
TO YOUR MASTER'S PLACE

51
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,583
THIS WHOLE TIME
AND I WAS DUMB ENOUGH

52
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,208
TO FALL FOR IT
'CAUSE THE ONLY WAY THAT I...

53
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,833
( shouts )

54
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,416
- HEY, I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO!

55
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,958
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GUYS
WOULD'VE COME ALONG

56
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,458
IF I'D TOLD YOU
WHERE WE WERE REALLY GOING.

57
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,916
I MEAN, GIVE ME A BREAK.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,916
I COULDN'T BEAR PARTING WAYS
WITH MY DEAR, SWEET LAILA

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,041
SO SOON!

60
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,541
- REMIND ME
WHY I SHOULD GIVE A DAMN!

61
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,166
- LOWER YOUR VOICE, TAITO.

62
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,291
HE'S ACQUIRED THE WEAPON
MEANT FOR HIM AS INSTRUCTED.

63
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,875
SO, HE'S OBLIGED TO REPORT BACK
TO HIS MASTER.

64
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,250
- GOOD FOR HIM!

65
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,416
IS HE ALSO OBLIGED TO
MAKE SURE WE ALL TAG ALONG?

66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,416
- SO, UH, HOSEI, YOU TOLD US
THIS MASTER OF YOURS

67
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,416
WAS PRETTY MEAN.

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,000
WAS THAT A FIB TOO
OR IS OUR GOING

69
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,833
A WHOLE "SAFETY IN NUMBERS"
KIND OF THING?

70
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,458
- IT'S TRUE. MEAN DOESN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HER.

71
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,666
SHE'S A BEAST!

72
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,833
- REALLY, HOSEI!

73
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,333
THAT IS NO WAY TO SPEAK
ABOUT YOUR MASTER!

74
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,625
- OH, SURE, THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY, MAN.

75
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,500
YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA
WHAT SHE'S LIKE!

76
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,875
( panicked cry )

77
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,166
SHE'D TAKE BEING CALLED A BEAST
A COMPLIMENT!

78
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,083
IF SHE THOUGHT
I'D FOUND THE SHUANG CHAN BOW

79
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,083
AND GONE TO THE CAPITAL
WITHOUT TELLING HER FIRST,

80
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,000
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW
WHAT SHE'D DO TO ME.

81
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,500
- Demon Koei: HOSEI!

82
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,458
WHY DID YOU NOT RETURN
TO ME DIRECTLY

83
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,875
AFTER OBTAINING THE BOW,
YOU VILE LITTLE WORM?

84
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,250
- ( Hosei screams )

85
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,916
I'M SORRY, BENEVOLENT MASTER!
PLEASE HAVE MERCY!

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,333
- YOU DARE BEG FOR MERCY?

87
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,708
( roars angrily )

88
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,750
- ( screams )

89
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,250
AND THAT'S HER IN A GOOD MOOD,
BELIEVE ME.

90
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,208
- DON'T BE SILLY! COME ON.

91
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,958
- MOCK MY PAIN, BUT YOU'LL SEE
FOR YOURSELVES SOON ENOUGH!

92
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,291
WHENEVER SHE STOMPS HER FEET,
THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE.

93
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,916
WHEN SHE RAISES HER VOICE,
BIRDS FALL OUT OF THE SKY.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,166
SHE CAN CUT DOWN A WHOLE FOREST
WITH HER BARE HANDS.

95
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,583
SHE EMPTIES A BOTTLE OF SAKE
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

96
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,708
HER MAKEUP IS THICK,
AND SHE SNORES LIKE A MAN.

97
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,250
- YEAH, YOU PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
STARTED THAT LIST IN REVERSE.

98
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,416
- RETURNING TO HER IS THE LAST
THING IN THE WORLD I WANT TO DO,

99
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,958
BUT WHAT CHOICE DOES A POOR
YOUNG LAD LIKE ME REALLY HAVE?

100
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,541
OH, LAILA!
- ( Taito cries in fear )

101
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,916
- IF ONLY YOU AND I COULD
SOMEHOW RUN AWAY TOGETHER.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,416
BUT SHE WOULD TRACK US DOWN.

103
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,791
WE WOULD BE
CRUELLY RIPPED APART...

104
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,583
- HEY! JERK,
GET YOUR FILTHY PAWS OFF HER!

105
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,750
- IDIOT. WE'RE HAVING
A TENDER MOMENT!

106
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,708
- IF YOU CALL ME THAT
ONE MORE TIME...

107
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,208
- WATCH IT.

108
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,458
FINE! HOW ABOUT
I JUST CALL YOU MORON?

109
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,750
SHUT UP! YOU GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY TO ME, TOUGH GUY,

110
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,500
YOU SAY IT TO MY FACE!

111
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,541
- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.
THAT'S WHAT HE JUST DID.

112
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,916
( arguing )

113
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,583
- THIS MUST BE THE PLACE.

114
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,833
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

115
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,708
REMEMBER, YOU SWORE AN OATH.

116
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,833
PAY ATTENTION. WE'RE ABOUT
TO HAVE STORIES TO LAST US

117
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,375
THE REST OF OUR JOURNEY.

118
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,875
ASSUMING I SURVIVE
INTRODUCING YOU.

119
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,000
- WOW. THE POOR GUY'S REALLY
PETRIFIED OF HER, ISN'T HE?

120
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,958
I'M ACTUALLY STARTING TO FEEL
A LITTLE NERVOUS MYSELF.

121
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,250
- ME, TOO.

122
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,208
- Hosei: MASTER, I'VE RETURNED!

123
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,458
- YOU'RE BACK!
- ( all gasp )

124
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,583
- OH, I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU!

125
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,916
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW EXHAUSTED YOU MUST BE.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,750
YOU DIDN'T GET HURT, DID YOU?

127
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,083
MY, YOU'VE GROWN!
I'LL BET YOU'RE STARVING. RIGHT?

128
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,583
- MASTER! STOP IT, PLEASE!

129
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,833
- SORRY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
LET ME GUSH FOR A LITTLE BIT.

130
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,958
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
MY FAVORITE PUPIL RETURNS

131
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,250
FROM A DANGEROUS MISSION.

132
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,500
YOU ARE EVEN MORE ADORABLE
THAN WHEN YOU LEFT!

133
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,708
- MASTER, THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET.

134
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:39,833
- WAIT, WHAT?

135
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,666
OH, DEAR!

136
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,041
( giggles )

137
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,250
WELCOME TO MY HOME.

138
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,791
- THIS IS HER? TOTALLY NOT
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

139
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,541
- I THINK HE MIGHT'VE BEEN...
- COMPLETELY FULL OF CRAP?

140
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,916
- PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
JUST CALL ME KOEI, IF YOU LIKE.

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,291
YOU MUST BE LAILA AND TAITO FROM
THE LIAN TONG TEMPLE, CORRECT?

142
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,083
AND THAT MAKES YOU RYUKO
FROM THE TONG YO TEMPLE.

143
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,666
- NO OFFENSE, MA'AM, BUT HOW
DO YOU KNOW WHO WE ARE?

144
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,166
- AH, WELL, I HEARD WORD OF
MASTER SONNEI SUMMONING RYUKO.

145
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,708
AND THAT THE THREE OF YOU
SET OUT TOGETHER

146
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,625
ON A JOURNEY
TOWARDS THE CAPITAL.

147
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,083
CONSIDERING HOW THE STARS
HAVE BEEN MOVING AS OF LATE,

148
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,750
IT WAS REALLY ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

149
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,833
BEFORE YOUR PATHS CROSSED
WITH THAT OF MY BELOVED HOSEI.

150
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,916
- Both: OH.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,291
- YOU ARE KNOWN AS
YIYANG'S FOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE.

152
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,000
ONE CAN SEE THE NAME IS JUST.

153
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,375
I AM AT YOUR SERVICE, MY LADY.

154
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,375
- OH, MY!

155
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,083
FLATTERY WILL
GET YOU EVERYWHERE!

156
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,291
HOSEI, DARLING,

157
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,583
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO HAVE MADE ME OUT

158
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,416
TO BE SOME KIND OF CRAZY,
SADISTIC DEMON WOMAN

159
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,916
TO YOUR NEW FRIENDS,
NOW WOULD YOU?

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,666
- I MAY HAVE PAINTED
A SOMEWHAT VIVID PICTURE,

161
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,291
BUT IT WAS TRUE TO LIFE.

162
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,791
I MEAN, IT WAS ONLY FAIR
THAT I PREPARE THEM

163
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,166
FOR MEETING THE HAG BEAST!

164
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,750
- WHY, YOU VILE BOY!

165
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,833
THAT YOU WOULD EVEN ASSOCIATE
SUCH A HORRIBLE IMAGE

166
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,875
WITH A DELICATE
YOUNG FLOWER LIKE ME!

167
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,500
- DELICATE AND YOUNG, HUH?

168
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,500
EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU'RE TURNING 39 THIS YEAR!

169
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,500
- KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!

170
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,208
- HOW MANY LAYERS OF MAKEUP
DO YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE

171
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,416
TO LOOK 38?

172
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,583
- "HOW MANY"?
YOU BED-WETTING LITTLE BRAT!

173
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,875
ONE MORE WORD AND I...

174
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,333
I WILL MAKE YOU CUT FIREWOOD
WITH YOUR TEETH!

175
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,625
- HEY, THE REAL YOU
IS COMING UP FOR SOME AIR.

176
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,875
BETTER PEEL BACK A FACE OR TWO
SO THE OLD GAL CAN ACTUALLY

177
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,166
BREAK THE SURFACE.

178
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,583

THREE TO TAKE BACK

179
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,916
WHAT YOU JUST SAID!

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,583
- KINDA HARD TO BUY THEM
AS MASTER AND PUPIL, HUH?

181

REGIMEN BEGINS AT DUSK.

HE SEEKS AN AUDIENCE.

OF THE REBELLION?

A BOY EMPEROR AND
THE DAUGHTER

NO DOUBT YOU LABORED TIRELESSLY
TO SEE TO IT THAT BALANCE

OFF THE GROUND
AFTER SHE'S SMACKED YOU ONE.

287

289

GET READY FOR THE BEATING
OF YOUR LIFE.

SHALL WE?

ALL RIGHT, NOW THIS TIME,

298
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,875
LET'S TRY IT
WITHOUT A WEAPON PER SE.

- ( Ryuko gasps )

300
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,041
LADY KOEI,
IT'S FAR TOO DANGEROUS!

301
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,708
WITHOUT SOMETHING TO ACT
AS A CONDUIT,

302
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,875
HIS BODY MAY NOT WITHSTAND
THAT KIND OF ENERGY!

303
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,583
- JUST WAIT AND SEE.
NOW THE OBJECT HERE, TAITO,

304
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,791
IS TO TRY
NOT BREAKING THE ARMBAND.

305
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,708
- RIGHT, WELL, I'LL TRY.

306
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,333
( guttural groan )

307
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,666
- TAKE IT EASY, LAD.

308
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,250
CHANNELING'S ALL ABOUT FOCUS,
NOT STRENGTH.

309
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,500
LOOSEN UP A BIT.

310
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,291
GOOD, NOW CLOSE YOUR EYES.

311
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,208
TRY TO VISUALIZE YOUR ARM
AS A KIND OF SOFT TUBE.

312
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,500
- A SOFT TUBE, YOU GOT IT.

313
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,166
- ( both gasp )

314
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,291
- ( gasps )

315
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,125
- I DON'T INTEND
TO HOLD BACK, TAITO.

316
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,333
( yells )

317
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,333
THAT WAS EXCELLENTLY DONE!
LOOK AT YOUR ARM!

318
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,166
- I... I DIDN'T BREAK THE BAND.

319
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,625
AND I THREW THAT PUNCH
WITH EVERYTHING I HAD, TOO.

320
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,291
YOU SEE NOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ENERGY AND STRENGTH?

321
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,750
WHEN CHANNELED PROPERLY,
ENERGY IS INEXHAUSTIBLE.

322
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,958
- BUT, LADY KOEI,
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

323
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,166
- IT'S QUITE
STRAIGHTFORWARD, REALLY.

324
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,000
YOU SEE, OUR YOUNG FRIEND HERE
POSSESSES WHAT THE ANCIENTS

325
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,500
CALLED AN INNER RESERVOIR.

326
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,708
- AN INNER WHAT?

327
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,750
- AND DOES THIS INNER RESERVOIR
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

328
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,916
WITH THE EIGHTH STYLE
LONG BELIEVED TO BE LOST?

329
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,416
- YES. THE STRICTLY WEAPON-BASED
STYLES YOU AND HOSEI ADOPT

330
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,416
UTILIZE OUTER RESERVOIRS.

331
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,708
YOU CAN'T CHANNEL WITHOUT
AN OBJECT, IN OTHER WORDS,

332
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,750
BUT TAITO IS CAPABLE OF USING
HIS BODY AS YOU DO YOUR STAFF.

333
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,958
IT'S QUITE A TALENT TO HAVE,
BELIEVE YOU ME.

334
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,916
AND IT WILL TAKE A GREAT DEAL
OF TRAINING TO MASTER.

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,875
BUT IF YOU CAN CALL TO MEMORY
HOW IT FELT TO DO THIS ONCE,

336
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,166
YOU WILL GET THERE EVENTUALLY.

337
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,166
- THANK YOU
FOR SHOWING ME, KOEI.

338
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,708
- WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

339
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,625
YOU BEAT ME TO A PULP
IF I SO MUCH AS BAT AN EYE

340
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,083
BUT YOU'RE SOFT ON THIS CLOD?

341
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,166
- WORDS ABSOLUTELY FAIL
TO GRASP THE DEPTHS OF

342
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,541
YOUR INSIGHT, LADY KOEI.

343
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,416
YOU ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT
ONE OF THE FINEST TEACHERS

344
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,625
I'VE SEEN.

345
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,416
- YOU REALLY ARE IN A LEAGUE
ALL BY YOURSELF!

346
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,750
- OH, STOP IT!
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME!

347
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,041
( giggles )

348
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,125
- HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?

349
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,500
I'M THE ONE WHO
DID ALL THE WORK HERE!

350
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,625
- TAITO. YOU HAVE TO
MAKE A SOLEMN PROMISE.

351
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,250
PLEASE UNDERSTAND, CHANNELING
FROM AN INNER RESERVOIR IS AS

352
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,208
HAZARDOUS AS IT IS BENEFICIAL.

353
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,791
ONE'S MIND MUST BE CALM
AND TRANQUIL AND ONE'S SPIRIT

354
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,958
ABSOLUTELY DISPASSIONATE
BEFORE YOU DARE PUT IT TO USE.

355
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,041
NEVER, EVER,
EVEN AS A LAST RESORT,

356
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,916
VENTURE TO CHANNEL WHILE
IN THE THROES OF ANGER.

357
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,708
PROMISE YOU WON'T.

358
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,125
- UH... OKAY.
- WOW, TAITO.

359
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,541
I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU AGREE
TO ANYTHING SO FAST.

360
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,666
I DON'T THINK I KNOW
THIS SIDE OF YOU!

361
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,791
- SHE ASKED ME TO PROMISE!
YOU GOT AN ISSUE WITH THAT?

362
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,625
- IT IS SOMEWHAT BIZARRE.

363
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,625
- SO, WHAT? I CAN'T AGREE
TO SOMETHING IF I FEEL LIKE IT?

364
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,333
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS CRAP.

365
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,625
- Ryuko, Taito and Laila:
THANK YOU FOR THE MEAL!

366
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,041
- MAN, THAT WAS GOOD GRUB!

367
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,958
I SWEAR, THERE MUST BE NOTHING
YOU CAN'T DO!

368
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,416
- I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

369
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,041
- YOU ARE SO LUCKY TO GET TO EAT
LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME!

370
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,458
IF YOU'D TOLD US SHE COULD COOK,
WE WOULD'VE RACED YOU HERE!

371
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,708
- YEAH. SHE FEEDS ME WELL.

372
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,000
EXCUSE ME FOR A MINUTE
WHILE I STEP OUT FOR SOME AIR.

373
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,583
- Taito: THERE'S AIR
IN THE HOUSE.

374
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,958
- PARDON HIS MANNERS.
HE DOES TEND TO SULK.

375
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,500
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

376
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,416
- IT'S BECAUSE I PRAISED
YOUR BROTHER EARLIER.

377
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,833
HE'S LIKELY UPSET
I WASN'T MORE HARSH WITH HIM.

378
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:36,166
SEE, IN HOSEI'S CASE,
I WAS STRICT FROM THE BEGINNING.

379
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,041
ONE HAS TO BE WITH CHILDREN.

380
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,458
I WAS OBLIGED TO
TAME A WILD BEAST, AS IT WERE.

381
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,083
OTHERWISE HE WOULD NEVER
HAVE LEARNED SELF-DISCIPLINE.

382
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,333
POOR BOY'S SO SENSITIVE, THOUGH.

383
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,541
- SO DOES THAT MEAN...

384
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,416
- YES. HE'S AN ORPHAN.

385
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,791
WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF HIM,

386
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,083
KNOW THAT CAVALIER EXTERIOR
HIDES A HEART OF GOLD.

387
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,291
HE CAN BE A HANDFUL, NATURALLY.

388
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,750
BUT I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU LOOKED OUT FOR HIM.

389
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,416
- HEY, WHENEVER HE NEEDS US,
WE'LL BE THERE.

390
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,333
- Laila: ISN'T SHE
JUST MARVELOUS?

391
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,708
I MEAN, SURE, MAYBE SHE'S
A LITTLE STRICT WITH HOSEI

392
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,375
AND THAT'S WHY HE TOLD US
ALL THAT STUFF,

393
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,541
BUT I THINK ON THE WHOLE

394
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,916
SHE MIGHT JUST BE
THE NEATEST PERSON

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,416
I'VE EVER MET.

396
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,291
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT OUR MOTHERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN

397
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,041
ANYTHING LIKE HER?

398
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,000
- DAMN IT. WHAT GIVES?
I KEEP BREAKING THEM.

399
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,041
SHE SAID ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS THINK OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE

400
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,375
WHEN I WAS DOING IT RIGHT.

401
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,416
- I BET IF KOEI WAS WATCHING
YOU PRACTICE,

402
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,125
SHE'D TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

403
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,875
- LOT OF GOOD I'LL BE
IF I ALWAYS NEED HER HELP.

404
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,500
WHATEVER OUR MOTHERS
MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE,

405
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,916
IF THEY'D BEEN AS SWEET AS HER,

406
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,416
CHANCES ARE WE WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ABANDONED.

407
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,458
- THAT'S NOT NICE.
- COME ON.

408
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,708
HEY, I'M GLAD THEY WEREN'T.

409
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,250
'CAUSE OTHERWISE
I WOULDN'T KNOW YOU,

410
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,750
OR DAD, OR ANYBODY
FROM TAI SHAN. GOOD NIGHT.

411
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,416
- YOU STILL BENT OUT OF SHAPE?

412
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,500
- I'M NOT BENT OUT OF SHAPE.

413
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,000
- YOU CAN BE
SO THICK-SKULLED SOMETIMES.

414
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,041
YOU KNOW THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE
REQUIRE DIFFERENT METHODS

415
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,416
OF TRAINING.

416
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,000
JUST LIKE FIGHTING,
YOU HAVE TO TAILOR YOUR METHODS

417
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,625
TO FIT THE SITUATION.

418
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,541
- YOU NEVER CHANGE
THE WAY YOU TRAIN ME.

419
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,666
STOP TRYING TO SPARE
MY FEELINGS.

420
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,875
YOU'D RATHER TAITO
WAS YOUR PUPIL.

421
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,750
- GOODNESS. NOW WHY ON EARTH
WOULD I PREFER TAITO OVER

422
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,458
MY CUTE, DARLING LITTLE HOSEI?

423
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,208
- WELL, BECAUSE... HE'S ALKAID

424
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,708
AND I'M JUST MEASLY OLD
PHECDA THE ARCHER.

425
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,625
- IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?

426
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,541
FINE, YES. ALKAID GETS PRIDE OF
PLACE AMONG THE DIPPER BEARERS,

427
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,875
I GRANT YOU.

428
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,208
BUT SO WHAT? WHY SHOULD THAT
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE

429
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,541
TO SOMEONE LIKE ME?

430
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,458
THIS CHANGES NOTHING
BETWEEN YOU AND I.

431
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,625
I WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK YOU IN.

432
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,125
I RAISED YOU, KICKED YOU,

433
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,666
BEAT YOU, SCOLDED YOU, FED YOU
AND EVENTUALLY TAUGHT YOU,

434
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,041
ALL BY CHOICE.

435
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,375
THE LEGENDS HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH MY REASON WHY.

436
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,666
- OF COURSE THE LEGENDS
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

437
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,416
BECAUSE IN THE GRAND SCHEME
OF THINGS, I'M JUST A DUMB KID.

438
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,250
- NEVER SAY THAT ABOUT YOURSELF!

439
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,833
- I CAN SEE THROUGH YOUR GAME!

440
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,916
YOU THINK TAITO'S BETTER THAN ME
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT!

441
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,458
- STUPID HAG BEAST!
- HEY, DON'T YOU RUN AWAY

442
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,500
FROM ME!

443
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,541
EVER THE WOUNDED BOY.

444
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,458
YOU REALLY NEED TO BE
MORE THICK-SKINNED THAN THIS.

445
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,791
THE STARS
ARE IN A FOUL HUMOR TONIGHT.

446
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,083
- THIS IS A BUNCH OF CRAP!
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE WITH HER?

447
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,333
GIVE ME A BREAK!

448
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,708
ALL I WANT
IS A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT

449
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,416
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN.
IS THAT TOO DAMN MUCH TO ASK?

450
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:44,125
BANDITS? WHAT THE...
HERE? NO WAY.

451
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,000
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, ALL OF YOU!

452
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,166
NOW SAY HELLO
TO KOEI'S NUMBER ONE PUPIL!

453
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,291
THIS MOUNTAIN'S DEFENDER, HOSEI!

454
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,291
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
SHE'LL ACKNOWLEDGE ME!

455
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,791
I'VE EARNED IT.

456
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,666
- WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO
BY YOURSELF AT SUCH A LATE HOUR,

457
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,666
MY LADY?

458
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,916
- TO TRY AND TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HOSEI.

459
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,541
HE THREW ONE OF HIS
LITTLE TANTRUMS EARLIER

460
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,166
AND CHARGED OFF INTO THE WOODS.

461
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,541
- PLEASE ALLOW ME THE HONOR
OF ACCOMPANYING YOU.

462
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,833
IT ISN'T SAFE TO TRAVEL ALONE
AT NIGHT.

463
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,833
- OH, I'LL BE FINE.
I KNOW THIS MOUNTAIN

464
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,500
LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND.

465
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,916
BESIDES, IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET LOST

466
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
THAN TO BE OF ANY HELP TO ME.

467
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,041
- SO YOU'VE HEARD THAT ABOUT ME,
HAVE YOU?

468
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,083
- I'M SURE I'LL BE BACK BEFORE
TOO LONG. HE'S A DIFFICULT BOY.

469
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,291
IF I DON'T TRACK HIM DOWN SOON,

470
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,083
WHO KNOWS WHAT
HE'LL GET HIMSELF INTO.

471
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,583
OH, AND A WORD OF ADVICE...

472
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,125
- YES?

473
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,916
- IT'S IMPORTANT IN LIFE TO
FOLLOW A PATH YOU BELIEVE IN,

474
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,375
BUT NOT SO IMPORTANT AS SEEING
A WAY TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

475
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,041
- EXCELLENT ADVICE INDEED.

476
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,708
YOUR SENSE OF DIRECTION
ISN'T HALF AS BAD AS

477
00:20:56,791 --> 00:21:01,791
YOU'VE CONVINCED YOURSELF IT IS.

478
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,250
- ( Hosei yells )

479
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,125
- ( grunts )

480
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,208
- HA! ONE DOWN, NINE MORE TO GO!

481
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,458
WHICH ONE OF YOU UGLY BASTARDS
IS NEXT IN LINE, HUH?

482
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:14,958
WHAT?

483
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,875
YEAH? TRY GETTIN' BACK UP
FROM THIS!

484
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,000
THE HELL IS GOING ON?

485
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,000
- Shimei: DEAR, OH DEAR. PHECDA
ALL BY HIS LONESOME AGAINST

486
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,666
A HORDE OF GROTESQUES.

487
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,750
HOW TRAGIC.

488
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,916
- WHO ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?

489
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,541
- MY FRIENDS CALL ME SHIMEI.

490
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,166
- THE HELL DO YOU WANT?

491
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,208
- SUCH A SPITFIRE.
I BELIEVE USING YOU

492
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,791
WILL BE QUITE THE ROMP.

493
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,333
- ( screams )

494
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,833
- AS THE GREAT SAGE ONCE SAID,

495
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,458
"HELL IS WHERE YOU FIND
YOUR TRUE ALLIES."

496
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,208
- ( laughs )

497
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,000
- ( theme song playing )

498
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,666
- Hosei: MASTER?

499
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,833
WOULD YOU...

500
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,458
WOULD YOU BE UPSET IF I WENT
WITH LAILA AND THE GUYS

501
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,041
TO THE CAPITAL?

502
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,416
- Koei: WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD
I BE UPSET WITH YOU FOR THAT?

503
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,125
YOU STILL HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN.

504
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,375
THE BEST REMEDY FOR THAT
IS EXPERIENCE.

505
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:53,583
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

506
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,708
- HOSEI, PROMISE ME
THAT YOU'LL TAKE CARE

507
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,208
OF TAITO AND THE OTHERS.

508
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,583
- Ryuko: NEXT ON HERO TALES,

509
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,458
"CHAPTER SEVEN:
SORROWFUL PHECDA."

510
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,125
- Hosei: I'M PROUD
YOU'RE MY MASTER.
