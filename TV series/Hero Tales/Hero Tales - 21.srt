1
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,083
- ( guttural groan )

2
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,250
- LORD KEIRO!
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER, SIR?

3
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,583
YOU'VE DRAWN IT!

4
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,291
THE SWORD OF RULE!
IT'S YOURS, MY LORD!

5
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,166
- AT LONG LAST, THE XIAN JIA LAN
WU CHOOSES ME

6
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,500
AS ITS TRUE MASTER!

7
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,375
- ( thunderclap )

8
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,541
- LORD KEIRO HAS UNSHEATHED
THE SWORD OF RULE?

9
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:56,791
- INDEED. WHAT HAD ONCE ELUDED
HIM, HE'S NOW ACCOMPLISHED.

10
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,416
BUT FOR WHAT REASON?

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,291
THE HEAVENS HAVE PLACED DUBHE
AT THE VERY AXIS OF THE EMPIRE.

12
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,833
WAS THIS DECREED BY FATE?

13
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:08,291
OR HAS KEIRO MADE FATE
ITSELF BEND TO HIS WILL?

14
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,458
- MY FATHER IS EMPEROR?

15
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,083
- ( thunderclap )

16
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,291
- ( theme song playing )

17
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,916
- ( yelling )

18
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,750
- ( chuckles )

19
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,125
- DAMN IT! THAT BASTARD!

20
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,833
I TOLD HIM IDON'T WANT
TO BE THE EMPEROR SO

21
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,583
WHY WON'T HE JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE?

22
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,000
I GUESS IF I REALLY
WANT THE ANSWER,

23
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,041
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
TO BEAT IT OUT OF HIM!

24
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,041
YOU HEAR ME?

25
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,500
- TAITO! YOU'RE JUST DOING
WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO!

26
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:15,833
- DON'T BE A FOOL, MAN!
COME BACK! TAITO!

27
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,833
- THIS LACKADAISICAL APPROACH
THE BOY IS TAKING

28
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,416
WILL NOT WORK AT ALL.

29
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,333
FATE HAS CHOSEN THEM
TO PORTRAY ADVERSARIES

30
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,125
IN THIS COSMIC DRAMA.

31
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,375
SO I AM SIMPLY MAKING SURE
THEY HIT THEIR MARKS.

32
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,083
- I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU! SHIMEI!

33
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,875
- THOSE VESTMENTS.

34
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,875
- MY LORD, PLEASE FORGIVE ME
IF I'M SPEAKING OUT OF TURN.

35
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,958
BUT THE THRONE OF THE EMPIRE
AWAITS YOUR ASCENSION

36
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,875
TO MAKE SUCH A JOURNEY TONIGHT.
ARE YOU QUITE CERTAIN IT'S WISE?

37
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,708
- THE THRONE CAN WAIT.

38
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:14,541
HOWEVER, MY ENGAGEMENT THIS
EVENING CANNOT BE POSTPONED.

39
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,000
- BUT, SIR...

40
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,000
- THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO DISSUADE ME.

41
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:24,333
- I SEE. IN THAT CASE I IMPLORE
YOU TO LET US BE YOUR ESCORT.

42
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,708
- IF YOU MUST.

43
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,958
- YES, MY LORD.

44
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,541
RYUKO, WE MUSTN'T TARRY.

45
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,291
- OF COURSE, SIR.

46
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,458
- ( panting )

47
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,500
- WAIT HERE.

48
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,416
- OF COURSE, MY LORD.

49
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,583
THE FOG HANGS THICK.

50
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,791
- ENSIGN KOCHO.
- WHAT IS IT?

51
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,333
- I CAN INFER KEIRO'S GARMENTS
HOLD SOME SIGNIFICANCE,

52
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,791
BUT WHAT?

53
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,000
- ANOTHER YEAR
HAS PASSED, CHOUSA.

54
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,416
ONE MORE SINCE OUR PARTING.

55
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,333
NEARLY A SCORE SINCE
I LAST GAZED UPON YOU.

56
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,666
- SHIMEI! STOP HIDING
AND FACE ME LIKE A MAN!

57
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,250
- THAT VOICE.

58
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,958
- SHIMEI!

59
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,333
MUSTACHE! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

60
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,791
- ALKAID.

61
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,625
- LOOKS LIKE I'M
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

62
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,375
WE'VE GOTTA SETTLE THE SCORE
RIGHT HERE AND NOW!

63
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,791
( yelling )

64
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,791
- NO BLOOD SHALL BE SPILLED
ON THESE GROUNDS.

65
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,875
- WHAT? WHY THE HELL NOT?

66
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,041
HEY, WHY'RE YOU EVEN OUT HERE
DRESSED IN THOSE PRAYER ROBES?

67
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,291
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

68
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,875
WHOSE GRAVE IS THIS?

69
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,833
- IT IS MY LATE WIFE'S.

70
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,625
SHE WAS TAKEN FROM ME.

71
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,500
MURDERED BY THE FORCES
OF OUR SACRED EMPIRE.

72
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,166
- THAT CANNOT BE.
LORD KEIRO'S WIFE WAS MURDERED?

73
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,916
- YES. A VERY TRAGIC
AND PAINFUL CHAPTER

74
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,250
IN HIS EXCELLENCY'S LIFE

75
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,583
WAS WRITTEN ON THIS DAY
MANY YEARS AGO.

76
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,333
HE COMES HERE EVERY YEAR
TO PAY HIS RESPECTS.

77
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:36,041
GOING ALONE INTO THIS FOREST,
TO PRAY FOR HER SOUL IN PEACE.

78
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,416
IT IS A SOLEMN DAY INDEED.

79
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,708
- MY MOTHER'S GRAVE
IS IN THIS FOREST?

80
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,625
- RYUKO.
- YES, SIR.

81
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,500
- YOU HAVE QUICKLY BECOME
A TRUSTED ALLY OF LORD KEIRO,

82
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,750
BUT THERE'S STILL MUCH YOU
DO NOT KNOW ABOUT HIM.

83
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,500
IT'S TIME YOU LEARNED
OF HIS PAST.

84
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,375
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
THOSE IMPERIAL ARMY BASTARDS

85
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,916
KILLED YOUR FAMILY TOO?

86
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,750
DAMN IT!

87
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,833
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

88
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,708
I FINALLY CORNER THE GUY
WHOSE ASS I WANNA KICK

89
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,208
MORE THAN ANYBODY
ELSE'S IN THE WORLD

90
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,583
AND I CAN'T BECAUSE HE'S PRAYING
AT HIS DEAD WIFE'S GRAVE.

91
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,916
EVEN I KNOW
THAT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.

92
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,791
JUST EXPLAIN ONE THING TO ME.

93
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,625
WHY DID YOU ATTACK
LIAN TONG TEMPLE AGAIN?

94
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,750
WHY THE HELL
DID YOU KILL MY FATHER?

95
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

96
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,250
- DON'T LIE! YOU KNOW!
HE'S DEAD!

97
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:37,000
YOUR GOONS BURNED DOWN LIAN TONG
AND THEY MURDERED MY FATHER!

98
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,125
- I SEE. I GAVE THEM
NO SUCH ORDERS.

99
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,500
- WHAT?

100
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,416
- SO THE LEADER OF THE QING
LONG PLATOON HAS FALLEN.

101
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,875
I'D HEARD OF HIS REPUTATION FOR
GREAT STRENGTH AND INTEGRITY.

102
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,875
BUT NOT HIS DEATH.

103
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,625
- WHAT? YOU MEAN
YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT?

104
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,291
- ALKAID, MUCH LIKE
YOUR LATE FATHER,

105
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,208
I TOO ONCE TOOK UP THE BANNER
OF THE WEAK AND DOWNTRODDEN,

106
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,125
TO SHEPHERD THEM FROM
THE EMPIRE'S UNENDING TYRANNY.

107
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,000
- WHAT?

108
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,250
- IT WOULD SEEM FATE IS NOT
WITHOUT A SENSE OF IRONY.

109
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,958
US MEETING HERE TONIGHT.

110
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:20,291
IT WAS A TIME BEFORE OUR CURRENT
FIGUREHEAD HELD THE THRONE.

111
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,208
OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO,
DURING THE REIGN OF MIYO.

112
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,333
- Kocho: LORD KEIRO HAILS
FROM LING FAWN,

113
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,041
A REMOTE REGION ON THE OUTSKIRTS
OF THE EMPIRE.

114
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,791
HE WAS THE SON OF KEITO.
A WISE AND VIRTUOUS LEADER,

115
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,416
WHO CHERISHED THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVED UNDER HIS FIEFDOM,

116
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,833
AND PASSED THESE NOBLE TRAITS
ONTO HIS SON.

117
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,500
IN TURN, BOTH MEN WERE BELOVED
AND RESPECTED BY THEIR SUBJECTS.

118
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,750
- AH, WISE LORD KEIRO!

119
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,833
- HOWEVER, THIS PEACE
WOULD NOT LAST.

120
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,375
A GOVERNOR GENERAL OF THE EMPIRE
DESIRED THIS FRUITFUL LAND,

121
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,541
AND SEIZED UPON IT
WITH UNIMAGINABLE SAVAGERY.

122
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,000
- KEIRO, MY SON.

123
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,791
THE TIME HAS COME
TO USE YOUR POWER.

124
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,166
DRAW UPON YOUR INNER RESERVOIR.

125
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,833
- FATHER, PLEASE!

126
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:21,833
- TO PROTECT OUR DEAR VILLAGERS,
YOU MUST...

127
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,166
KILL THAT MAN!

128
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,000
- ( yelling )

129
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,541
- ( yelling )

130
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,166
- NO. SPARE ME.
PLEASE, SPARE MY LIFE.

131
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,916
- YOU TOOK THE LIVES
OF EVERYONE IN MY VILLAGE,

132
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,750
MY FAMILY!

133
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,333
WHY SHOULD I SPARE YOURS?

134
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,125
- ( both yell )

135
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,875
- WHAT THE HELL? KILLING A MAN
LIKE THAT WOULD MAKE YOU

136
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:31,958
AN ENEMY OF THE EMPIRE,

137
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,500
NOT A MAJOR GENERAL.

138
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,583
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

139
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,666
FOR MANY YEARS I WORE MY OUTLAW
STATUS AS A BADGE OF HONOR

140
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,500
WHILE FIGHTING THE EMPIRE

141
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,875
AS A REBEL.

142
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,166
- Kocho: KEIRO TRAVELED ALONE,

143
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,166
FAR AND WIDE ACROSS THE LAND
UNTIL ONE DAY...

144
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,208
- ( yelling )

145
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,458
- ( groaning )

146
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,333
- ( people chattering )

147
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,166
- Kocho: THAT WAS THE DAY
HE ENCOUNTERED CHOUSA.

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,708
OVER TIME, SHE WAS
ABLE TO FILL THE VOID

149
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,791
IN HIS EXCELLENCY'S HEART

150
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:22,333
TO EASE HIS TROUBLED SOUL,
AND FOR THAT, HE TREASURED HER.

151
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,041
DURING THE COURSE
OF HIS TRAVELS,

152
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,125
HE SPARED MANY LIVES FROM
THE BLOODY ACTS OF MEN

153
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,583
SEEKING DOMINION AND POWER.

154
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,000
MANY OF THOSE HE SAVED
PLEDGED THEIR FEALTY TO HIM

155
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,500
AND FOLLOWED HIM
WHEREVER HE ROAMED.

156
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,125
TOGETHER THEY CARVED OUT
A MOUNTAIN PASS

157
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,291
AND MADE THEIR HOME UNDER
ITS AND LORD KEIRO'S PROTECTION.

158
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,916
IT WAS AT THIS TIME
HE TRAINED THE VILLAGERS

159
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,333
IN THE WAYS OF BATTLE,

160
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,875
AND ESTABLISHED THE SCHWAN LONG
PLATOON TO KEEP A VIGIL

161
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,750
AGAINST THE EMPIRE'S
ENCROACHMENT.

162
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,625
- SO YOU GAVE THEM A SAFE PLACE?

163
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,791
THAT'S WHAT FATHER
DID WITH TAI SHAN!

164
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,541
- Keiro: OUR LIVES
WERE FILLED WITH PEACE

165
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,458
AND OUT OF THAT PEACE,
A CHILD WAS BORN.

166
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,333
- ( baby cooing )

167
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:18,125
- MY SON!
I SHALL CALL YOU KEIKO, CHILD!

168
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:22,458
I WILL RAISE YOU TO BE STRONG
AND HONORABLE. I SWEAR!

169
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,041
- THAT CHILD WAS ME.

170
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,458
- FILLED WITH
A NEWFOUND SENSE OF PURPOSE,

171
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,791
LORD KEIRO SET OUT TO PURGE
THE NEARBY LANDS

172
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,166
OF CORRUPT OFFICIALS
AND DESPOTS.

173
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,333
- A PURGE?

174
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,041
- TO RESTORE HEALTH
TO THE EMPIRE,

175
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:44,291
HE SAW IT NECESSARY TO LOP OFF
ITS ROTTEN BRANCHES, AS IT WERE.

176
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:48,125
HE DID THIS SELFLESSLY AND
WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR POWER.

177
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,291
THE EMPIRE VIEWED THIS PURGE
AS AN ACT OF TREASON,

178
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,000
AND METED OUT
PUNISHMENT ACCORDINGLY.

179
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,416
- ( thunderclap )

180
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,208
- Keiro: THIS HOLOCAUST
WAS THE EMPIRE'S DOING.

181
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,833
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT
THAT I REALIZED I HAD BEEN

182
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,833
COMPLETELY WRONG IN MY THINKING.

183
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:17,000
IT WAS NOT THE BRANCHES OF
THE EMPIRE THAT WERE ROTTEN.

184
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,166
IT WAS DISEASED
FROM THE ROOTS UPWARD.

185
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:25,208
CHOUSA! KEIKO! CHOUSA!

186
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,625
CHOUSA.

187
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,458
CHOUSA! SPEAK TO ME!

188
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,166
( gasps )

189
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,541
NO! CHOUSA, PLEASE,
YOU CAN'T DIE!

190
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:04,625
I CURSED NOT ONLY THE EMPIRE
AND ITS UNYIELDING BRUTALITY,

191
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,541
BUT MY OWN INABILITY TO PROTECT
THOSE CLOSEST TO ME FROM IT.

192
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,708
MY RAGE BURNED
LIKE A THOUSAND SUNS.

193
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:22,625
WHAT HAD LAIN DORMANT WAS AT
ONCE AWOKEN. MY KARMA AS DUBHE.

194
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,458
- ( thunderclap )

195
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,583
- Kocho: IN TIMES
OF GREAT TURMOIL,

196
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,708
THE DIPPER BEARERS ARE GIVEN
THE TASK TO ACT AS BEACONS,

197
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,708
GUIDING THE PEOPLE
OUT OF DARKNESS.

198
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,916
OF THESE STARS, DUBHE'S FATE IS
TO RESTORE ORDER THROUGH FORCE.

199
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
LORD KEIRO
HAS BEEN HANDED THIS FATE.

200
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,208
THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES
HAVE DECREED THAT HE SHOULDER

201
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,250
THIS INCONCEIVABLE BURDEN.
THAT HE ALONE SHALL

202
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,416
BRING THE WORLD TO RIGHTS
BY THE SHEER FORCE OF HIS WILL.

203
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,791
( sighs )

204
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,708
ALL I KNOW ABOUT HIM IS WHAT
I'VE SHARED WITH YOU TONIGHT.

205
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,333
- THANK YOU, KOCHO.
QUITE A STORY.

206
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,916
- TELL ME. IF ALL
THAT STUFF IS TRUE ABOUT

207
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,750
WHAT THE EMPIRE DID TO YOU,

208
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,791
WHY ARE YOU WORKING
FOR THEM NOW?

209
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,916
- AFTER I BURIED CHOUSA,

210
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,125
I SURRENDERED TO
THE IMPERIAL FORCES

211
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,041
AND SWORE UNCONDITIONAL LOYALTY.

212
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,541
- YOU LET THEM WIN?

213
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,958
- YOU SEE, I KNEW IF I WOUND
MY WAY THROUGH THE RANKS,

214
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,041
I COULD TAKE CONTROL
FROM THE INSIDE.

215
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,041
REBELLIONS ARE ULTIMATELY
MEANINGLESS ACTIONS BOTH BORN

216
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:53,000
OF AND BEGETTING DESPERATION.
I WILL CONQUER THE SHAWN EMPIRE

217
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,000
BY USING THE POWER GRANTED
TO ITS MILITARY AS A FULCRUM

218
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,166
WITH WHICH TO TOPPLE IT
AND SEIZE IT FOR MY OWN.

219
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,250
THE HEAVENS HAVE CHOSEN
TO BESTOW THIS FATE UPON DUBHE,

220
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:06,125
AND THUS I AM TASKED
WITH RESTORING ORDER BY FORCE.

221
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,083
- YOU MEAN BY BLOODSHED.

222
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,375
- ( wind whooshing )

223
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,000
- I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR REASONS
FOR DOING WHAT YOU DID

224
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,000
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

225
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,541
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT

226
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,333
BY CAUSING MORE SUFFERING!

227
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,166
NEXT TIME I SEE YOU,

228
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,291
I'LL MAKE SURE TO SETTLE THE
SCORE ONCE AND FOR ALL.

229
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,541
- WAIT.

230
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,750
- FOR WHAT? WE'RE DONE HERE.

231
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,625
( gasps )

232
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,500
NO. THAT'S THE SWORD OF RULE.

233
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,708
- ( guttural groan )

234
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,958
THE SWORD HAS CHOSEN ME
AS ITS MASTER!

235
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,541
SO KNOW THAT NEXT TIME OUR PATHS
DO CROSS, YOU WILL ADDRESS ME

236
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,958
AS SON OF HEAVEN, EMPEROR KEIRO!

237
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,458
- IF I MAY ASK, SIR,

238
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,916
DO YOU HAPPEN TO
KNOW WHATEVER BECAME

239
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,458
OF HIS EXCELLENCY'S SON, KEIKO?

240
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,500
- I'M TOLD THAT
HE WAS ABANDONED.

241
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,750
- BUT WHY?

242
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,375
- THE PATH TO THE THRONE
IS A BLOOD-SOAKED ONE.

243
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,750
I CAN IMAGINE MY LORD
DID NOT WISH HIS ONLY SON

244
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,708
TO BE WASHED AWAY IN IT.

245
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,250
- BUT WHAT OF HIS DAUGHTER?
WHAT OF TAKI?

246
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,250
- THE TRUTH OF IT, LADY TAKI
IS THE CHILD OF ANOTHER MAN.

247
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,291
- WHAT?

248
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,250
- PERHAPS IT IS NOT THE WILL
OF THE HEAVENS

249
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,750
THAT THE TWO WARRIOR GODS
OF OLD ENGAGE EACH OTHER

250
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,125
IN BLOODY CONFLICT AFTER ALL.

251
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,791
- WHAT? I DIDN'T DRAG ALKAID ALL
THE WAY OUT HERE FOR DISCUSSION.

252
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,416
HOW VERY DISAPPOINTING.

253
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,375
- Choka: LIGHT THE TORCHES!

254
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,583
- THAT LIGHT.

255
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,541
- I'LL GO INVESTIGATE, SIR.

256
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,708
- THAT'S FIRE. FOR WHAT REASON?

257
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,708
- Keiro: ON MY ORDERS.

258
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,166
- LORD KEIRO!

259
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,041
- NOW THAT I'VE DRAWN
THE SHAWN GHEE LAN WU,

260
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,958
ALKAID IS NO LONGER
OF ANY USE TO ME.

261
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,916
- KEIRO!

262
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,083
- YOU RAT! ONE OF THE FIVE?

263
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,583
- INDEED!

264
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,500
- HEY! YOU KEEP THESE CLOWNS
BUSY WHILE I GO HELP TAITO!

265
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,708
- AYE-AYE!

266
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,791
- ( yelling )

267
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,583
WHAT THE HELL? BARE-HANDED?

268
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:01,666
- TIME NOW TO DIE, ALKAID.

269
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,791
- I GET IT. YOU CAN'T KILL
UNLESS YOU GET ONE OF YOUR GOONS

270
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,583
TO DO IT FOR YOU.

271
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,791
NICE TRY,
BUT YOU STILL WON'T WIN!

272
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,583
I WON'T DIE!

273
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,250
( guttural groan )

274
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,083
- ( all gasp )

275
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,041
- WHAT THE HELL?

276
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,333
- I'LL BE DAMNED. WELL, NOW,
TAITO, YOU DON'T NEED ME.

277
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,416
BYE.

278
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,000
- RAT! DAMN YOU!

279
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:14,041
- Ryuko: SO, HE'S LEARNED
TO HARNESS ALKAID'S FURY.

280
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,125
COULD THIS NEWFOUND CONTROL
LEAD TO POWER EQUALING

281
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,583
THAT OF FATHER'S?

282
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,583
- THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME.
THE GRAVE BECKONS.

283
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,833
- ( Shimei chuckles )

284
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,833
OH, HOW THEY FLAIL AND STRUGGLE,

285
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,000
LABORING UNDER THE SELF-CENTERED
DELUSION OF FREE WILL,

286
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,458
FIGHTING AGAINST FATE.

287
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,333
THE LIFE OF MORTALS
IS BRIEF AND BRUTAL.

288
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,083
BUT HOW I RELISH IN THE
SPECTACLE

289
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,083
THEIR EMPTY GESTURES CREATE.

290
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,333
- ( theme song playing )

291
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,750
- Koyo: WILL THE SWORD OF RULE
CLEAVE IN TWO

292
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,583
THE VERY EMPIRE ITSELF?

293
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,083
- THE XIAN EMPIRE IS
BUT MERE PAGEANTRY!

294
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,791
FOUNDED ON LIES
AND ANCHORED IN DECEIT!

295
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,375
- Ryuko: I SPEAK AS ONE
ALLIED TO THE EMPEROR!

296
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,583
KEIRO HAS BEEN DECREED
THIS LAND'S SALVE.

297
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,375
- Taito: IF KEIRO'S TAKEN
THE THRONE ALL OF A SUDDEN,

298
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,875
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO TAIGA?

299
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,000
- Koyo: IF HE GIVES IT UP
WITHOUT A FIGHT, HE MAY LIVE.

300
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,750
- BEHOLD! THE WILL
OF THE HEAVENS!

301
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,083
- Koyo: VIOLENT UPHEAVAL
ROCKS THE EMPIRE TO ITS CORE

302
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,833
IN HERO TALES, CHAPTER 22,

303
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,291
"THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL
IN CONFUSION."

304
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,458
- Keiro:
THE TRUE SWORD BEFORE YOU,

305
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,333
HAS CHOSEN THE TRUE EMPEROR!
