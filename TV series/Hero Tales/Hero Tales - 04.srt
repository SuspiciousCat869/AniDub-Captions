1
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:21,875
- ( girl screams )

2
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:24,000
- LAILA, WHAT'S WRONG?

3
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:25,166
- ( sobs )

4
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,458
- THAT CAN'T BE GOOD, HUH?

5
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,125
- HMM.

6
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:38,208
NO, IT'S NOT GOOD.
WHAT HAVE WE WALKED INTO?

7
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:41,833
- ( theme song playing )

8
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:52,583
( singing in English )

9
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:11,250
- ( panting )

10
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:15,958
- ( gasps )

11
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:18,666
- ( chuckles ) WELL, WELL.

12
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:23,708
- ( girl screams )

13
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,541
- WHAT?
- OVER THERE.

14
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,375
- ( chuckles )

15
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,541
- WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
WE'D RUN INTO EACH OTHER

16
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,625
OUT IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE LIKE THIS?

17
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:37,750
WHAT LUCK. EIRETSU'S
GONNA BE REAL HAPPY

18
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:39,166
TO SEE THE TWO OF YOU.

19
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,458
- LINLIN, DON'T BE AFRAID.

20
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:42,791
I'M HERE TO PROTECT YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

21
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:44,875
I WON'T LET THEM
DO ANYTHING TO HARM YOU.

22
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:49,958
NOW, JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES.

23
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:52,916
- YEAH, BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T
WANT TO SEE WHAT WE ARE GONNA

24
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,958
DO TO YOUR FRIEND, GIRLIE.

25
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:57,875
- I'M STILL A PROUD MEMBER
OF THE ZHANG JIN SQUAD.

26
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,750
DON'T THINK I'LL GO DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

27
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:02,541
- HA! THAT PACK OF LOSERS
IS A THING OF THE PAST.

28
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,958
( cackling )

29
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,000
( groans )

30
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,250
- ( all gasp )

31
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:14,666
- STAND ASIDE. THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.

32
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,333
- WHEN I SEE BASTARDS
PICKING ON THE WEAK,

33
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:18,291
I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS, FRIEND.

34
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:19,708
AND FROM WHERE I'M STANDING,

35
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:21,416
YOU GUYS PRETTY MUCH LOOK
LIKE A BUNCH OF BASTARDS.

36
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:25,041
- WE LOOK LIKE A BUNCH
OF BASTARDS? IS THAT RIGHT?

37
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:27,166
- UM, THAT'S KINDA
WHAT HE JUST SAID.

38
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:30,291
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT IT, THOUGH.

39
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,875
HE DOES MAKE A REALLY
GOOD POINT.

40
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,083
- ( yells )

41
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:37,291
( groans )

42
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:40,416
- HA!

43
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:43,208
- ( screams )

44
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,500
- WHO, WHO IN THE HELL
ARE YOU, PEOPLE?

45
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:52,583
- SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA
TEACH YOU A LESSON.

46
01:03:58,166 --> 01:03:59,208
WHAT THE...

47
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:06,875
- YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST THESE THREE.

48
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:10,250
- Man: HOSEI.

49
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:12,375
- HE CAUGHT MY ARROW
WITH HIS BARE HANDS.

50
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:14,500
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,
YOU WANNA RUN.

51
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,083
- WE'LL GET YOU FOR THIS,
YOU HEAR ME?

52
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:23,000
THIS ISN'T OVER
BY A LONG SHOT.

53
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,125
- HELLO.

54
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:33,125
- YOU PICKED THE WRONG GUY TO...

55
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:35,041
- SOMEBODY'S NOT FROM
AROUND HERE.

56
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:36,666
SO, HOW FAR
HAVE YOU TRAVELED?

57
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:39,166
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

58
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,125
PLEASE SAY NO.
THEY CALL ME HOSEI.

59
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,833
WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU?

60
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:46,958
- UM, LAILA.
- LAILA. OH MAN.

61
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,958
I COULDN'T HAVE PICKED
A BETTER NAME FOR YOU MYSELF.

62
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:51,458
- HEY, YOU STAY
THE HELL AWAY FROM HER.

63
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:52,583
- I'M WORKING HERE.

64
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:06,041
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

65
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:10,666
- YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE.
BUT I SMELL STUPIDITY.

66
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:14,500
- CHINJO, CAN I LOOK NOW?

67
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:17,208
- YES. EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT
NOW. YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES.

68
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:25,875
- THAT ARCHER. CAN IT BE?

69
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:35,458
- I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR YOUR HELP OUT THERE.

70
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:40,416
MY NAME IS CHINJO, BY THE WAY.
THE LITTLE ONE IS LINLIN.

71
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:44,250
- AND YOU MAY CALL ME RYUKO.
THIS IS MY FRIEND LAILA.

72
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,333
THE ONE STUFFING HIS FACE
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW

73
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:47,916
ANSWERS TO TAITO.

74
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,583
WE'RE TRAVELING
TO THE CAPITAL TOGETHER.

75
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,750
FORGIVE MY SAYING SO,

76
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:54,208
BUT THIS PLACE HAS CHANGED
CONSIDERABLY

77
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:56,250
SINCE I WAS LAST HERE.

78
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:59,166
- YES, IT HAS. I'M CERTAIN
ON YOUR PREVIOUS VISIT,

79
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,000
WE WERE A THRIVING TOWNSHIP.

80
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:03,166
SADLY OUR PROTECTOR,
THE ZHANG JIN SQUAD,

81
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,750
HAS DISBANDED SINCE THEN.

82
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:07,041
ITS LEADER WAS A GOOD MAN,

83
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:09,375
BUT WHEN HE PASSED AWAY
THREE YEARS AGO,

84
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:11,791
THERE WERE NO MALE HEIRS
TO TAKE UP THE TORCH.

85
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:13,416
WE WERE PLUNGED INTO CHAOS.

86
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,750
- Laila: YOU MEAN THERE WAS
A FIGHT OVER WHO WOULD

87
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,333
SUCCEED HIM?

88
01:06:16,416 --> 01:06:19,375
- EXACTLY. EIRETSU, HIS FORMER
RIGHT-HAND MAN, STAKED A CLAIM

89
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:21,583
TO THE TITLE THROUGH BLOODSHED.

90
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:24,291
SEVERAL OF US
TOOK A STAND AGAINST HIM.

91
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:25,416
- Man: UGLY MUTT.

92
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,791
- Ryuko: AND THE MAGISTRATES?

93
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:28,291
- IF THERE WERE ANY, THERE'D
HAVE BEEN NO NEED FOR

94
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:30,583
THE SQUAD IN THE FIRST PLACE.

95
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:32,041
I'M AN ORPHAN, YOU SEE.

96
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:35,291
I OWE THE LEADER
FOR TAKING ME IN.

97
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:36,375
TO HONOR HIS MEMORY,

98
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:38,250
I'VE TAKEN HIS DAUGHTER
UNDER MY WING.

99
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,583
SHE DESERVES TO SEE THIS TOWN
RESTORED TO ITS FORMER GLORY.

100
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:48,166
AS DO THE FAMILIES OF MY
COMRADES WHO WERE CUT DOWN.

101
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,333
- Taito: YOUR COMRADES?

102
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,333
- TAITO.

103
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:55,083
- WHO TOOK THIS EIRETSU'S SIDE?
WHERE ARE THEY?

104
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:57,416
- AH.
- WONDERFUL.

105
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,375
I DON'T SUPPOSE TELLING YOU
IT'S NOT OUR PLACE WOULD DO

106
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:00,583
ANY GOOD AT THIS POINT?

107
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:02,833
NO, YOU'VE GOT THAT
LOOK IN YOUR EYE.

108
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:06,958
- WE'RE THIRSTY, OLD MAN!

109
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:10,166
- I WOULDN'T SERVE THE LIKES OF
YOU A PINT OF MY OWN DAMN PISS.

110
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:15,791
- THAT A FACT?
- HEY, LEAVE HIM ALONE.

111
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:19,791
- YOU? EIRETSU, SIR,
THESE ARE THE GUYS.

112
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:23,166
- EIRETSU, HE MEAN YOU?
- ( scoffs )

113
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,458
I HEAR YOU LOT GAVE MY BOYS
A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY

114
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,041
EARLIER TODAY.

115
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:30,000
CHINJO, YOU LOOK WELL.

116
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:34,375
OLD MAN, STOP GAWKING
AND BRING US BOOZE.

117
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:35,833
- OH, JUST TAKE A SEAT.

118
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:38,291
PRETTY BALLSY FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S ABOUT TO GET WHUPPED.

119
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,333
- Hosei: LIKE HE'S GOT
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

120
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,583
( gasps )

121
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:48,958
- SON OF A... YOU'RE THAT JERK
WITH THE BOW!

122
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:52,250
- WOW. IMAGINE SEEING THAT
PRETTY FACE TWICE IN ONE DAY.

123
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,708
- ( chuckles ) COME ON, BABE.

124
01:07:53,791 --> 01:07:56,291
DITCH THIS HOLE IN THE WALL
AND COME BACK TO MY PLACE.

125
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:59,791
YOU CAN EAT YOUR FILL
OF WHATEVER YOUR HEART DESIRES.

126
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,333
- YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, IDIOT?

127
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:03,708
WE JUST TEAMED UP WITH THE GUYS
WHO ARE GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN.

128
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:07,791
- HUH?
- THAT'S RIGHT. SO GET LOST.

129
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,958
- HOLD ON, CHIEF. WHAT ARE YOU,
LIKE LAILA'S MAN?

130
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:12,041
- MY WHAT?

131
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:15,166
- HER MAN? NO, DUMBASS,
I'M HER BROTHER.

132
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:20,750
- YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

133
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:24,125
- I DON'T SEE IT.
- DID I SAY WE WERE TWINS?

134
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:27,833
- LINLIN, CHINJO. OH, YOU'RE
SAFE. THANK HEAVENS.

135
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:31,375
AFTER WE HEARD YOU HAD
GONE OUT TO VISIT

136
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:32,750
THE LEADER'S BURIAL SITE,

137
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:34,625
WE FEARED THE WORST
FOR YOU, SIR.

138
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:37,166
- YOU WANNA LAY IN THE GROUND
BESIDE HIM, WE CAN OBLIGE YOU.

139
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,958
- THINK I'M GONNA PASS
ON THIS ONE.

140
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:46,833
I ONLY JUST REPLACED THE BOW
I BROKE THIS AFTERNOON, GUYS.

141
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,125
- DISGUSTING.

142
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:56,041
- I'M STAYING IN THE
BIG MANSION UP THE ROAD

143
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:59,541
IF YOU HAPPEN TO CHANGE
YOUR MIND, SO...

144
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,583
- YOU COME WITHIN FIVE
OF HER AND I'LL MAKE YOU SORRY

145
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:03,125
YOU WERE EVER BORN!

146
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:06,208
- THE ARCHER DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE HE'S FROM AROUND HERE.

147
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:10,333
- HE'S NOT. JUST SOME DRIFTER
EIRETSU HIRED AS A BODYGUARD.

148
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,041
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

149
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:16,625
- NOTHING. I'M A BIT
PREOCCUPIED IS ALL.

150
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:18,416
- ABOUT WHAT?

151
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:24,791
- ( dog barks )

152
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,166
- ( snores )

153
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:34,458
- BE QUIET.

154
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,625
HEY, WHERE'D HE GO?

155
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,833
- Hosei: THIS ONE'S CRAP.

156
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:50,875
( sighs )

157
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:54,416
SO IS THIS ONE.

158
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,125
COME ON, GIVE ME A BREAK.

159
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:00,916
- ( door creaks )

160
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,458
- DON'T SHOOT.

161
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:20,958
- YOU, YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE
STROLLING IN HERE LIKE THIS.

162
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:23,458
- YES, WELL, I'D LIKE
A WORD, IF I MAY.

163
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:27,625
- STAY BACK, PRETTY BOY.
I'M WARNING YOU.

164
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:29,833
- ( yells )

165
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:32,875
- WHAT THE...

166
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:35,791
- DON'T BE ALARMED. YOUR BODY'S
ENERGY IS MERELY PASSING

167
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:38,041
THROUGH MY OWN.

168
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:39,833
I'M ACTING AS AN AMPLIFIER.

169
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:41,916
( yells )

170
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:50,291
- JUST AS I THOUGHT.
THE SIGIL OF PHECDA.

171
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:51,416
- THE WHAT?

172
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,083
- ACCORDING TO LEGEND,

173
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,541
EACH OF THE SEVEN DIPPER
BEARERS CARRIES A MARK

174
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:55,791
UNIQUE TO THE STAR

175
01:10:55,875 --> 01:10:58,500
UNDER WHOSE AUSPICES
HIS FATE IS DIRECTED.

176
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:02,166
THE SYMBOL YOU CARRY REPRESENTS
PHECDA, THE STAR OF THE ARCHER.

177
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,583
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

178
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:07,791
- YOU'VE NOT YET HELD THE BOW
THAT COULD WITHSTAND

179
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:09,208
YOUR STRENGTH, HAVE YOU?

180
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:11,375
ALL YOU DID WAS LET
THIS ARROW FLY,

181
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:13,500
AND YET IT SHATTERED TO
SPLINTERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

182
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:16,375
BELIEVE ME,

183
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:18,458
I KNOW A THING OR TWO
ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE

184
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,208
SINGLED OUT BY DESTINY.

185
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:21,541
- ( gasps )

186
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:27,500
WHY? YOU'RE ONE OF
THE FIVE DIVINE WARRIORS.

187
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,250
WHY WOULD YOU SUBMIT
TO TAKING ORDERS FROM

188
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,791
A MAN LIKE HIM?

189
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:33,625
- DIVINE WARRIORS? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT?

190
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:35,041
I KNOW HOW THIS LOOKS,

191
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,750
BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
AS MY REAL MASTER TOLD ME,

192
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:37,708
ALL RIGHT?

193
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:39,083
- YOUR REAL MASTER?

194
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:47,291
- HOSEI, THE RIGHT WEAPON
WAITS FOR YOU.

195
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:49,625
GO NOW AND FIND IT.

196
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:50,833
- ( gasps )

197
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,958
- WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT DID
YOUR MASTER TELL YOU TO DO?

198
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:58,083
- SHUT UP. IF IT WAS ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS,

199
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:01,000
I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU WITHOUT
YOU HAVING TO ASK ME.

200
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,625
NOW GET OUT.

201
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:05,000
- HMM. VERY WELL, THEN.

202
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:06,916
FOR THE MOMENT I SHALL
LEAVE YOU IN PEACE.

203
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,416
BUT, YOU'D DO WELL
TO REMEMBER THIS,

204
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,666
THE WARRIOR GODS, DUBHE
AND ALKAID HAVE BROUGHT THEIR

205
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:13,833
FIGHT INTO THE EARTHLY SPHERE.

206
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:16,875
THE LINES ARE ALREADY
BEING DRAWN AS WE SPEAK.

207
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,458
KNOW THAT WHOEVER ALIGNS
THEMSELVES TO DUBHE,

208
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:23,125
I AM BOUND BY A SACRED DUTY
TO DESTROY.

209
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:25,083
- DUBHE? ALKAID?

210
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:27,333
YOU JUST MAKING THIS
STUFF UP AS YOU GO ALONG?

211
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:28,583
- SCOFF IF YOU LIKE, FRIEND.

212
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:31,000
IT ISN'T MY PLACE
TO MAKE YOU BELIEVE.

213
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:34,041
THAT PRIVILEGE BELONGS TO FATE.

214
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:38,250
- ( exhales )

215
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:40,416
( sighs )

216
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,416
( gasps )

217
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:48,750
- LIKE I CAN READ THIS.

218
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:55,125
OH, WAIT. THAT'S THE CHARACTER
FOR "BOW," ISN'T IT?

219
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:56,958
- IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ONLY ME.

220
01:12:57,041 --> 01:13:00,333
- OH, HEY BOSS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

221
01:13:00,416 --> 01:13:03,500
- FUNNY. I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO ASK YOU THE SAME THING.

222
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:06,083
- YEAH. WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
- HMM?

223
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,583
- IT'S WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL
A PURCHASE ORDER FOR A SHIPMENT

224
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:13,291
OF NEW WEAPONS
I'VE GOT ON THE WAY.

225
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:15,166
- AH, FOR THE BIG SHOWDOWN,
YOU MEAN.

226
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:17,208
- YOU BET. THEY SHOULD BE
ARRIVING SOMETIME

227
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:18,750
TOMORROW NIGHT.

228
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:22,291
AND, BY SUN UP THE NEXT DAY,
THE LAST HOLDOUTS WILL BE DEAD.

229
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:24,750
- I CAN COUNT ON YOU
TO BE THERE, RIGHT?

230
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,500
- DAY AFTER TOMORROW, RIGHT.

231
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:27,958
- I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD.

232
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:31,000
BY THE WAY,
WHAT'S THIS ONE HERE?

233
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:32,583
- NOTHING SPECIAL.

234
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:34,958
- COME ON, BOSS. DON'T PLAY DUMB
WITH ME. I'M YOUR BODYGUARD.

235
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:37,166
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT KIND
OF WEAPONS YOU'VE GOT COMING IN.

236
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,166
I'M AN ARCHER. BOWS ARE MY LIFE.

237
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,875
HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME
ABOUT THIS ONE?

238
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,958
- AH, THE SHUANG CHAN BOW.
I'D ALMOST FORGOT.

239
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:47,416
- SHUANG CHAN BOW.

240
01:13:56,333 --> 01:14:00,416
- ANOTHER STAR MOVES. DIVINE
WARRIOR PHECDA JOINS THE FOLD,

241
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,541
AND NEARS HIS FATE.

242
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:08,333
PREPARE TO CHOOSE SIDES,
OLD FRIEND.

243
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:09,833
- Laila: TONIGHT?

244
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:13,208
- YES. EIRETSU'S ORDERED
A HUGE STOCKPILE OF WEAPONS.

245
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:15,958
HE INTENDS TO LAUNCH A SURPRISE
ATTACK AGAINST YOU AND YOURS

246
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:17,791
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING.

247
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:20,000
- IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

248
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:21,875
- ( muffled ) I SAY WE HIT THEM
WHERE THEY LIVE TODAY BEFORE

249
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,500
THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO ATTACK.

250
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,833
- HEY, COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
A LITTLE SLOWER, PLEASE.

251
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:30,166
AND WITHOUT A MOUTH
FULL OF SWEET BUNS?

252
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,125
- I SAID LET'S HIT THEM WHERE
THEY LIVE TODAY BEFORE

253
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,583
THEY ATTACK US.

254
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:35,458
IF WE CAN AMBUSH THE WEAPONS
SHIPMENT, THEY WON'T HAVE

255
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:36,666
A LEG TO STAND ON

256
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,333
AND WE'LL HAVE ALL
THEIR COOL STUFF.

257
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:40,291
- Ryuko: INTERESTING.

258
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,875
- YOU KNOW, COMING
FROM YOU, THAT'S ACTUALLY

259
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:43,083
AN EXCEPTIONAL IDEA.

260
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:45,000
- ( chuckles ) WOW, REALLY?

261
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:47,333
- THE MEANS BY WHICH THEY SOUGHT
TO AFFECT YOUR DOWNFALL,

262
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,875
WILL BE THE INSTRUMENTS
OF THEIR OWN RUIN.

263
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:51,541
- THERE'S POETIC JUSTICE
IN THAT. I LIKE IT.

264
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:55,083
- SO, THEN, TONIGHT WE'LL ATTACK
UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS.

265
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:57,333
- HMM.

266
01:14:57,416 --> 01:15:00,166
- HERE WE ARE. HAVE AS MANY
AS YOU LIKE, SON.

267
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:05,500
- WHOA.

268
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:06,916
- LET'S GO OVER THIS AGAIN.

269
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,500
LAILA AND I WILL CALL THEIR
ATTENTION AWAY FROM YOU.

270
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:10,875
WHILE WE'VE GOT
THEM DISTRACTED...

271
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:12,416
- YEAH. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

272
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,583
I GOT IT, ALL RIGHT? TRUST ME,
THIS WILL BE A BREEZE.

273
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:17,416
- OH GEE, THAT'S CERTAINLY
A LOAD OFF.

274
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:20,000
MY BROTHER, THE GENIUS,
SAYS IT'S GONNA BE A BREEZE.

275
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:21,500
- NOBODY WAS TALKING TO YOU.

276
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:25,458
- HEY, WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

277
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:27,916
I WAS JUST LOOKING
TO PLANT MY FOOT IN...

278
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,375
- LAILA, BABE. ARE YOU
EVER A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES.

279
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:32,916
CAN YOU BELIEVE MY LUCK?

280
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,333
DID YOU COME ALL THE WAY OUT
HERE TO LOOK FOR ME?

281
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:37,708
- ( chuckles )
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

282
01:15:37,791 --> 01:15:40,291
- HEY, I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM HER.

283
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:41,750
- WILL YOU JUST RELAX?

284
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,291
WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION.

285
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:45,208
- YOU ARE SO ON THE ROAD
TOWARDS AN ASS-KICKING

286
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,250
RIGHT NOW.

287
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,541
- WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
DOING OUT HERE?

288
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:51,041
- TECHNICALLY, I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO SAY

289
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:53,791
BUT I'D NEVER LET A SECRET COME
BETWEEN ME AND MY SWEETHEART.

290
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:57,625
- SHUT UP. JUST TELL US ALREADY.
- YOU'RE NOT MY SWEETHEART, PAL.

291
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:59,125
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS CRAP.

292
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:02,958
- HUH, WHAT IS THAT?

293
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:04,208
- Taito: WHAT THE HELL?

294
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:05,833
- Ryuko: I'M AFRAID THE SIEGE
MAY HAVE BEGUN.

295
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:06,791
- Taito: WHAT?

296
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:08,416
- Hosei: THEY'RE
DOING THIS NOW?

297
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,166
- BUT THEY WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO ATTACK TILL DAWN.

298
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,375
- HEY, HOLD ON.
- LET'S GET MOVING.

299
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:14,375
WE'VE NO TIME TO LOSE.

300
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:15,500
- RIGHT.

301
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:20,708
- ( panting )

302
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:22,625
- HOW IS THIS HAPPENING?
- IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

303
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:24,000
- WHY WOULD THEY MAKE
A MOVE BEFORE THE WEAPONS

304
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:25,458
GOT HERE?

305
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:26,791
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY COULD'VE
KNOWN WE WERE ON TO THEM.

306
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:27,833
- ( people screaming )

307
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:31,541
- ( cackling )

308
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,083
- OH, NO.

309
01:16:36,166 --> 01:16:38,916
- WELL, WELL,
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE.

310
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,958
MY BODYGUARD
FRATERNIZING WITH THE ENEMY?

311
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:44,583
- I KNEW YOU WEREN'T
A MAN TO BE TRUSTED, HOSEI.

312
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:45,958
- TRUSTED?

313
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:47,791
- THERE WAS SOMETHING
IN YOUR ATTITUDE LAST NIGHT

314
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,125
I DIDN'T LIKE.

315
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:51,708
IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT DECIDED ME
ON ATTACKING NOW.

316
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:52,750
AS YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF,

317
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,875
THE WEAPONS CAME
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

318
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,791
A PORTENT OF VICTORY
IF THERE EVER WAS ONE,

319
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:58,000
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

320
01:16:58,083 --> 01:16:59,291
- ( gasps )

321
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:01,750
- WE HAVE TO GET LINLIN
AND CHINJO OUT OF THERE.

322
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:04,041
THE WHOLE PLACE WILL BURN TO
EMBERS IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.

323
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:05,541
THEY'LL BE KILLED.

324
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:08,416
- I'VE GOT THIS.
- DON'T MOVE ANY CLOSER.

325
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,125
- WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE THOSE THINGS?

326
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:17,583
- RATHER IMPRESSIVE, RIGHT?

327
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:23,666
CARE TO GUESS HOW MANY ARROWS
THEY CAN SHOOT AT ONCE?

328
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:25,958
LOOK, THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
YOU CAN DO TO SAVE THEM NOW,

329
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,125
SO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST SIT BACK
AND ENJOY THE SHOW.

330
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:32,083
- YOU MONSTER.
- TAITO, I LEAVE HIM TO YOU.

331
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:32,958
- RYUKO.

332
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,125
- KEEP HIS THUGS BUSY

333
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:36,000
WHILE I GET LINLIN
AND CHINJO TO SAFETY.

334
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:37,125
- YOU GOT IT.

335
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,500
- IDIOTS.

336
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,416
SHOOT MORE.
DAMN IT, TAKE THEM DOWN.

337
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:57,333
NO, THEY'RE NOT HUMAN.

338
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:00,916
WHAT? WHY CAN'T I...

339
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:08,250
- WHERE ARE YOU?
CALL OUT TO ME.

340
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,375
LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.
I'LL COME TO YOU.

341
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:19,625
- DAMN IT. THE FINEST
BOW EVER MADE, MY ASS.

342
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:22,083
STUPID PIECE OF JUNK
IS COMPLETELY USELESS.

343
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:24,000
- RYUKO, HURRY.

344
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,500
- OH, THANK GOODNESS,
YOU'RE SAFE.

345
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:30,958
- LET'S FINISH IT.

346
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:33,750
- INDEED WE SHALL.
LAILA, WATCH THEM.

347
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:40,958
- THIS IS IT.
THE SHUANG CHAN BOW.

348
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:43,333
- ( grunts )

349
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:48,750
- YOU LOSE, YOU BASTARD.
- Laila: NO!

350
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:50,875
- LAILA.
- LINLIN.

351
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:53,458
- CHINJO, CHINJO.
YOU HAVE TO GET UP, PLEASE.

352
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:54,708
- NOW I'VE GOTCHA.

353
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:58,750
- THAT'S IT, YES.
SHOW NO MERCY. KILL HER.

354
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:04,041
- LET HER GO.
- ( laughs ) IT'S TOO LATE, BOY.

355
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,583
- ( whimpers )

356
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:08,416
- ( laughs )

357
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,708
- AFTER EVERYTHING
IS SAID AND DONE,

358
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:23,291
I WILL BE THE ONE TO TRIUMPH.

359
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:26,500
- THIS IS IT.
I HAVE FOUND MY WEAPON.

360
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:33,000
HEADS UP.
I'M ONE HELL OF A SHOT, HA.

361
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
- ( laughs )

362
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:47,291
- CURSE YOU.
I WAS THIS CLOSE.

363
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:49,041
- YOU MAKE A BAD ARCHER,
OLD MAN.

364
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:58,416
HA, GUESS CROOKED
ARROWS CAN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT.

365
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,750
- COME ON.
WHAT'S WITH THIS THING?

366
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:05,083
- LINLIN, CLOSE YOUR EYES, OKAY?

367
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:08,333
( yells )

368
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:12,541
ALL DONE. YOU CAN LOOK NOW.

369
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:15,208
- ( giggles )

370
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:25,416
- Chinjo: YOU BROUGHT PEACE
BACK INTO OUR LIVES.

371
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,125
WE ARE FOREVER
IN YOUR DEBT.

372
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:28,958
- ONCE WE'VE FINISHED WITH
OUR BUSINESS AT THE CAPITAL,

373
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:30,541
WE'LL STOP BACK BY.

374
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,833
- OF COURSE. AND WHEN
YOU DO THIS PLACE WILL BE

375
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:34,250
AS TRANQUIL AS YOU LEFT IT.

376
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:36,958
OR BETTER YET, WE'LL BE
SUCH A BOOM TOWN, YOU WILL

377
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:39,708
HARDLY RECOGNIZE US.

378
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:41,291
- THANKS FOR HELPING
US OUT, HOSEI.

379
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:43,458
YOU CAN HOLD YOUR
OWN PRETTY WELL.

380
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:46,041
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
MY AWESOMENESS MAY BE OBVIOUS,

381
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,625
BUT SOMEHOW IT'S ALWAYS
BETTER TO HEAR IT FROM

382
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,375
A PRETTY LITTLE THING LIKE YOU.

383
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:50,833
- ( sighs )

384
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:54,833
- SEE YOU SOON, LINLIN.
- THANK YOU.

385
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:56,750
- WELL, WE'D BEST BE OFF, YES?

386
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:02,541
- ( laughs ) GOODBYE.

387
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,833
BE CAREFUL. I'LL THINK
OF YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY.

388
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,291
- IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE
YOUR HEART MELT.

389
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:08,291
COULD SHE BE
ANY MORE ADORABLE?

390
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:11,458
- NO KIDDING, RIGHT? WAIT.

391
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:13,416
HOLD ON. IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO WEASEL YOUR WAY INTO

392
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,958
JOINING US, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

393
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:16,333
GO BACK TO THE VILLAGE.

394
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:17,833
THEY'RE BOUND TO NEED YOU
MORE THAN WE DO.

395
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,125
- AH, THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

396
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:20,916
ONLY REASON I CAME HERE
WAS TO FIND THIS BOW.

397
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,333
NO POINT IN MY STAYING
BEHIND NOW.

398
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:24,166
- WHY DON'T YOU GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN?

399
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:25,583
- DON'T BE SUCH A STICK
IN THE MUD.

400
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:27,083
BETTER GET USED TO ME,

401
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:29,166
'CAUSE I PLAN ON FOLLOWING
LAILA TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH.

402
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,208
YOU HEAR THAT, SWEETHEART?
I'LL PROTECT YOU NO MATTER...

403
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,291
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE
NOT EVEN REALLY THAT GOOD.

404
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:37,166
WANNA KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU CAME
TO HITTING ME WITH THAT ARROW,

405
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,583
MR. SURE SHOT?

406
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:40,375
TOO DAMN CLOSE.

407
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:41,750
- HOW DARE YOU.

408
01:21:41,833 --> 01:21:43,250
THAT ARROW WENT RIGHT WHERE I
WANTED IT TO, BUDDY.

409
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:45,166
ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD THINK
MY AIM WAS OFF.

410
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,958
- ARE YOU CALLING ME AN IDIOT?

411
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:49,125
- WHADDYA SAY WE GET
A MOVE ON, GUYS?

412
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:51,083
- QUIT ACTING LIKE WE ARE
FRIENDS, JERK-FACE.

413
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:52,041
- JUST SO YOU'RE AWARE,

414
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:53,125
THE ONLY THING HOLDING
ME BACK

415
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,541
FROM KICKING YOUR ASS
INTO NEXT WEEK

416
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:56,041
IS THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE LAILA'S BROTHER.

417
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:57,375
- YOU KICKING MY ASS.

418
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:58,750
THAT'S GOOD. SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HIT.

419
01:21:58,833 --> 01:22:01,666
- OH, DEAR.
- FANTASTIC. ANOTHER IMBECILE.

420
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,791
JUST WHAT OUR PARTY
NEEDS RIGHT NOW.

421
01:22:03,875 --> 01:22:06,500
- WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK HOME?
- WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK HOME?

422
01:22:06,583 --> 01:22:09,291
- BECAUSE I WAS HERE FIRST.
- BECAUSE...

423
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:11,375
- ( theme song playing )

424
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:20,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

425
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:42,333
- Ryuko: MUST THE WEAK
AND BEDRAGGLED TURN

426
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:44,500
TO PETTY CRIME
TO SURVIVE IN THIS WORLD?

427
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:46,791
- Taito: AND UNLESS YOU WANT
TO MAKE ME ANGRIER, YOU WILL

428
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:48,458
COME OUT NOW. UNDERSTAND?

429
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:50,000
- Laila: THE ONLY PEOPLE
THESE KIDS HAVE IN

430
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,541
THE WHOLE WORLD IS EACH OTHER.

431
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:53,291
- Ryuko: THEIR SITUATION
IS NO EXCUSE FOR LIVING

432
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:54,750
LIKE PARASITES.

433
01:23:54,833 --> 01:23:56,250
- Hosei: ONLY SOMEONE WHO'S
NEVER WANTED FOR ANYTHING

434
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:58,041
COULD SAY SOMETHING SO COLD.

435
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:00,166
- Taito: ALL RIGHT, KID.
BRING IT ON.

436
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:02,208
- Shimei: LET'S SPICE
THINGS UP A BIT.

437
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:03,958
- Ryuko: NEXT TIME,
ON HERO TALES,

438
01:24:04,041 --> 01:24:06,583
THE CHILDREN OF WANT
MEET THEIR CHAMPIONS

439
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:09,458
IN CHAPTER FIVE,
AILING EMPIRE.

440
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:21,125
- Taito: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

441
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:22,583
BUT YOU NEED TO STOP.
