1
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,791
- HOW DID YOU COME BY IT?

2
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,458
- THE DIVINE WARRIOR GIRL.

3
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,500
SHE HAD IT ON HER PERSON WHEN WE
ENSNARED HER AT TONG YO.

4
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,208
- IS THIS TRUE?

5
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:36,875
- AS HER EXECUTION IS NIGH,
YOU MAY WISH TO HOLD ON TO THAT.

6
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,333
- ( Japanese song playing )

7
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,458
- ( gasps )

8
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,333
- AS YOU SEE, THAT WHICH
WE REVERED AS THE SWORD

9
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,083
OF RULE IS COUNTERFEIT.

10
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,208
A GILDED PRETENSE.

11
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,750
- ( all murmuring )

12
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,125
- BUT THEN, WHITHER
THE GENUINE SWORD?

13
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,625
- WHAT IS THIS?

14
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,791
- WILL YOU ATTEMPT TO DRAW IT?

15
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,375
- ( grunting )

16
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,583
ALAS, I CANNOT.

17
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,666
- THE XIAN EMPIRE IS
BUT MERE PAGEANTRY!

18
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,666
FOUNDED ON LIES AND
ANCHORED IN DECEIT!

19
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,458
ITS LEADER, A PAPER TIGER!

20
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,791
AND YET STILL THERE IS HOPE.

21
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:36,250
THE TRUE SWORD BEFORE YOU
HAS CHOSEN THE TRUE EMPEROR.

22
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,875
BEHOLD! THE WILL OF THE HEAVENS!

23
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,875
- SUCH RADIANCE.
INDEED IT MUST BE!

24
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,583
- WHY DO YOU GAPE?

25
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,541
THE MAN BEFORE US HAS BEEN
DECREED BY FATE TO LEAD!

26
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,708
SHOW THAT YOU WILL FOLLOW.
BOW YOUR HEADS, NOW!

27
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,416
- ( laughing )

28
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,291
- RYUKO!

29
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,708
- YOUR BLADE.

30
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,541
- THEY TELL ME IT
WAS FOUND ON YOU.

31
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,083
- I HELD TIGHT TO IT
WHEN I THOUGHT...

32
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,041
WHEN I FELT IN MY HEART
THAT YOU'D MET YOUR END.

33
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,833
BUT NOW I KNOW THE TRUTH.

34
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,041
- RINMEI...

35
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,583
BECOME A PART OF ALL THIS.

36
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,000
YOU AND I CAN SERVE HIS
LORDSHIP ARM IN ARM!

37
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,291
- HOW CAN YOU ASK THAT?

38
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,916
- THE PRICE OF OBSTINACY
WILL BE YOUR HEAD!

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,125
A COST I CANNOT BEAR
TO SEE YOU PAY.

40
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,583
SWEAR FEALTY TO LORD
KEIRO AND I CAN INTERVENE.

41
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,291
RINMEI, PLEASE.
HELP ME TO SAVE YOU!

42
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,708
- THAT I CAN'T.

43
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,166
- DAMN YOU! SEE REASON!
YOUR LIFE IS AT STAKE!

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,541
- RYUKO, WHAT YOU
CALL REASON IS MADNESS.

45
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,458
THE ONE WHO NEEDS SAVING IS YOU.

46
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,458
MY LIFE WILL BE SPARED CARE
OF YOUR FORMER FRIENDS.

47
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,708
- SUCH CHARMING FAITH.

48
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,125
- WHAT OF YOUR OWN?
- WHAT?

49
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,291
- YOU'VE ALIGNED YOURSELF
TO LORD KEIRO.

50
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,458
IN YOUR HEART DO YOU
BELIEVE HIM TO BE RIGHT?

51
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,041
- I DO.

52
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,291
- YOUR KEEPSAKE YIELDS
ITS SECRETS TO THE MOON.

53
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,041
I HAVE SEEN THE NAME.

54
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:49,416
THE LOVE OF A SON
CAST ASIDE BLINDS YOU.

55
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,291
- PERHAPS IT DOES.

56
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,458
THOUGH YET, MY IDEALS WOULD
REFLECT HIS REGARDLESS.

57
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:58,000
OF THIS I COULD NOT BE
MORE CERTAIN. IT IS FATE.

58
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,583
- SPEAK AS YOURSELF!

59
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:03,625
- I SPEAK AS ONE
ALLIED TO THE EMPEROR!

60
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,666
INDEED. AS ONE
ALLIED TO THE STARS,

61
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,333
KEIRO HAS BEEN DECREED
THIS LAND'S SALVE.

62
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,166
- HAVE YOU HEARD THE RUMBLINGS?

63
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,625
THEY SAY GENERAL KEIRO
DREW THE SWORD OF RULE.

64
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,166
AND BEFORE A STAGGERED
EMPEROR NO LESS.

65
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,916
- BUT HOW CAN THAT BE? ONLY
HIS MAJESTY CAN DRAW THE SWORD.

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
- BUT THAT'S JUST IT, THOUGH.
THE ONE HE DREW WAS A FAKE.

67
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,916
APPARENTLY TAIGA WAS NEVER FIT
TO RULE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,375
- WELL, THAT'D DEFINITELY
EXPLAIN THE SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS

69
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,041
THE REALM'S BEEN IN LATELY.

70
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:43,083
- YOU WHAT? YOU'RE JOKING!
TAIGA HAS BEEN DEPOSED!

71
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,375
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE HE'S DRIVEN FROM

72
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,083
THE CAPITAL LIKE A PLAGUE DOG

73
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,500
FROM ITS MASTER'S TABLE!

74
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,666
WOULD YOU JOIN
HIM IN BANISHMENT?

75
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,083
TAKI, PLEASE. YOU AND I
CAN LIVE OPENLY

76
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,125
AS FATHER AND DAUGHTER NOW.

77
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:03,250
- A MOMENT I HAVE LONGED FOR.
AND PLEASE DO NOT THINK ME COLD.

78
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,750
BUT I...
MY PLACE IS WITH HIM.

79
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,583
I WILL NOT ABANDON MY
HUSBAND IN HIS HOUR OF NEED!

80
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,666
- HE WHAT? LORD KEIRO HAS
DRAWN THE SWORD OF RULE?

81
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,458
- OH MAN, NO WAY!

82
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,083
- THE WHOLE CAPITAL IS
ASTIR WITH THE NEWS, SIR.

83
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,125
- WHAT AN UNSEEMLY
TURN OF EVENTS.

84
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,916
MY ENTIRE STRATAGEM IS A
PANTOMIME NOW.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,833
WORSE, AN UTTER FARCE.

86
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,250
- NOW WHAT?

87
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,250
- THIS IS TERRIBLE. IF KEIRO
IS CROWNED EMPEROR...

88
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,208
- COME ON. IT'S NOT LIKE DRAWING
SOME STUPID OLD SWORD

89
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,916
AUTOMATICALLY MAKES
YOU THE EMPEROR, RIGHT?

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,041
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT DOES!

91
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,083
- WHAT, HAVE YOU BEEN
LIVING UNDER A ROCK?

92
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,791
GIVE ME A BREAK, TAITO,

93
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,458
INFANTS KNOW THAT'S HOW
EMPERORS ARE CHOSEN.

94
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:51,041
- WELL I THINK THE WHOLE THING'S
A SHAM, I MEAN I DIDN'T HAVE

95
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,583
ANY TROUBLE UNSHEATHING
THAT THING.

96
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:57,000
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU DREW THE SWORD?

97
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,500
- WELL, YEAH, SURE.

98
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,791
IT HAPPENED WHEN I FOUGHT
MOUSTACHE FOR THE FIRST TIME.

99
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,791
- YOU IMBECILE! DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD HAVE SHARED THIS

100
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,458
WITH THE REST OF US BEFORE NOW?

101
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,750
- WELL, MAKE A MOLEHILL
OUT OF IT, WHY DON'T YOU?

102
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,250
I'M NOT YOU. I DON'T REMEMBER
EVERY LITTLE THING I DO WRONG!

103
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,666
- SHUT UP, JERK!

104
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,208
- GENIUS IS EMPEROR? SEEMS
LIKE A BIT OF A STRETCH.

105
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,083
OR, UH, IMPOSSIBLE.

106
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,833
- COULD THE HEAVENS HAVE
DECREED TWO RULERS AT ONCE?

107
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,416
NO, IT MUST BE THAT TAITO HAS
SOMEHOW MANAGED TO FALL

108
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,000
OUT OF THE BLADE'S FAVOR.

109
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,208
- WHO EVEN CARES? RULING
IS FOR CHUMPS, NOT ME.

110
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,625
EVEN WHEN SHIMEI TRIED TO
SWEET TALK ME INTO IT,

111
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,458
I FLAT-OUT TOLD HIM NO.

112
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,958
- YOU... YOU INGRATE!
- IN-WHAT?

113
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,125
- YOU THUMBED YOUR
NOSE AT DESTINY

114
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,666
AND FOR THAT THE HEAVENS HAVE
CHOSEN A MONSTER'S AMBITION

115
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,208
OVER A SAPLING'S PRIDE.

116
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,333
- SO YOU MEAN, IF HE
WOULD'VE ACCEPTED IT,

117
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,666
WE WOULDN'T BE IN
THIS MESS, WOULD WE?

118
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,250
- WE CAN'T BE SURE BUT IT SEEMS
LIKELY. THE SWORD IS FICKLE.

119
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:08,833
- ARE YOU'RE SERIOUS? SO IT'S MY
FAULT KEIRO'S THE EMPEROR NOW.

120
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,875
BECAUSE I TURNED MY BACK ON IT?

121
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:17,000
- WELL, EITHER WAY IT WAS LIKELY
BOUND TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.

122
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,708
- HOLD ON A SECOND. IF KEIRO'S
TAKEN THE THRONE ALL OF A SUDDEN

123
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,125
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO TAIGA?

124
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,625
- WELL, UH, IF HE GIVES IT UP
WITHOUT A FIGHT HE MAY LIVE.

125
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,500
USURPERS CAN BE MERCIFUL.

126
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,416
- AND IF HE DOESN'T?

127
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,375
- SURELY HE'S WILLING
TO ABDICATE.

128
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,500
TAIGA HASN'T THE
WILL BUT TO FOLD.

129
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,000
- NO! HE MADE ME A
PROMISE, DAMN IT!

130
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,666
HE SWORE HE'D TRY
TO CHANGE THINGS,

131
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,791
THAT HE'D MAKE THE
EMPIRE A BETTER PLACE!

132
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,541
- SHOULD HE CHOOSE TO HOLD
HIS OWN, MORE'S THE PITY.

133
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:47,125
KEIRO WILL CUT HIM DOWN WITHOUT
SO MUCH AS BATTING AN EYE.

134
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,416
- HEY! JUST WHERE THE
HELL ARE YOU OFF TO?

135
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,666
- TO GO AND HELP EMPEROR TAIGA.

136
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,583
- DON'T BE RASH.

137
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,875
- THE MAN'S MY BROTHER!

138
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,125
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP ME,
SO JUST BACK OFF!

139
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,083
- YOU FOOL, WHY CHOOSE
TO BE A LONE WOLF?

140
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:12,541
YOU'VE AN ENTIRE
PACK TO RUN WITH.

141
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,958
- LORD KEIRO.
- YES, BOY?

142
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:20,500
- A RUMOR'S GAINED CURRENCY
THAT YOU INTEND TO KILL TAIGA.

143
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,166
- AND IF IT BE TRUE?

144
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,208
- I IMPLORE YOU TO RECONSIDER!

145
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,291
YOUR AIM HAS ALREADY
BEEN REALIZED!

146
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,875
PLEASE, LORD, WHAT NEED CRIES
FURTHER BLOODSHED TO THAT END?

147
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,666
- BLOODSHED HARBINGERS FEAR,
BEGETS OBEDIENCE,

148
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,083
BALLASTS ONE'S POWER.

149
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,458
- BUT SIR, HE'S...
HE'S YOUR SON-IN-LAW!

150
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,666
YOU'D AS GOOD AS
SHED YOUR OWN BLOOD!

151
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,500
WHY WOULD YOU VISIT
HARM UPON FAMILY?

152
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,208
- ENOUGH.
- MY LORD.

153
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,333
FATHER.

154
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,625
TELL ME. WOULD YOU STOOP
TO SPILL MY BLOOD?

155
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,041
- THAT DAGGER.

156
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,666
IMPOSSIBLE.
CAN YOU REALLY BE KEIKO?

157
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,416
- FORGIVE ME.
I HAD HOPED TO SPARE YOU

158
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,916
THE EMBARRASSMENT AND YET...

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,208
- RYUKO... RATHER, KEIKO.
I ABANDONED YOU

160
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,958
IN SERVICE TO A LOFTIER VISION
THAN FATHERHOOD. FORGIVE ME.

161
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,208
I SHALL RESCIND MY
DECISION TO EXECUTE HIM.

162
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,958
- DO YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH?

163
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,250
- MOREOVER, TAIGA
IS NOW IN YOUR CARE.

164
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,875
- MY LORD, I AM MOST GRATEFUL.

165
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,916
- KILL THEM ALL.

166
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,666
- LISTEN UP, MEN!
NOW, TAKE HEED!

167
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,791
OUR QUARRY IS ESPECIALLY
ELUSIVE FOR TONIGHT,

168
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,416
WE ENSNARE AN EMPEROR!

169
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,791
- BUT, BOSS. THAT'S CRAZY.
AND BESIDES, WE'RE PRIVATEERS.

170
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:29,458
- COME NOW. GIVE NOT
FEAR A FEAST! BE BRAZEN!

171
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,875
THINK OF THE GRAND ADVENTURE.

172
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,958
THE THRILL OF THE HUNT!
TREADING WHERE FEW ELSE DARE.

173
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,000
AND, WELL, NATURALLY THINK
OF AN EMPEROR'S RANSOM.

174
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,166
- WELL I FOR ONE THINK
IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA, SIR!

175
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,583
- ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES,

176
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,291
HIS MAJESTY IS CURRENTLY
BEING HELD AT TONG YO TEMPLE.

177
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,958
- SERIOUSLY?
- RINMEI IS THERE AS WELL.

178
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,666
- SO IT'S TWO FOR
THE PRICE OF ONE.

179
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,000
- REALLY?

180
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,708
- ALL RIGHT! THIS IS THE
SORT OF CRAZY I LIVE FOR!

181
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,666
- EXCELLENT. BUT BEAR IN MIND,

182
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,875
THE TEMPLE HAS ESSENTIALLY
BECOME A FORTRESS.

183
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,833
GET COCKY AND WE'LL BE FODDER
FOR THE XUAN LANG PLATOON.

184
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,958
- SO, THEN WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT UP YOUR SLEEVE?

185
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,333
- MY SLEEVE? NO FANCY TRICKS
THIS TIME AROUND, I'M AFRAID.

186
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,541
- COME ON! YOU'RE JOKING!

187
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,416
- TIME IS AGAINST US.
IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

188
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,000
- BUT SIR, CAN WE NOT
USE THE MACHINES?

189
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,250
GIVEN THE ENEMY'S NUMBER,

190
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,041
I BALK TO THINK WHAT OUR
CASUALTIES WILL BE

191
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,291
WITHOUT THE ELEMENT
OF SURPRISE ON OUR SIDE.

192
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,875
COME NOW. SURELY
OUR BRAVE CAPTAIN

193
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,416
WOULD GIVE HIS
BLESSING TO WHATEVER

194
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,041
ADVANTAGE WAS AVAILABLE.

195
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,125
- DO NOT SPEAK TO ME OF THEM.
WOULD YOU SEE PIGS FLY?

196
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,500
- SURE!

197
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,333
- NO, NO! I WILL NOT SUBMIT
TO THEIR INFERNAL WHIM!

198
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,083
- I DESPAIR MY CHARGE.

199
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,791
PLEASE, FRIENDS. FORGIVE
THE SPARSE ROOM.

200
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,833
- NOT AT ALL. MY GRATITUDE,
SIR. INDEED, MY UTMOST.

201
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,333
YOUR INTERVENTION MAY HAVE
SPARED MY LIFE OR AT THE LEAST

202
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,583
KEPT TAKI AND I TOGETHER.

203
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,125
- WON'T YOU CONSIDER
ABDICATION? PLEASE.

204
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,291
YOU MAY YET BE
TOGETHER IN FREEDOM.

205
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,750
- I WILL NOT ABDICATE!
I'VE A PROMISE TO KEEP.

206
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,375
ONE I'M LOATHE TO RECANT.

207
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,250
ONE THAT I MAY ONLY
FULFILL AS EMPEROR.

208
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,666
- FOR TAITO, YES?

209
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,250
- THAT'S CORRECT!
I TAKE IT YOU KNOW HIM?

210
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,500
- I DO.

211
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,958
- OUTSTANDING! TELL ME
HOW DOES HE FARE?

212
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,250
- WELL, SIR, RECKLESSLY
AS EVER, I FEAR.

213
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:27,208
- THAT RINGS TRUE. GOOD TAITO,
YOU MAY LAUGH AT THIS...

214
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,375
BUT EVEN FROM THE MOMENT HE
DROPPED THROUGH THE CEILING.

215
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,708
IT NEVER FELT AS THOUGH
WE WERE STRANGERS.

216
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,791
- SUCH IS THE BOND
OF BROTHERHOOD.

217
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,708
- ( gasps )

218
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,125
- THIS IS WHAT I CALL FUN!

219
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,583
- Man: TO ARMS, MEN!
WE'RE UNDER SIEGE!

220
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,833
- THE HELL?

221
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
- OH, WOW! THIS IS GREAT!

222
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,125
- NO KIDDING! THE WO JIN
GUYS HAVE IT ALL!

223
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,166
NOBODY CAN TOUCH US UP HERE!

224
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,166
- GOOD NEWS. HOSEI'S QUITE
TAKEN WITH HIS TASK.

225
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,041
- I HATE THIS!

226
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,291
WE WEREN'T MEANT TO FLY! EVER!

227
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,250
WE SAW FURTHER WEALTH
OF COMMON SENSE

228
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,875
WITH EVERY PUMP OF THE BELLOWS.

229
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,625
WHO DEVISED THESE
LUDICROUS CONTRAPTIONS?

230
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,875
- YOU, SIR.

231
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,166
- DAMN MY HUBRIS!

232
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,583
- WE'RE HERE.

233
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,458
- SAFE TO SAY WE'VE
ESCAPED THEIR NOTICE.

234
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,583
- IF THEY DIDN'T
HEAR YOU SCREAMING.

235
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,750
- GOOD POINT, TAITO. YOUR
FEAR OF HEIGHTS

236
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,750
ALMOST DESPOILED
THE PLAN, BRAVE CAPTAIN.

237
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:26,333
- WOW SERIOUSLY? I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE AFRAID OF ANYTHING!

238
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,291
- QUIET! ARE WE
DOING THIS OR NOT?

239
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,333
- ( yawning )

240
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,666
- DON'T MOVE! REFRAIN
FROM PLAYING GAMES

241
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,166
AND YOU JUST MIGHT LIVE.

242
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,666
- YES, MA'AM.

243
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,500
- ( thud )

244
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,208
- NO NEED TO BE SCARED. IT'S ME.

245
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,208
- RANK AMATEURS.
BUNCHED TOGETHER.

246
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,708
THEY MIGHT AS WELL FIT THAT
BUILDING WITH A TARGET.

247
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,875
- SO WHAT DO WE DO?

248
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,083
- WE PLAY IT SAFE.
BEST TO STAY PUT.

249
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,208
- WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR? COME ON!

250
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,416
- TAITO!

251
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,666
- LONG TIME NO SEE!
LOOKING FANCY!

252
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,000
- MY FRIEND, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

253
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,083
- I'M HERE TO RESCUE
YOU TWO, OF COURSE!

254
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,583
- RESCUE? ARE YOU MAD?

255
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,250
- SURE, WHATEVER. LET'S GO.

256
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,083
- BEFORE WE DO. WE'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONES BEING HELD.

257
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,000
A GIRL IS IMPRISONED
VERY CLOSE BY.

258
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,291
- OH, DON'T WORRY. WE'RE
ALL OVER THAT ONE, TOO.

259
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,541
- TAITO!

260
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,250
- DAMN IT! THEY HAVE
US BOXED IN!

261
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,625
- WHAT NOW?

262
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,041
- YOU FIREBOMBED LORD
KEIRO'S HOUSE TO DIVERT US,

263
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,875
THINKING YOU COULD
BAG YOUR QUARRY.

264
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,291
A CLEVER STRATAGEM, IN ITS WAY.

265
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:52,125
INTERESTING, SHOKAKU
SAW THIS. CLEARLY.

266
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,750
YOU'VE NOWHERE TO RUN!

267
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,500
SURRENDER PEACEFULLY, ALKAID!

268
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,000
- CAREFUL.
- STAY BACK, SIS.

269
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,416
- YOU GOT IT. BE SAFE.

270
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,875
- DON'T BE AN IMBECILE!

271
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,458
STAND DOWN! YOU CAN'T TAKE
THEM ALL ON! YOU'LL FALL!

272
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,583
- A REAL MAN STAYS AND FIGHTS.

273
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:12,291
WHATEVER THE ODDS.
PERIOD! YOU HEAR ME?

274
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,083
- YOU FOOL. JUST WHO
ARE YOU TRYING TO IMPRESS?

275
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,833
CAPITULATE!

276
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,333
- NOT A CHANCE,
OLD-TIMER. COME ON,

277
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:25,083
YOU WANT A PIECE OF THIS.
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.

278
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,208
- YOU THINK SO?
ANTE UP THEN, ALKAID!

279
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,125
- LET'S SEE IF THAT FABLED MIGHT

280
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,958
IS ON PAR WITH THE
WARRIOR GOD YOU'RE SO HUNGRY

281
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,583
TO PIT YOURSELF AGAINST!

282
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,791
I'VE GOT HIM! DODGING THIS
BLOW ISN'T AN OPTION, BOY!

283
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,000
HOW WILL YOU COUNTER?

284
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,125
- TAITO!

285
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,583
- WHAT THE?

286
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,375
IMPOSSIBLE!

287
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,125
- ( chuckles ) AW, DARN. MY BAD.

288
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:08,083
- THIS CAN'T BE! HE FELLED
KOCHO WITH JUST ONE HIT!

289
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,125
- SO THIS IS ALKAID, THE
ONLY MAN TO HAVE

290
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,583
CROSSED SWORDS WITH LORD KEIRO

291
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,833
AND WOUNDED HIM, EVER.

292
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,375
- ( soldiers groaning )

293
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,416
- RYUSHO!

294
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,541
- WELL DONE. YOU'VE
MADE GREAT STRIDES.

295
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,041
QUITE THE WARRIOR INDEED!

296
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,500
- WELL, TO BE HONEST I HAVE
BEEN WORKING ON MY TECHNIQUE

297
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,583
A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW.

298
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,416
- YOUR MAJESTY.
- GENERAL? YOU'RE HERE?

299
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,833
- YOU'RE UNHARMED,
I'M SO THANKFUL.

300
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,666
- ( all screaming )

301
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,666
- TAITO! LET'S CLEAR A PATH!

302
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,666
- YOU BET!
- DID HE SAY TAITO?

303
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,333
COULD HE BE?

304
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,291
- FOLLOW ME! WE'RE MAKING
A BREAK FOR IT!

305
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,541
- TONIGHT'S NOT YOUR NIGHT.
