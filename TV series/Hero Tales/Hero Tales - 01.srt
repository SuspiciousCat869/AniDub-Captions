1
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,000
- ( panting )

2
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:05,708
- ( metal clanging )

3
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:08,833
- KANYO. JUST TRY
TO HOLD ON, PLEASE.

4
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,375
- IS THAT YOU, TAITO?

5
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,083
YEAH, IT'S ME.
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

6
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:13,916
HOW MANY ATTACKERS ARE THERE?

7
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,666
- JUST, JUST ONE.
- SERIOUSLY?

8
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:18,916
- ( screams )

9
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:48,375
- AT LAST XIAN JIA LAN WU,
THE SWORD OF RULE,

10
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:51,041
SHALL BE CLASPED
BY A HAND FIT TO WIELD IT.

11
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:52,708
- ( grunts )

12
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,833
- HMM?

13
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:59,958
BASTARD! MOWING INNOCENT PEOPLE
DOWN LIKE THEY WERE NOTHING.

14
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:02,041
WHY SHOULD I LET YOU
DRAW ONE MORE BREATH?

15
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:07,041
IF I WERE YOU, I'D RUN!

16
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,166
( grunts )

17
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,041
- THEY WHO STAND IN THE WAY
OF DESTINY SHALL FALL.

18
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,083
FANCY MOVE.

19
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:20,458
GUESS I CAN SEE HOW YOU STORMED
THE TEMPLE SINGLE HANDEDLY.

20
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:24,125
- MY PRIZE IS THE SWORD OF RULE,
BLADE OF CONQUERORS.

21
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,708
IT IS ACQUIRED EITHER
BY ONE'S METTLE ALONE

22
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:27,583
OR NOT AT ALL.

23
01:02:27,666 --> 01:02:29,291
- STOP YAMMERING AND FIGHT.

24
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,208
THE ONLY THING YOU ARE
ACQUIRING TONIGHT, MOUSTACHE,

25
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:33,166
IS THE HONOR OF BEING
CONQUERED BY ME.

26
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:36,500
( grunts )

27
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,208
- TOO SLOW.

28
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,166
( grunting continues )

29
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:55,958
- YOU GOADED ME INTO USING
MY RIGHT ARM. VERY IMPRESSIVE.

30
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:57,666
- ( exclaims )

31
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,541
- DO NOT TOUCH THAT SWORD!

32
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:09,083
- ( groaning )

33
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:13,875
- DAMN YOU.

34
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,625
- UNHAND THE BLADE AT ONCE

35
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,250
AND I WILL FORGIVE
YOUR LACK OF DECORUM.

36
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,750
- HA! IN YOUR
DREAMS, MOUSTACHE.

37
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:22,166
OH, NOW, YOU'RE
REALLY IN FOR IT.

38
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,250
I'M NOT A GUY
YOU WANNA MESS WITH.

39
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,791
- FOOLISH BOY.

40
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,791
YOU GRIP THE HILT OF A WEAPON

41
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:30,750
FAR BEYOND THE POWER OF AN
INSECT LIKE YOU TO UNSHEATHE.

42
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:33,125
- SHUT YOUR FACE.

43
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:34,500
( grunting )

44
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:39,708
- NO, IMPOSSIBLE.

45
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,708
- ( screams )

46
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:52,458
- WHAT IN THE HELL WAS THAT?

47
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:55,541
- XIAN JIA LAN WU
CHOOSES ALKAID OVER ME?

48
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,000
( screams ) NO!

49
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:03,583
THE HEAVENS WILL SEE
OUR FINAL RECKONING THIS NIGHT.

50
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:06,208
- WHAT? WHY DOES EVERYTHING
YOU SAY SOUND CRAZY?

51
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:08,958
- I WILL VANQUISH YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

52
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,250
- THEN WALK THE WALK, MOUSTACHE.

53
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,500
WHAT WAS THAT SHOCKWAVE
ALL ABOUT JUST NOW?

54
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,791
DON'T TELL ME THIS GUY'S
BEEN HOLDING OUT.

55
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,166
- ( yelling )

56
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:42,833
- DIE!

57
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:52,791
- YOU'VE ONLY POWER ENOUGH
TO DRAW THE SWORD.

58
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:54,000
EVEN THOUGH ALKAID,

59
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:56,500
YOU ARE STILL LITTLE
MORE THAN A CHILD. WHAT?

60
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:02,041
- I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET.

61
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:04,750
MY FALLEN BROTHERS
WILL BE AVENGED.

62
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,250
- WILL YOU NEVER LEARN?

63
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,625
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

64
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:53,166
( gasps )

65
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,041
- ( screaming in pain )

66
01:06:04,916 --> 01:06:06,333
- ( exclaims )

67
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,291
- ALKAID!

68
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:28,041
- HAIL LORD KEIRO!
DID YOU SUCCEED?

69
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,250
THERE, BEHOLD, MEN.

70
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:35,916
YOUR LORD AND MASTER CLUTCHES
THE FABLED SWORD OF RULE,

71
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,541
AND WITH IT, THE VERY FORTUNES
OF THIS WORLD.

72
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:40,125
- ( crowd cheering )

73
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,041
- ( theme song playing )

74
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:17,166
- Sonnei: THE HEAVENLY SPHERE
PIVOTS ON THE FORTUNES

75
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,583
OF THE GREAT DIPPER,

76
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:21,875
A CELESTIAL RETINUE COMPOSED
OF SEVEN BRILLIANT STARS

77
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:25,666
UPON WHOSE DEEDS THE PRINCIPLE
OF KARMA IS SAID TO REST.

78
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,541
BUT, JUST AS HERE
IN THE EARTHLY PLANE

79
01:08:27,625 --> 01:08:29,625
YIN AND YANG HOLD SWAY,

80
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:33,500
SO, TOO, DO CONTRARY POLES
DEFINE THE GREAT DIPPER'S FORM,

81
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:37,250
DUBHE AND ALKAID,
THE WILD WARRIOR GODS OF OLD.

82
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:40,416
FOREVER CLASHING,
FOREVER CALLING UPON THE PEOPLE

83
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,166
TO CHOOSE SIDES
AND TAKE UP ARMS.

84
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:06,333
- ( panting )

85
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:08,458
( gasps ) THERE YOU ARE.

86
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,166
HOLD ON, TAITO, I'M COMING.

87
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:19,208
- ( knocking on door )

88
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:22,083
- MASTER SONNEI. SENIOR SOEI.

89
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:25,125
- NO NEED TO BE FORMAL. WE'RE
SORRY TO HAVE KEPT YOU WAITING.

90
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:26,833
THE PAST FEW DAYS
HAVE CLAIMED MORE

91
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:28,333
THAN THEIR SHARE
OF OLD FRIENDS.

92
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:31,250
- AND IF NOT FOR YOU, RYUKO,
MY SON MIGHT BE AMONG THEM.

93
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,625
OUR THANKS.

94
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:35,125
- PLEASE, WE REALLY
ONLY HAVE DUMB LUCK TO THANK.

95
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:36,375
WELL, THAT, I SUPPOSE,

96
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:39,125
AND MY TRULY DEPLORABLE
SENSE OF DIRECTION.

97
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:42,083
- NO. YOUR STUMBLING
ACROSS TAITO WAS FATE.

98
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:44,000
- AS ARE ALL THINGS, MASTER.

99
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:47,500
- FOOLS ARE A HEARTY LOT,
THEIR CARETAKERS LESS SO.

100
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:50,291
- AND I AM GRATEFUL
FOR ONE LESS KIN TO MOURN.

101
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:52,125
- PLEASE FORGIVE MY INDOLENCE.

102
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,875
- I ONLY WISH I MIGHT HAVE
ARRIVED HERE A BIT EARLIER.

103
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:57,041
- DON'T START HAUNTING
YOURSELF WITH "WHAT IFS".

104
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:59,625
I'M GUILTY ENOUGH
FOR HAVING GONE TO EMEI SHAN.

105
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:02,208
- AND I INVITED YOU
TO THE MOON VIEWING.

106
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:04,166
- PERHAPS THERE'S NOTHING
WE COULD'VE DONE.

107
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:07,041
I MEAN, THE QING LONG PLATOON
AND THE PRIESTS OF LIAN TONG,

108
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:10,500
ALL OVERWHELMED BY A SINGLE MAN.
IT BEGGARS BELIEF.

109
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:13,250
- EVEN ALKAID WAS HELPLESS
AGAINST HIM.

110
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:15,625
- MASTER SONNEI, YOU MEAN...

111
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:20,333
- Laila: TAITO. TAITO.

112
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,458
HEY, TAI... OH, SORRY.
HI, MASTER SONNEI.

113
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:26,625
- ( laughs ) YOU'RE
IN HIGH SPIRITS TODAY, LAILA.

114
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:28,291
- WELL, I WOULD BE
IF MY STUPID BROTHER

115
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:29,916
WASN'T BEING SUCH A PAIN.

116
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:33,916
( laughs ) IS...

117
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,166
- HE'S OUT OF THE WOODS NOW.
HIS WOUNDS HAVE HEALED NICELY.

118
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:42,500
- REALLY? WELL, THEN, SOMEONE
NEEDS TO GET UP, DON'T THEY?

119
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:44,500
- ( groaning )

120
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:48,000
- RISE AND SHINE, SLEEPY HEAD.
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

121
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:50,041
- YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
A PERCUSSION, GENIUS.

122
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:51,416
- YOU MEAN CONCUSSION.

123
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,500
- SHUT UP.
I KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

124
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,000
- ( screams )

125
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:56,791
RUN FOR YOUR LIVES. THERE'S
AN ANGRY IDIOT ON THE LOOSE.

126
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:59,375
- YOU'D BETTER RUN AWAY.
DAMN IT. 

127
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:01,125
- I TAKE IT THEY KNOW
EACH OTHER?

128
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:04,791
- MY DEAR SWEET DAUGHTER.
HIS LOVING SISTER.

129
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:07,458
- ( laughing loudly )

130
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:11,333
- OH, WHEN I GET MY HANDS
ON YOU, YOU'RE GONNA BE SORRY.

131
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:13,166
- AW, AND WHAT'S GRUMPY
GONNA DO?

132
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,291
UH, TAITO, WHAT ARE YOU
STARING AT?

133
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:30,541
- ( people chattering )

134
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:49,666
- KANYO...

135
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,083
LIAN TONG TEMPLE WAS MY HOME,
TAI SHAN MY GARDEN.

136
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:59,000
THE PRIESTS AND THE BRAVE
WARRIORS OF QUING LONG PLATOON,

137
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:00,583
SOME OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.

138
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,916
- ( breathing heavily )

139
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,416
- DAMN IT!
- HOLD ON!

140
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,000
- ( grunting angrily )

141
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:13,750
- TAITO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP!

142
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:15,375
- ( rumbling )
- ( Laila screaming )

143
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:22,416
- WHAT KIND OF A MORON ARE YOU?
LASHING OUT LIKE THAT?

144
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,083
- YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

145
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,541
- WHAT?

146
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,166
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY PERSON
WHO MISSES THEM, YOU KNOW.

147
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:30,625
THEY WERE ALL MY FRIENDS, TOO.
WE'RE THE LUCKY ONES HERE, TAI.

148
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:32,750
LOOK, THOSE PEOPLE
THERE HAD EVERYTHING

149
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:34,083
TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM.

150
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:37,125
WE STILL HAVE OUR LIVES.
WE STILL HAVE EACH OTHER.

151
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:40,333
AND WE STILL HAVE OUR MEMORIES
OF THEM TO KEEP THEM ALIVE.

152
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:41,541
- ( grunts )

153
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:45,625
I'M STRONG, RIGHT?
I'M A FIGHTER

154
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,041
THEN, WHY COULDN'T I BEAT HIM?

155
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:53,250
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

156
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:54,916
( exclaims ) HERE.

157
01:12:57,625 --> 01:12:58,916
- WAIT. LAILA...

158
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:07,333
- WHY ARE MEN SO STUPID
AND USELESS?

159
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,208
WINNING AND LOSING ARE THE ONLY
THINGS THEY EVER CARE ABOUT.

160
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:12,458
TAITO, YOU'RE A HEARTLESS IDIOT!

161
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,833
- ( grunting )

162
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,750
WHY AM I UNABLE TO DRAW IT?

163
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:37,541
THE ALKAID BOY,
HE MUST STILL BE ALIVE.

164
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:39,875
SO BE IT.

165
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:42,208
IF THE SWORD WILL NOT DEIGN
TO CHOOSE ME,

166
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:44,666
I WILL TAKE
THE LAND BY FORCE.

167
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,083
SHIMEI, EMERGE.

168
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:51,333
- EVER THE WARY EYE
HAS MY LORD KEIRO.

169
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:54,166
- EVEN THE DEAD FIND
NO QUARTER IN WHICH TO HIDE.

170
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:55,375
- DO IT.

171
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:57,541
- WITH PLEASURE, YOUR GRACE.
REST ASSURED.

172
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:07,958
- ALKAID MUST PERISH, AS WILL
ALL WHO STAND IN MY WAY.

173
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:11,291
- Ryuko: INCREDIBLE.

174
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:12,625
THE BLADE OF CONQUERORS?

175
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,083
THE SHINING SYMBOL
OF THE XIAN EMPIRE'S DESTINY?

176
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:17,666
- INDEED. THE VERY SAME.

177
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:21,041
HE WHO UNSHEATHES IT REIGNS,
ACCORDING TO THEIR FATE.

178
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:23,833
- BUT I THOUGHT EMPEROR TAIGA
POSSESSED THE SWORD OF RULE?

179
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:25,416
- HIS IS A RUSE.

180
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,125
THE REAL ONE HAS BEEN HIDDEN
IN THE LIAN TONG TEMPLE

181
01:14:28,208 --> 01:14:29,250
FOR YEARS.

182
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,166
- WHY SHOULD THE EMPEROR
NEED A RUSE?

183
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,416
- BECAUSE, MY BOY,
HE COULD NOT DRAW THE BLADE.

184
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,000
- HE'S A FRAUD?

185
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:38,625
- HIS POSITION CERTAINLY
IS A PRECARIOUS ONE.

186
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,666
HE'D PREFER NOT TO
ANNOUNCE THE FACT.

187
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:43,500
THE EMPIRE STANDS ON THE BRINK
OF RUIN AND DISSOLUTION

188
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,166
AS IT IS.

189
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:48,041
- ( grunts ) WE'VE KEPT UP
THE MASQUERADE,

190
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:50,250
AND THIS IS
WHERE IT'S GOTTEN US.

191
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:54,125
- SO, THE BANDIT'S INTENTION
WAS TO STEAL XIAN JIA LAN WU.

192
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:56,041
ANY IDEA WHO HE WAS?

193
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,916
- A FACTION OF TROOPS
WERE SEEN IN THE MOUNTAINS.

194
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,708
THEY BORE FLAGS EMBLAZONED
WITH THE SIGN OF THE WOLF.

195
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:05,708
- THEY WHAT? SUCH FLAGS
ARE BORNE ONLY BY THE ELITE.

196
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:08,875
- Soei: OF THE IMPERIAL ARMY,
YES.

197
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:11,583
- SUCH FOOLISHNESS.
THEIR GAMBIT IS FOLLY.

198
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:13,791
- ONLY THE SWORD ITSELF
MAY CHOOSE.

199
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

200
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:17,083
- HE WHO WOULD FORCE
THE HAND OF FATE

201
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:18,791
HAS LEFT THE PATH OF WISDOM.

202
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:20,708
SUCH A WEAPON CANNOT
BE UNSHEATHED

203
01:15:20,791 --> 01:15:22,750
BY CUNNING
OR BRUTE STRENGTH.

204
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:24,958
IT ALONE DECREES IT'S MASTER.

205
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:50,750
- YOU BASTARD. I'LL MAKE YOU PAY
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

206
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,750
- MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE HARSH.
POOR GUY.

207
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:00,625
( inhales ) OKAY.

208
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,500
HEY, TAITO.

209
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:08,083
- ( exclaiming )

210
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:13,041
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

211
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:14,333
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

212
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:15,875
I COULD'VE PLUNDERED
TO MY DEATH.

213
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:17,333
- I THINK YOU MEAN PLUMMETED.

214
01:16:17,416 --> 01:16:20,708
- SHUT YOUR FACE.
I KNOW WHAT I MEANT!

215
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:23,416
- OH, COME ON. DON'T BE MAD.

216
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,208
YOUR ADORABLE SISTER
WANTS TO SEE YOU SMILE.

217
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:29,291
- OKAY, YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD.
- I'M ACTING WEIRD?

218
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:31,125
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
TRADED THE CAREFREE TAITO

219
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:33,458
WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE
FOR THIS GLOOMY GUY.

220
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:40,083
- HEY, UH, THANKS
FOR PICKING THOSE HERBS.

221
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:43,875
- YEAH, WELL, I'M JUST
GLAD THERE'S NO HERB

222
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:45,125
FOR CURING STUPIDITY.

223
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:47,166
I'D BE PICKING THAT ONE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

224
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,166
- STOP MAKING FUN OF ME.

225
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:50,250
YOU KNOW I AM STILL YOUR
OLDER BROTHER,

226
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:51,750
EVEN IF WE'RE
NOT RELATED BY BLOOD.

227
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:54,208
- I KNOW, YOU'D BE SMARTER
IF WE WERE.

228
01:16:54,291 --> 01:16:55,375
- ( chuckles )

229
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:57,208
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'D BETTER RUN.

230
01:17:14,958 --> 01:17:16,958
- OH, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

231
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:18,750
HE DOES HAVE SOME SKILL,

232
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:20,916
ALAS, NOT ENOUGH
TO BE A THREAT.

233
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,625
ALKAID WOULD HAVE SENSED ME
LONG BEFORE NOW.

234
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:25,625
SO, WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

235
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:30,000
AN EXCELLENT IDEA.

236
01:17:31,666 --> 01:17:33,416
- ( thunder rumbling )

237
01:17:39,666 --> 01:17:41,416
- ( martial art cries )

238
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:45,416
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

239
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,166
I JUST FINISHED DOING
THE LAUNDRY.

240
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:48,875
- Shimei: GOOD AFTERNOON,
YOUNG LADY.

241
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,000
- ( gasps )

242
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,791
- SORRY TO STARTLE YOU.

243
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:56,291
MY MASTER'S DISPATCHED ME
ON A VERY IMPORTANT ERRAND.

244
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:58,708
- IMPORTANT TO HIM, AT
LEAST, HOWEVER...

245
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:00,208
- WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS WITH ME?

246
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:03,625
- I'VE COME TO SEE WHAT ALKAID
IS CAPABLE OF, DEAR HEART.

247
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:05,333
- DID YOU JUST SAY "ALKAID"?

248
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:08,708
- IF I FIND HIS POWERS WANTING,
I AM TO DESTROY HIM.

249
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:10,583
THAT'S THE GIST OF IT, ANYWAY.

250
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:11,625
- ( exclaims )

251
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:16,166
( Laila screaming )

252
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,125
- I KNOW THAT SCREAM.
SIS, I'M COMING.

253
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:28,458
LAILA, WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU OKAY?

254
01:18:28,541 --> 01:18:31,250
- STAY AWAY FROM ME.
JUST GO.

255
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:33,125
- WHY'D YOU YELL? SOMETHING...

256
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:37,083
( groaning )

257
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:38,458
- HEY, WHAT GIVES?

258
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:41,541
- TAI. I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT THE ONE DOING IT.

259
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:43,666
- PRETTY USEFUL TRICK, EH?

260
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:48,250
I HAVE TO SAY, THE GIRL MAKES
AN EXQUISITE MARIONETTE.

261
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:50,291
- YOU SON OF A...
- NOW, NOW...

262
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:52,250
- DON'T WASTE THAT PRECIOUS
ANGER ON WORDS.

263
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:54,375
I CAME TO SEE
ALKAID IN ACTION.

264
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:57,625
- WAIT. THAT NAME,
I'VE HEARD IT BEFORE.

265
01:18:57,708 --> 01:19:01,875
- HAVE YOU NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE?
- PLEASE, STOP THIS.

266
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:04,708
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S
BEEN KEPT IN THE DARK.

267
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:07,291
ALKAID IS A WARRIOR GOD,
A WRATHFUL STAR

268
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,583
DESTINED TO PLUNGE THE
EARTHLY PLANE INTO CHAOS

269
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:12,250
AS HE SLAKES HIS UNQUENCHABLE
THIRST FOR DESTRUCTION.

270
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:13,833
- WHAT?

271
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:16,125
- YOU, I'M AFRAID, GET THE
BALANCE OF HIS KARMIC DEBT.

272
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:19,208
THE MARK UPON YOUR BODY
LEAVES NO ROOM FOR DOUBT.

273
01:19:19,291 --> 01:19:20,916
MY MASTER, LORD KEIRO,

274
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,166
BEARS THE MARK OF
ALKAID'S OPPOSITE, DUBHE,

275
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:25,916
WITH WHOM YOU'RE FATED
TO SCRAPE SHIELDS.

276
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,875
- WAIT A MINUTE. YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU'RE MOUSTACHE'S LACKEY?

277
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:34,833
( screaming )
YOU BASTARD!

278
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:38,750
- ( laughing )
OH MY. THIS IS TOO EASY.

279
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:41,875
TRUE, I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE MUCH OF A CHALLENGE,

280
01:19:41,958 --> 01:19:44,083
BUT THIS IS PATHETIC!

281
01:19:44,166 --> 01:19:45,500
- ( grunting )

282
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:47,291
- TAITO.

283
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:53,958
- YOU'VE GOT QUITE A LONG WAY
TO GO BEFORE YOU CAN LIVE UP

284
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:55,458
TO YOUR STAR'S EXAMPLE.

285
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,500
YOU LACK AMBITION,
RESOLVE, CUNNING,

286
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:01,000
AND OF COURSE HATRED.

287
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:05,875
- UGH! WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU, YOU PERV?

288
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,333
- QUITE THE FEISTY LITTLE
CHERRY BLOSSOM, EH?

289
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:10,583
JUST THE SORT OF GIRL
I CAN'T RESIST.

290
01:20:10,666 --> 01:20:13,500
- NO. LAILA...
YOU STAY AWAY FROM HER.

291
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:18,000
- ( Laila gasps )

292
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:21,708
- CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE
VERY SLOW TO ANGER.

293
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:23,500
THEY'RE MUCH LIKELIER
TO BE PROVOKED

294
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:26,375
WHEN THE LIFE OF A LOVED ONE
HANGS IN THE BALANCE.

295
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:28,916
NOW LET'S SEE,
WHERE IS THE HEART?

296
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:33,791
- STOP IT, DAMN YOU! STOP IT!

297
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:36,916
- OH, DOES THIS BORE YOU?
HOW ABOUT THIS?

298
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:42,041
- ( Laila screaming )
- LAILA! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

299
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:44,708
- I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY
OF MAKING THINGS MORE EXCITING.

300
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:47,250
WATCHING A LOVELY YOUNG THING
STRANGLE HERSELF

301
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:48,666
IS SUCH
RARE PLEASURE.

302
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:51,708
- ( laughing )
- ( choking )

303
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:55,125
- JUST LOOK AT THOSE EYES
BULGING OUT OF HER HEAD.

304
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:58,083
- BASTARD, YOU'RE DEAD,
YOU HEAR ME?

305
01:20:58,166 --> 01:21:01,166
- SUCH SAD, EMPTY LITTLE NOISES
YOU BOTH MAKE.

306
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,291
AM I SUPPOSED
TO FEEL THREATENED?

307
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:04,583
- ( whimpers ) TAITO...

308
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:07,583
- WHERE'S THAT STRENGTH?

309
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:10,416
POOR CHILD, IS THERE
NOTHING YOU CAN DO?

310
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,583
YOU FAILED TO SAVE
YOUR FRIENDS, AND NOW,

311
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:14,750
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO LIE THERE SNIVELING

312
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,208
WHILE YOUR LITTLE SISTER
DIES LIKE AN ANIMAL.

313
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,666
- ( thunder rumbling )

314
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,916
- ( explosion )

315
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,166
- NO.

316
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:37,916
- I FEEL IT. A DREADFUL POWER
HAS AWAKENED.

317
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,375
- TAITO...

318
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:47,458
- SO, THERE'S A LITTLE FIGHT
IN THE BOY AFTER ALL.

319
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:50,416
OH, THE CATASTROPHIC DEEDS
THAT HATRED WILL SPUR YOU

320
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:55,416
TO COMMIT. WELCOME BACK, ALKAID.

321
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,875
IT'S BEEN SO MANY CENTURIES
SINCE YOU AND DUBHE

322
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:01,000
HAVE CLASHED IN
THE EARTHLY REALM.

323
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,625
WHAT A FIGHT IT'LL BE!

324
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:05,625
- ( yelling )

325
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:11,250
- ( theme song playing )

326
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:43,708
- Ryuko: A STAR ROUSED FROM
THE SLEEP OF EONS LASHES OUT.

327
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:46,750
TAITO'S REACTING
TO MY OWN MARK, SIR.

328
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:49,208
- Laila: MY FATHER DIDN'T WANT
TAITO TO LEARN THE TRUTH.

329
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:52,500
HE WANTED HIM TO KNOW
A NORMAL LIFE. A PEACEFUL LIFE.

330
01:23:52,583 --> 01:23:54,541
GUESS DESTINY CAUGHT US
OFF GUARD.

331
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:56,625
- Ryuko: IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE IT KILLS YOU.

332
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:59,458
- Shimei: WE LIVE IN
INTERESTING TIMES, DON'T WE?

333
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:01,375
- Ryuko: NEXT, ON HERO TALES.

334
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:04,500
THE PATHS OF THE ETERNAL
CHAMPIONS BEGIN TO CONVERGE

335
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:07,500
IN "CHAPTER TWO,
THE KARMA OF MIZAR".

336
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:22,375
WHY IS MY STAR SIGIL RESONATING?
