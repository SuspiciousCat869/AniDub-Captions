1
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,291
- Keiro: A MAN'S WORTH
IS MEASURED IN

2
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,833
VOLUMES OF BLOOD SPILT,
OF LIVES DEVOURED.

3
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,625
FOR HE WHO WOULD
RULE THE WORLD

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:28,500
MUST FIRST SEE
THE WISDOM OF ABSOLUTE CRUELTY.

5
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,666
- OH, YEAH? WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,958
ABOUT BEING A MAN.

7
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,041
WHAT GOOD IS POWER
IF IT MAKES YOU A SAVAGE?

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:38,208
- SIMPLE, IMPUDENT VERMIN.
I AM THE TOLL THIS LAND MUST PAY

9
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,791
- FOR PEACE.
- FOR PEACE?

10
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,041
- AND IF SAVAGERY BE
THE MANTEL I MUST DON

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,083
TO SECURE THE PEOPLE'S FORTUNE,
SO BE IT!

12
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,666
- TO HELL WITH YOU.

13
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,166
( yells )

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,875
- DIE, ALKAID!

15
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,166
- ( theme song playing )

16
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,333
- Taito: WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS PLACE?

17
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,000
LAILA. RYUKO.
IS ANYONE THERE?

18
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,125
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,041
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

20
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,166
WHERE THE HELL
DID YOU GUYS RUN OFF TO?

21
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,583
ARE LAILA AND THEM WITH YOU?

22
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,458
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

23
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,416
HEY! WAIT.

24
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,791
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

25
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,791
RYUKO.

26
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,916
COME ON.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,958
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY
FROM ME WHILE...

28
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,583
NO. COME BACK.

29
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,875
WHAT THE...

30
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,916
OH, YEAH. I WAS FIGHTING
THAT MUSTACHED BASTARD.

31
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,250
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

32
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,000
- ( creaking )

33
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,291
- JEEZ, MY FREAKING HEAD. OW!

34
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,750
OKAY...

35
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,333
HEY, RYUKO. WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING ON THIS BOAT?

36
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,208
- THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED.

37
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,166
- I KNOW YOU.

38
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,916
HE STAYED BEHIND?

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,791
YOU ALL JUST LET HIM
STAY IN THAT CAVE

40
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,791
SO WE COULD GET AWAY?
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ABOUT?

41
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,458
HOW IN THE HELL COULD YOU GUYS
JUST LEAVE HIM BEHIND LIKE THAT?

42
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,291
TELL ME! I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

43
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,125
YOU WERE ON BOARD
WITH THIS, HOSEI?

44
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,708
- WE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE.

45
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,208
WE COULD'VE EITHER ALL STAYED
AND DIED OR ONE STAY AND...

46
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,666
SO HE STAYED.

47
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,208
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT CRAP, MAN.
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT!

48
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,875
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING
ONE ANOTHER OUT HERE.

49
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,375
NO ONE IS ALONE.

50
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,166
NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE
LEFT BEHIND TO DIE LIKE THAT.

51
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,458
TURN THIS PIECE OF CRAP AROUND
RIGHT NOW!

52
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,916
YOU HEAR ME?
WE'RE CHANGING COURSE!

53
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,125
- IT'S TOO LATE. SEVERAL DAYS
LATE AS A MATTER OF FACT.

54
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,375
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE BOY

55
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,875
WHO HAS BEEN SPENDING
HIS TIME IN DREAMLAND,

56
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,708
SHUT HIS MOUTH TILL
HE'S UP TO SPEED.

57
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,541
- DREAMLAND?

58
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,833
- YOU'VE HAD QUITE
AN EASY TIME OF IT, LAD.

59
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,083
FIRST YOU RESIGN YOURSELF
FROM BATTLE AND KEEL OVER

60
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,250
IN A PITIFUL SLUMP
AT THE FEET OF THE ENEMY,

61
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,666
THEN SLEEP FOR DAYS
AND WAKE UP WHINING

62
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,458
LIKE A CHILD.

63
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,000
A SPOILED LITTLE CHILD.
- WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?

64
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,208
- TELL US WHAT FRIEND
WOULD YOU HAVE DEEMED FIT TO DIE

65
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,833
IF RYUKO HAD NOT
VOLUNTEERED HIS LIFE?

66
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,000
FACED WITH THAT DILEMMA,

67
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,791
RYUKO CHOSE TO SAVE
THE ONES DEAR TO HIM

68
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,458
AND MET HIS OWN END
WITHOUT CONCEIT.

69
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,458
HE PUT THE LIVES OF OTHERS
BEFORE HIS OWN.

70
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,208
THANKS TO HIS ACT OF SACRIFICE,

71
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,291
YOU CAN STILL DRAW BREATH

72
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,916
WITH WHICH TO
VOICE YOUR COMPLAINTS.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,333
YOUR FRIENDS HONORED HIS ACTIONS

74
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,791
BY PRESERVING THE LIVES
HE CHERISHED.

75
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,041
PERHAPS YOU COULD
HONOR THEM AS WELL

76
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,166
AND BE THANKFUL
YOU ARE ALL ALIVE

77
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,000
TO DISCUSS THE
MERITS OF HIS DEEDS.

78
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,125
WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING,

79
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,916
THEY'VE HAD MUCH TIME
TO MOURN RYUKO

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,541
AND COMFORT EACH OTHER
FOR THEIR LOSS.

81
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,500
- I'M SORRY.

82
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,375
- I SENT A SCOUTING PARTY
TO INVESTIGATE

83
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,958
THE SCENE AT THE CAVE.

84
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,208
I EXPECT THEIR RETURN SOON.

85
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,833
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY MAY FIND.

86
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,375
- WE'VE ALL RETURNED SAFELY.
- WITH WHAT NEWS?

87
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,583
- IT WAS JUST
AS WE HAD EXPECTED.

88
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,416
NOT A SOUL WAS TO BE FOUND THERE
INCLUDING KEIRO'S MINIONS.

89
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,541
- DID THEY LEAVE
ANY KIND OF CLUES BEHIND?

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,833
- ( gasping ) THAT'S HIS BLADE.

91
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,083
- I'M SORRY.
- MAYBE RYUKO JUST DROPPED IT.

92
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,708
- DON'T WORRY.

93
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,916
I'LL MAKE SURE THAT
BASTARD ANSWERS FOR THIS.

94
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,416
YOU HEAR?

95
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,750
- I DO. BUT STILL YOU WON'T.
- LISTEN UP, FRIEND,

96
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,791
IF IT WASN'T FOR RYUKO

97
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,833
I WOULDN'T EVEN
BE ALIVE RIGHT NOW.

98
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,750
I OWE HIM BIG TIME
AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY

99
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,500
I KNOW HOW TO PAY HIM BACK.

100
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,000
ARE YOU GONNA STAND IN MY WAY?

101
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,041
- IF YOU TRULY WISH
TO PAY HIM BACK,

102
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:30,125
PROTECT THE LIFE HE SAVED.
THE LIFE HE DIED FOR.

103
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,625
IF MIZAR THOUGHT IT NECESSARY
TO ACT AS A BREAKWATER

104
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,666
BETWEEN ALKAID AND DUBHE,

105
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,625
WE SHOULD ALSO HONOR
HIS WISH TO PRESERVE THE PEACE.

106
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,875
TRY AS WE MIGHT,

107
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,458
WE SIMPLY CANNOT SHIRK
FROM THE SACRED BURDEN

108
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,833
OUR CELESTIAL BODIES
SHACKLE TO US.

109
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,333
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

110
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,375
- YOU BEAR THE MARK
OF THE STARS AS WELL?

111
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,125
- YOU'RE MEGREZ?

112
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,958
- BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
THAT YOU WERE A DIPPER BEARER

113
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,500
UNTIL JUST THIS MOMENT?

114
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,541
- NOW, LET US NOT BE CONTENT
TO IDLY FLOAT ADRIFT.

115
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,541
WE MUST SET A NEW COURSE
AND MAKE ALL PREPARATIONS

116
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,375
TO HARBOR OUR VESSEL
AND OUR SPIRITS AT LIAN TONG!

117
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,583
- YES, SIR!

118
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,333
- YOU'RE FAMILIAR
WITH LIAN TONG, TOO?

119
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,291
- I AM.

120
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,125
AND QUITE INTIMATELY,
IN FACT.

121
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,375
AT LEAST, ENOUGH TO KNOW
IT'S THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU.

122
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,000
I SWORE UP AND DOWN
I'D NEVER RETURN THERE.

123
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,375
BUT HERE WE ARE.

124
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,750
- THE PLAYERS ARE
FINDING THEIR MARKS.

125
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,208
INHABITING THE ROLES
IN WHICH FATE HAS CAST THEM.

126
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,500
KNOWING OUR BOY TAITO,
HE'S LIKELY QUITE CONFUSED.

127
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,083
( laughs )

128
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,583
- WELL, THIS IS NICE.

129
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,708
GETTING TO TRAVEL
BY BOAT LIKE THIS, I MEAN.

130
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,500
KOYO'S BEEN REALLY GREAT
HELPING US OUT LIKE HE HAS.

131
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,625
AH, AND THIS WEATHER
IS SIMPLY AMAZING.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,250
COME ON, TAI,
YOU'VE GOTTA CHEER UP.

133
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,291
MAYBE YOU COULD FIND SOMETHING

134
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,750
THAT TAKES YOUR MIND
OFF EVERYTHING?

135
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,708
HOSEI'S HELPING WITH ROWING.

136
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,125
RINMEI'S SHOWING OFF
HER COOKING SKILLS.

137
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,750
THE CREW IS ACTUALLY
A LOT NICER THAN THEY LOOK.

138
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,625
THEY APPRECIATE WHATEVER WE DO.

139
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,750
THEY EVEN GIVE US A HAND
WHEN WE TRY TO HELP.

140
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,208
YOU KNOW, THEY ALWAYS SEEM
TO NEED MORE LOOKOUTS.

141
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,208
OR, MAYBE, YOU COULD EVEN LEARN
HOW TO DO SOMETHING NEW

142
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,333
THAT'S REALLY FUN.

143
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,083
- TELL ME SOMETHING.
- ( gasps ) WHAT'S UP?

144
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,166
- WHAT'D HE SAY?

145
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,458
WHAT WAS THE LAST THING
RYUKO SAID?

146
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,125
- ( shouting )

147
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,541
RINMEI! HOSEI!

148
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,041
GET TAITO AND LAILA
OUT OF HERE NOW!

149
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,500
I'LL STAY AND FEND OFF KEIRO!

150
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,583
- IT'S JUST LIKE
KOYO SAID EARLIER.

151
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,333
THEY HONORED HIS WISHES
AND WORKED TOGETHER

152
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,833
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE SAFE.

153
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,416
THEY ONLY LEFT BECAUSE
RYUKO HAD ASKED THEM TO.

154
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,791
- Taito: WE DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW EACH OTHER FOR VERY LONG.

155
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,125
BUT I THOUGHT
I UNDERSTOOD HIM.

156
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,333
I THOUGHT WE WERE
OF THE SAME SPIRIT.

157
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,166
THAT WE COULD COMMUNICATE
WITHOUT WORDS.

158
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,083
THE TRUTH IS, WE DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW EACH OTHER AT ALL.

159
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,125
BUT HE ENDED UP ALONE
IN THAT CAVE BECAUSE OF ME.

160
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,833
NO. BECAUSE OF ALL THIS
STAR NONSENSE.

161
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,000
THIS CURSE. MY DAMN CURSE
COST HIM HIS LIFE.

162
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,500
- TAITO.

163
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,375
- IT'S ALL MY FAULT! NONE OF US
ARE EVER GONNA SEE HIM AGAIN

164
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,916
BECAUSE OF WHO I AM.

165
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,750
- RYUKO DID WHAT HE HAD TO DO
BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS FATE.

166
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,166
IT WASN'T BECAUSE
YOU MADE HIM DO IT, TAITO.

167
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,000
IT WAS JUST HIS FATE
AS ONE OF THE DIVINE WARRIORS.

168
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,291
- YOU'RE WRONG! WITHOUT ME
HE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE!

169
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,041
HE'D STILL BE HAPPY
AT HOME, AT THE TEMPLE

170
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,458
WITH RYUSHO AND RINMEI

171
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,083
AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE
HE CARED ABOUT.

172
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,166
IT'S LIKE I...
LIKE I KILLED HIM MYSELF.

173
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,041
I AM THE ONE WHO'S REALLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS DEATH.

174
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,625
NOT JUST HIM.

175
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,458
THE QING LONG PLATOON AND KOEI
ARE ALL DEAD BECAUSE OF ME!

176
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,166
DAMN IT!
I MIGHT AS WELL BE POISON.

177
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,875
IF YOU WANNA STAY ALIVE,
KEEP AWAY FROM ME!

178
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,833
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S NOT ALL YOUR FAULT.

179
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,625
IT'S NOT. ( sobs )

180
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,666
- DON'T MAKE HER CRY JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A BAD MOOD!

181
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,000
ALL YOU'VE DONE SINCE WAKING UP
IS WHINE ON AND ON

182
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,958
ABOUT YOURSELF!

183
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,625
- NO! PLEASE DON'T HURT HIM!

184
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,583
- RYUKO WENT DOWN IN THAT CAVE
ALL BECAUSE OF YOU, HUH?

185
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,458
I HAD TO STRIKE DOWN THE WOMAN
WHO RAISED ME BECAUSE OF YOU.

186
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,208
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU ARE THAT IMPORTANT?

187
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,291
DO YOU?

188
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,250
JUST GET THE HELL
OVER YOURSELF!

189
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,541
( grunting )

190
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,916
- STOP! PLEASE STOP IT, HOSEI!

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,791
- FORGIVE ME, LAILA.
I AM SICK OF YOUR CRAP!

192
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,166
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN

193
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,458
WHETHER YOU'RE AROUND OR NOT.

194
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,833
IT DOESN'T MATTER!

195
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,333
SO STOP BEING
SUCH A DAMNED COWARD

196
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,625
AND FACE YOUR FATE
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HAD TO.

197
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,791
JUST BE A MAN
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE.

198
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,541
- HOSEI, PLEASE.
YOU'LL KILL HIM.

199
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,250
- GO AHEAD.

200
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,458
I DESERVE WHATEVER'S
COMING TO ME.

201
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,166
IT'S A PAYMENT FOR ALL
THE PAIN AND SUFFERING

202
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,416
I'VE CAUSED EVERYBODY.

203
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,958
IT'LL FINALLY PUT AN END
TO THIS CURSE OF THE ALKAID.

204
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,625
- YOU CAN'T KEEP ON
LIKE THIS, TAITO.

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

206
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,958
WHY DOES THIS
HAVE TO BE OUR FATE?

207
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,041
- DO YOU THINK
HE CAN SURVIVE THIS?

208
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,041
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
BUT WHETHER HE LIVES OR DIES,

209
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,875
WE STILL HAVE TO ACCEPT
THE HAND THAT FATE

210
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,500
HAS SEEN FIT TO DEAL US.

211
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,416
- I'M AWARE OF THAT.
BUT STILL...

212
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,541
- BUT STILL WHAT?

213
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,916
- HAVE YOU SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN
THAT WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL

214
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,791
WITH THAT BOY OUT THERE?

215
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,125
FOR MY OWN REASONS,
I WANT HIM TO SUCCEED.

216
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,000
- ALL RIGHT, YOU SALTY DOGS,
SHIFT CHANGING TIME.

217
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,375
TEAM NUMBER THREE PLEASE
REPORT TO YOUR POSTS.

218
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,458
TEAM NUMBER ONE,
IT'S TIME TO FILL YOUR BELLIES.

219
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,916
- Man: THAT'S AWESOME.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,916
- I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH
EXCITEMENT ABOUT MEALTIME

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,291
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

222
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,416
DID KOYO NEGLECT TO FEED YOU
BEFORE I ARRIVED?

223
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,791
- HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE.

224
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,041
I THINK THE CHUM WE THREW
OVERBOARD WAS MORE FIT

225
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,041
FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION
THAN OUR USUAL FARE.

226
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,000
- IT'S TRUE.
BUT EVER SINCE YOU CAME ABOARD,

227
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,166
DINNER HAS BECOME
MY FAVORITE TIME OF DAY.

228
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,875
- SEAFOOD DUMPLINGS, FRIED RICE,

229
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,166
AND GRILLED SHRIMP
IN SWEET CHILI SAUCE.

230
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,291
THE EMPEROR WOULD BE LUCKY
TO EAT THIS WELL.

231
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,125
- HEARING SUCH PRAISE FROM YOU
MAKES IT ALL WORTHWHILE.

232
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,666
- IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING,

233
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,708
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO MAKE STEAMED PORK DUMPLINGS

234
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,083
FOR DINNER SOMETIME?

235
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,166
- THAT MOST CERTAINLY
WOULD BE A TREAT.

236
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,916
I'M SURE YOU'D MAKE
THE KIND OF PORK DUMPLINGS

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,125
EVEN THE PIGS WOULD BE
PROUD TO BE A PART OF.

238
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,416
- Man 1: YEAH. JUST THE THOUGHT
OF THEM MAKES ME DROOL.

239
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,541
- Man 2: OH, ME, TOO.

240
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,875
- SO WHAT DO YA SAY, MY LADY?

241
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,750
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

242
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,500
BUT I MADE A SOLEMN PLEDGE
TO MYSELF THAT I'D NEVER MAKE

243
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,750
SUCH A DISH AGAIN.

244
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,000
- OH, WE WOULDN'T WANNA
ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING

245
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,708
YOU DON'T WANNA DO, RIGHT?

246
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,291
- YEAH, RIGHT.

247
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,750
- ANYTHING YOU WANNA COOK
IS JUST FINE WITH US.

248
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,416
- YES. YES.
WE'RE ALL VERY SATISFIED.

249
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,291
- RYUKO.

250
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,958
- ( muffled groans )

251
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,375
- ( suspenseful music playing )

252
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,875
- MY WORD, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING? TAITO!

253
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,375
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO YOURSELF?

254
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,458
- LEAVE ME ALONE.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

255
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,583
I HAVE TO GET THIS DAMNED
PATTERN OFF MY BODY FOR GOOD.

256
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,833
I...
- STOP THIS!

257
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,625
- PLEASE HELP ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

258
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,250
I JUST WANT MY NORMAL LIFE BACK
LIKE IT USED TO BE.

259
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:15,541
I DON'T WANNA BE ALKAID ANYMORE.
I DON'T WANT THIS FATE.

260
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,500
I DON'T WANNA
BRING PAIN TO EVERYONE.

261
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,083
I JUST WANT ALL THIS TO STOP.

262
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,750
YOU GOTTA HELP ME STOP THIS.

263
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,000
- TAITO, BELIEVE ME
WHEN I TELL YOU.

264
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,458
NONE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED
TO US IS YOUR FAULT.

265
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,791
- IT'S NOT?

266
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,208
- ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
IS ACCORDING TO OUR FATE.

267
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,708
AND RYUKO KNEW THAT.
HE WOULDN'T BLAME YOU.

268
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,125
- Taiga: ENJOYING THE NIGHT AIR?

269
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,041
- YOUR MAJESTY.

270
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,375
PLEASE FORGIVE ME, HIGHNESS.

271
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,875
I APOLOGIZE IF I'VE DISTURBED
YOUR SLUMBER.

272
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,083
- FEAR NOT.

273
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,041
MY RESTLESS MIND ALONE
IS TO BLAME.

274
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:20,333
- MY THOUGHTS, TOO,
PREVENTED ME FROM SLEEPING.

275
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,875
- I SUPPOSE, MY LADY,

276
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,291
YOU'VE OVERHEARD
THE SAME JOYOUS TALK,

277
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,583
AS HAVE I?

278
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,583
- YES, I HAVE, MY LORD.

279
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,541
- I UNDERSTAND THAT
THINGS HAPPEN FOR REASONS

280
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,000
BESIDES CONCERN
FOR MY GENERAL HAPPINESS.

281
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,541
I CANNOT ESCAPE THAT FACT
OF LIFE IN MY POSITION.

282
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,958
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS
I AM QUITE HAPPY.

283
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,541
- AND MY WORK IS DONE.

284
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,958
- I DON'T THINK SHE COULD BE
ANY MORE BEAUTIFUL

285
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,208
THAN SHE ALREADY IS,

286
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,833
BUT, STILL,
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW

287
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,250
UNLESS I LOOK FOR MYSELF.

288
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,333
- SHE IS QUITE A VISION.
GIVE THE POOR BOY A LOOK.

289
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,333
- ( nervously ) OKAY.

290
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,791
- EXQUISITE!
SHE'S JUST EXQUISITE!

291
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,541
- AWW...

292
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,000
- YOU SEE,
I AM TRULY AN ARTIST.

293
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,791
- YES, BUT IT HELPS TO HAVE SUCH
A LOVELY CANVAS TO BEGIN WITH.

294
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,041
- IT IS TRUE. HER NATURAL
BEAUTY IS QUITE AN ADVANTAGE.

295
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,458
- NOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

296
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,708
- NONSENSE. IT'S TRUE,
IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRULY TRUE.

297
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,083
MASTER, MY ONLY REGRET IS
THAT YOU CAN'T BE HERE TO SEE

298
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,458
HOW OVERJOYED I AM
AT THIS MOMENT.

299
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,541
TO THINK MY BRIDE'S BEAUTY

300
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,458
WOULD SURPASS
THE MOST RADIANT SUNSET.

301
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,625
I AM THE LUCKIEST MAN
IN THE WHOLE WORLD!

302
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,500
( laughs joyously )

303
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,375
- YOU MEAN IT? YOU THINK
I REALLY LOOK THAT GOOD?

304
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,750
- YES, YES!

305
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,875
I'LL SAY IT A THOUSAND TIMES
IF YOU WANT ME TO, YES!

306
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,291
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I SHOULD SHOW TAITO!

307
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,666
OH, TAITO!

308
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,041
YOU SEE? YOUR SISTER IS
A VISION OF LOVELINESS!

309
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,625
KOYO'S SURPRISINGLY GOOD
AT PUTTING ON MAKEUP.

310
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,375
ANYWAY, HE OFFERED
TO "ENHANCE MY BEAUTY."

311
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,958
WHAT'S WRONG?

312
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,875
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE SO EXCITED?

313
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,291
WHO THE HELL CARES
HOW YOU LOOK?

314
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,083
IS THIS HOW YOU MOURN RYUKO?

315
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,125
BY PLAYING DRESS UP
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

316
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,916
- I WASN'T BEING DISRESPECTFUL.

317
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,083
- THEN JUST WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

318
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,333
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK HE'D
WANT YOU TO BE FOOLING AROUND

319
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,833
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

320
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,708
- Koyo: THAT'S ENOUGH!

321
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,791
I UNDERSTAND YOUR DESIRE
TO TURN YOUR BACK ON FATE

322
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,375
AND YOUR ROLE AS ALKAID.

323
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,625
THE TRUTH IS,

324
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,500
WHAT'S PUT YOU IN THIS
NEW FOUND SULLEN MOOD

325
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,208
IS MORE COMMONPLACE THAN COSMIC.

326
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,916
YOU'VE LOST HEART.

327
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,833
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

328
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,375
- IF YOU CAN'T HEAR ME,

329
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,875
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU ANOTHER WAY.

330
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,250
- I'M SICK OF YOU
ALWAYS LECTURING ME.

331
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,208
I DON'T NEED TO LEARN
ANYTHING FROM YOU.

332
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,541
SO, SHUT UP!

333
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,875
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
WAY BETTER THAN THAT.

334
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,666
- ( chattering )

335
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,000
- YOU'RE TOO SLOW.

336
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,583
( shouting )

337
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,041
AS WEAK MINDED AS YOU ARE NOW,

338
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,083
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL
YOU CAN BEAT ME.

339
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,083
- YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M PATHETIC.

340
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,916
I CAN'T CHANGE
MY FATE IN LIFE.

341
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,916
I CAN'T TAKE REVENGE
FOR RYUKO'S DEATH.

342
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,208
I'M NOTHING.

343
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,125
- I TOLD YOU. YOU LOST
THE FIRE INSIDE YOU.

344
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,166
TOMORROW, WE REST.

345
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,166
I WANT THIS SHIP TAKEN ASHORE
AT DAWN'S FIRST LIGHT.

346
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,958
- YES, SIR!

347
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,375
- YOU BASTARD.

348
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,083
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T DO?

349
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,833
YOU'RE JUST SOME LOW-LIFE
IN A ROTTEN BOAT

350
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,791
PLAYING CAPTAIN TO
A BUNCH OF SCUMBAGS!

351
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,875
- SEVERAL YEARS AGO,

352
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,083
THERE WAS A SMALL
FARMING VILLAGE LAID WASTE

353
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,375
BY A BLOODTHIRSTY GENERAL
NAMED KEIRO.

354
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,166
AT HIS COMMAND, A VAST ARMY
OF MINDLESS KILLERS.

355
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,250
WHATEVER REASON WAS GIVEN
TO JUSTIFY THE ATTACK,

356
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,166
IT WAS SURELY NOTHING BUT A LIE.

357
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,916
- Laila: THAT'S HORRIBLE.

358
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,458
- THE VILLAGERS' HOMES
WERE BURNED TO THE GROUND

359
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,708
AS THE PEOPLE COWERED
IN TERROR INSIDE THEM.

360
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,750
MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN
WERE SLAUGHTERED

361
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,208
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

362
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,625
THE ONLY SURVIVORS THAT DAY
WERE TWO CHILDREN

363
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,750
WHO WERE PLAYING ON A BOAT
IN THE NEARBY RIVER.

364
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,916
THOSE TWO WERE KOYO AND MYSELF.

365
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,791
WHEN WE RETURNED HOME,

366
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,208
THE FACES OF OUR FRIENDS
AND LOVED ONES WERE NO LONGER

367
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,208
EVEN RECOGNIZABLE TO US.

368
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,083
EVERYONE THAT HAD BEEN
DEAR TO OUR HEARTS

369
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,375
WERE SUDDENLY AND VIOLENTLY
TAKEN AWAY FROM US FOREVER

370
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,666
IN AN INSTANT.

371
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,875
EVERY PERSON IN THE WO JIN SQUAD
SHARES THIS TRAGEDY.

372
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,333
THE COMMON THREAD
THAT BINDS US TOGETHER

373
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,583
IS OUR LOSS.

374
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,291
ALL AT THE HANDS OF KEIRO.

375
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,125
NONE OF US CAN THINK OF HIM
WITHOUT VISIONS

376
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,750
OF BLOODY REPRISAL
DARKENING OUR HEARTS.

377
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,458
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
JUST DO IT ALREADY

378
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,166
AND SEND HIM TO HELL
WHERE HE BELONGS?

379
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,083
AND IF KOYO DOESN'T
WANT TO HIMSELF,

380
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,375
WHY WON'T HE LET ME?

381
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,791
- ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER
THAT QUESTION.

382
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,875
I DON'T CLAIM TO UNDERSTAND
THE KARMA OF THE STARS, TAITO.

383
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,875
BUT, LISTEN,

384
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,625
EVERYONE HAS TO CARRY THE
BURDEN OF THEIR OWN FATE,

385
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,791
LIKE IT OR NOT.

386
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,000
THAT FACT CANNOT BE NEGOTIATED.

387
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,333
I MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT
CHOOSE THE FATE

388
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,000
I WAS HANDED
DOWN IN THIS LIFE.

389
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,416
NOR DID YOU.

390
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,333
BUT WHAT WE CAN CHOOSE IS
HOW WE SHOULDER THE BURDEN

391
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,583
WE WERE GIVEN.

392
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,041
YOU EITHER HAVE TO
MAKE THAT DECISION

393
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,583
OR FOREVER BE
A SLAVE TO ITS WHIMS.

394
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,625
- ( theme music playing )

395
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,500
- Koyo: THE HOLE
IN TAITO'S HEART

396
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,750
THREATENS TO
ENGULF HIS SPIRIT.

397
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,958
- Hosei: YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE

398
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,666
TO TAKE IT DOWN
WITH A FLICK OF YOUR WRIST.

399
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,000
- Koyo: BUT TO TURN YOUR BACK
ON THE STARS IS TO CHOOSE

400
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,750
A POORLY LIT PATH, INDEED.

401
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,000
- Taito: WHAT IS ALKAID?

402
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,333
WHAT'S ALL THIS "KARMA OF
THE STARS" STUFF?

403
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,458
EXPLAIN IT TO ME!

404
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,708
- Rinmei: WHETHER IT
WISHES TO OR NOT,

405
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,708
A STAR AFFECTS ANY AND
EVERYTHING AROUND IT,

406
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:55,583
PROFOUNDLY.

407
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,583
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

408
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,041
- Koyo: WHAT SALVE COULD
THE ACHING SOUL HOPE TO FIND

409
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,125
ATOP SUCH AN UNFORGIVING CRAG?

410
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:06,583
ON HERO TALES, CHAPTER FIFTEEN:
"ALKAID'S GUIDEPOST."

411
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,583
- ( inaudible )

412
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,500
- Koyo: SO, WHAT DO YOU
INTEND TO DO?
