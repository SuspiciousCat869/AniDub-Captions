1
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,041
- TAITO.

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,875
- SO, THERE'S A LITTLE FIGHT
IN THE BOY AFTER ALL.

3
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:31,166
- I FEEL IT.
A DREADFUL POWER HAS AWAKENED.

4
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,250
- OH, THE CATASTROPHIC
DEEDS THAT HATRED

5
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,083
WILL SPUR YOU TO COMMIT.

6
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,666
WELCOME BACK, ALKAID.

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,750
IT'S BEEN SO MANY CENTURIES
SINCE YOU AND DUBHE

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,083
HAVE CLASHED IN
THE EARTHLY REALM.

9
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,750
WHAT A FIGHT IT'LL BE.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,041
- ( screams )

11
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,250
- RYUKO.
- YES, SIR. I FELT IT, TOO.

12
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:03,166
- HE'S AWAKE. IT BEGINS.

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,666
- ( theme song playing )

14
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,125
- ( thunder rumbling )

15
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,041
- ( screams )

16
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,458
- ( grunts )
- OH. HOW TERRIFYING.

17
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,291
- ( grunting continues )

18
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,291
- NOT BAD. NOT BAD AT ALL.

19
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,666
YOU'RE QUITE VIGOROUS
FOR SOMEONE

20
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,375
WHO'S ONLY JUST WOKEN UP.

21
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,000
- ( grunts )

22
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,625
- ALAS, MY BOY.
IMMENSELY POWERFUL

23
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,041
THOUGH YOU SEEM TO BE,

24
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,500
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON LORD KEIRO'S
FULL SURRENDER JUST YET.

25
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,416
- ( screaming )

26
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,166
- HUH. NOW IF I DIDN'T
KNOW BETTER,

27
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,875
I'D SAY
HE WAS IMPROVING.

28
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,166
- ( thunder rumbling )

29
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,500
- WHAT... WHAT IS GOING ON?

30
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,083
TAITO. LAILA.

31
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,458
- ( screams )

32
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,750
- WHY IS MY
STAR SIGIL RESONATING?

33
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,625
IS THAT MARK ON TAITO'S
SHOULDER WHAT I THINK IT IS?

34
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,541
- HE BEARS THE MARK OF ALKAID.

35
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,541
MY SON'S DESTINY IS INTERTWINED
WITH THAT OF A WARRIOR GOD.

36
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:16,166
- WELL, WELL. WE LIVE
IN INTERESTING TIMES, DON'T WE?

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,958
- ( gasps )

38
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,208
- TAITO'S REACTING TO MY
OWN MARK, SIR.

39
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,541
HURRY AND USE THE DISTRACTION

40
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,458
TO GET YOUR DAUGHTER
OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

41
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,583
- UNDERSTOOD.

42
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,541
LAILA, LAILA! OH, NO.

43
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,500
- HE'S AVOIDING HER.

44
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,208
EVEN IN THE THROES OF
ALKAID'S TERRIBLE FURY,

45
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,750
PART OF HIM FIGHTS
TO SPARE HIS SISTER.

46
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,958
- ( grunting )

47
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,875
- AN AMATEUR MOVE.

48
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,458
- COME ON, SWEETHEART.
SPEAK TO ME.

49
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,583
- FATHER.
- I'M HERE.

50
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,708
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

51
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,583
I WAS JUST DOING
THE LAUNDRY AND... TAITO.

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,375
- ( growls )

53
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,708
- WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM?

54
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,791
- I'M AFRAID THE ANSWER TO THAT
QUESTION IS OUT OF OUR HANDS.

55
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,583
HE'S CONSUMED BY ALKAID'S RAGE.

56
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,166
- IF THE SOURCE OF YOUR POWER
IS WHAT I THINK IT IS,

57
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,041
THEN UNDERSTAND
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

58
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,583
BEFORE IT KILLS YOU.

59
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,583
FORGIVE ME.

60
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,333
( screams )

61
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,083
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

62
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,708
YOU MONSTER.

63
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,041
- ( screaming )

64
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,416
- YOU WANNA KILL ALL OF US?
START WITH ME!

65
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,125
- LAILA!

66
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,000
- MY LADY, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

67
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,166
GET OUT OF HERE!

68
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,375
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE SUCH A PAIN, HUH?

69
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:22,375
LISTEN TO ME, TAI. YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A COMPLETE IDIOT! WAKE UP!

70
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,750
- ( gasps )

71
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,541
- ( exhales ) WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO, LAILA?

72
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,750
GIVE ME HEAD DRAMA?

73
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,375
- HEAD TRAUMA, MORON.

74
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,625
- WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

75
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,416
I'M COVERED IN BLOOD.
WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT?

76
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,541
DID SOMEBODY JUST TROLL ME
DOWN THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN?

77
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,458
- SERIOUSLY? YOU MEAN ROLL ME
DOWN THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN.

78
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,250
- THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE.

79
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,958
- ( laughs ) I THINK
ALKAID'S MET HIS MATCH.

80
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,625
- ( birds chirping )

81
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,125
- NO ONE HELP ME OR ANYTHING.

82
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,291
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE ALL THIS.

83
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,291
- IT WAS VERY COURAGEOUS
OF YOU TO TRY TO STEP IN

84
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,541
AND SAVE US LIKE THAT, MISTER?

85
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,875
- OH, HOW IMPOLITE OF ME.

86
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,000
I HAVEN'T FORMALLY
INTRODUCED MYSELF.

87
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,500
MY NAME IS RYUKO,
A MONK FROM THE TONG YO SHRINE.

88
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,916
THE HEAD PRIEST SENT ME.

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
- YOU CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM THE CAPITAL?

90
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,291
- YES, BUT PERHAPS ONLY BECAUSE
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I'D FIND.

91
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,208
DESTINY DOES LIKE TO
CATCH US OFF GUARD.

92
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,000
- LIKE FINDING MY BROTHER?

93
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,000
- HE AND I SHARE
A SIMILAR FATE.

94
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,875
ONE MIGHT SAY OUR PATHS
IN THIS WORLD

95
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,791
REFLECT THE
MOVEMENTS OF THE STARS.

96
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,708
WE BEAR THE KARMIC BURDEN
OF A BATTLE PLAYED OUT

97
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,166
IN THE HEAVENS ABOVE.

98
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,333
- MY FATHER DIDN'T WANT
TAITO TO LEARN THE TRUTH.

99
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:05,833
HE WANTED HIM TO KNOW
A NORMAL LIFE, A PEACEFUL LIFE.

100
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,125
GUESS DESTINY CAUGHT US
OFF GUARD.

101
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,041
YOU CAN'T BLAME HIM
FOR TRYING, THOUGH.

102
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,250
- Sonnei: THE HEAVENLY SPHERE
PIVOTS ON THE FORTUNES

103
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,666
OF THE GREAT DIPPER,

104
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,833
A CELESTIAL RETINUE COMPOSED
OF SEVEN BRILLIANT STARS

105
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,958
UPON WHOSE DEEDS
THE PRINCIPLE OF KARMA

106
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,500
IS SAID TO REST.

107
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,250
BUT JUST AS HERE IN
THE EARTHLY PLANE

108
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,416
YIN AND YANG HOLD SWAY,

109
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,625
SO, TOO, DO CONTRARY POLES
DEFINE THE GREAT DIPPER'S FORM,

110
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,375
DUBHE AND ALKAID,

111
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,750
THE WILD WARRIOR GODS
OF OLD FOREVER CLASHING,

112
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,083
CALLING THE
PEOPLE TO TAKE UP ARMS.

113
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,000
- THE DIPPER BEARERS
ARE AMONG US AGAIN, AREN'T THEY?

114
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,666
- INDEED. IN TIMES OF GREAT
TURMOIL, THEY DWELL THE LAND.

115
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,708
INCARNATE IN THE FORM
OF SEVEN HUMAN BEINGS.

116
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,125
EACH ONE BEARING A MARK
CORRESPONDING TO

117
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,083
A STAR OF THE GREAT DIPPER.

118
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,958
- FIVE OF THEM HAVE
A SPECIAL TASK.

119
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:58,041
MIZAR, MERAK, ALIOTH,
PHECDA AND MEGREZ

120
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,500
ARE KNOWN AS
THE QUINTESSENT,

121
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,375
OR THE FIVE DIVINE WARRIORS.

122
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,666
ALKAID AND DUBHE ARE KNOWN
AS THE WARRIOR GODS.

123
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,958
- THEY'RE PRETTY POWERFUL, HUH?

124
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,875
- SO, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
THIS ALKAID GUY, RIGHT?

125
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,208
- ( chuckles )
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

126
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,541
- SHUT UP!

127
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,791
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

128
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,500
THIS IS ALL CLEARLY BEYOND
HIS UNDERSTANDING.

129
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,416
HE MAKES JOKES BECAUSE
THE TRUTH ELUDES HIM.

130
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,166
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
THE NAME'S RYUKO, YEAH?

131
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,916
IF YOU WANNA CALL ME STUPID,
SAY IT TO MY FACE.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,416
- I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE DID.

133
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
- AS I WAS SAYING, THE RIVALRY
BETWEEN ALKAID AND DUBHE

134
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,250
THREATENS THE VERY LAND ITSELF.

135
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,333
THE FIVE DIVINE WARRIORS
ACT AS LEVEES

136
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,791
AGAINST THE DEVASTATION
THEIR GRUDGE WILL INFLICT.

137
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,500
- SO, WHY SHOULD I CARE?

138
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,666
- BECAUSE I, TOO, BEAR A MARK.

139
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,208
MINE IS MIZAR.
I AM ONE OF THE FIVE.

140
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,666
- OH, BIG DEAL. I DON'T BUY
ALL THIS DESTINY STUFF,

141
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,416
SO, MIGHT AS WELL
JUST SAVE YOUR BREATH.

142
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,083
I'M MY OWN MASTER IN THIS LIFE
AND THAT'S THAT.

143
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,000
- ( Sonnei laughs )

144
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,333
EVEN YOUR DOUBT
IS DECREED, LAD.

145
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,416
NOT ONE OF US FORGES
HIS PATH THROUGH LIFE ALONE.

146
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,166
OF COURSE, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO BELIEVE AS YOU PLEASE.

147
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,708
- ( laughs )
- UH, GRANDPA.

148
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,333
- (scoffs ) LORD KEIRO AND
HIS MEN ARE ROUGHING IT, EH?

149
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,791
MUST BE PASSING THROUGH
AFTER CRUSHING SOME REBELLION.

150
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,625
SIGN OF THE TIMES.

151
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,708
- SO, YOU COULD NOT DESTROY HIM.

152
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,500
- AH, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT,
MY LORD. EVEN MIZAR JOINED IN.

153
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,416
ALAS, THE ONLY CASUALTY
WAS MY WARDROBE.

154
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,708
SO, WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

155
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,458
DUBHE AND ALKAID DEVOUR
EACH OTHER AS USUAL,

156
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,083
OR IS THERE ANY CHANCE...

157
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,000
- ENOUGH. THE HEAVENS HAVE
ORDAINED THAT HE SHOULD LIVE.

158
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,916
- YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO IGNORE HIM?

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,333
- I AM, YES. WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE
TO DO IS YOUR OWN AFFAIR.

160
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,791
- MY, MY, CRAFTY.

161
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,291
- BOY, LET US SEE
HOW MUCH OF AN OBSTACLE

162
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,125
YOU ARE WILLING TO BECOME.

163
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,291
- THEY'RE HEARTY AND CHEAP.
FROM OUR GARDEN TO YOUR TABLE.

164
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,541
FRESH PICKED ONLY JUST
THIS MORNING.

165
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,791
- ( children giggling )

166
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,708
- LOOK, IT'S TAITO.
- HI, TAITO.

167
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,375
- YOU'RE GONNA COME PLAY
WITH US, RIGHT?

168
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,458
- NO. NOT RIGHT NOW.

169
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,416
BUT WE'LL GO FISHING
REAL SOON, OKAY?

170
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,458
- ALL RIGHT.
- IT'S A DEAL.

171
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,666
- HEY, WAIT FOR ME.

172
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,750
- THE PEOPLE OF TAI SHAN

173
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,541
CERTAINLY TAKE
HARDSHIP IN STRIDE.

174
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,500
ONE CAN SCARCELY TELL
THERE'D BEEN A FIRE.

175
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,625
- WHAT? YOU EXPECT THEM
TO WALLOW IN MISERY?

176
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,291
REFUGEES TAKE JUST
AS MUCH PRIDE IN THEIR HOME

177
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,458
AS ANYBODY ELSE.

178
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,833
- HUH? I DIDN'T MEAN...

179
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,416
- ( chuckles ) IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE JUST SPEAKING YOUR MIND.

180
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,708
- SONNEI AND MY DAD WORKED HARD
ON THIS PLACE SO REFUGEES

181
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,416
WOULD HAVE A PLACE TO CALL HOME.

182
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,458
SO, DON'T GET ALL HIGH
AND MIGHTY.

183
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,166
- I APOLOGIZE.
I SPOKE OUT OF TURN.

184
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,125
PLEASE KNOW THAT I
RESPECT THEIR TENACITY.

185
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,166
- GOOD. APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

186
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,958
THESE PEOPLE ARE LIKE
FAMILY TO ME.

187
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,708
I LOOK UP TO THEM. ALWAYS HAVE.

188
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:38,791
KANYO. WE'LL BE BACK TO SEE YOU
AGAIN REAL SOON. PROMISE.

189
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,166
- IT'S A TRAGEDY.

190
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,000
SO MANY FINE WARRIORS
LOST IN ONE NIGHT OF BLOODSHED.

191
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,916
- THEY'RE OWED MORE THAN THIS.
A LOT MORE.

192
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,708
I'LL AVENGE THEM. IF IT TAKES
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

193
00:12:56,791 --> 00:13:00,041
- Soei: WHICH WON'T BE LONG
IF YOU RUN AFOUL OF ME.

194
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,291
- UH, FATHER.

195
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,541
- I FORBID YOU TO TAKE
ANY ACTION, TAITO.

196
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,208
THE BUSINESS OF
THE QING LONG PLATOON

197
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,291
IS SELF DEFENSE,
PURE AND SIMPLE.

198
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,083
I WILL NOT HAVE ONE OF OUR OWN
ACTING LIKE A MERCENARY.

199
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,541
- SO, WHAT?
WE ACCEPT IT AND MOVE ON?

200
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,875
TOO MANY GOOD PEOPLE
DIED FOR US

201
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:15,958
JUST TO LOOK
THE OTHER WAY!

202
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,000
- SILENCE!

203
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,416
ANGER AND HATRED ARE
BEGETTERS OF CATASTROPHE.

204
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,291
ESPECIALLY IN YOUR CASE.

205
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,375
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
BUT THIS ISN'T THE WAY.

206
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,625
- ( sighs )

207
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,083
- ( grunts )

208
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,208
- HIS SPEED IS ASTONISHING.

209
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,416
- I'LL LEAVE YOUR CHANGE
OF CLOTHES RIGHT HERE.

210
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,833
- THAT'S THE STUFF.

211
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,875
- TAITO.
- YEAH?

212
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,625
- YOU UNDERSTAND IT'S MY HOPE
THAT ONE DAY YOU'LL SUCCEED ME,

213
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,625
AS LEADER OF
THE QING LONG PLATOON.

214
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,791
- WELL, SURE.
THAT'S THE IDEA, RIGHT?

215
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,000
HAVE THINGS CHANGED
OR ARE YOU JUST BEING WEIRD?

216
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,250
- ( both laughs )

217
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,583
- DAMN KIDS.

218
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,416
- LET ME ASK YOU.
- WHAT'S THAT?

219
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,125
- EVER HEARD OF SOMEBODY
NAMED LORD KEIRO?

220
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,791
- KEIRO? THE ONLY MAN
I KNOW WITH THAT NAME

221
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,916
IS AN IMPERIAL GENERAL.

222
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,875
- SO, HE'S A PART
OF THE GOVERNMENT.

223
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,000
- WHERE'VE YOU HEARD...

224
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,291
- YOU HAVE TO LOAN ME
SOME MONEY.

225
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,291
- HUH?

226
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,541
- MONEY?
- I HAVE TO GO.

227
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,625
I HAVE TO LEAVE
FOR THE CAPITAL RIGHT NOW.

228
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,541
THE GUY WHO DID THIS TO US.
THAT'S WHERE HE IS.

229
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,708
- ( birds chirping )

230
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,208
- THIS ISN'T JUST RECKLESS,
IT'S SUICIDE.

231
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,000
- WELL, HE IS AN IDIOT.

232
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,250
- WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO DISSUADE THE BOY NOW.

233
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,083
- HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE
ALWAYS WANTED ME TO SEE

234
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,000
THE CAPITAL FOR MYSELF.

235
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,000
- CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH.

236
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,541
- ONE OF THE EMPEROR'S OWN,

237
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,625
RAIDING OUR TEMPLE AND REDUCING
TAI SHAN TO EMBERS.

238
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,541
- DO YOU THINK
THE EMPEROR'S BEHIND IT?

239
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,625
- NO. IT'S MORE LIKELY
THAT KEIRO ACTED ALONE.

240
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,416
KEEP IN MIND HE WAS AFTER
THE LEGENDARY SWORD OF RULE.

241
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,208
SOMETHING THE EMPEROR
WOULD MUCH PREFER STAY

242
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,625
SAFELY HIDDEN AWAY.

243
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,125
- SO, THEN, THIS KEIRO GUY
WANTS TO USURP THE THRONE.

244
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,000
- WORSE YET. SUPPOSE HE'S
NOT JUST A USURPER

245
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,875
BUT DUBHE HIMSELF.

246
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,666
- IT CAN'T BE!

247
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,125
- NO! DUBHE AND ALKAID
HAVEN'T APPEARED IN

248
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,458
THE SAME ERA FOR AGES!

249
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,958
IT'S UNTHINKABLE!

250
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,916
- ON THE CONTRARY,

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
GIVEN DUBHE AND ALKAID'S
ENORMOUS POWER,

252
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,958
THE THOUGHT OF THEIR OCCUPYING
THE SAME STAGE, SO TO SAY,

253
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,041
IS A HUMBLING ONE, YES.

254
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,541
BUT, ETERNAL WARFARE
IS THEIR DESTINY.

255
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,333
WHETHER THEIR BATTLE
CONFINE ITSELF TO THE STARS

256
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,250
OR ERUPT INTO
THE LESSER SPHERES.

257
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,375
- ALL THE MORE REASON
NOT TO LET HIM GO.

258
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,166
- HUH?

259
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,500
- AND IF IT'S HIS FATE?

260
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,208
- HIS FATE. YOU AND THAT WORD.

261
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:34,541
- RYUKO. IT'S TIME I UNVEILED
THE PURPOSE OF YOUR PRESENCE.

262
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,708
I WISH FOR YOU TO ACT
AS TAITO'S CUSTODIAN.

263
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,000
- CUSTODIAN?

264
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,583
- AWESOME THOUGH IT IS,

265
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:45,250
THE POWER OF ALKAID MAY PROVE
OVERWHELMING TO A BOY HIS AGE.

266
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,750
HE NEEDS THE GUIDANCE
OF ONE WHO HAS MASTERED

267
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,833
THEIR STAR.

268
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,833
- IF MY STAR DECREES IT,
I SHALL DO SO.

269
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:57,625
HOWEVER, AS ONE OF
THE FIVE DIVINE WARRIORS,

270
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,416
IT IS MY DUTY TO PREVENT
HIS AND DUBHE'S COLLISION

271
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,875
FROM WREAKING HAVOC
ON THIS WORLD.

272
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,958
AND I WILL HOLD TO THAT
WHATEVER THE COST.

273
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,000
- NOW LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

274
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,625
IF I LOSE, I FORGET ABOUT
MOUSTACHE AND LIVE IN TAI SHAN

275
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,416
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

276
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,833
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD TO ME.
SO LET'S GO.

277
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,791
- INDEED.

278
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,250
- BE WARNED. I HAIL FROM
A VERY OLD SECT.

279
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,875
SKILLED IN THE
EIGHT GREAT STYLES. BEGIN!

280
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,833
- HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR.
YOU GET TO USE A WEAPON?

281
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,333
- THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A FAIR FIGHT

282
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,750
IN THE REAL WORLD, MY FRIEND.

283
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,583
EACH OF THE ETERNAL CHAMPIONS
BRANDISHES A WEAPON TAILORED TO

284
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,416
THEIR OWN SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES.

285
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,000
AS MIZAR, THIS STAFF
IS AS MUCH A PART OF ME

286
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,458
AS THE ARM THAT WIELDS IT.

287
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,833
- OH, I SEE.

288
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,583
I HAIL FROM THE SAME SECT
AS YOU, BUDDY. THE EIGHT STYLES

289
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,333
ARE MY BREAD AND BUTTER.

290
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,625
MY WEAPON IS MY FIST!

291
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,750
( screams )

292
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,791
( groans )

293
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,791
OKAY. THAT KINDA HURT.

294
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,041
- IT'S CALLED CHANNELING.

295
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,916
A SECRET FIGHTING TECHNIQUE
THAT ENABLES ONE'S WEAPON

296
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,916
TO BECOME A CONDUIT

297
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,666
FOR THE BODY'S NATURAL ENERGIES.

298
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,208
WHEN LAST WE FOUGHT
I USED A TREE BRANCH.

299
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,625
TONIGHT MY TRUE WEAPON.
ONE HIT IS ALL I NEED!

300
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:41,958
( screams )

301
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,791
( gasps )

302
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:54,625
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT. CAN
CHANNELING BE AN INNATE SKILL?

303
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,041
- SO, ONE HIT
IS ALL YOU NEED, HUH?

304
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,166
- IN ABSENCE OF A WEAPON,

305
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,416
THE BODY ITSELF HAS BECOME
HIS CONDUIT.

306
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,541
IMPOSSIBLE!

307
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,416
- OH, I'LL SHOW YOU IMPOSSIBLE!

308
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,625
- ( grunting )

309
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,125
- ( screams )

310
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,750
- FATHER.
- WHAT IS IT?

311
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,250
- YOU'LL PROBABLY SAY NO.
BUT I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK.

312
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,375
- WELL, NOW, ISN'T THIS
A COINCIDENCE?

313
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,416
- HUH?

314
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,416
- TAITO, I HAVE NEVER
ENCOUNTERED YOUR LIKE.

315
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,125
- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
A LITTLE REMATCH SOMETIME?

316
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,625
- DEFINITELY.

317
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,208
- AND A DRAW IS NOT
THE SAME THING AS A LOSS, RIGHT?

318
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,208
GET READY, CAPITAL, HERE I COME.

319
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,708
- GOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SAY?

320
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,333
- I HAVE BEEN APPOINTED
AS YOUR CUSTODIAN.

321
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,458
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ME.

322
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,833
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT
KIND OF TROUBLE YOU'LL

323
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,083
GET YOURSELF INTO OUT THERE

324
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,083
WITHOUT SOMEONE
TO WATCH YOUR BACK.

325
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,000
- JUST TRY TO KEEP UP.

326
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,083
- ( giggles )

327
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,458
- DON'T EVEN START, LAILA!

328
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,458
- IS THIS YOUR IDEA
OF SLIPPING PAST ME, GENIUS?

329
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,375
YOU'RE ABOUT AS STEALTHY
AS AN AVALANCHE.

330
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,875
- I'M COMING TOO, BY THE WAY.
- AH.

331
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,208
- OH, JUST FACE IT, YOU NEED ME.
EVEN WITH RYUKO IN TOW,

332
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,333
WITHOUT A LADY'S INTUITION,
YOU'LL BE HELPLESS.

333
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,375
HONESTLY, IS THERE ANY CREATURE
IN THE WORLD MORE PATHETIC

334
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,541
THAN A MAN?

335
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,708
- UH, YOU DO KNOW
THAT I'M A MAN, RIGHT?

336
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,458
- THAT MOUTH IS GONNA GET
A FAT LIP ONE OF THESE DAYS.

337
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,000
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
WHO EVEN CARES?

338
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,791
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT TAGGING ALONG.
NOW GET OUT OF THE WAY!

339
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,333
- FINE THEN. YOU WANNA
TRAVEL BROKE, GO RIGHT AHEAD.

340
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,333
HOPE YOU CAN SEW
IF YOUR CLOTHES GET TORN.

341
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,875
OH YEAH AND YOU'LL HAVE
TO DO WITHOUT THIS.

342
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,625
FATHER'S LOANING IT TO YOU
ON THE CONDITION THAT

343
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,083
I TAG ALONG.

344
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,916
WELL, GUESS THAT'S SETTLED
THEN. LET'S MOVE OUT.

345
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,958
- HEY, DON'T TAKE THE LEAD.
THIS IS MY JOURNEY.

346
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,083
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
CRAWLING THE SHOTS.

347
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,666
- YOU MADE A WISE CHOICE
IN LETTING HIM GO.

348
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,833
- EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

349
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,458
HE'S THE CLOSEST THING
TO A SON I'VE GOT.

350
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,250
I'D MUCH RATHER HE STAYED.

351
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,041
- I'M SORRY TO PUT YOU
IN SUCH A DIFFICULT POSITION.

352
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,541
YOU HAD TO SACRIFICE
A DAUGHTER AS WELL.

353
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,458
- HE NEEDS HER. SHE MAY JUST
BE THE ONLY HUMAN BEING

354
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,416
ABLE TO STILL THE RAGING
TEMPEST IN HIS HEART.

355
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,583
- MORTALS CANNOT REDIRECT
THE HEAVENLY COURSE

356
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,291
OF THE STARS.

357
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:56,041
BUT TAITO, MY LAD,
DESTINY'S NO PUPPET SHOW.

358
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,500
YOU CAN IN FACT CHOOSE
TO BE YOUR OWN MASTER

359
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,916
IN THIS LIFE.

360
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,791
- ( theme song playing )

361
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

362
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,416
- Ryuko: THE JOURNEY'S
FIRST STEP BRINGS US

363
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,166
FACE TO FACE
WITH A CRUEL REALITY.

364
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,375
- Taito: THIS IS A LOAD OF CRAP.

365
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,166
POOR PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE JUST
SO RICH BASTARDS LIKE HIM

366
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,791
CAN CLEAR OUT WITH EVERYTHING?

367
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,916
WELL, NOT ON MY WATCH!

368
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,500
- Ryuko: TAITO, UNTIL A WARRIOR
LEARNS SELF-CONTROL,

369
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,166
THINGS DO NOT
AUGER WELL FOR HIM.

370
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,541
YOU MUST TAKE THAT TO HEART.

371
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,666
- Koyo: TAITO, I'LL HAVE
TO REMEMBER THAT NAME.

372
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,166
- Taito: THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

373
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,208
YOU MADE A PROMISE TO COME
WITH ME TO THE CAPITAL

374
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,875
AND I'M GONNA HOLD YOU TO IT.

375
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,791
- Ryuko: NEXT TIME,
ON HERO TALES,

376
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,583
THE PLIGHT OF THE WRETCHED
STRENGTHENS THE BOND

377
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,375
BETWEEN NEWFOUND FRIENDS

378
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:08,458
IN "CHAPTER THREE, THE PLEDGE
OF ENERGY MANIPULATION"

379
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:19,250
- Taito: I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DEAL WITH PISSANTS LIKE YOU.
