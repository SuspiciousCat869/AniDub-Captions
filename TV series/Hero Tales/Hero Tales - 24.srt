1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,875
- Taito: NO. THERE'S JUST NO
WAY. TELL ME YOU'RE LYING.

2
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,250
- KEIRO SEALED OFF
THE CITY GATES

3
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,291
SO THOSE LIVING CORPSES COULD

4
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,250
SLAUGHTER THE PEOPLE
WITHOUT MERCY.

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,416
IT'S SO HORRIBLE I DIDN'T
EVEN BELIEVE IT MYSELF

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,416
WHEN I FIRST HEARD.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,083
- HOW COULD HE?

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,791
- THAT CANNOT BE ANSWERED.

9
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,000
I KNEW HIS REIGN
WOULD BE BLOODY.

10
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,458
BUT I THOUGHT SURELY HE WOULD
START WITH HIS SWORN ENEMIES,

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,708
NOT INNOCENT SUBJECTS.

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,750
- THOSE PEOPLE WERE THERE
TO WISH HIM WELL.

13
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,583
THEY WANTED TO CELEBRATE THEIR
WAR HEROES' VICTORY WITH HIM.

14
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,458
BUT HE...

15
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,458
- I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL.

16
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,250
HOW COULD SOMEONE BE
SO TWISTED THEY COULD JUST

17
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,666
KILL PEOPLE LIKE THAT?

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,083
- KEIRO TOOK MANY PATHS
LINED WITH BLOOD AND TREACHERY

19
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,333
TO ACHIEVE THE POWER
HE SO DESIRED.

20
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,000
IT WAS HIS ULTIMATE GOAL TO RULE
THE PEOPLE OF THE XIAN EMPIRE

21
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,541
OR TO EXTERMINATE THEM.

22
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:06,416
- IS THIS IT? IS EVERYONE DEAD,
THE "PEACE" HE TALKED ABOUT?

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,958
- IT'S LIKE HELL ON EARTH.

24
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,208
THE CAPITAL'S A PLACE
OF TORMENT AND DEATH.

25
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,500
- Tokaku: NO. I FEAR IT'S FAR
WORSE THAN THAT, YOUNG LADY.

26
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,916
- THE PLAGUE SPANS THE EMPIRE.

27
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,833
- THE WHOLE EMPIRE?

28
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,166
- ( theme song playing )

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

30
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,791
- Ryusho: ACCORDING TO
WHAT LITTLE WORD I'VE RECEIVED

31
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,500
FROM TEMPLES AROUND THE EMPIRE,

32
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,541
SIMILAR EVENTS
ARE OCCURRING ELSEWHERE.

33
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,958
UNHOLY MASSACRES
PERPETRATED BY THE LIVING DEAD.

34
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,416
LANDS ONCE VERDANT ARE NOW
STAINED BY BLOOD AND FIRES

35
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,791
RAGE RAMPANT
THROUGHOUT THE REALM.

36
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,333
MEN WHO ONCE LIVED IN HARMONY,

37
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,166
HOLD ONE ANOTHER
IN DEEP SUSPICION

38
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,708
AND LASH OUT AT THEIR
ERSTWHILE BRETHREN.

39
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,291
ALL THIS DESTRUCTION
CARRIED OUT UNDER THE BANNER

40
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,791
OF THE NEW EMPEROR, KEIRO.

41
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:24,916
- IT CAN'T BE.

42
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,291
- NOW I UNDERSTAND.

43
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,416
KEIRO SENT HIS LEGIONS OUT NOT
TO QUASH POCKETS OF REBELLION

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,083
IN THE EMPIRE AS HE SO CLAIMED,

45
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,916
BUT TO SEED THE LAND
WITH FRESH CORPSES

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,916
TO REANIMATE AND MURDER
THE LIVING.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,458
- MASTER RYUSHO,

48
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,583
IS THE XUAN LANG PLATOON NOW
COMPOSED SOLELY OF THE UNDEAD?

49
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,250
IS RYUKO AMONG THEM?

50
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,291
- FEAR NOT, MY CHILD.

51
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,458
ALTHOUGH THE LAD'S MIND MAY BE
CLOUDED, THE LIGHT OF MIZAR

52
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,958
STILL BURNS ABOVE.

53
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,166
- THERE ARE STILL MANY IN
THE SCHWAN LONG WHO HAVE NOT YET

54
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,250
SUCCUMBED TO THIS AFFLICTION.

55
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,166
SOME HAVE TAKEN ARMS AGAINST
THEIR GRUESOME FORMER COMRADES

56
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,458
TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS.

57
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,208
- THIS MACABRE ARMY
IS THE CREATION OF SHIMEI.

58
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,041
UNLESS HIS THRALL
CAN BE UNDONE,

59
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,500
THEY WILL WIPE OUT THE EMPIRE
AND HUMANITY WITH IT.

60
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,208
- ONE SHOT TO THE FOREHEAD.

61
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,875
HIT THOSE WALKING BAGS
OF WORM FOOD RIGHT HERE.

62
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,958
WE JUST NEED TO LET
THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT!

63
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,458
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. WITHOUT
THOSE UNDEAD CREEPS AROUND,

64
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,291
KEIRO WON'T HAVE
ANY KIND OF ARMY LEFT.

65
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,666
- THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
UNLESS YOU TWO CAN

66
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,583
COME UP WITH A PLAN TO
PASS THAT INFORMATION ON

67
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,500
TO EVERY LIVING PERSON
IN THE EMPIRE.

68
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,750
EVEN IF ALL THE KILLING
WERE TO STOP TODAY,

69
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,750
SHIMEI WOULD HAVE A FRESH SUPPLY
OF BODIES TO USE AS HE PLEASED.

70
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,958
- WE'RE WASTING TIME.

71
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,583
ALL OF THIS TALKING
ISN'T GETTING US ANYWHERE.

72
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,541
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS LET ME
TRACK THAT BASTARD DOWN

73
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,958
AND MEET HIM FACE TO FACE.

74
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,125
LIKE A WARRIOR. THEN HE'LL
BE DEAD AND THIS NIGHTMARE

75
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,583
WILL BE OVER.

76
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,541
I'M GOING TO THE CAPITAL
AT FIRST LIGHT TOMORROW.

77
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,166
MASTER RYUSHO, GRAND GENERAL,

78
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,625
I'LL LEAVE THE REAL EMPEROR
UNDER YOUR CARE.

79
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,750
- Ryuko: LORD KEIRO! LORD KEIRO,
PLEASE WAIT!

80
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,708
- WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

81
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,166
- SIR, ABOUT THE INCIDENT
IN JIALING SQUARE,

82
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,000
I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO
COMPREHEND WHY IT HAPPENED.

83
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,375
- ANY LOYAL CITIZEN WOULD GIVE
HIS LIFE IF THAT WAS MY WISH.

84
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,833
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

85
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,875
HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH A THING.

86
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,625
THE FOUNDATION OF THE EMPIRE
IS ITS PEOPLE.

87
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,333
THEY ARE ITS LIFE AND FUTURE!

88
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,708
- SUCH CHILDISH IDEALS.

89
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,833
LOOK. IN THE EMPIRE
WHICH I REIGN,

90
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,208
THE WEAK HAVE NO FUTURE
SAVE DEATH.

91
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,791
I WILL RENDER THEM TO ASH

92
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,583
AND BID THEM RETURN TO
THE BARREN GROUND

93
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,416
UPON WHICH THEY TOIL.

94
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,291
IN THAT WAY, THEY ARE MUCH
LIKE THE WOMAN WHO

95
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,708
BURDENED ME WITH YOU.

96
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,958
IF AN EMPIRE CAN BRING
DEATH UPON ITS PEOPLE,

97
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,666
SURELY AN EMPEROR CAN BRING
DEATH UPON HIS EMPIRE.

98
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,708
DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW, KEIKO?

99
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,791
- YOU'RE WRONG. BLOOD IS
NOT CLEANSED WITH MORE BLOOD.

100
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,541
MOTHER'S DEATH WAS DECREED
BY FATE, NOT SOLELY BY

101
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,916
THE ACTIONS OF THE EMPIRE!

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,541
- THEN IT ALSO BE FATE THAT
CALLS UPON ME TO VIEW

103
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,458
THE EMPIRE'S DEMISE FROM
THE HILT OF MY BROADSWORD.

104
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,541
- NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR DEATH.

105
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,916
THE TIME IS UPON US FOR
THE EMPIRE'S REBIRTH.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,750
A TRANSFORMATION BEGOTTEN
BY THE PEACE AND PROSPERITY

107
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,291
OF WHICH YOU ONCE SPOKE.

108
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,291
PLEASE FATHER,
COME TO YOUR SENSES.

109
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,750
- IF YOU WISH TO
CALL ME YOUR FATHER,

110
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,291
YOU MUST HONOR ME AS SUCH.

111
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,875
YOU MUST MAKE MY DESIRES
YOUR OWN.

112
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:25,041
- FATHER, HOW CAN I
BELIEVE AS YOU?

113
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,583
- Koyo: WELL LOOK AT THAT.

114
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,791
DUBHE SHINES BRIGHTLY INDEED.

115
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,291
THE HEAVENS' WAY OF TELLING US
THEY SHARE OUR KNOWLEDGE

116
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,875
OF THE SKIRMISH TO COME.

117
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,333
- HIS STAR.
KEIRO'S CELESTIAL OTHER.

118
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,833
- ( yawning )

119
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,000
I GUESS IF THERE'S ONE THING

120
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,541
WE SHARE IN COMMON
WITH THE GUY,

121
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,083
IT'S LIKE IT OR NOT, WE'RE ALL
HELD TO WHATEVER THE KARMA

122
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,833
OF THE STARS
HAS IN STORE FOR US.

123
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,750
- KEIRO'S STAR IS ONE RULED
BY AGGRESSION AND BLOODSHED,

124
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,583
AS IS THE EARTHLY VESSEL
THAT CARRIES HIM PLAGUED BY

125
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,375
SUCH UNFORTUNATE BURDENS.

126
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,333
- HIS IS A DISMAL FATE.

127
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:06,291
HARD TO BELIEVE HE ONCE USED
THE GUIDING HAND OF COMPASSION

128
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,916
TO DIRECT HIS POWER TO AID
THOSE IN NEED.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,250
BUT SUCH IS LIFE FOR THOSE WHO
BEAR DUBHE'S GHASTLY MARK.

130
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,416
- I DON'T THINK IT REALLY
WORKS THAT WAY.

131
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,708
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE
THAT IT'S TRUE.

132
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,791
I MEAN, I DON'T WANNA BE
DISRESPECTFUL TO WHAT GRANDPA

133
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,541
TAUGHT ME ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF.

134
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,625
BUT OUR LIVES DOWN HERE
HAVE NOTHING TO DO

135
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,916
WITH HOW A BUNCH OF LIGHTS
HAPPEN TO SHINE UP IN THE SKY.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,083
KEIRO'S NOT THE WAY HE IS
BECAUSE OF SOME STAR.

137
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,083
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S NOT STRONG
ENOUGH TO BE ANY WAY ELSE.

138
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,958
- Ryusho: SO YOU'D DENY THE ROLE
OF THE STARS ALTOGETHER?

139
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,083
- Taito: YES, I WOULD.

140
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,333
I MAY BE ALKAID AND HE'S DUBHE.

141
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,375
BUT AFTER ALL
THE SUFFERING HE'S CAUSED,

142
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,958
I KNOW THAT I'D STILL BE
ON MY WAY TO THE CAPITAL

143
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,625
TO KICK HIS ASS NO
MATTER WHO I WAS.

144
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,125
SO YOU GUYS SHOULD JUST FORGET
ABOUT BEING THE DIVINE WARRIORS

145
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,125
AND COME TO THE CAPITAL
WITH ME IF YOU THINK

146
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,791
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

147
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,958
- ( laughing )

148
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,875
SO YOU MEAN THE CENTRAL FIGURE,

149
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,291
THE BOY RULED BY ONE
OF THE MOST POLARIZING STARS

150
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,958
TO WHOM WE HAVE SWORN
BLOOD ALLEGIANCE.

151
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,125
THE ONE AT THE CENTER
OF THIS WHOLE COSMIC DRAMA,

152
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,708
CLAIMS THIS IS
THE PRODUCT OF CHANCE? HA!

153
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,333
( laughing )

154
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,958
- ARE YOU LAUGHING AT ME?

155
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,625
- NOT AT ALL.

156
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,250
IN FACT, MY RESPECT FOR YOU
HAS GROWN, MY FRIEND!

157
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,541
- I THINK TAITO MAY
HAVE A POINT.

158
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,916
AFTER ALL, THE ONE OF US
WHO'S FOCUSED SO RIGIDLY

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,916
ON THE LIGHT OF THE STARS ABOVE.

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,625
- WELL, WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT HE'S THE ONE WHO'S

161
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,125
COMPLETELY LOST HIS BEARING
ON THE EARTHLY PLANE.

162
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,125
- THAT'S TRUE.
BUT SERIOUSLY, TAITO,

163
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,416
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
FIGURING ALL THIS STUFF OUT NOW.

164
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
I'VE COME ALONG WITH YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO STUPID

165
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,750
TO BE BY YOURSELF,
NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE ALKAID.

166
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,333
- ONCE AGAIN, THE LADY'S RIGHT.
YOU BIG OL' IDIOT!

167
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,416
- NOBODY ASKED YOU, YOU JACKASS.

168
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,083
- HEY, IF LAILA SAYS IT'S TRUE,
IT'S TRUE!

169
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,791
- ( laughing )

170
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,416
CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH
AS YOUR FATHER.

171
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,083
ONLY SOEI AND NOW ALKAID
HAVE BEEN BOLD ENOUGH

172
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,041
TO CALL SONNEI'S
TEACHINGS MALARKEY.

173
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,041
- HEY, COME ON. I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D GO ALL THAT FAR!

174
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,625
- OOH! WHEN WE GET BACK
HOME TO LIAN TONG,

175
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,083
I AM SO GONNA TELL GRANDPA
WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN

176
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,375
SAYING ABOUT HIM.

177
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,416
- THERE'S, UH...
NO NEED FOR THAT.

178
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,250
IT WOULDN'T BE
CONSTRUCTIVE, CHILD.

179
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,208
- THE LADY'S RIGHT AGAIN!

180
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,750
- BAH! SHUT YOUR FOOLISH MOUTH,
YOU HALF WIT!

181
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,375
- NOW, NOW, YOU MUSN'T
OVEREXCITE YOUR HEART,

182
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,833
MASTER RYUSHO.

183
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,125
- I WILL BE JOINING TAITO
WHEN HE LEAVES TOMORROW.

184
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,625
I ASK YOU KEEP WATCH
OVER OUR GUESTS.

185
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,041
PROTECT THEM WITH YOUR LIVES.
I EXPECT NO LESS FROM YOU.

186
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,333
GOT IT?

187
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,875
- Crewman: CAPTAIN, PLEASE,
TAKE ME WITH YOU!

188
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,041
- Crewman 2: ME TOO!

189
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:38,625
- Crewman 3: ME TOO!
- Crewman 4: ME TOO!

190
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,958
PLEASE, CAPTAIN!

191
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,458
- COME ON. THIS JOURNEY TO
OUR ONCE FAIR CAPITAL

192
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,291
IS TO HAVE THE
FINAL BOUT WITH KEIRO.

193
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,208
I'LL HAVE MY HANDS FULL ENOUGH
WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE

194
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,458
YOUR FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS.

195
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,375
- I WOULDN'T BE A BURDEN
TO YOU, CAPTAIN.

196
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,416
I SWEAR I WOULDN'T!

197
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,750
- YEAH, WE'LL STAY OUT
OF YOUR WAY.

198
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,625
- I REALIZE WE ALL SHARE
A DESIRE TO SETTLE OUR VARIOUS

199
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,750
GRUDGES WITH KEIRO.

200
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:57,916
BUT STILL...

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,791
- YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.

202
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,625
WE JUST WANNA HONOR
OUR PLEDGES TO STAY WITH YOU

203
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,625
'TIL THE BITTER END.

204
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,500
- PLEASE!

205
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,666
- WHEN THOSE BASTARDS
IN THE SCHWAN LONG PLATOON

206
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,875
BURNED DOWN MY VILLAGE,

207
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,875
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
TO GIVE ME SHELTER!

208
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,833
- YOU SAVED ME RIGHT WHEN
THAT SERGEANT'S BLADE

209
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,166
WAS SAILING TOWARDS
MY NECK, CAPTAIN!

210
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,208
- WHEN I WAS STILL HUNGRY
AFTER DINNER THE OTHER NIGHT,

211
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,916
YOU GAVE ME YOUR LEFTOVERS!

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,416
- ( chuckling )

213
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,708
- LISTEN TO ME, CAPTAIN,

214
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,250
NO MATTER HOW ROUGH
THE WATERS MAY HAVE BEEN,

215
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,250
WE HAVE ALWAYS BRAVED THEM
TOGETHER IN THE SAME VESSEL.

216
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,208
THIS TIME IS NO DIFFERENT, SIR.

217
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,000
- WE'LL NEVER LEAVE
YOUR SIDE, CAPTAIN!

218
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,916
- STOP BEING SO FOOLISH!

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,041
- ENKI, I...

220
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,125
- YOU WILL HONOR YOUR CAPTAIN
BY FOLLOWING HIS ORDERS,

221
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,958
BY PROTECTING OUR GUESTS.

222
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,416
REMEMBER OUR SWORN DUTY
TO THE WO JIN SQUAD

223
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,000
TRUMPS ANY OTHER BOND.

224
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,791
WE MUST REST FOR THE NIGHT.

225
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,625
I FEAR THE DAY TO COME
WILL BE THE LONGEST YET.

226
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,291
- A WORD.

227
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,041
- YES, CAPTAIN?

228
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,500
- I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR ONCE AGAIN FILLING

229
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,208
THE UNPLEASANT ROLE
OF DISCIPLINARIAN.

230
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,875
- THAT WASN'T MY POINT EXACTLY.

231
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,666
- IF I'M IN FACT ABLE TO AVENGE
YOUR BROTHER ENYU'S DEATH

232
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,833
AND RETURN HERE,

233
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,666
THERE IS A MATTER
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS.

234
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,541
AND, UH, WE SHALL
DISCUSS IT THEN. FAREWELL.

235
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,250
- THAT DAMN FOOL.

236
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,291
HE'S HOPELESS.
ALL MEN ARE HOPELESS.

237
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,291
- AS LONG AS WE'VE
KNOWN EACH OTHER,

238
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,333
WE'VE NEVER HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN

239
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,791
AND TALK AS FRIENDS.

240
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,833
- THAT WISE FOOL WAS
ALWAYS HOVERING ABOUT.

241
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,291
- A VERY APT DESCRIPTION.
SO THAT WAS THE REASON.

242
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,291
- WHAT DO YOU
SUPPOSE HE'S THINKING

243
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,958
ON THIS PORTENTOUS NIGHT?

244
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,958
- HIS MIND'S IN A FOG,
IN ABSOLUTE CONFUSION.

245
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,166
- I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

246
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,291
IT'S SO LIKE HIM, ALWAYS
GETTING LOST ALONG THE WAY.

247
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,708
- WHAT HE NEEDS IS SOMEONE
TO TAKE HIM BY THE HAND

248
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,708
AND GUIDE HIM
ALONG LIFE'S PATH.

249
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,250
RINMEI. YOUR HAND
SHALL BE HIS GUIDE.

250
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,541
- THAT'S GOOD.

251
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,083
IN FACT I HAVE
HIS FIRST LESSON READY.

252
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,250
ONE HE NEEDS TO LEARN.

253
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,666
- HEY, THANKS A LOT FOR
HELPING ME WITH THIS.

254
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,541
- NO PROBLEM.
I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

255
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,750
- SO. YOU'RE, UH...

256
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,666
YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING WITH US
TOMORROW MORNING, AREN'T YOU?

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,166
- THAT'S RIGHT.

258
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,250
- YOU KNOW, IT'LL BE DANGEROUS.

259
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,541
WHEN WE MEET HIM FACE TO FACE
KEIRO WILL GO AT US FULL BORE.

260
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,250
I'M REALLY WORRIED THAT
NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO

261
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,125
PROTECT YOU FROM HIM.

262
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,666
IF SOMETHING WERE
TO HAPPEN TO YOU,

263
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IN
THE WORLD I WOULD DO.

264
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,250
- HEY, DON'T WORRY.

265
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,958
THINGS WILL TURN OUT JUST FINE!

266
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,250
- LAILA! I'M A MAN ON MY KNEES
ASKING YOU.

267
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,833
PLEASE GET ON THAT BOAT
TOMORROW MORNING

268
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,208
AND GO SOMEPLACE SAFE
WITH ENKI AND THE OTHERS.

269
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,208
- HOSEI, I...

270
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,000
- I'M DEAD SERIOUS,
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

271
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,208
I CAN'T HOLD BACK. DON'T GO!

272
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,291
- I'VE HONORED MY WORD
TO MY FATHER THIS FAR

273
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,583
AND I'M NOT STOPPING NOW!

274
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,916
I SWORE I'D STAY WITH TAITO
'TIL THE END.

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I CAN'T GO BACK ON MY PLEDGE
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

276
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,750
WHEN IT'S DONE,
I'LL GO TO FATHER'S GRAVE

277
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,291
AND TELL HIM EVERYTHING.

278
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,708
TELL HIM HOW HIS SON
AVENGED HIS DEATH.

279
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,166
- I UNDERSTAND.

280
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,666
- IN THAT CASE,
I'LL HAVE TO BE EVEN STRONGER.

281
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,958
I WILL MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR
WORD AND I TAKE MY REVENGE,

282
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,083
BOTH WITHOUT FAIL.

283
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,083
- THIS IS AS MUCH AS I CAN
TELL YOU ABOUT THE

284
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,000
LAYOUT OF THE IMPERIAL PALACE.

285
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,333
MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT
I CANNOT LEND MY FISTS

286
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,291
TO THE BATTLE AHEAD.

287
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,875
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

288
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,375
IT'S FINE. JUST KEEP THESE TWO
LOVEBIRDS OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

289
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,250
- SO THE DIE'S CAST. WILL
NOTHING STAVE OFF THIS BATTLE?

290
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,041
- KEIRO'S PAVED HIS ENTIRE WAY
TO THE THRONE WITH THE BODIES

291
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,083
OF INNOCENT MEN,
WOMEN, AND CHILDREN.

292
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,958
SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE HIM
ANSWER FOR THAT.

293
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,250
- I KNOW. AND YOU'RE SO STRONG.

294
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,500
BUT MY POOR FATHER
WAS A STRONG MAN TOO.

295
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,666
- I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH TAKI,

296
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,583
AND AFTER I'M DONE
WITH THAT BASTARD,

297
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,666
HE WON'T MAKE ANYONE
FEEL THIS WAY AGAIN.

298
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,000
- YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

299
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,625
- THANK YOU, BROTHER.

300
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,541
- BUT AFTER THAT, YOU'LL HAVE TO
HONOR YOUR END OF THE DEAL.

301
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,500
TO FIX THIS BROKEN LAND
AND MAKE IT A PLACE OF HARMONY,

302
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,416
A PLACE OF TRUE PEACE.

303
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,125
BUT HEY I HAVE A FEELING
YOU CAN DO THAT.

304
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,125
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE MY OWN
FLESH AND BLOOD, RIGHT?

305
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,791
- WHO GOES THERE?

306
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,791
SHOKAKU!

307
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,708
- I'M RELIEVED TO SEE
YOU'RE UNHARMED.

308
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,958
- PLEASE, SIR. RELEASE ME
FROM THIS CELL AT ONCE!

309
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,166
DUBHE'S TERROR MUST BE STOPPED!

310
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,958
- MIZAR, YOU MUST
REMAIN IN THERE.

311
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,041
- BUT WHY MUST I?

312
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,625
SURELY YOU DON'T AGREE WITH
THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER

313
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,958
OF THE EMPIRE'S CITIZENS!

314
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,875
IT IS OUR DUTY TO INTERCEDE
ON THEIR BEHALF!

315
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,750
- OUR DIVINE RULER'S WORDS
ARE SACROSANCT.

316
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,458
IF YOU BELIEVE OTHERWISE,

317
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,250
YOUR RIGHTFUL PLACE IS
LOCKED AWAY IN THERE.

318
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,541
- HE BELIEVES AS FATHER?

319
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,833
- ( coughing )

320
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,833
- Guard 1: MY LORD!
- Guard 2: LORD SHOKAKU!

321
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,500
- Shokaku: NO. NOT YET.

322
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,916
THE TIME IS NOT RIPE.

323
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,750
- Shimei: YOU'VE EXCEEDED EVEN
MY MOST GRAND EXPECTATIONS,

324
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,000
BY A CONSIDERABLE MARGIN.

325
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,833
IN FACT IN ALL MY YEARS
I'VE NOT THE PLEASURE

326
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,916
OF HEARING SUCH A LOVELY
CACOPHONY OF SCREAMS.

327
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,791
- SUCH NOVELTY CAN BE FOUND
AFTER EONS OF HAUNTING

328
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,208
THIS ABJECT TERRAIN?

329
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,416
- YES, TRULY. THIS CAME AS
A SURPRISE TO ME AS WELL.

330
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,416
THE WAR HERO DRAWS THE SWORD
OF RULE CLAIMS HIS PLACE

331
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,583
ATOP THE EMPIRE'S THRONE,

332
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,625
AND DECREES DEATH
TO HIS SUBJECTS.

333
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,916
THE BETRAYAL OF A WHOLE
POPULACE IS QUITE THE COUP

334
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,916
IF YOU'LL PARDON THE EXPRESSION.

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,250
THEIR SAVIOR REVEALS HIMSELF
TO BE THEIR EXECUTIONER.

336
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,708
I'D ENDURE EONS MORE ON THIS
EARTH TO WITNESS THAT AGAIN.

337
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,625
BUT WHAT TITLE SHALL HISTORY
BESTOW UPON YOU?

338
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,583
THE BLOOD STAINED EMPEROR,
UNITER OF HELL AND EARTH.

339
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,208
- WHATEVER THE TITLE MAY BE,

340
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,541
YOUR NAME SHALL BE WRIT
LARGE ACROSS ITS PAGES.

341
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,541
- IF I DEIGN TO LEAVE A SCRIBE
ALIVE TO TELL THE TALE.

342
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,708
- ALL TOO TRUE, MY LORD.

343
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,250
AFTER ALL, YOUR AIM IS
TO CURE THE LAND

344
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,000
OF ITS "HUMAN AFFLICTION."

345
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,875
AND THAT TIME IS ANON.

346
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,375
AT PRESENT YOUR FOE
IS SAYING HIS TEARFUL FAREWELLS,

347
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,250
READYING HIS MIND FOR
THE ULTIMATE CLASH.

348
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,875
THIS WILL NOT BE THE FIRST TIME
YOUR PATHS HAVE CROSSED.

349
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,083
BUT INDEED IT SHALL BE THE LAST.

350
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,166
AND WHAT WILL BE BORN OF
THIS PAIRING SHALL BE DEATH.

351
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,541
- SHIMEI.

352
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,958
- YES, MY LORD?

353
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,541
- OUR PARTNERSHIP WAS BUILT
ON A COMMON GOAL.

354
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,333
ITS FRUIT, THE BATTLE TO COME.

355
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,375
I BELIEVED ONLY WHEN ALKAID'S
STRENGTH EQUALED MY OWN

356
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,083
COULD SUCH AN EVENT TRANSPIRE.

357
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,250
IF WE WERE TO FIGHT PREMATURELY,
THE EARTH MIGHT WITHSTAND

358
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,458
THE FALLOUT AND HUMANITY REMAIN.

359
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,166
THAT WAS NOT AN OPTION.

360
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,083
- THE YOUNG LAD HAS CHEATED
DEATH TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

361
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,333
BY FATE'S WILL, HE HAS SURVIVED
TO SEE THIS DAY COME TO PASS.

362
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,208
THE HEAVENS DO TEND TO GET
THEIR WAY, DO THEY NOT?

363
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,291
- INDEED. I NOW HOLD DOMINION
OVER THE EMPIRE,

364
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,541
AS WAS THEIR WILL.

365
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,291
- AND I SHALL SEE TO ITS
ANNIHILATION AS IS MINE.

366
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,791
I WILL ACCEPT NO LESS
THAN THE END OF HUMANITY!

367
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,166
- YES. "THE TOLL FOR PEACE,"
AS YOU SAY.

368
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,875
- ANNIHILATION, HOWEVER...

369
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,375
- MY LORD!

370
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,375
- ...IS NOT ENOUGH.

371
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,041
OF WHAT AVAIL IS THIS
DIVINE CARNAGE WITHOUT

372
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,541
MY OWN EYES TO BEAR WITNESS?

373
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,375
- LORD, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

374
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:10,208
- THIS NEWFOUND POWER
OF ALKAID'S NOW EQUALS MY OWN.

375
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,250
SO TO CLASH NOW WOULD
ASSURE MUTUAL DESTRUCTION.

376
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,541
I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBSERVE
MY DESIRES MADE FLESH.

377
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,625
WHY IS THAT?

378
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,791
- UNHAND THE SWORD,
MY LORD!

379
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,750
- SHIMEI, YOU HAVE LABORED
DILIGENTLY TO STOKE THE FIRES

380
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,541
OF RAGE INSIDE MY NEMESIS.

381
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,500
FOR THAT I COMMEND YOU.

382
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,333
THE TORMENT AT YOUR HANDS
HAS BEEN THE CRUCIBLE

383
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,666
FOR HIS TRANSFORMATION.

384
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,333
AT THE TIME I FORGED
THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU,

385
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,333
I SAW THE FUTURE DARKLY.

386
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,333
BUT NOW I SEE ITS CULMINATION
IS THIS MOMENT.

387
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:42,375
- YOU VERMIN! HOW DARE A MORTAL
TREAT ME IN THIS MANNER!

388
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,916
- A MORTAL, AM I?

389
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,333
( laughing )

390
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,916
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MY LORD?

391
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,458
WHY WOULD YOU HARM
YOURSELF THIS WAY?

392
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,125
- YOUR CORPOREAL FORM IS
NOTHING MORE THAN A MARIONETTE.

393
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,500
THE SPIRIT ANIMATING THAT VESSEL
RESIDES IN THE WEAPON ITSELF.

394
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,666
WAN SHAWNG SHE MING.

395
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,583
TO ENSURE MY SURVIVAL
THROUGH THE CATACLYSM,

396
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,625
I MUST ABSORB THAT
SPIRIT INTO MY OWN.

397
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,541
- YOU'LL ACCOMPLISH
NOTHING BY THIS.

398
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,375
JUST ENSURE THAT YOUR BODY
SHALL BE MY NEXT VESSEL.

399
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,583
( screaming )

400
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,833
- OH, YES!

401
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,375
I CAN FEEL YOUR DEMONIC POWER
BECOMING ONE WITH MY OWN.

402
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,958
AND WITH IT I SHALL SEE
WORLD'S END!

403
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,333
- ( laughing )

404
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,791
THE HEAVENS HAVE CHOSEN WELL.

405
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,666
YOU ARE TRULY A GOD AMONG MEN.
YOU'VE DEFEATED ME.

406
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,291
I ACQUIESCE WITHOUT DISHONOR.

407
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,958
I CANNOT HOPE TO RESIST YOU.

408
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,291
WAN SHAWNG SHE MING
HAS BEEN SWALLOWED UP WHOLE.

409
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,250
I HAVE FOREVER BEEN INTEGRATED
INTO THE PERFECT FORCE

410
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,625
TO END THIS PLAGUE-RIDDEN WORLD
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

411
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,750
YOU ARE A TRUE MONSTER, DUBHE.

412
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,875
ONE FIT TO DEVOUR ALL HUMANITY.

413
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,166
SUCH DIVINE ENTERTAINMENT!

414
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,166
( laughing )

415
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,208
- ( screaming )

416
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,916
- Choka: MY LORD!
WHAT IS THE MATTER?

417
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,916
- ( Keiro still screaming )

418
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,041
I LEAVE MANKIND IN MY WAKE!

419
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,500
DESTROYER OF WORLDS.

420
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,583
DUBHE! WILD WARRIOR GOD!

421
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,125
( laughing )

422
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,208
- BEST OF LUCK
IN THE BATTLE AHEAD.

423
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,916
WE'RE ALL BANKING
ON YOUR SAFE RETURN!

424
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,625
- THANK YOU.

425
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,375
KEEP A CLOSE EYE
ON TAIGA AND THE REST OF 'EM!

426
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,833
- BROTHER, PLEASE.

427
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,250
SAVE OUR LAND.

428
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,166
WE SHALL PRAY FOR VICTORY!

429
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,916
- Taito: THIS'LL PROBABLY BE
OUR FINAL BATTLE.

430
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,625
AND WE MIGHT NOT ALL
SURVIVE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY.

431
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,666
ARE YOU STILL WILLING TO ENTER
THE FRAY THIS ONE LAST TIME?

432
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,541
- YEAH. I'VE LIVED
MY WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS DAY.

433
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,291
- TRY AND STOP ME.

434
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,333
LAILA, I WILL PROTECT YOU
NO MATTER WHAT

435
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,833
WE MAY BE UP AGAINST.

436
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,541
THEY WOULD HAVE TO
TEAR ME APART TO GET TO YOU.

437
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,875
- THEN I GUESS I'D JUST HAVE TO
PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER.

438
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,500
- YOU WOULD, REALLY?

439
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,166
- RYUKO WILL MAKE HIS WAY
BACK TO THE PATH.

440
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,375
TOGETHER WE CAN ALL BE
THE HANDS THAT WILL HELP

441
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,875
TO GUIDE HIM THERE.

442
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,791
- IT'S UP TO ALL OF US
TO PULL THE EMPIRE

443
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,041
OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND HATRED

444
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,375
AND MAKE IT A PLACE
OF HAPPINESS.

445
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,958
A PLACE OF TRUE PEACE.

446
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,208
SO, LET'S MOVE OUT!

447
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,291
- ( theme song playing )

448
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

449
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,791
- Koyo: THE WILD DANCE OF THE
STARS REACHES A STATE OF FRENZY.

450
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,250
- STRIKE ME DOWN.

451
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,041
- YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? I SAID
I'M NOT GOING TO KILL YOU!

452
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,458
- Ryuko: IF YOU FALL BY MY HAND,

453
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,500
THE MONSTER WILL
REIGN UNCHALLENGED!

454
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:53,083
- PRECISELY. ONCE A FIGURATIVE
PAWN, NOW A PAWN IN FACT.

455
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,958
- Laila: STOP HIM.
HE'S GONNA KILL TAITO.

456
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,250
RYUKO OR NOT,
WE CAN'T JUST STAND HERE!

457
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,583
- Koyo: FED BY SORROW,

458
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,958
INHUMAN FIGURES WRITHE
AND REVEL IN DESTRUCTION.
