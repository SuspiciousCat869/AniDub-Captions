1
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,375
- ( laughing )

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,125
THIS IS MORE LIKE IT!

3
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:28,125
THE SUN IS OUT SHINING,
THE BIRDS ARE OUT SINGING.

4
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,708
DEFINITELY THE RIGHT
WAY TO BEGIN A JOURNEY!

5
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,291
GOOD TIMES ARE AHEAD, FRIENDS!

6
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,625
- LAILA, IS HOSEI ALL RIGHT?

7
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,583
- POOR WIDDLE TAITY-WITEY BEAR.

8
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,833
WHY ARE YOU SO
WORRIED, MY CHILD?

9
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,208
- WHAT THE HELL'D YOU CALL ME?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,625
- LOOK UP, LITTLE TAITY.

11
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,750
GAZE INTO THE ENDLESS
AZURE SKIES ABOVE OUR HEADS.

12
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,500
THERE IS MUSIC FILLING
THE THE AIR. LISTEN.

13
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,041
THE BIRDS SERENADING US
WITH THEIR SWEET SONGS.

14
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,541
- UH, YEAH.

15
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,583
- NOW, DEAR FRIENDS!

16
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,458
THE CAPITAL
BECKONS US TO COME!

17
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:59,833
THE ROAD AHEAD IS
FILLED WITH JOY. REJOICE!

18
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,750
- HE'S FINALLY LOST HIS MIND.

19
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,708
WHAT LITTLE BIT
HE HAD TO START WITH.

20
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,375
- ( theme song playing )

21
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,916
( singing in English )

22
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,583
- HEY LAILA, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT'S COME OVER

23
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,083
HOSEI THIS MORNING?

24
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,916
AFTER ALL THAT STUFF
HE WENT THROUGH,

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,583
HE'S JUST LAUGHING
LIKE AN IDIOT.

26
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,625
- HOW CAN YOU ALWAYS
BE SO THICK-HEADED?

27
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,833
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS THAT
HE'S HAVING TO FORCE

28
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,375
HIMSELF TO LAUGH LIKE THAT?

29
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,875
- YOU THINK SO?

30
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,916
- THIS IS CLEARLY A DESPERATE
ATTEMPT TO RID HIS MIND

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,125
OF THOUGHTS OF YESTERDAY'S
GRUESOME EVENTS.

32
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,166
QUITE SAD.

33
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,291
- YEAH, YOU'RE
RIGHT. POOR GUY.

34
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,875
- HEY! WHAT'S THE DEAL?

35
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,375
HURRY IT UP, SLOWPOKES!

36
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,583
- I CAN'T TRUST OUR
LIVES TO THAT BRIDGE.

37
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,291
- WE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK FOR
ANOTHER WAY TO CROSS THE RIVER.

38
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,458
- AW, DON'T LET IT
SCARE YOU, LITTLE GUY.

39
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,458
CROSSING THIS THING IS
GONNA BE A BREEZE.

40
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,166
I'LL GO FIRST SO YOU
CAN SEE HOW EASY IT IS.

41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,500
- NO, IT'S NOT SAFE!
- HEY, STOP!

42
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,791
- All: HOSEI!

43
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,041
- ( Hosei laughing )

44
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,583
- HOSEI'S TRAUMA
IS QUITE SEVERE.

45
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,750
BEING FORCED TO STRIKE
DOWN ONE'S MASTER

46
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,333
AND CHILDHOOD CAREGIVER...

47
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,333
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
THE PAIN HE'S IN.

48
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,166
- YEAH? SO NOW WHAT?

49
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,541
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING
BESIDES JUST STAND HERE

50
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,791
AND TALK ABOUT IT.

51
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,250
- YOU'RE RIGHT. SO WHAT
DO YOU PROPOSE WE DO?

52
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,208
HAVE YOU A PLAN
TO EASE HIS SUFFERING?

53
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,000
- NO PLAN, BUT I'M SURE
THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

54
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,625
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, LAILA?

55
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,125
- I SWEAR, IT'S
ALWAYS THE SAME.

56
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,958
YOU SCRAPE AROUND IN YOUR TINY
BRAIN LOOKING FOR A GOOD IDEA

57
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,125
AND THEN TURN TO ME FOR HELP
WHEN YOU COME UP EMPTY-HANDED.

58
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,250
- I DENIGRATE!

59
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,125
- DELEGATE! BUT STILL...

60
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,250
AS SURPRISING AS IT IS,
YOU ARE ACTUALLY RIGHT

61
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,666
ABOUT SOMETHING.

62
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,000
THE THREE OF US JUST NEED
TO PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER

63
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,583
AND THINK OF SOME WAY
WE COULD LIFT HIS SPIRITS

64
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,250
FOR A LITTLE WHILE AT LEAST.

65
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,541
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEAS, RYUKO?

66
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,750
- YOU'RE SMART.
- YOU WANT ME TO CHEER HOSEI UP?

67
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,250
I DON'T KNOW. I'M AFRAID
I'VE GOT NOTHING IN MIND.

68
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,833
- IS THAT SO? ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING IN MIND, HUH?

69
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,666
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

70
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,208
WAIT, HOLD ON. HOSEI
IS A SIMPLE SORT OF MAN.

71
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,291
WE KNOW WHAT HE TRULY DESIRES.

72
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,833
SOME ATTENTION FROM
YOU WOULD HELP.

73
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,250
- YOU KNOW I
HAVE BEEN TRYING.

74
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,125
- THAT'S SO SWEET,
BUT DON'T WORRY, LAILA.

75
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,833
I'M FINE. BUT I'M GLAD YOU
WERE THINKING ABOUT ME.

76
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,208
I KNEW YOU WOULD.

77
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,458
( laughs )

78
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,333
- I TRIED, BUT JUST COULDN'T
GET THROUGH TO HIM.

79
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,708
- HMM? IS THAT SO?

80
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,708
- HE NEEDS TO EAT,
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

81
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,125
- SO HE'S HUNGRY?

82
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,291
- A GOOD MEAL WILL GIVE
HIM HIS ENERGY BACK.

83
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,000
A MEAL WITH LOTS OF MEAT.

84
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,166
TRUST ME. SO, BYE.

85
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,708
- HOLD ON, TAITO.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

86
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,833
- TO GET MEAT,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

87
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,166
- UGH, HE MAKES ME SO MAD!

88
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,166
HE JUST THINKS HE CAN DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS ALL THE TIME.

89
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,416
REALLY? HE NEEDS MEAT?

90
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,583
HE HONESTLY THINKS THAT
HOSEI NEEDS TO STUFF

91
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,750
HIS FACE TO FEEL BETTER?

92
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,083
IT'S JUST SO
CHILDISH AND STUPID.

93
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,500
BACK ME UP HERE.

94
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,833
- WELL, IT'S NOT ALL THAT
UNREASONABLE, ACTUALLY.

95
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,458
- WHAT? ARE YOU SURE?

96
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,916
- YES, I AM. AND I WOULD GO
SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST THAT,

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,375
YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE
TO PREPARE THE MEAL FOR HIM.

98
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,125
- I DON'T KNOW...

99
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,458
- I KNOW OF NOTHING THAT
BETTER NOURISHES A MAN

100
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,958
THAN A MEAL
FIRST WARMED,

101
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,000
BY THE HEART OF
HIS TRUE BELOVED.

102
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,958
- MY WORD! I THINK YOU MAY BE
TAKING THIS A LITTLE TOO FAR.

103
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,250
BUT THE WAY YOU'RE TALKING

104
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,291
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

105
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,583
- ( hesitatingly ) WELL,
A BIT, PERHAPS.

106
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,250
- AW, THAT IS
JUST SO SWEET!

107
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,291
SO, TELL ME ALL
ABOUT THIS GIRL.

108
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,125
WHAT IS SHE LIKE?

109
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,833
- I DON'T QUITE
KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

110
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,333
- COME ON.

111
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,083
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACT SO
EMBARRASSED AROUND ME, RYUKO.

112
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,958
OUT WITH IT.

113
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,875
- WELL, SHE WORKS AS AN
ATTENDANT AT THE TONG YO TEMPLE.

114
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,416
- OH YEAH?

115
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,625
SO, IS SHE PRETTY?

116
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,833
- YES, BOTH HER
VISAGE AND HER MIND.

117
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,166
TO WIN HER HEART WOULD
BE A LOFTY GOAL.

118
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,083
ESPECIALLY FOR A MAN SO
INEXPERIENCED AS MYSELF.

119
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,333
- ( sneezes )

120
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,000
I DID IT AGAIN.

121
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,500
SO MANY SOULS
SEEKING SUSTENANCE.

122
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,833
WE CAN QUIET THEIR
STOMACHS, AT LEAST.

123
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,375
- HELLO. I ASSUME YOU ARE A
MEMBER OF THE TONG YO TEMPLE?

124
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,125
- YES, I AM.

125
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,708
- WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE
FOR ME TO HELP YOU

126
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,625
WITH YOUR DUTIES HERE?

127
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,083
- HELP ME?

128
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,833
IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME ASKING,

129
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,208
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
OF YOUR STATUS

130
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,958
WANT TO DO
THIS KIND OF WORK?

131
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,416
- I CAN'T SAY.

132
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,625
- NO MATTER. YOUR
HELP IS APPRECIATED.

133
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,416
- RIGHT THIS WAY.
- Taki: YES, MA'AM.

134
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,083
YOU COMING, SHOKAKU?

135
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,291
- GO AHEAD, BUT TAKE GREAT CARE.

136
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,750
- YES, I WILL. THANK YOU.

137
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,916
- IF YOU'RE CONCERNED,
MAY I SUGGEST

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,875
YOU THROW IN
YOUR LOT AS WELL?

139
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,416
- IT IS NOT JUST THE
FOOD THAT NOURISHES.

140
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,208
BUT THE FEELINGS BEHIND IT.

141
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,666
QUALITY OF THE MEAL
IS A SECONDARY MATTER.

142
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,791
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,
THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU ASSUME

143
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,833
I'M GONNA MAKE A HORRIBLE MEAL
FOR HIM, HE'LL STILL LIKE IT?

144
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,250
- THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I MEAN.

145
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,125
- IT SURE SOUNDED
THAT WAY TO ME.

146
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,333
AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

147
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,958
I AM FAIRLY SKILLED IN
THE ART OF COOKING.

148
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,791
MY FATHER WOULD
ALWAYS SAY TO ME,

149
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,833
"LAILA, PLEASE DON'T WASTE
YOUR CULINARY TALENTS

150
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:32,916
ON ME, DEAR CHILD,

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,500
SAVE THEM FOR
YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND."

152
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,750
- DID HE?
SOUNDS QUITE PROMISING.

153
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,291
IN THAT CASE, I WILL JOIN
TAITO AND HELP HIM TO COLLECT

154
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,083
THE INGREDIENTS FOR THE MEAL.

155
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,000
PERHAPS YOU COULD
SUGGEST TO HOSEI,

156
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,583
THAT HE TRY HIS LUCK
FISHING 'TIL WE RETURN.

157
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,833
- SOUNDS GOOD.

158
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,375
- THEN I'LL TAKE MY LEAVE.

159
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,500
- IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
TAITO, HE WENT THE OTHER WAY.

160
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,916
- ( laughs sheepishly )

161
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,166
- I WANNA EAT SOME
TASTY GOOD MEAT!

162
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,583
BUT I DO WONDER,

163
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,875
WHAT KIND OF MEAT WILL
I BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HERE?

164
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,750
WHO CARES?

165
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,291
I'LL JUST CATCH WHATEVER
MEATY CREATURE

166
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,958
IS UNLUCKY ENOUGH
TO CROSS MY PATH

167
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,833
AND DO THE BEST I CAN WITH IT.

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,250
THAT LOOKS LIKE MEAT!

169
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,958
I'LL GET YOU!

170
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,500
HEY, NOW! YOU GOTTA
STAY STILL SO I CAN GRAB YOU!

171
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,791
( groans )

172
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,458
YOU HAVE GOT
SOME KIND OF NERVE!

173
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,625
- AND YET AGAIN,
I AM LOST.

174
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,375
- WHAT IS TAKING
THEM SO LONG?

175
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,791
COME ON, GUYS!

176
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,000
WE CAN'T WAIT ALL DAY
OR WE'LL STARVE TO DEATH!

177
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,833
HURRY IT UP!

178
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,416
I NEED THESE INGREDIENTS

179
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,458
SO I CAN MAKE THIS
LOVING MEAL FOR HOSEI.

180
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,833
OKAY, FINE. I'LL GO!

181
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,000
I GUESS I'LL JUST
DO EVERYTHING!

182
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,666
- STUPID RABBIT.

183
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,250
NOT ENOUGH MEAT ON THEM
FOR A DECENT MEAL ANYWAY.

184
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,166
BIRDS, HUH?
THEY COULD BE TASTY.

185
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,333
DON'T FLY AWAY!

186
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,375
( sinister laugh )

187
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,291
- NOW, THIS PLACE
SEEMS UNFAMILIAR.

188
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:30,041
- WOW! THAT
IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

189
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,291
NOW WHY DID I NOT THINK
OF LOOKING FOR THESE SOONER?

190
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,000
MY GOSH!
THIS IS AMAZING!

191
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,166
I THINK THIS ONE IS
A SHENZEN MUSHROOM.

192
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,333
THEY SAY THAT EATING
ONE OF THESE LITTLE GUYS

193
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,250
WILL CURE ALMOST ANYTHING.

194
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,208
AND THIS IS A KANKIN.

195
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,583
I HEAR IT'S GOT A BUNCH
OF REALLY GOOD STUFF

196
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,750
FOR YOU IN IT TOO.

197
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,416
OH, MY. IT'S LIKE
FINDING BURIED TREASURE.

198
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,458
WHATEVER I MAKE OUT OF
THIS STUFF IS GONNA MAKE

199
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,041
HOSEI FEEL BETTER THAN
HE EVER HAS BEFORE!

200
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,375
( laughs )

201
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,833
- THOSE STUPID BIRDS.

202
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,666
EVEN AFTER I TOLD
THEM NOT TO FLY AWAY,

203
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,250
THEY JUST TOOK OFF INTO
THE AIR LIKE THAT'S WHAT

204
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,625
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO OR SOMETHING

205
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,500
TAKING ALL THAT DRY STRINGY
MEAT AWAY WITH THEM,

206
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,500
WHICH IS GOOD 'CAUSE WE NEED
SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT

207
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,875
IF WE WANT TO GET OUR
ENERGY BACK UP. WHAT'S THIS?

208
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,333
- ( chittering )

209
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,375
- I GUESS THOSE GUYS
TECHNICALLY COUNT AS MEAT.

210
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,416
- ( chuckles )

211
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,250
OH, WELL, THEY ACTUALLY
MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD

212
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,791
AS A LITTLE SIDE DISH.

213
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,750
ALL RIGHT. MAYBE I'LL HAVE
BETTER LUCK THIS TIME.

214
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,625
COME BACK HERE!

215
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,416
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

216
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,375
( groans )

217
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,750
THAT HURT.

218
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,708
- DEAD END, HUH?

219
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,875
RIGHT, THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP,

220
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,125
WOULD BE TO RETRACE THE
EXACT PATH THAT LED ME

221
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,041
TO THE PLACE
WHERE I NOW STAND.

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,708
AND THAT WAS...

223
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,583
- STAY FOCUSED.
AND DON'T RUSH.

224
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,416
APPLY THE SKILLS YOU
LEARNED IN YOUR TRAINING.

225
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,958
THE KEY IS TO PUT YOURSELF
INSIDE THE MIND

226
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,125
OF YOUR OPPONENT.

227
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,041
AND THEN...
GOT HIM!

228
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,791
( laughs ) SEE?

229
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,333
- MASTER...

230
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:35,916
- HOSEI?

231
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,958
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY

232
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,208
I COOKED UP A
SPECIAL MEAL FOR YOU.

233
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,791
I HOPE YOU'D LIKE IT.
WANNA TRY SOME?

234
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,750
- MM.

235
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,541
- REALLY? THAT'S GREAT!

236
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,791
HERE YOU GO.

237
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,916
I DON'T WANNA BRAG, BUT
I'M A PRETTY GOOD LITTLE COOK.

238
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,958
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT MUSHROOMS
AND HERBS TASTE GOOD TOGETHER.

239
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,375
- ( Hosei screams )

240
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,875
- ( shouts )

241
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,083
- RIGHT. THIS WAY.

242
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,666
- GOTTA GET SOME
MEAT TO EAT.

243
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,375
- ( leaves rustling )

244
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,541
- THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING IN THERE.

245
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,458
WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S DINNER!

246
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,541
RYUKO?

247
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,291
SORRY ABOUT BASHING
YOUR SKULL LIKE THAT BACK THERE.

248
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,458
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE
TOO MAD AT ME ABOUT IT.

249
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,458
I HONESTLY THOUGHT YOU WERE
SOME KIND OF BEAR OR SOMETHING.

250
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,291
BUT, YOU KNOW,

251
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,875
FOR BEING SUCH A TRAINED
WARRIOR YOU SHOULD HAVE

252
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,125
BEEN ABLE TO AVOID THAT.

253
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,208
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN JUST
FOOLING AROUND, RIGHT?

254
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,666
- I KNEW IT WAS
YOU BACK THERE.

255
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,500
THAT'S WHY I HAD MY GUARD
DOWN IN THE FIRST PLACE.

256
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,000
I THOUGHT I WAS MEETING UP WITH
A TRUSTED MEMBER OF MY PARTY,

257
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,125
NOT SOME ROGUE
BAMBOO-WIELDING ATTACKER!

258
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,375
BUT I SHOULD HAVE
ANTICIPATED AS MUCH.

259
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,708
YOU ALWAYS JUST
ACT ON IMPULSE.

260
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,625
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THE
ORDEAL I JUST WENT THROUGH

261
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,000
TRYING TO TRACK YOU DOWN
TO SEE IF YOU NEEDED HELP.

262
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,208
- LET ME GUESS, IT WAS AN ORDEAL
BECAUSE YOU GOT LOST, RIGHT?

263
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,500
- DO I LOOK LOST?

264
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,625
I'M STANDING IN
FRONT OF YOU, AREN'T I?

265
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,541
- POOR FELLA. YOU
GOT SCARED AND LONELY

266
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,791
OUT THERE BY YOURSELF.

267
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,250
EVERYTHING'S OKAY
NOW THAT YOU'RE WITH...

268
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,166
- JUST SAY ONE MORE THING.

269
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,583
GO AHEAD, TAITO.

270
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,708
- SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
- WE'RE GOOD.

271
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,083
- NOW, THEN. WE MUST
CONTINUE ON IN OUR SEARCH

272
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,458
FOR INGREDIENTS IF LAILA
IS TO PREPARE THE MEAL.

273
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,916
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET'S GO THEN.

274
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,125
- HOSEI.

275
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,750
I KNOW THAT LAST
BATCH WASN'T PERFECT.

276
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,750
BUT, THIS ONE'S DIFFERENT.

277
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,750
SEE, THE LAST ONE
WAS WAY TOO BITTER,

278
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,333
SO I DECIDED TO SPICE
THINGS UP A LITTLE.

279
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,750
WELL, CARE TO GIVE
ME A SECOND CHANCE?

280
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,125
- ( screaming )

281
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,333
- WHAT WAS THAT?

282
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,750
IT SOUNDED LIKE SOME
KINDA PAINED ANIMAL.

283
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,541
- IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

284
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,375
DUSK WILL SOON BE UPON US.

285
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,208
WE NEED TO FIND OUR PREY.

286
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,250
HUNTING WITHOUT
SUNLIGHT WOULD PROVE TO

287
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,541
BE QUITE DIFFICULT INDEED.

288
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,375
- DAMN IT. I KNEW I
SHOULDN'T HAVE PASSED

289
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,666
ON THOSE LITTLE GUYS EARLIER.

290
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,208
AT LEAST WE
WOULD'VE HAD SOMETHING.

291
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,416
- SO YOU PASSED
ON THEM, DID YOU?

292
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,083
- YES, I DID.

293
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,333
AND I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU BEING AROUND TO

294
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,500
SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT!

295
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,041
- I DIDN'T NEED TO BE THERE.

296
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,250
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

297
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,375
YOU CHARGED AT
SOMETHING HEAD ON,

298
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,666
AND THEY, OF COURSE, RAN AWAY.

299
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,916
MOST WILD CREATURES DON'T JUST
WILLINGLY CLIMB INTO YOUR MOUTH.

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,500
- SO, TELL ME, HOW
FAR DID YOU GET BEFORE

301
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,791
YOU KNEW YOU WERE LOST?

302
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,750
YOU NEED TO DROP
WHAT HAS PASSED.

303
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,833
- YEAH, SURE.

304
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,666
AND I ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER
NEVER TO RELY ON YOUR

305
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,458
EXPERT SKILLS OF NAVIGATION.

306
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,791
- ( scoffs )

307
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,833
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
I TAKE MY LEAD FROM SOMEONE

308
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,625
WHO CANNOT MUSTER THE
BRAINS TO OUTWIT

309
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,708
THE FAMOUSLY
CUNNING CHIPMUNK.

310
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,791
- WHAT WAS THAT?

311
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,583
- ( squealing )

312
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,916
- FINALLY! SOME MEAT!

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,416
- WAIT, TAITO!

314
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST RUN
UP THAT CLIFF AND GRAB HIM?

315
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,916
- WHAT'S WRONG?

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,958
ARE YOU TOO SCARED YOU
WILL GET LOST ON THE WAY UP?

317
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,375
- ( yells )

318
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,041
- WHAT?

319
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,000
- LISTEN, TAITO. IF YOU
WANT THIS TO BE A CHALLENGE,

320
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,083
YOU'LL HAVE TO CLIMB UP
MUCH FASTER THAN THAT!

321
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,125
HE'S FAST.

322
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,750
- I GOT HERE FIRST!

323
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,500
- SORRY, BUT MY FOOT TOUCHED
DOWN AN INSTANT SOONER.

324
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,708
- ( boar grunting )

325
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,083
- ( both yelling )

326
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:17,583
- HOSEI, MY CHILD!
- YES, MASTER.

327
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,041
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

328
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,708
- Laila: HOSEI!

329
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,291
IT'S REALLY PERFECT THIS TIME.

330
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,083
I FIGURED OUT
WHERE I WENT WRONG!

331
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,958
THE FIRST BATCH WAS TOO BITTER
AND THE LAST ONE TOO SPICY,

332
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,083
SO I DECIDED A LITTLE SWEETNESS
IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED!

333
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,541
SO, DIG IN!

334
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,708
- ( Hosei screams )

335
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,375
- I'M THE ONE WHO THOUGHT
OF HUNTING IN THE FIRST PLACE,

336
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,666
WHILE YOU WERE BUSY
WANDERING AROUND IN

337
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,083
THE WOODS
LOOKING FOR A FRIEND.

338
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,875
- I WAS TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO COULD RELATE TO YOU

339
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,000
ON AN INTELLECTUAL
LEVEL, LIKE A MONKEY!

340
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,416
- SO I TAKE IT YOU'RE GONNA
KEEP GETTING IN MY WAY?

341
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,000
- THERE IS NO WAY I'M GOING TO
LET YOU DO THIS ON YOUR OWN!

342
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,125
TOO SLOW!

343
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,791
- YOU'RE ALWAYS ABLE TO COME UP
WITH ANOTHER PLAN, AREN'T YA?

344
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,583
- I SEE YOU'VE IMPROVED
IN THINKING ON YOUR FEET!

345
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,000
- ( laughs )

346
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,916
- WHAT'S THAT?
- HUH? WHAT IS WHAT?

347
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,125
- ( groans )

348
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,041
- HEY, NOW!
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

349
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,708
- THEN MAINTAIN YOUR FOCUS.
YOU'LL REMAIN ON YOUR FEET!

350
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:28,375
- BASTARD! NOW YOU'VE MADE
ME MORE THAN MAD, I'M CURIOUS!

351
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,666
- IT'S FURIOUS!

352
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,583
AND YOU DARE TO CALL
ME A FOOL, DO YOU?

353
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,125
WITH NO SENSE OF DIRECTION?

354
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,125
- THAT IS PRETTY SAD, RYUKO!

355
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,083
EVEN YOUR STAFF
CAN'T FIND ME, HUH?

356
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,416
- SHUT UP!

357
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,625
- ( burbling )

358
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,333
- COME ON, BOIL!
COME ON, BUBBLE!

359
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,250
- ( hissing )

360
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,666
- YES, THAT'S IT.
NOW WORK YOUR MAGIC.

361
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,083
WIPE THAT FROWN
OFF HIS FACE FOREVER!

362
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,875
- ALL BRAWN AND NO BRAINS!

363
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,166
JUST STOP, MONKEY!

364
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,083
YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING.
GET BACK HERE!

365
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,083
- ALL RIGHT THEN.
YOU GOT IT, TOUGH GUY.

366
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,333
HERE I COME!

367
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,875
- ( growls )

368
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,458
- HE'S USING CHANNELING,
THE DAMN FOOL!

369
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,541
- GET READY! I'M COMING!

370
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,083
- ( explosion )

371
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,958
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU! COULD YOU
POSSIBLY BE ANY MORE SELFISH?

372
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,291
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GATHER
FOOD FOR OUR MEAL TONIGHT,

373
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,916
BUT ALL YOU DID WAS WASTE TIME
FIGHTING LIKE CHILDREN ALL DAY?

374
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,083
- IT WAS REALLY MORE
LIKE A TEST OF OUR SKILLS.

375
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,333
- THAT'S NO EXCUSE!

376
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,666
- SORRY.
- UGH!

377
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,833
SO I GUESS I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO DID ANYTHING TO HELP HOSEI!

378
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,916
- AND SPEAKING OF HOSEI...

379
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,333
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE WENT?

380
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:28,500
- YEAH, HE, UH, HE SAID HE
WANTED SOME TIME ALONE.

381
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,791
- LAILA, YOU CAN
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

382
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,125
WHY DID HE LEAVE?

383
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,000
WAS IT MAYBE BECAUSE
YOU SAID OR DID SOMETHING

384
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,666
THAT MADE HIM UPSET?

385
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,833
- DON'T BE STUPID!

386
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,833
I WAS ACTUALLY SUPER
NICE TO HIM ALL DAY.

387
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,625
AS A MATTER OF FACT I EVEN MADE
HIM A LOVELY MEAL OF MUSHROOMS

388
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,000
AND STUFF I FOUND
WHILE YOU TWO IDIOTS...

389
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,375
- OH, HE ATE YOUR FOOD?

390
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,458
THAT TOTALLY
EXPLAINS WHY HE LEFT!

391
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,916
- WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY THAT?

392
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,958
HOW DOES THAT
EXPLAIN ANYTHING?

393
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,500
- YOUR COOKING IS
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE, LAILA.

394
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,875
IT WOULD MAKE THE STRONGEST
GUY OUT THERE RUN FOR HIS LIFE.

395
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,458
- IS IT REALLY THAT BAD?

396
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,541
- "BAD" ISN'T EVEN
THE WORD FOR IT.

397
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,000
FATHER AND I BARELY SURVIVED
AFTER EATING HER LAST MEAL.

398
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,208
- Ryuko: SERIOUSLY?

399
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,333
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

400
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,958
- HEY, RELAX.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

401
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,875
- YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
- HOSEI.

402
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,583
- SO, WHAT'S WITH THE FISH?
- Hosei: I CAUGHT DINNER.

403
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,416
- Hosei: YOU'RE HUNGRY, AREN'T
YOU? SO LET'S CHOW DOWN.

404
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,625
- THANK YOU.

405
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,166
- NO WORRIES.
AND THANK YOU.

406
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,750
I'M REALLY FEELING
A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

407
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,291
- WOW, HOSEI,
I GUESS YOU CAN BE

408
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,041
A PRETTY ALL RIGHT
GUY SOMETIMES.

409
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,125
- WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY "SOMETIMES?"

410
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:49,250
- HEY, LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
SOME STEW GOING ALREADY!

411
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,708
- THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
I'M REALLY QUITE HUNGRY.

412
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,791
- NO! DON'T DO IT, YOU GUYS!

413
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,791
- ( Taito and Ryuko screaming )

414
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,833
- ( theme song playing )

415
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,208
( singing in Japanese )

416
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:40,166
- Ryuko: WE PROCEED ON TO OUR
FINAL DESTINATION, LUO CHANG.

417
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,833
- Hosei: SO IS THIS GUY
REALLY AS TOUGH AS YOU

418
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,083
MAKE HIM OUT TO BE?

419
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,541
- Ryuko: IF THE HEAVENS
DEEM YOUR CAUSE WORTHY,

420
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,791
A PATH WILL UNFURL
BEFORE YOU OF ITS OWN ACCORD.

421
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,750
- Shimei: BUT RATHER THAN
COME HERE FOR A TUSSLE,

422
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,500
I'D PREFER WE AVAIL OURSELVES
OF CIVILIZED DISCOURSE.

423
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,291
- Ryuko: RICH THOUGH
THE CITY MAY SEEM,

424
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,541
IT DOES HAVE A SHADOW.

425
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,958
- Taito: LIKE HE GIVES A
DAMN ABOUT THE PEOPLE!

426
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,958
- Ryuko: NEXT TIME
ON HERO TALES,

427
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:02,166
THE KARMIC CYCLE CONTINUES
ITS ETERNAL ROTATION

428
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,416
IN CHAPTER NINE,

429
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:15,916
"SHADOW ON
THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL."

430
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,416
- Shimei: FATE HAS MADE
ITS CHOICE. THE HELM OF

431
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
THIS BROKEN LAND IS YOURS!
