1
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,041
- MASTER SOEI! TAITO!
- LIEN?

2
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,208
- WHAT'S WRONG?

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,541
- ( grunts )

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,333
- WHY ARE YOU JERKS EVEN HERE?

5
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,125
- WHY? WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO COME AND BURN

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,708
LIAN TONG TO THE GROUND?

7
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,541
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KILL
INNOCENT PEOPLE TO GET TO ME?

8
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,833
KEIRO!

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,083
- ( theme song playing )

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,041
- I'LL KILL HIM.

11
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,791
HEY!

12
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,000
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

13
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,666
- I'M SORRY.

14
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,458
WE FAILED YOU.

15
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,625
XUAN LANG, THEY, THEY ATTACKED
SO QUICKLY, WE...

16
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,208
- DON'T WASTE YOUR
STRENGTH, IT'S OKAY.

17
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:57,125
- TAITO! LIEN!
- LAILA! YOU OKAY?

18
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,000
- YEAH, ME AND THE
KIDS ARE OKAY.

19
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,250
SO MANY PEOPLE GAVE
UP THEIR LIVES TO SAVE US.

20
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,833
- IT'S HORRIBLE.
- HE'LL PAY FOR THIS.

21
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,375
- BASTARD!
- STOP. TAITO.

22
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,416
YOU NEED TO USE YOUR
ANGER CONSTRUCTIVELY.

23
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,083
LEAVE THE FIGHTING TO THE OTHERS

24
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,250
AND HELP ME AND YOUR SISTER
TEND TO THE WOUNDED.

25
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,750
- BUT, FATHER!

26
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:19,750
- HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE MOTTO
OF THE QING LONG PLATOON?

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,041
- WE SWEAR TO WORK FOR PEACE.

28
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,750
TO HELP OTHERS
AND TO LOVE OUR FELLOW MAN.

29
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,000
- THAT'S RIGHT THE DIVINE
WARRIORS CAN HANDLE

30
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,250
THE IMPERIAL TROOPS.

31
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,958
BUT YOU ARE A PART
OF THE QING LONG PLATOON,

32
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,416
FIRST AND FOREMOST.

33
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,375
- YES, SIR.

34
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,458
- WE CAN HELP TOO.

35
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,916
- Taito: STILL FOR WHAT
YOU'VE DONE TO US TODAY.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,416
I WILL SEE TO IT MYSELF
THAT YOU GO DOWN.

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,583
- ( indistinct shouting )

38
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,916
- STOP MOVING, DAMN IT!

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,375
COME ON, FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN.

40
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,125
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHY
THE HELL YOU CAME HERE.

41
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,250
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT BURNS
INSIDE THESE WALLS?

42
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,000
PRICELESS RELICS ARE TURNING
TO ASH AS WE SPEAK.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,166
SO THAT MEANS...

44
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,458
- THEY'VE COME HERE FOR TAITO.
FOR HIS HEAD AT LEAST.

45
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,583
- A DAMN FOOL'S ERRAND.

46
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,125
BUT STILL IT'S QUITE STRANGE.

47
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,833
I MEAN, WHO WOULD THINK
THAT THIS SORRY LOT,

48
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,541
COULD EVEN DREAM
OF TAKING ON ALKAID

49
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,708
AND THREE DIVINE WARRIORS
AND LIVE TO TAKE THE PRIZE?

50
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,291
WELL, THEIR MISTAKE.

51
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,500
- Man: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS
HANDLE THAT ONE OVER THERE.

52
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,875
- I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.

53
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,250
- HOSEI.

54
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,750
- RINMEI.

55
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:55,916
- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO
DISPOSE OF QUITE A FEW

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,250
OF THE IMPERIAL TROOPS.

57
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,041
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
THINGS UNDER CONTROL HERE.

58
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,291
- I'M NOT SO SURE HOW
"UNDER CONTROL" IT IS!

59
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,833
I WAS FIGHTING ONE OF
THOSE GIRL NINJAS

60
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:04,916
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT,

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,375
SHE COMPLETELY
DISAPPEARED SOMEWHERE.

62
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,958
- I WONDER.

63
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,500
WAS ALL THIS CARNAGE
JUST TO CREATE

64
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,125
SOME KIND OF DISTRACTION?

65
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,250
BUT FROM WHAT?

66
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,250
- WHERE'S KOYO?
- BEATS ME. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

67
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,291
- UGH, I TOLD HIM TO COME HERE
TO HELP WITH THE FIRES,

68
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,375
BUT I GUESS HE CHOSE
NOT TO LISTEN TO ME.

69
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,500
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

70
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:28,083
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW
YOU THAT MEN ARE, HOPELESS!

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,916
OH, I MEAN, UH...

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,291
( chuckles )

73
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,041
- IF YOUR AIM IS TO KILL
A HELPLESS OLD MAN,

74
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,833
AT LEAST GIVE ME THE
PLEASURE OF A LOOK.

75
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,041
- I KNOW MY TARGET BETTER
THAN YOU THINK.

76
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,625
THE NAME SONNEI OF LIAN
TONG TEMPLE CARRIES WITH IT

77
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,041
QUITE A CACHET
THROUGHOUT THE EMPIRE.

78
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,208
- ( laughs ) MY DEAR,
YOU CERTAINLY DO FLATTER ME.

79
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,083
BUT PUTTING ALL MODESTY ASIDE,

80
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,083
THIS SMALL BAND OF GIRLS IS
NOT ENOUGH TO TAKE ME DOWN.

81
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,583
- ( gasps )

82
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,666
- YOU ARE A LIVELY ONE,
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

83
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,875
- YES, WELL, YOU REALLY
SHOULD'VE SEEN ME

84
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,000
WHEN I WAS STILL IN MY PRIME.

85
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,666
- ( indistinct chattering )

86
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,041
- Boy: HEY,
HE'S GOING TO BE FINE.

87
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,208
- THERE, THAT SHOULD
DO THE TRICK.

88
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,250
- I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR
HELP, YOUNG MASTER.

89
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,166
- ANYBODY ELSE NEED PATCHING
UP AROUND HERE, POP?

90
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,208
- WELL, I THINK WE'RE
GETTING A HANDLE ON IT.

91
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,541
TAITO, I'M EXTREMELY
PROUD OF YOU.

92
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,083
- I'M, UH, JUST DOING
WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO.

93
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,333
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

94
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,083
BEFORE, YOU WOULD HAVE
JUST RUN OFF TO FIGHT

95
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,083
WITHOUT LISTENING
TO A WORD I SAID.

96
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,791
YOU'VE REALLY GROWN UP.

97
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,708
- THANK YOU, POP.

98
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,791
- ( gasps )

99
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,625
- WHAT THE? GET DOWN FROM THERE.

100
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,541
- GRANDPA!
- SONNEI!

101
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,875
- HARK, ALKAID.

102
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,583
IF YOU VALUE THE LIFE
OF THIS DECREPIT WARRIOR,

103
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,000
YOU'LL COME HERE ALONE AT ONCE!

104
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,958
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.

105
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,916
- SO THAT'S IT. THEY WERE
TRYING TO GET MASTER SONNEI.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,083
THIS WHOLE TIME.

107
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,958
- THAT ISN'T FAIR.
HE'S JUST AN OLD MAN.

108
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,166
THOSE GIRLS SHOULD BE
TAUGHT LESSON IN RESPECT.

109
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,500
- ALL YOU "DIVINE" WARRIORS
NEED TO STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

110
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,750
IF ANY ONE OF YOU

111
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:56,041
TAKES ONE STEP CLOSER,
THEN THE OLD MAN DIES.

112
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,625
- DAMN YOU, YOU HAG!

113
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,750
OH, YOU'VE ASKED FOR IT NOW.

114
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:07,000
I CANNOT WAIT TO GET UP
THERE. WELL, POP?

115
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,875
- HIS LIFE IS IN
YOUR HANDS, SON.

116
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:09,916
- YES, SIR.

117
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,708
- TAITO, PLEASE BE CAREFUL.
- HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

118
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,250
WELL...

119
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,041
- I'M SCARED, DAD.

120
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,083
- DON'T BE.
HAVE FAITH IN YOUR BROTHER.

121
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,208
- YEAH.

122
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,250
- ( soldiers laughing )

123
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,500
GOOD THINGS DO COME
TO THOSE WHO WAIT.

124
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,750
LOOKS LIKE WE JUST MISSED
RUNNING INTO THAT ALKAID BRAT.

125
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,833
- LEAVE US ALONE.

126
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,500
- KNOCKING OFF THE
HEAD OF QING LONG?

127
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,500
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD
CAREER MOVE TO ME.

128
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,583
WE COULD BE EATING BREAKFAST
IN THE OFFICERS' TENT TOMORROW.

129
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,083
- ( laughing )

130
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,291
- I ADMIRE YOUR AMBITION,
SON. BUT I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

131
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,875
BY THEN. YOU'LL BE IN HELL.

132
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,250
- OH, YEAH?

133
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,416
- ( all shouting )

134
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,375
- ( yawns ) IT'S SAD.

135
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,416
YOU HAVE TO STAND HERE
STILL AS STATUES

136
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,958
AT THE TOP OF THIS TOWER,

137
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,625
SWORDS AT THE READY TO SLASH
AN OLD MAN'S WRINKLED THROAT.

138
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,958
MAKES YOU WONDER WHERE THINGS
WENT WRONG, DOES IT NOT?

139
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,916
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH OR I'LL
SHUT IT FOR YOU.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,500
- ( laughing )

141
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,583
- I HAVE TO ADMIT, I'M NOT
AS QUICK TO UNDERSTAND

142
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,541
MY SITUATION THESE DAYS.

143
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,458
BUT SINCE WE FIND
OURSELVES TOGETHER,

144
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,875
MAY I ASK IF YOU TWO ARE
BEING COURTED BACK HOME?

145
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,458
- I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!
- DO YOU WANT TO DIE?

146
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,750
- ( laughing )

147
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,791
- YOU'RE JUST DARLING
WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY!

148
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,250
AS HE IS NOW, I HAVE NO
DOUBT TAITO IS CAPABLE

149
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,708
OF CONTROLLING THIS MESS IN
WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES.

150
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,333
IT SEEMS DUBHE HAS UNDER
ESTIMATED HIS ADVERSARY.

151
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:50,291
TAITO. PLEASE SAVE ME. THESE
GIRLS ARE BORING. POOR DEARS.

152
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,708
- HOLD ON, GRANDPA. I'M COMING.

153
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,041
- ALAS, CHOKA IS AS
MISGUIDED AS EVER.

154
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,625
SO MUCH WORK WITH
SO VERY LITTLE INSIGHT.

155
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,750
SHE DOESN'T SUBSCRIBE
TO THE "KNOW THY ENEMY"

156
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,666
SCHOOL OF THOUGHT.

157
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,333
THIS FOOLISH PLOT TO
HOLD THE OLD MAN

158
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,541
HOSTAGE WILL HAVE NO
LASTING EFFECT WHATSOEVER.

159
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,333
WHAT A SHAME.

160
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,041
IF SHE'D ONLY CHOSEN A
DIFFERENT BARGAINING CHIP

161
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,000
HER TROPHY COULD
HAVE BEEN CLAIMED.

162
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,291
- ALL RIGHT, WHO'S NEXT?

163
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,333
- YOU BASTARD.

164
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,666
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HIS STRENGTH.

165
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,166
I THOUGHT THE QING LONG PLATOON
AVOIDED FIGHTING AT ALL COST.

166
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,500
- ( both screaming )

167
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,875
- LIEN, NO!

168
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,958
- ALL RIGHT, SOEI!
COME AT ME AND I'LL KILL HIM.

169
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,333
- HELP, FATHER!

170
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,250
- ANOTHER HOSTAGE,
YOU IMPERIAL BASTARDS,

171
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,750
CERTAINLY DO LOVE TO PICK ON
THE WEAK, DON'T YOU? PATHETIC.

172
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,416
- I'M NOT FOOLING AROUND.

173
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,833
I'LL CUT THIS LITTLE BRAT'S
THROAT IN A HEARTBEAT!

174
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,875
( screaming )

175
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,833
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU,
YOU'LL BE IN HELL SOON.

176
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,416
- THAT COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN STRONG ENOUGH

177
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,000
TO PUT A CRACK IN
THE SWORD LIKE THIS.

178
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,875
- SO YOU CAME AFTER ALL, ALKAID.

179
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,625
- I CAME ALONE, JUST
LIKE YOU ASKED ME TO.

180
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,500
NOW STAY TRUE TO YOUR WORD
AND LET MASTER SOEI GO.

181
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,958
- I CAN'T SAY I RECALL STRIKING
THAT BARGAIN, BUT I'LL RELEASE

182
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,541
THE OLD MOSSBACK AFTER
WE DISPOSE OF YOU.

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,916
- KEEP YOUR HEAD, TAITO.

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,250
ANGER AND RASHNESS ARE
THE GATEKEEPERS OF DISASTER.

185
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,916
( gasps ) I SENSE A FOUL
PRESENCE. COULD IT BE HIM?

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,750
THE SOWER OF CHAOS, WAN
SHONG SHI MING IS AMONG US?

187
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,500
BUT HOW? NO!

188
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,750
IT CANNOT BE.

189
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,833
- TAITO!
- GRANDPA!

190
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,791
- LEAVE THIS PLACE AT ONCE.
RETURN TO THE OTHERS.

191
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,791
THEY ARE ALL IN GRAVE DANGER.

192
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,708
HURRY, GO BEFORE
IT IS TOO LATE.

193
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,208
DON'T JUST STAND THERE! RUN!

194
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,875
- BUT I CAN'T JUST
LEAVE YOU HERE!

195
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,500
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
YOU MUST TURN BACK!

196
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,500
- PLEASE, TAITO. HURRY!
- GRANDPA!

197
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,166
- OLD MAN! WHAT GAME
ARE YOU PLAYING?

198
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,500
- THERE ARE ELEMENTS A FOOT
THAT ARE FAR BEYOND

199
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,250
THE LIMITS OF YOUR CONTROL.

200
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,875
UNTIE ME AND TAKE HEED
TO FLEE AS WELL.

201
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,333
- I WILL NOT FALL
FOR THIS TRICKERY.

202
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,625
YOUR HEAD WILL HAVE TO SUFFICE
FOR KEIRO'S TRIBUTE, KILL HIM!

203
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,958
( gasps )

204
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,250
- HAVE YOU NO MANNERS? THE OLD
MAN MAY BE A DODDERING FOOL,

205
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,958
BUT THAT IS NO EXCUSE FOR
YOUR RUDE BEHAVIOR.

206
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,291
- ( chuckles )
DODDERING FOOL, AM I?

207
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,625
- QUITE SO, IN FACT.

208
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,041
- HOW DARE YOU!

209
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,541
- YOU WON'T STAY PRETTY IF
YOU SCOWL LIKE THAT. CAREFUL.

210
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,750
- MY LADY, SHOULD
WE GIVE CHASE?

211
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,291
- LET'S COUNT OUR
LOSSES AND GO.

212
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:29,083
BUT MARK MY WORDS, ALKAID
WILL FALL BY MY HAND.

213
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,875
- I NEVER IMAGINED
YOU AS MY SAVIOR.

214
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,791
- THINK OF IT AS TUITION,
FOR MY BRIEF SCHOOLING HERE.

215
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,166
BUT WHY DID YOU
SEND TAITO AWAY?

216
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,625
- THERE'S A FOUL SPIRIT HERE,
WAN XIANG SHI MING.

217
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,916
- DO YOU MEAN, SHIMEI?

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,583
- WHAT A FOOL,

219
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,208
I NEVER CONSIDERED HOW
THIS CELESTIAL FRACAS,

220
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:52,125
WOULD APPEAL TO SUCH
A LOVER OF DESTRUCTION.

221
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,916
- DAD. LAILA!

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,791
- WELL, THAT CERTAINLY
WAS QUICK, TAITO!

223
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,625
- I GUESS GRANDPA'S OKAY?

224
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,250
- HE SAID THAT I SHOULD
COME BACK HERE.

225
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,791
THAT YOU WERE IN TROUBLE.

226
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,041
- WAN XIANG SHI MING
TAKES HUMAN FORM

227
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,041
AND WALKS AMONG US,
BUT HE IS NOT ONE OF US.

228
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,250
HE IS A DEMON. A VILE AND
LOATHSOME CREATURE WHO

229
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,666
THRIVES ON THE SUFFERING
AND SORROW OF MANKIND.

230
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,541
- AND NOW,
HE'S IN LEAGUE WITH KEIRO?

231
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,458
- YES. HE HAS EXISTED
FOR COUNTLESS GENERATIONS

232
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,416
ONLY TO CAUSE TURMOIL
IN THIS WORLD.

233
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,833
TURMOIL WHICH A MAN LIKE KEIRO,
IS ALL TOO EAGER TO SEIZE.

234
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:31,083
I SUSPECT HE IS NOT SERVING
KEIRO, BUT IS USING

235
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,083
THE MAN'S PROPENSITY
FOR BLOODSHED,

236
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,166
AS A SOURCE OF
GHOULISH AMUSEMENT.

237
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,875
- HE THRIVES ON PEOPLE'S
MISERY, THEIR SORROW.

238
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,625
- NOW, NOW, ALKAID.

239
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,458
MY APPETITE HAS
MERELY BEEN WHETTED.

240
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,333
IT'S HIGH TIME WE GOT
ON TO THE REAL SHOW.

241
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,000
- I TOOK CARE OF ALL
THE "TROUBLE".

242
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,208
NOW WHY HAVEN'T YOU
RETURNED WITH MASTER SONNEI?

243
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,625
- WELL BECAUSE HE SAID...

244
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,000
- BUT HOW? I THOUGHT I'D
ALREADY KILLED THEM.

245
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,916
- I'M SURE YOU DID. BUT THESE
GUYS, THEY DON'T STAY DEAD.

246
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:05,958
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

247
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,458
- YOU WANT THEM DEAD?
YOU GOTTA HIT THEM HERE.

248
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,875
- RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.

249
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,000
- ( growling )

250
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,000
- ( gasps )

251
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,708
- ( gasps )

252
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,458
- ( gasping )

253
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,625
- ( screaming ) NO!

254
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,583
- DAD, COME ON, PLEASE,
DAD! TALK TO ME!

255
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,875
- FATHER, PLEASE!
- TAITO, MY DEAR SON.

256
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,541
- STAY WITH US.

257
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,291
- DON'T CRY, SON.

258
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,416
LISTEN TO ME ALL MEN MUST DIE.

259
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,000
IT IS AN UNENDING CYCLE.

260
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,416
IT IS OUR FATE.

261
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,750
- BUT WHY? BUT WHY NOW?

262
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,208
- OH, NO!

263
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,625
- MASTER SOEI
- MASTER.

264
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,458
- SONNEI. IS HE, HE'S SAFE?

265
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,541
- I MYSELF RETURNED MASTER
SONNEI HOME SAFELY.

266
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,625
CHOKA AND HER MINIONS
HAVE RETREATED AS WELL.

267
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,875
- THANK YOU,

268
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,333
I'M RELIEVED.

269
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:06,250
I CAN LEAVE THIS WORLD KNOWING
MY LOVED ONES ARE SAFE.

270
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:10,208
AND YOU STAYED TRUE TO OUR
CODE. TO FIGHT FOR PEACE,

271
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:14,208
TO HELP OTHERS,
AND TO LOVE YOUR FELLOW MAN.

272
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,666
NEVER FORGET THAT, NEVER!

273
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,708
- ( both gasping )

274
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:36,833
- IT'S YOUR FAULT. YOU LET
THIS HAPPEN. YOU WERE THERE.

275
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,541
YOU WERE RIGHT BY HIS
SIDE THE ENTIRE TIME AND

276
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,833
YOU STILL COULDN'T PROTECT
HIM FROM THOSE MONSTERS.

277
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,125
YOU LET HIM DIE.
HOW COULD YOU BE SO USELESS?

278
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:56,916
- ( laughing )

279
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,708
- YOU'RE DEAD!

280
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,000
- HE THRIVES ON PEOPLE'S SORROW.

281
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,416
- WHAT THE EXPERIENCE, EH?

282
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,791
HAVING YOUR OWN FATHER DYING
IN YOUR HELPLESS ARMS.

283
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:21,750
OH, THAT IS QUITE THE LOOK.
THE FRUIT OF MY LABORS.

284
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:25,541
I'VE WORKED VERY HARD TO
CULTIVATE THAT EXPRESSION.

285
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,125
SEEMS KILLING DADDY
FINALLY DID THE TRICK.

286
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,000
( laughing )

287
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,500
- Taito: I'LL KILL YOU FOR THIS!

288
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,708
( grunting )

289
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,500
- THE ALKAID SIGIL IS GLOWING!

290
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,083
-COME ON, "SON." NOW GET ANGRY.

291
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,625
LET YOUR HATRED BURN,
DESTROY EVERYTHING IN SIGHT

292
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,083
AND UNLEASH ALKAID'S
CLEANSING HOLOCAUST!

293
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,250
- ( grunting )

294
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,875
( screaming )

295
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,125
( panting )

296
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,916
- ALKAID'S, CALMED.

297
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,666
- I ALMOST CAN'T BELIEVE IT,

298
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,833
HE WAS ABLE TO KEEP
IT UNDER CONTROL.

299
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,291
EVEN AFTER WHAT JUST HAPPENED,

300
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,291
HE SOME HOW DIDN'T
GO TOTALLY NUTS.

301
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,083
- DAMN THAT BRAT.

302
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,458
HAS HE ACTUALLY FIGURED
OUT HOW TO KEEP

303
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,583
THE REIGNS ON ALKAID'S FURY?

304
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,250
NO FUN, NO FUN AT ALL.

305
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,208
( gasping )

306
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,458
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

307
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,625
ALKAID.

308
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,125
- YOU'RE GOING BACK THEN?
- I AM.

309
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:30,333
- THE STARS THEMSELVES FORETOLD
OF YOUR DEPARTURE.

310
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,208
THEY ARE ONCE AGAIN TO
CONVERGE UPON THE CAPITAL.

311
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,833
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT
SOEI AND THE REST

312
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,416
OF OUR FALLEN BROTHERS.

313
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,291
I'VE TAKEN STEPS TO PROTECT
THEM FROM THAT DEMON'S,

314
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,541
SINISTER MACHINATIONS.

315
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,333
- I APPRECIATE IT, GRANDPA.

316
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,291
BUT THERE ARE STILL
JUST SO MANY THINGS

317
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,625
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

318
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,916
WHO IS SHIMEI? WHY DID KEIRO
BURN DOWN LIAN TONG?

319
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
ALL OF THIS
KARMA OF THE STARS STUFF.

320
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,125
IT STILL DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE TO ME YET.

321
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,333
- SINCE MY BROTHER'S STILL GOT
A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT THE WORLD,

322
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,041
I'LL BE GOING WITH HIM.

323
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,625
HONESTLY, I'M PRETTY SURE
FATHER WOULD HAVE

324
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,875
INSISTED ON IT ANYWAY.

325
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,041
- BUT DON'T WORRY,
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

326
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,083
- WITH THE RESCUE AND ALL
THAT, THEY HAVE ACCRUED

327
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,125
QUITE A DEBT FOR MY SERVICES.

328
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,666
I NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY
DON'T SKIP ON THE TAB.

329
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,791
- WHILE WE'RE IN THE
CAPITAL WE CAN LOCATE

330
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,458
RYUKO AND THE REMAINING WARRIOR.

331
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,208
I AM CERTAIN WE WILL RETURN TO
LIAN TONG BEARING GOOD NEWS.

332
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,250
- HMM.

333
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,041
- WELL, GUYS, I GUESS WE
SHOULD BE HITTING THE ROAD.

334
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,833
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
GRANDPA, OKAY?

335
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,916
- I WILL. AND YOU AS WELL.

336
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:47,041
IF FATE HAS ORDAINED THAT
TAITO LEAVE HOME YET AGAIN

337
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,500
THEN SO ORDAINED WAS
SOEI'S PASSING.

338
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,291
AS WAS THE SURVIVAL OF
THIS OLD FOOL,

339
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,541
TO BEAR WITNESS TO IT ALL.

340
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:01,583
I STILL HAVE TO WONDER. WHERE
DOES THE WILL OF THE STARS END,

341
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,416
AND OUR OWN BEGIN?

342
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,500
- ( Japanese song playing )

343
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,416
- Koyo: HOPES FOR A TENDER
REUNION ARE DASHED

344
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,208
BY A HEART HARDENED BY DESPAIR.

345
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,000
- Taito: WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU PLAYING AT HERE?

346
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,625
THIS JUST DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

347
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,375
- Ryuko: GOOD, GENUINE GOOD,
IS A FUNCTION OF POWER.

348
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,833
- SO I TAKE IT
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY

349
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,166
KEIRO'S GOODWILL AMBASSADOR.

350
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,875
- IF YOU COULD HEAR THE
WORDS YOU'RE SAYING

351
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,541
AS CLEARLY AS WE DO,
YOU'D BE ASHAMED!

352
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,250
- WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS DEAL
ONLY IN BARREN EXTREMES?

353
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,291
- LORD KEIRO IS VITAL
TO THE EMPIRE.

354
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,708
- CONFLICTING ALLIANCES
THREATEN TO THROW

355
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,791
THE CELESTIAL ORDER
INTO DISARRAY.

356
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:06,833
IN HERO TALES, CHAPTER
NINETEEN, "STARS DIVIDED."

357
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,750
- IF WE DESIRE LASTING PEACE,

358
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,958
WE MUST BE WILLING
TO PAY THE PRICE!
