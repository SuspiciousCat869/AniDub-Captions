1
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,791
- Shimei: XIAN JIA LAN WU,
ALPHA AND OMEGA

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,250
OF MANY A DYNASTY.

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,416
KNOWN MORE COMMONLY AS
THE SWORD OF RULE,

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,750
FOR ONLY AN EMPEROR'S
HAND MAY DRAW IT.

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,666
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU'RE
THE KIND OF BLEEDING HEART

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,166
WHO'D SET THE WORLD TO RIGHTS
GIVEN HALF A CHANCE.

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,000
DO I ASSUME CORRECTLY?

8
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:37,500
- IF SO, THEN WHAT BETTER MEANS
TO ACCOMPLISH IT THAN A THRONE?

9
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,708
- WHAT?

10
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,333
- YOU AND YOU ALONE
DREW THE SWORD OF RULE.

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,041
FATE HAS MADE ITS CHOICE.

12
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,958
THE HELM OF THIS
BROKEN LAND IS YOURS.

13
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:49,166
RISE TO THE OCCASION, BOY.
TAKE THE SWORD.

14
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,333
- ( theme song playing )

15
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,541
- ( metal gonging )

16
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,541
- AS EMPEROR, I ORDER
THE UPRISING IN QIAO YAO

17
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,875
TO BE CRUSHED AT ONCE.

18
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,250
THIS MATTER IS OF
VITAL IMPORTANCE

19
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,083
TO THE PEACE OF THE EMPIRE.

20
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,125
WE CAN BROOK
ABSOLUTELY NO DISSENT.

21
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,375
SHOW THE RABBLE THE MEANING
OF UNITY IN YOUR CONCERTED

22
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,791
EFFORTS TO ROUTE THEM.

23
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,208
- YES, MY LIEGE.

24
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,708
- MAY FORTUNE SMILE UPON
YOUR CAMPAIGN, LORD KEIRO.

25
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,958
- I WAIT NOT ON
FORTUNE'S CAPRICE.

26
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,875
- FORWARD, MARCH!

27
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,583
- ( all yelling )

28
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,041
- FORTUNE, WHAT IS MY STAR?

29
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,333
- WOW! LOOK AT HOW
MANY OF 'EM THERE ARE.

30
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,916
- THERE'S MOUSTACHE!

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,208
- CALM YOURSELF, TAITO.

32
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,333
YOU PROMISED ONLY
TO WATCH, REMEMBER?

33
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,333
- YEAH, I KNOW!

34
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,958
- THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

35
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,291
SITTING BACK WHILE YOUR
MORTAL ENEMY PARADES BY.

36
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,416
OF COURSE THE
WALL OF SOLDIERS

37
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,458
IS A PRETTY MAJOR
DETERRENT RIGHT NOW.

38
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,666
- Man: I DON'T ENVY THE MAN.

39
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,250
YOU'D THINK SOMEONE OF
HIS RANK WOULDN'T NEED

40
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,833
TO THROW HIMSELF
INTO THE FRAY.

41
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,083
- HE HARDLY HAS A CHOICE.

42
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,333
WHATEVER THEIR STATUS,

43
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,500
ONE DOESN'T REFUSE
AN ORDER FROM THE EMPEROR.

44
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,833
- OH, I THINK IT'S
MORE THAN THAT.

45
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,750
HIS MAJESTY MUST HAVE
THE BEARING OF A TIGER

46
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,625
TO BRING A WARRIOR LIKE
HIS LORDSHIP KEIRO TO HEEL.

47
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,375
- MOUSTACHE LETS HIMSELF BE
PUSHED AROUND BY THE EMPEROR?

48
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,041
- THAT'S BIZARRE.

49
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,833
I CAN'T ASCERTAIN OUR LITTLE
FRIEND'S WHEREABOUTS.

50
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,250
WHAT KIND OF BASE
TRICKERY IS CONCEALING HIM?

51
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,875
- WOW. THIS CHARM YOU DREW FOR
ALL OF US CERTAINLY IS STRIKING,

52
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,166
MASTER RYUSHO.

53
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,625
YOU SAID JUST CARRYING IT
ON OUR PERSON

54
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,041
IS ENOUGH TO KEEP PEOPLE
FROM DETECTING US, RIGHT?

55
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,416
- PRETTY HANDY WAY OF TOURING
ALL THE HOT SPOTS, I'LL BET.

56
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,583
- AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS
IS BEYOND DISPUTE.

57
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,666
I USED THESE MANY A TIME
TO GET OUT OF TRAINING

58
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,791
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN.

59
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,000
- FATHER.

60
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,583
- ( all laughing )

61
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,000
- OH, LIGHTEN UP, MY BOY!

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,333
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

63
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,541
YOU HAVE THE LOOK OF
SOMEONE WHO'S PREOCCUPIED.

64
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,541
- I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU,
ABOUT THE EMPEROR.

65
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,625
IS HE SOME KIND OF BIG
MONSTER OR SOMETHING?

66
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,666
- WHAT ON EARTH GOES ON
IN THAT HEAD OF YOURS?

67
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,291
- YOU CAN'T JUST BLURT OUT THE
LAST THING IN A LONG CHAIN

68
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,750
OF THOUGHT, GENIUS.

69
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,041
SPELL IT OUT FOR US.

70
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,041
- FINE THEN.

71
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,291
EVERYBODY'S BEEN GOING ON
AND ON ABOUT HOW USELESS

72
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,875
THE EMPEROR'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

73
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,916
BUT A BIG BAD GENERAL'S
TAKING ORDERS FROM HIM.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,791
SO, HE CAN'T BE A WEAKLING.

75
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,041
- TAITO.

76
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,916
- I'M BEING SERIOUS!

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,208
WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD
MOUSTACHE LET HIMSELF

78
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,291
BE BOSSED AROUND BY?
EXPLAIN IT TO ME!

79
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,166
- AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
ABOUT HIM WITHOUT BENEFIT

80
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,583
OF PERSONAL INTERACTION,

81
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,666
HIS MAJESTY'S HEART IS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND PERHAPS

82
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,750
COULD MAKE AN EXEMPLARY RULER.

83
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,500
THE ONLY THING HOLDING HIM
BACK IS A BRITTLE CONSTITUTION.

84
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,625
- SO HIS HEART'S IN
THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST,

85
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,666
AND HE'S ONLY HELD BACK
BY SOME KINDA BRITTLE BARRIER?

86
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,625
( screams )

87
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,875
WE CAN'T LET THAT
MONSTER BREAK FREE!

88
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,083
- WHAT'D I JUST TELL YOU
ABOUT THINKING OUT LOUD?

89
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,791
- ( laughs ) I'M AFRAID
THAT WORDS CAN'T REALLY DO

90
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,458
JUSTICE TO THE MAN HIMSELF.

91
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,208
AS WITH ANYBODY, I GUESS YOU'D
HAVE TO MEET HIM IN PERSON.

92
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,666
- OF COURSE! I SHOULD JUST
GO MEET THE GUY FACE-TO-FACE.

93
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,250
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

94
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,416
- HA, COMMONERS LIKE OURSELVES
ARE LUCKY TO CATCH A FLEETING

95
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,625
GLIMPSE OF HIS MAJESTY.

96
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,791
AND EVEN THAT PERHAPS
ONCE IN A LIFETIME.

97
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,375
- YOU WOULD STAND A BETTER
CHANCE OF SEEING

98
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,333
YOUR OWN ARSEHOLE
ON A MOONLESS NIGHT.

99
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,500
- MASTER. THAT'S DISGUSTING.

100
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,375
- ( all laughing )

101
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,375
- THE IDIOT'S ACTUALLY
GONNA DO IT.

102
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,916
- WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

103
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,416
- THOSE THE LAST OF THE GOODS
YOU INTEND TO BRING IN TODAY?

104
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,083
- YEAH. THIS IS IT.

105
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,875
-RIGHT. THAT'S ALL.
RAISE 'ER UP.

106
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,791
- ( chuckling )

107
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,583
TAITO, YOU'RE A GENIUS.

108
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,291
MASTER RYUSHO'S CHARM
WILL KEEP ME INVISIBLE.

109
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,166
AND WITH MOUSTACHE OFF PLAYING
WAR HERO, NOTHING CAN STOP ME

110
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,875
FROM SEEING HIS HIGHNESS.

111
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,291
UP WE GO.

112
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,541
NOW, IF I WERE A LOUSY
GOOD FOR NOTHING EMPEROR,

113
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,875
WHERE WOULD I BE?

114
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,541
WHAT THE...

115
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,791
HOW THE HELL DOES ALL THIS
BELONG TO JUST ONE GUY?

116
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,375
I CANNOT WAIT TO GET MY
HANDS ON THIS GREEDY BASTARD.

117
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,916
I AM GONNA TEACH
HIM A LESSON ABOUT

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,791
WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE A REAL MAN.

119
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,750
I JUST HOPE FOR HIS SAKE
HE'S A REAL GOOD LISTENER.

120
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,000
OKAY, OKAY, REMEMBER,

121
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,666
THIS THING DOESN'T TURN YOU
LITERALLY INVISIBLE,

122
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,041
IT JUST KINDA HELPS YOU BLEND
IN TO YOUR SURROUNDINGS.

123
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,583
- FAREWELL, LADY TAKI.
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER MIDDAY MEAL.

124
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,875
- INDEED. ENJOY IT,
YOUR MAJESTY.

125
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,041
- ( stomach growling )

126
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,125
- UGH, I'M STARVING.

127
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,833
SO MUCH FOR BEING DONE
WITH ALL THIS CRAP AND BACK

128
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,583
AT THE TEMPLE BY LUNCHTIME.

129
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:43,291
- KARO'S WARMONGERING WILL RAIN
HAVOC DOWN UPON US BEFORE LONG.

130
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,250
EACH BLOOD BESOT VICTORY
ONLY INCREASES HIS APPETITE

131
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,458
FOR THE BATTLEFIELD.

132
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,583
- WHOA, HE SOUNDS
LIKE AN EMPEROR.

133
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,583
- THERE ARE THOSE WHO
WOULD ARGUE HIS READINESS

134
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,041
TO SACRIFICE LIFE AND LIMB

135
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,166
FOR THE EMPIRE'S SAKE PAINTS
THE MAN IN FAVORABLE HUES.

136
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,333
- A PLOY TO CURRY
THE PUBLIC'S FAVOR!

137
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,583
- INDULGE US.

138
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,458
WHO EXACTLY MAKES
SUCH AN ARGUMENT?

139
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,916
- COME. LADY CHOKA,
NATURALLY. WHO ELSE?

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,250
- NATURALLY, INDEED.

141
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,083
BOTH SHE AND KARO HAIL
FROM PLEBIAN STOCK.

142
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,000
WHY HIS MAJESTY
SURROUNDS HIMSELF

143
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,083
WITH LOW BORN UPSTARTS
I'LL NEVER KNOW.

144
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,833
- JUST WHERE IS HIS MAJESTY?

145
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:17,000
- HE'S IN RESIDENCE AT DAMING
PALACE THIS AFTERNOON, SIR.

146
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,000
- HM, OF COURSE.

147
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,250
DEEPENING HIS NAIVE AFFECTIONS

148
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,541
FOR THE VAPID LITTLE
ORCHID TENDER, NO DOUBT.

149
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,791
THAT IS THE CASE
IS IT NOT, SHOKAKU?

150
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,041
- WELL, WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT, SIR,

151
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,666
BEING A DOCTOR,
MY POLITICS ARE WANTING.

152
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,000
- THAT IS ALL, GENTLEMEN!

153
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,541
- IMPOSSIBLE.

154
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,833
- OKAY, SO THAT WASN'T HIM.

155
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,333
WHERE IS HE, THEN?

156
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,416
I'M STARTING TO WONDER IF
HE'S EVEN REAL AT THIS POINT.

157
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,875
( yells )

158
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,625
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
I HAVEN'T EATEN IN HOURS!

159
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,250
OH, MAN! I CAN SMELL LIKE A
THOUSAND KITCHENS MAKING LUNCH

160
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,750
FOR ALL THESE RICH BASTARDS.

161
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,500
( sniffing )

162
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,916
NOW THAT'S THE KIND OF
DELICIOUS SCENT YOU CAN

163
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,333
ONLY CATCH A WHIFF OF

164
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,750
ONCE OR TWICE IN YOUR
ENTIRE LIFE, IF YOU'RE LUCKY.

165
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,166
TOP GRADE MEAT.

166
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,791
ONLY THE EMPEROR WOULD CHOW DOWN
ON FOOD THAT HIGH CLASS

167
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,958
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON.

168
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,166
OF COURSE.

169
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,458
THIS WORKS OUT GREAT, I'LL DROP
IN ON OLD HIGH N' MIGHTY

170
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,000
AND CATCH A BITE
TO EAT. OH, YEAH.

171
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,291
- IS SOMETHING THE
MATTER, MY LADY?

172
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,791
- IT'S CLOSE!

173
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,500
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE
THE NOSE OF A WARRIOR

174
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,250
WHO HASN'T EATEN
SINCE BREAKFAST.

175
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,458
( exclaims in pain )

176
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,458
( yelling )

177
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,208
HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT!

178
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,958
( exclaiming )

179
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,916
- IMPOSSIBLE.
ALKAID IS IN CAI FEI PALACE?

180
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,875
- WHEW. THERE WE GO.
MAN, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

181
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,083
- WHO GOES THERE?

182
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,125
- ( gasps )

183
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,041
- WHO'S THERE?

184
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,916
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S MY
BURDEN TO ANSWER THAT QUERY.

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,166
NOW, WHO ARE YOU AND
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

186
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,750
THIS IS...

187
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:29,916
WHAT?

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,125
YOUR FACE, IT...

189
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,916
- ( knocking on door )
- Woman: ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

190
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:47,000
MY LIEGE, ARE YOU IN NEED OF US?

191
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,125
- IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOOD FOR YA,

192
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,625
YOU'LL GET WHOEVER
THAT IS OUTTA HERE.

193
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,875
PLEASE DON'T LET ME GET
CAUGHT, I'M BEGGING YOU!

194
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,708
- MAY WE COME IN?

195
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,000
- YES, ENTER.

196
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,041
- ( door opens )

197
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,416
- WERE YOU NOT JUST
SPEAKING TO SOMEONE?

198
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,208
- NO NEED FOR ALARM.

199
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,375
IT SEEMS I MERELY GREW
A BIT TOO ENRAPTURED

200
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,375
BY THE POEM I WAS RECITING.

201
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,541
YOU MAY GO NOW.

202
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,583
- YES.
- YES.

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,958
- ( door closes )

204
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,916
- IS THAT WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND?

205
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,375
- ( growls )

206
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,958
- ( chuckles )

207
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,041
- ( sighs )

208
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,458
THANKS FOR PLAYING ALONG.

209
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,833
SORRY IF I SOUNDED KINDA UGLY
THERE AT THE START.

210
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,250
IT WASN'T ANYTHING PERSONAL.

211
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,958
I SHALL TAKE MIDDAY MEAL
IN THE ARBOR TODAY.

212
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,875
PLEASE SEE THE TABLE
IS SET FOR TWO.

213
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,833
- YES, OF COURSE, YOUR GRACE.
MY PLEASURE.

214
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,791
- AH, WILL LADY TAKI BE
JOINING YOU, YOUR HIGHNESS?

215
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,625
- WHETHER SHE IS OR SHE IS NOT,
WE VALUE OUR PRIVACY.

216
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,083
- ABSOLUTELY, YOUR MAJESTY.

217
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,458
- Laila: HUH?
- Ryuko: HE WHAT?

218
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,791
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN TAI'S
GONE TO SEE THE EMPEROR?

219
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,833
- WHY ARE YOU MAD?

220
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,375
HOW IS THIS EVEN A
SURPRISE TO YOU?

221
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,958
WE ALL HEARD HIM EARLIER.
HE WAS RARING TO GO.

222
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,750
- AND YOU JUST LET THE BIG DOLT
WALK RIGHT OUT OF HERE

223
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,166
LIKE HE WAS
GOING TO MARKET?

224
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,166
- BUT WHY ARE YOU
BLAMING ME FOR THAT?

225
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,166
- BECAUSE YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT HE'S AN IDIOT, THAT'S WHY!

226
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,625
- UM, RYUKO.

227
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,041
SHOULD WE HAVE EXPECTED THIS
KIND OF BEHAVIOR FROM HIM?

228
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,291
- YES, WE SHOULD HAVE.

229
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,125
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WARY AT LUNCH,

230
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,458
WHEN HE DIDN'T BURST IN AT THE
FIRST SCENT OF YOUR COOKING.

231
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,916
HE'S JUST SO IMPULSIVE.

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,375
- UGH! I SWEAR MEN ARE
ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS!

233
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,666
- ( chewing noisily )

234
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,458
THIS IS THE BEST
GRUB I'VE EVER HAD!

235
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,708
YOU EAT THIS STUFF EVERY DAY?

236
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,125
YOU MUST BE NEXT IN LINE FOR
THE THRONE OR SOMETHING.

237
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,708
- YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO THESE IF YOU LIKE.

238
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:43,708
- WOW, DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?
YOU'RE THE NICEST GUY I KNOW!

239
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,333
- WELL, YOU SEEM LIKE QUITE
THE AMIABLE FELLOW YOURSELF.

240
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,000
- IF THAT BIG WORD THERE
TOWARD THE END MEANS

241
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,791
"FIERCE DEFENDER OF
THE BROKEN AND DEPRESSED"

242
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,666
THEN YOU HAVE SUMMED
UP TAITO PRETTY WELL.

243
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,083
- SO YOUR NAME IS TAITO, THEN.

244
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,791
WELL, ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MY...

245
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,291
- NOT SO FAST, FANCY DRESS.

246
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,875
JUDGING BY THIS
SET UP YOU GOT HERE,

247
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,791
THE CHANCES OF US SEEING EACH
OTHER AGAIN ARE PRETTY SLIM.

248
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,333
THERE'S NO POINT
IN KNOWING YOUR NAME.

249
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,375
NOT TO BE A JERK, BUT PEOPLE
THAT BATHE BEFORE LUNCH

250
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,541
USUALLY DON'T MIX
WITH PEOPLE LIKE ME.

251
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,958
- ACTUALLY, AS IT SO HAPPENS,

252
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,791
I BATHE A TOTAL OF
THREE TIMES A DAY.

253
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,208
- THREE TIMES A DAY? WHAT,
DO YOU GOT A PERSONAL VERANDA

254
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,708
AGAINST DIRT OR SOMETHING?

255
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,000
- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT
THE WORD HAS COME TO MEAN.

256
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,416
- YOU SOUND LIKE A CROSS
'TWEEN MY FRIEND AND MY SISTER.

257
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:30,333
- TAITO, EARLIER YOU SAID
YOU SNUCK INTO THE PALACE

258
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,083
ON THE REMOTE CHANCE OF
LAYING EYES ON THE EMPEROR.

259
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,500
- THAT WAS THE PLAN.

260
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,708
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

261
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,750
- TO SIZE HIM UP. IF I CAN TELL
BY LOOKING HE'S HALF THE JERK

262
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,166
HE'D HAVE TO BE, WELL THEN,

263
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,541
I'M GONNA BEAT HIM
TO A BLOODY PULP

264
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,458
AND TAKE THE
THRONE FOR MYSELF.

265
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,458
- NOW WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU MEAN
BY "THE JERK HE'D HAVE TO BE?"

266
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,708
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

267
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,833
THE COUNTRY'S FALLING
APART BECAUSE OF HIM.

268
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,166
THE ONLY FOLKS WHO GET TO
EAT LIKE I JUST DID ARE EITHER

269
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,958
TOTAL BASTARDS OR
JUST PLAIN LUCKY.

270
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,833
MOST PEOPLE HAVE TO
GET BY WITH JUST SCRAPS,

271
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,083
WHILE BANDITS AND CROOKED
MAGISTRATES EAT LIKE,

272
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,458
WELL, EMPERORS.

273
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,541
AND ALL THE FIGHTING.

274
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,791
IF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
GAVE A DAMN,

275
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,208
THINGS WOULD'VE
NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THIS BAD.

276
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,583
BUT, TO BE FAIR, I DON'T
HAVE THE FIRST CLUE

277
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,166
WHAT THE EMPEROR
ACTUALLY DOES,

278
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,083
SO IT'S ANYBODY'S GUESS IF I'D
BE BETTER AT IT THAN HE IS.

279
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,000
HEY, YOU GREW UP HERE.
YOU KNOW HIM, RIGHT?

280
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,791
- I SUPPOSE THAT'S ONE
WAY OF PUTTING IT, YES.

281
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,250
SO THEN, WHAT'S
MR. HIGH N' MIGHTY REALLY LIKE?

282
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,083
- HE WHAT?

283
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,875
HOW COULD ALKAID HAVE
SIMPLY CREPT INTO OUR MIDST?

284
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,375
- HOW ISN'T THE ISSUE.

285
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,833
THAT HE'S OUT OF MY SIGHT
AGAIN IS WHAT GIVES ME PAUSE.

286
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,250
SURELY A ROUTINE SEARCH OF THE
PALACE GROUNDS WOULD UNVEIL HIM.

287
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,500
- THE IMPERIAL GUARDS
ARE TO KILL HIM ON SIGHT.

288
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,375
- YES.

289
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,583
- DAMN YOU, ALKAID.

290
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,625
TO WHAT CONCEIVABLE
PURPOSE HAVE YOU COME?

291
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,875
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

292
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,666
YOU'VE NOT YET HAD THE
PLEASURE OF MAKING HIS

293
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,416
ESTEEMED ACQUAINTANCE,
HAVE YOU MY LADY?

294
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,041
- AND WHAT IS THAT TO YOU?

295
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,291
- NOTHING. IT'S JUST THAT HIS
VISAGE MAY WELL SURPRISE YOU.

296
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,708
( chuckles )

297
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,416
- ( birds chirping )

298
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,750
- REALLY? THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

299
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,041
I DON'T THINK BEING EMPEROR

300
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,333
IS SOMETHING I'M REALLY
TOO KEEN ON AFTER ALL.

301
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,875
ALL THE FORMALITIES AND CRAP,

302
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,000
NOT HAVING ANY SAY SO
IN HIS OWN LIFE.

303
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,625
OR EVEN WHAT GOES ON
IN THE COUNTRY

304
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,708
HE'S SUPPOSED TO
BE RULING OVER.

305
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:15,000
- IT'S TRUE.
HE'S A FIGUREHEAD, NOTHING MORE.

306
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:19,500
- SCREW THE THRONE!
IT REALLY SUCKS!

307
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,291
- YOU UNDERSTAND THOUGH, YES?

308
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,291
THE EMPEROR IS ESSENTIALLY
POWERLESS TO CHANGE ANYTHING.

309
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,041
MUCH THOUGH HE MAY DESIRE TO.

310
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,625
- SO WHAT'S ALL THIS FOR, THEN?
WHAT'S THE EMPEROR ACTUALLY DO?

311
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,708
- HE PRAYS.

312
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,125
FOR CONTINUED PEACE AND
THE PROSPERITY OF HIS SUBJECTS.

313
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,208
THAT IS THE SACRED DUTY
ENTRUSTED TO HIM

314
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,916
BY THE STARS ABOVE.

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,333
- BUT, CAN'T ANYBODY PRAY?

316
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,666
- TELL ME, IN YOUR
WILDEST DREAMS,

317
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,833
WHAT SETS AN IDEAL COUNTRY APART
FROM THE ONE IN WHICH WE LIVE?

318
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,250
- HMM.

319
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,541
I'M NOT SURE.

320
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,625
BUT IN MY COUNTRY,
EVERYBODY WOULD BE SMILING.

321
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,500
- THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A LOVELY PLACE.

322
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,000
- THE WAY I SEE IT, UNLESS THE
POOREST PERSON CAN SMILE

323
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,666
JUST AS OFTEN AS THE RICHEST,
THE COUNTRY'S JUST NO GOOD.

324
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,833
WAIT.

325
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,208
COME TO THINK OF IT,

326
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,750
THE EMPEROR REALLY IS TO
BLAME FOR THIS WHOLE MESS.

327
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,041
IF HE CAN'T FIND A WAY TO CLAW
HIMSELF OUT OF THE MURK,

328
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,541
HOW ARE HIS SUBJECTS
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SHOT?

329
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,958
WHAT THIS COUNTRY
NEEDS IS AN EXAMPLE.

330
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,041
SEEMS TO ME HE'S GOTTEN
COMFORTABLE SULKING

331
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,125
UNDER THE WEIGHT
OF HIS SACRED DUTY.

332
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,458
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

333
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,250
I'LL BET THE REASON
HE'S SO POWERLESS IS BECAUSE

334
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,833
HE LETS HIMSELF BE.

335
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,875
WHAT HE NEEDS IS TO TASTE
A LITTLE BLOOD IN HIS MOUTH,

336
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,708
SO HE KNOWS WHAT
FIGHTING REALLY FEELS LIKE.

337
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,166
- PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.

338
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,916
INEFFECTUAL THOUGH I MAY BE,

339
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,791
THE PEOPLE OF THIS LAND DESERVE
MORE OF ME THAN SELF PITY.

340
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,583
WHAT THEY DESERVE IS
ONE WHO CAN LEAD THEM.

341
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,333
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, FANCY DRESS?

342
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,250
IT'S THE EMPEROR'S PROBLEM
TO GET HIS HEAD AROUND,

343
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,583
NOT SOME PAMPERED LITTLE
"I TAKE THREE BATHS A DAY"

344
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,333
RICH KID LIKE YOU!

345
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,875
- ( glass shattering )

346
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,666
- MY EYES DECEIVE ME.

347
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,416
CAN... CAN THERE REALLY BE TWO?

348
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
TWO EMPERORS?

349
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,958
- IT'S OKAY, DON'T WORRY.

350
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,958
I KNOW I LOOK SUSPICIOUS,
BUT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

351
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,000
SEE, I'M ACTUALLY AN OLD PAL
OF THE EMPEROR, SO UH...

352
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,250
( gasps )

353
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,375
THE EMPEROR?

354
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,500
- ( chuckles )

355
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,916
- YEAH. WE DO LOOK KINDA
ALIKE IN A WAY, I GUESS.

356
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,375
- I DON'T SEE HOW THE FACT
COULD HAVE ESCAPED YOU BEFORE.

357
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,250
- WELL, I'M REALLY NOT ALL THAT
FAMILIAR WITH MY OWN FACE.

358
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,833
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF LOOKING
GLASSES WHERE I COME FROM.

359
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,083
- I SEE.
- HMM.

360
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,125
- I NEVER WOULD HAVE
GUESSED YOU WERE YOU.

361
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,625
HOW LONG WERE YOU GONNA LET ME
MAKE A FOOL OUT OF MYSELF

362
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,166
BEFORE YOU TOLD ME?

363
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,291
- WELL I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO
BEAT ME TO A BLOODY PULP.

364
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,250
- ( grunts )

365
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,291
- ( gasps )

366
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,500
- HA.

367
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,375
YOU WERE NICE ENOUGH TO HIDE ME
AND FEED ME AN AWESOME LUNCH.

368
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,791
SO FOR TODAY AT LEAST
I GUESS YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.

369
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,666
- THANK YOU.

370
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,333
- I UNDERSTAND THE EMPEROR
HAS MORE THAN

371
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,250
HIS FAIR
SHARE OF PROBLEMS.

372
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,000
BUT DON'T THINK I'M GONNA LET
YOUR LITTLE PITY PARTY

373
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,958
GO ON FOREVER, MY FRIEND.

374
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,541
- MY SOLEMN VOW TO YOU, TAITO,

375
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,041
IS THAT I WILL TRY
TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY

376
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,375
AS A GOOD EMPEROR
SHOULD, JUSTLY.

377
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,916
- YOU WORK ON MAKING STUFF
BETTER FROM THE INSIDE.

378
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,083
AND I'LL DO WHATEVER
I CAN ON THE OUTSIDE.

379
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,916
YEAH, AND THANKS AGAIN
FOR THE FOOD, BUDDY.

380
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,041
- AND OFF HE GOES.
WHAT AN ASTONISHING DAY.

381
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,666
- I WONDER WHAT'S
TAKING HIM SO LONG.

382
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,708
- ( yelling )

383
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,041
( grunting )

384
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,541
- AVERT YOUR THOUGHTS FROM THE
RESEMBLANCE HE BEARS

385
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,291
TO HIS MAJESTY AND
RUN HIM THROUGH.

386
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,291
- ( grunting )

387
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,583
- SO THIS IS THE ENEMY.

388
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,708
SHIMEI SPOKE THE TRUTH.

389
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,875
THEY ARE THE VERY IMAGE
OF ONE ANOTHER.

390
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,166
CAN THIS LIKENESS
BE MERE COINCIDENCE?

391
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,666
- DAMN IT, GET OFF MY BACK!

392
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,750
FOR THE RECORD, I HAD NO BEEF
WITH ANY OF YOU FELLAS.

393
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,208
BUT YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

394
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,291
( yelling )

395
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,041
- WHAT?

396
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,583
- HE'S RUNNING AWAY!

397
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,833
- GET HIM!

398
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,625
- ( groaning )

399
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,916
WHO IN THE HELL ARE YOU?

400
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,291
- LOOK, BEHIND YOU.
THERE'S YOUR OUT.

401
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,875
- HMM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR
GAME IS, PAL, BUT I OWE YOU ONE.

402
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,916
- Guard: CONFOUND IT,
HE CAN'T HAVE GOTTEN FAR.

403
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,750
FIND THE VERMIN! FIND HIM.

404
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,666
- IT PROFITS US NOTHING TO LET
ALKAID BE DONE IN SO SOON.

405
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,208
- DAMN THAT BOY!

406
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,875
- PLEASE, TAITO.

407
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,166
- THANK YOU, FRIEND.

408
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,833
- SO THAT WAS THE EMPEROR.
BEST OF LUCK TO HIM.

409
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,833
- ( theme song playing )

410
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

411
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:37,916
- Ryuko: A CELESTIAL RETINUE

412
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,416
COMPOSED OF SEVEN
BRILLIANT STARS.

413
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,916
- Taito: BUT THEY'RE THE BEST
FRIENDS A GUY LIKE ME

414
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,333
COULD EVER ASK FOR.

415
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,708
- Hosei: TOGETHER WE CAN TAKE
CARE OF OLD FURRY LIP

416
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:45,916
WITH NO PROBLEM!

417
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,500
- Ryuko: THE PURPOSE OF
THE DIVINE WARRIORS

418
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,208
IS TO MAINTAIN PEACE AND
ORDER IN THE XIAN EMPIRE.

419
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,375
IT IS OUR DESTINY,
OUR SACRED MANDATE.

420
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,750
WE CANNOT FAIL.

421
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:57,000
- Taito: WHY WAS I CHOSEN
TO BE ALKAID. WHY ME?

422
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,208
- Keiro: I DO NOT WISH TO
BE DISAPPOINTED, ALKAID.

423
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,416
- Ryuko: NEXT, ON HERO TALES,

424
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,625
AS ABOVE, SO BELOW,
IN CHAPTER ELEVEN,

425
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,458
"THE TALE OF THE BIG DIPPER."

426
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,708
BUT CAN I POSSIBLY
CONVINCE TAITO

427
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,250
THAT HE GIVE UP HIS
QUEST TO DESTROY KEIRO?
