1
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,583
- RYUKO.

2
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,041
- Laila: NO! STOP!

3
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,208
COME ON, EVEN YOU SHOULD KNOW
YOU CAN'T EAT THAT PLANT.

4
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,666
STUPID IDIOT.

5
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,208
- KEIRO?

6
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,208
- ( theme music playing )

7
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,750
- ( door opens )

8
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,291
- STAND DOWN!
THAT'S AN ORDER!

9
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,625
- GRAND GENERAL TOKAKU, YOU ARE
HEREBY UNDER ARREST FOR TREASON

10
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,041
AGAINST THE XIAN EMPIRE.

11
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,583
- TREASON? ABSURD!

12
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,041
- YOU CAN PRESENT YOUR ARGUMENT
IN DUE TIME.

13
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,333
FOR NOW, YOU MUST COME WITH ME.

14
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,625
- IT SEEMS THE COURT HAS
FALLEN UNDER HIS SHADOW

15
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,083
SOONER THAN I EXPECTED.

16
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,208
- HE'S BEEN ARRESTED?

17
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,375
- IT SEEMS HIS WAS
THE UNSEEN HAND

18
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,791
FANNING THE FLAMES OF REVOLT
AMONG THE PEOPLE.

19
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,750
GENERAL KEIRO'S MEN
HAVE HIM IN CUSTODY.

20
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,500
- I CAN'T...
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

21
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,375
- HE HAD DESIGNS ON
TAKING YOUR LIFE AS WELL.

22
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,541
TO BE BETRAYED BY
SUCH A TRUSTED ADVISOR,

23
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,833
YOU HAVE MY
DEEPEST SYMPATHIES, HIGHNESS.

24
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,791
BUT THE SEVERITY OF
THE CRIME REQUIRES

25
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,375
SEVERE PUNISHMENT
BE METED OUT, AND SWIFTLY.

26
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,125
- AS HE'S BEEN MY
TRUSTED ADVISOR,

27
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,541
I WILL WITHHOLD SENTENCING

28
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,125
UNTIL I HAVE OCCASION TO
DISCUSS THIS MATTER WITH HIM.

29
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,125
MEANWHILE, HE'S TO
REMAIN IN CUSTODY.

30
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,625
- MY LORD! SURELY WE DO NOT WANT
TO MEET SUCH A DESPICABLE ACT

31
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,666
WITH WEAKNESS.

32
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,041
THE PRICE OF TREASON
IS ONE'S HEAD!

33
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,250
- DO NOT DARE
CHALLENGE MY ORDER!

34
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,916
GENERAL TOKAKU
WILL BE DEALT WITH

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,583
WHEN AND IN THE MANNER
THAT I DEEM FIT!

36
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,458
HE IS NOT TO BE HARMED!

37
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,125
- YES. AS YOU WISH, MY LORD.

38
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,875
- SHOW YOURSELF.

39
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,250
- AND I THOUGHT I HAD THOROUGHLY
CONCEALED MY PRESENCE.

40
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,291
- YOU STINK OF DEATH.

41
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,583
WHEREVER YOU PROWL,

42
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,458
A FETID CLOUD OF ROT
BETRAYS YOUR HIDING PLACE.

43
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,166
THE GRAVE HAS FOREVER
CLAIMED YOU AS ITS OWN.

44
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,333
- IS THAT SO?
UNTIL NOW I WAS UNAWARE.

45
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,125
- NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT?

46
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,333
- A "PALTRY THING," AS IT WERE.

47
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,708
THE SWORD OF RULE,

48
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,041
IN MY HAND, AS IN YOURS,
AN UNREMARKABLE ITEM.

49
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,041
HOWEVER, WHEN GRASPED BY THE
HAND IT DEEMS FIT TO WIELD IT,

50
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,083
THAT'S A DIFFERENT
STORY ALTOGETHER.

51
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,750
YES, QUITE.

52
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,750
A SHAME WE COULD NOT
BEAR WITNESS TO SUCH

53
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,833
A DIVINE PAIRING. AT PRESENT
THE EMPIRE ALLOWS

54
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,750
A MERE PRETENDER TO SIT
ATOP THE THRONE.

55
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,166
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, MY LORD?

56
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,000
- I ASKED WHAT YOU WANTED.

57
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,458
- AND SO COMMANDING
A VOICE WAS HEARD,

58
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,833
BUT I FIND THIS LAISSEZ FAIRE
APPROACH TO OUR PROBLEM

59
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,083
DREADFULLY BORING.

60
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,125
I'D LIKE TO LIVEN IT UP A BIT.

61
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,375
- YOU MAY.

62
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,750
- I WAS HOPING TO GARNER
YOUR BLESSING, MY LORD.

63
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,958
AND, WHO KNOWS,

64
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,750
WE MAY YET FIND A MEANS
BY WHICH TO BREATHE NEW LIFE

65
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,250
INTO THIS RUSTY OLD ARTIFACT,
AFTER ALL.

66
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,041
( laughing diabolically )

67
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,416
- Taito: YEAH, THIS'LL BE GREAT!

68
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,250
- IT'S THE PERFECT SPOT
FOR A LITTLE HIDEAWAY,

69
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,750
DON'T YOU THINK?

70
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,750
- I GOTTA SAY I ADMIRE THE
BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE CAPITAL.

71
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,875
- IT'S MAGNIFICENT,

72
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,041
PERHAPS THE MAIN WE REASON
WE CHOSE THIS PARTICULAR CAVERN

73
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,625
TO BE OUR DEN WHEN
THE FATEFUL HOUR DREW NEAR.

74
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,208
- WHAT FATEFUL HOUR'S THAT?

75
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,500
- ( smirks )

76
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,916
COME NOW. THE HOUR
WE SLAY KEIRO, OF COURSE.

77
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,750
- UGH, COME ON, GUYS, GEEZ!

78
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,250
- LIGHTEN UP! WE'RE WORKING
ON OUR STRATEGERY.

79
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,708
- YOU NEED TO HELP ME!

80
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,083
- ALL RIGHT! I'LL DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT!

81
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,541
- HEY, WHATCHA GOT THERE, LAILA?

82
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,875
- OH, ENKI SAID I COULD
HANG THIS OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE

83
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,333
TO OUR NEW HEADQUARTERS.

84
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,500
- I DON'T KNOW.

85
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,708
- WELL, MAYBE IF YOU GUYS
PULLED YOUR WEIGHT AROUND HERE,

86
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,625
YOU'D HAVE A SAY IN IT. HMPH!

87
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,708
- SO WE'RE KILLING KEIRO.

88
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,791
- WHAT'S WRONG, ARE YOU
HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS?

89
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,583
- HELL NO! IT'S JUST THAT...

90
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,958
- IT'S RYUKO, ISN'T IT?

91
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,916
- DO YOU GUYS THINK THAT
RYUKO REALLY BELIEVES

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,958
ALL THAT STUFF HE WAS SAYING

93
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,541
ABOUT KEIRO WANTING PEACE?

94
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,958
- I CAN'T SAY
WHAT HE BELIEVES IN,

95
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,375
BUT SOMETHIN' ABOUT IT
JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO ME.

96
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,625
- WHAT?
- IT'S...

97
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,083
I DUNNO, THIS WHOLE THING
DOESN'T SEEM VERY

98
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,041
"RYUKO-LIKE" AT ALL.

99
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,666
- WELL, I SURE DON'T GET IT.

100
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,041
- I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED
THAT'S WHO HE REALLY IS, Y'KNOW?

101
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,708
- ( sobs )
- OH, ARE YOU OKAY, RINMEI?

102
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,750
- I'M FINE.

103
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,375
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

104
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,083
( thinking ) RYUKO
WAS A FOUNDLING.

105
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,208
MASTER RYUSHO TOLD ME
WHEN HE WAS DISCOVERED,

106
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,208
THIS DAGGER WAS ALL HE HAD.

107
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,333
HE'S CARRIED IT EVER SINCE.

108
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,708
I WONDER, DID HE KNOW
OF ITS MESSAGE?

109
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,291
AND IF SO...

110
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,958
- SOMETHING TROUBLING YOU?

111
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,833
- IT'S NOTHING.
- I HAD DOZED OFF FOR A BIT,

112
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,833
BUT WAS AWOKEN BY THE SOUND
OF HURRIED FOOTSTEPS

113
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:40,916
OUT OF THE CAVE.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
- OH?

115
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,958
- I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE
THE WO JIN SQUAD IS DRY-DOCKED

116
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,500
FOR THE TIME BEING, AT LEAST.

117
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,041
GUESS MY MEN WILL HAVE TO GET
THEIR LAND LEGS BACK, HUH?

118
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,041
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I HAVE TO
MAKE MYSELF LOOK BUSY,

119
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,791
LEST I INCUR ENKI'S WRATH.

120
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,250
- WAIT.

121
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,500
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU.

122
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,833
- SURE. ANYTHING
YOU WISH TO KNOW.

123
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,458
- A SWORD, IS IT COMMON
TO HAVE A NAME ENGRAVED?

124
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,250
- A NAME?

125
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,708
WELL, QUITE A FEW CRAFTSMEN HAVE
BEEN KNOWN TO MARK THEIR BLADES

126
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,291
WITH A NAME PARTICULAR
TO THAT WEAPON.

127
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,666
IT'S NOT TYPICALLY
A PERSON'S NAME, HOWEVER.

128
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,083
BUT, IT'S NOT UNHEARD OF.

129
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,208
IN SOME FAMILIES OF
HIGH SOCIAL STANDING,

130
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,791
THE PATRIARCH WILL BESTOW
A WEAPON ENGRAVED WITH HIS NAME

131
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,000
AS AN HEIRLOOM TO
HIS FIRST BORN SON.

132
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,333
HIS SUCCESSOR, IF YOU WILL.

133
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,375
AN ARCHAIC TRADITION,
BUT STILL DONE SOMETIMES.

134
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,666
IS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON
FOR YOUR QUERY?

135
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,916
- NO, THERE'S NOT.

136
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,208
- I'M QUITE SURPRISED.

137
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,000
I'D THOUGHT HIM INCAPABLE
OF MAKING SUCH A DECREE.

138
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,708
- I COULD NOT DISSUADE HIM,
MY LORD.

139
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,833
- OUR PLANS WILL HAVE TO BE
ALTERED YET AGAIN I SUPPOSE.

140
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,875
THE OLD FOOL WILL SIMPLY BE
PUT ASIDE BY SOME OTHER MEANS.

141
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,791
MY ASCENSION WILL NOT
BE HINDERED.

142
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,083
- LORD KEIRO.

143
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,625
TOKAKU IS NOW UNDER
IMPERIAL CUSTODY, MY LIEGE.

144
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,041
- EXCELLENT WORK.

145
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,583
- WHAT WILL YOU HAVE ME
DO WITH HIM, SIR?

146
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,458
- IT MATTERS NOT.

147
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,875
A GENERAL STRIPPED OF HIS RANK

148
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,125
IS NO MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANY COMMONER.

149
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,583
SHALL I IMPRISON HIM?

150
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,416
- NO, ALTHOUGH HIS POSITION
IN THE COURT IS TENUOUS,

151
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,208
FINAL JUDGMENT REMAINS.

152
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,541
ACTING RASHLY MAY CAUSE A STIR.

153
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,333
- SO WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

154
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,166
- I WOULD PREFER TO HANDLE
THIS MATTER MYSELF.

155
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,458
THAT IS, IF IT
PLEASES YOU, MY LORD.

156
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,166
- VERY WELL, THEN.

157
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,708
- MY GRATITUDE.

158
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,750
RYUKO, REPORT TO MY QUARTERS
AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE.

159
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,875
- YES, SIR.

160
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,750
- ONE MOMENT.

161
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,375
NEWS HAS TRAVELED UPWARD,

162
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,083
I'VE HEARD TALES OF
YOUR PERFORMANCE

163
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,916
AND LEADERSHIP IN XUAN LONG.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,750
- WELL, SIR. IT'S MY DUTY.

165
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,583
- DON'T BE SO MODEST
AS TO STAGNATE YOUR RANK.

166
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,166
- ( whispers ) YES, FATHER.

167
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,833
- Koyo: WHAT? GENERAL TOKAKU?
YOU'RE CERTAIN OF THIS?

168
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,875
- MY SOURCES HAVE VERIFIED IT.

169
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,750
- I WASN'T EXPECTING KEIRO TO
MAKE HIS MOVE IN SUCH HASTE.

170
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,083
- SO WHO IS THIS TOKAKU GUY?

171
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,416
- LATELY HE'S BEEN THE MOST
PROMINENT VOICE OF OPPOSITION

172
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,583
IN THE IMPERIAL COURT

173
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,833
TO KEIRO'S INCREASING
THIRST FOR POWER.

174
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,791
AND THOUGH STEADFAST, HE'S NOT
THE TYPE TO PLOT ANYTHING

175
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,333
THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE EMPIRE.

176
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,083
- AND IF HE'S BEEN OUSTED
FROM HIS POSITION, THAT MEANS...

177
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,916
- THAT MEANS THERE IS
NO VIABLE OPPOSITION

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,625
TO KEIRO SEIZING POWER.

179
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,458
- DAMN IT ALL! WE MAY ALREADY
BE TOO LATE TO STOP HIM!

180
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,291
- WE SHOULD TAKE A PAGE FROM OUR
ENEMY AND MAKE HASTE AS WELL.

181
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,333
- IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
THE TIME ISN'T RIGHT!

182
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,291
- THE TIME IS GONNA BE
A HELL OF A LOT LESS RIGHT

183
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,833
ONCE THAT MURDERING
BASTARD HAS CONTROL OF

184
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,875
THE WHOLE DAMN EMPIRE!

185
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,041
- DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?

186
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,291
IF WE MOVE TOO QUICKLY
WE MAY ONLY SUCCEED

187
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,291
IN JOINING COUNTLESS
OTHERS IN THE GRAVE!

188
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,916
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO?

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,541
WITH TOKAKU AND HIS MILITARY
OPPOSITION BROUGHT TO HEEL,

190
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,875
THE THRONE IS WELL WITHIN
KEIRO'S RAVENOUS GRASP.

191
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,166
THE EMPIRE WILL BE SHROUDED
IN A VEIL SO HEAVY

192
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,458
THE LIGHT OF THE STARS WILL BE
RENDERED BUT A MEMORY.

193
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,041
BUT STILL, WE MUST DO SOMETHING.

194
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,625
- HEY, IS KOYO EVEN
TALKING TO US ANYMORE?

195
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,500
- UH...

196
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,250
- THE CAPTAIN IS SIMPLY
DISCUSSING POSSIBLE STRATEGIES

197
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,250
WITH HIMSELF. HE NEEDS
SOME TIME TO ORGANIZE

198
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,291
HIS THOUGHTS WITHOUT
FURTHER DISTRACTION,

199
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,375
SO LET'S LEAVE HIM BE FOR NOW.

200
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,500
- THERE IS ACTUALLY
ANOTHER ITEM TO REPORT.

201
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,750
- WHAT'S THAT?

202
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,416
- THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK
ABOUT THAT RYUKO GUY.

203
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,458
- RYUKO?
- WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT HIM?

204
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,458
- WELL, THAT HE'S RECENTLY
RISEN UP IN THE RANKS

205
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,500
AND HAS USED HIS POSITION
IN THE XUAN LONG PLATOON

206
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,250
TO CLEAN HOUSE IN THE CABINET.

207
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,250
HE'S ARRESTED A LOT OF OFFICIALS
FOR CORRUPTION.

208
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,916
- GAH! THAT BASTARD!

209
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,541
- WELL, AT LEAST HE HASN'T
COMPLETELY CHANGED, HAS HE?

210
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,916
- GUESS NOT.

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,083
- ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES,

212
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,791
RYUKO WAS ALSO THE ONE
WHO LED THE SQUAD

213
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,875
THAT ARRESTED
GENERAL TOKAKU AS WELL.

214
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,750
- SERIOUSLY?

215
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,625
- DO YOU THINK THAT RYUKO
STILL ARRESTED HIM

216
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,250
EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW
TOKAKU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG?

217
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,875
- RYUKO IS A SMART GUY. HE KNOWS
EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING.

218
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,875
- SO HE'S COMPLETELY GONE OVER
TO KEIRO'S SIDE, HAS HE?

219
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,666
- Koyo: YES. THAT'S IT.

220
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,583
FOR NOW IT'S BEST THAT WE LET
THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY,

221
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,541
AND GENERAL TOKAKU
ALONG WITH THEM.

222
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,833
- TOKAKU, SIR, YOU ARE HEREBY
ORDERED TO REMAIN WITHIN

223
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,416
THE WALLS OF TONG YO,

224
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
TO AWAIT THE VERDICT
FROM HIS MAJESTY.

225
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,291
- I UNDERSTAND. A FITTING PLACE
TO ENGAGE IN CONTEMPLATION.

226
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,541
- YES, WELL, THE EMPEROR
WILL ARRIVE IN DUE TIME

227
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,750
TO DISCUSS THE
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST YOU.

228
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,583
UNTIL THEN, I WILL KEEP WATCH.

229
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,083
- I SEE. I'M SURE THAT I WILL BE
QUITE STIMULATED HERE.

230
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,458
I HAVE AN OLD FRIEND
WITH WHOM TO PASS THE TIME.

231
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,250
- TAKE HIM IN.
- ( soldiers grunt )

232
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,083
- Ryusho: WELL, MY BOY.

233
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,083
- FATHER.

234
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,291
- SO THIS IS THE PATH
YOU'VE CHOSEN?

235
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,625
( sighs )

236
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,166
THEN I'VE NOTHING TO SAY.

237
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,708
- Koyo: THE PLAN IS THIS.

238
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,500
WE HAVE TOKAKU EMBRACE
HIS ALLEGED ROLE OF INSTIGATOR

239
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,000
AND START THE REBELLION
IN EARNEST.

240
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,708
WHILE THE CAPITAL IS GRIPPED
IN THE THROES OF CHAOS,

241
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,916
WE CARRY OUT OUR PLAN TO
ENTER THE CITY WALLS,

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,708
AND FINALLY CUT KEIRO DOWN.

243
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,833
- HOW DO WE DO THAT?

244
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,416
- I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS
IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS.

245
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,208
ALTHOUGH LARGE FIRES
OF REBELLION HAVE BEEN QUELLED,

246
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,291
MANY EMBERS STILL REMAIN
BURNING WITH THE DESIRE

247
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,375
FOR REVOLT AND CHANGE.

248
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,083
IF WE CAN COMBINE THESE EMBERS
BY ADDING OUR OWN FUEL,

249
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,000
THE RESULTS
COULD BE SPECTACULAR.

250
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,458
- COMBINING THEM?
BUT IS THAT REALLY POSSIBLE?

251
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,875
- OF COURSE IT IS!

252
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,458
THE IMPETUS FOR RISING UP
TOGETHER IS ALREADY THERE!

253
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,875
- I JUST DON'T THINK
I'M FOLLOWING YOU, BROTHER.

254
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,208
- THIS WILL BE OUR CRY!

255
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,375
GOOD PEOPLE, KEIRO HAS
CAST A SHADOW UPON THIS LAND

256
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,708
BLACK AS DEATH ITSELF.

257
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,541
BUT TOKAKU CAN GIVE US MEANS
TO DISPEL THAT PALL

258
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,416
AND ILLUMINATE A PATH TO VICTORY
WITH THE FIRES OF REVOLT!

259
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
RISE UP!

260
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,708
- HMM. UM-HMM. I GET IT.

261
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,208
- YEAH, I'M SURE YOU DO.

262
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,083
- KOYO, DON'T YOU THINK BY
CASTING TOKAKU IN THIS ROLE,

263
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,208
WE'LL ESSENTIALLY BE
GIVING HIM THE DEATH SENTENCE?

264
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,708
- EXECUTION IS
CURRENTLY HIS FATE.

265
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:06,166
SO, IN FACT, WE ARE GIVING HIM
TWO CHOICES OF LEGACY.

266
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,791
YIELD AND DIE, OR FIGHT AND DIE.

267
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,166
- ( whispers) KOYO'S A
LITTLE HARSH, ISN'T HE?

268
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,500
- HE HAS TO BE, Y'KNOW?

269
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,250
- UM-HMM.

270
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,416
- OUR NEXT STEP IS TO SIMPLY
PRESENT OUR PLAN

271
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,375
TO THE GENERAL HIMSELF

272
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,333
AND CONVINCE HIM
TO FOLLOW ALONG.

273
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,416
- LUCKILY, THE GENERAL IS
NOT IMPRISONED BUT MERELY

274
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,666
UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

275
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,875
HE'S CURRENTLY BEING HELD
AT TONG YO TEMPLE.

276
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,375
- I SHALL SEND SOMEONE THERE
RIGHT AWAY.

277
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,708
- VERY GOOD. I'LL WRITE
MY THOUGHTS IN A LETTER

278
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,291
TO HAND THE GENERAL
WITH THE HOPES

279
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,541
WE CAN STOKE THE FIRES
OF REBELLION WITHIN HIM.

280
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,958
- Rinmei: WAIT!
- ( both gasp )

281
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,916
- I'LL GO. I SHOULD BE THE ONE.

282
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,875
AFTER ALL, I'M THE MOST FAMILIAR
WITH TONG YO TEMPLE.

283
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,166
- YES, THAT'S TRUE.
BUT TAKE A MAN WITH YOU.

284
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,625
- I'LL GO WITH HER, CAPTAIN.

285
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,416
- ENKI, SURELY YOU DON'T
NEED TO GO WITH HER.

286
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,083
- AS A SISTER MEMBER OF THE "MEN
ARE HOPELESS LEAGUE," YES, I DO!

287
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,916
- Ryuko: YOU'RE TO CONDUCT
ALL PATROLS IN PAIRS.

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,208
ANY SUSPICIOUS PERSON YOU
ENCOUNTER SHOULD BE TAKEN IN

289
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,500
FOR QUESTIONING IMMEDIATELY.

290
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,666
- Soldiers: SIR!

291
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,166
- Choka: SHOKAKU'S
PLAN OF KEEPING TOKAKU

292
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,750
LOCKED AWAY AT TONG YO

293
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,583
ALLOWS US TO KEEP WATCH
OVER THIS UPSTART RYUKO AS WELL.

294
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,458
SOMETHING TROUBLES ME, HOWEVER.

295
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,291
HIS FATHER IS HERE.

296
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,250
CAN HE BE TRUSTED TO PREVENT
THAT MONK FROM CAUSING

297
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,708
MORE DISRUPTION?

298
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,750
- WHAT DO YOU WANT AT THIS HOUR?

299
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,958
- Woman: PLEASE!
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!

300
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,166
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

301
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,833
- THERE'S A WOMAN AT THE GATE.
- A WOMAN?

302
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,125
- Woman: PLEASE OPEN UP!
HE'LL KILL ME IF HE CATCHES ME!

303
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,458
HE NEVER WORKS AND HE JUST
STAYS DRUNK ALL THE TIME

304
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,208
AND ALWAYS HANGING OUT WITH
HIS DISGUSTING FRIENDS.

305
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,708
- WHAT NOW?

306
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,625
- EH, SHE'S JUST HAVIN' A LITTLE
TROUBLE WITH HER HUSBAND.

307
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,333
- LET'S LET HER IN.
- Woman: LET ME IN!

308
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,125
- ALL RIGHT, LADY,
JUST CALM DOWN, OKAY?

309
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:56,875
- WHAT THE HELL?

310
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,333
( groans )

311
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,500
- WELL, THAT WAS EASY, THANKS TO
YOUR CONVINCING PERFORMANCE.

312
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,625
- IT HELPS IF THERE'S
A LITTLE BIT OF TRUTH TO IT.

313
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,416
YOU KNOW WHERE
THEY MAY BE KEEPING TOKAKU?

314
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,875
- IF I HAD TO GUESS, HE'S MOST
LIKELY IN THAT CHAMBER THERE.

315
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,958
IT CAN BE LOCKED
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

316
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,875
- ( door opens )

317
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,750
- GRAND GENERAL TOKAKU
I PRESUME?

318
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,458
- OF COURSE. AND YOU ARE?

319
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:33,250
- YES, FORGIVE ME, SIR. I AM
ENKI WITH THE WO JIN SQUAD.

320
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:37,166
- WO JIN? WHAT DO YOU
WATER BANDITS WANT WITH ME?

321
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,125
- TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,
WE NEED YOUR HELP, GENERAL.

322
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,791
WE BELIEVE YOU CAN BE
OF ASSISTANCE TO US

323
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,583
IN OUR PLAN TO ELIMINATE KEIRO.

324
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,541
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

325
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,625
- UNTIL WE CAME BACK
HERE TONIGHT,

326
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,333
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH
I'VE MISSED THIS PLACE.

327
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,625
THAT WAS ONCE RYUKO'S CHAMBER.

328
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,958
- YOUNG LADY, YOUR GROUP
WISHES ME TO AID IN YOUR REVOLT?

329
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,333
- I'M AFRAID IT'S
MORE THAN THAT, SIR.

330
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,625
WE ASK THAT YOU TAKE ON
THE ROLE OF ITS INSTIGATOR

331
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,208
AND ACCEPT ANY AND
ALL CONSEQUENCES

332
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,500
SUCH A ROLE MAY BRING.

333
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,791
- SO, THEN, YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO MARTYR MYSELF?

334
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,375
- IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO
PROTECT THE EMPEROR.

335
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,166
THE LAST HOPE TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

336
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,291
- TO SAVE HIS LIFE THEN.
YES, I SEE.

337
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,291
IF I MUST FORFEIT MY OWN LIFE
TO ENSURE HIS, SO BE IT.

338
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,000
I WILL GLADLY DIE.

339
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,583
- WE WILL HONOR YOU NAME,
GRAND GENERAL, SIR.

340
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,833
WHERE IS SHE? RINMEI.

341
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,958
- Choka: WHAT A SURPRISE.

342
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,291
I KNEW SOME SORT OF PREY
HAD SKULKED ITS WAY INSIDE.

343
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,416
BUT NOT A DIVINE WARRIOR.

344
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,750
THAT IS QUITE THE PRIZED CATCH.

345
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,333
SURROUND HER!

346
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,375
- ( Laila exclaims )
-WHAT IN THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?

347
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,083
- RELIGHT THE FIRE!

348
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,666
- ( clinking )

349
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,250
- HEY, UH, WHERE DID TAITO GO?

350
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,583
- OH, NOT THIS PLACE AGAIN.

351
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,791
- NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, LAD.

352
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,041
- WHAT DO YOU WANT,
YOU BASTARD? TELL ME!

353
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,458
- I'VE COME TO INQUIRE ABOUT
YOUR FINAL DECISION, ALKAID.

354
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,666
- ON WHAT?

355
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,750
- HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?
THE EMPIRE IS YOURS

356
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,541
IF YOU DESIRE IT, MY BOY.

357
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,500
THE DECISION RESTS
IN YOUR HANDS.

358
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,916
- ( grunting )

359
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,500
- THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!

360
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,666
SURELY YOU CAN DISPOSE OF ONE
WOMAN, DIVINE WARRIOR OR NOT!

361
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,375
- ( swords clanging )

362
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,375
- RINMEI!
- ( gasping )

363
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,000
( groans )

364
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,625
- A RATHER INOPPORTUNE TIME
TO LET DOWN YOUR GUARD.

365
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,958
OR RATHER THE PERFECT TIME FOR
YOU TO PROVIDE A DISTRACTION.

366
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,500
I THANK YOU.

367
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,333
- HOLD ON, RYUKO!

368
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,375
( gasping )

369
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,833
- ( sniffling )

370
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,958
- ( sobbing )

371
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,583
- TAKE HER AWAY.

372
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,416
- THIS IS BAD.

373
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,166
- Shimei: THE SWORD CHOSE YOU,

374
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,916
THE ONLY ONE IT SEES FIT TO SIT
ATOP THE EMPEROR'S THRONE!

375
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,750
IT IS QUITE AN HONOR!

376
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,083
- I DON'T GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT SITTING ON THAT THRONE.

377
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,708
- BUT DON'T YOU WISH
TO DEFEAT KEIRO?

378
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,375
- WHAT?

379
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,875
- YOU CAN END HIS LIFE AND TRULY
BEGIN YOUR OWN AS EMPEROR.

380
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,125
OR WOULD YOU RATHER CONTINUE
SPOUTING THIS CHILDISH DRIVEL

381
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,708
ABOUT ENGAGING HIM
WITH YOUR BARE HANDS ALONE?

382
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,916
ABSOLUTE POWER IS IN YOUR GRASP!

383
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
THE WORLD WILL REST IN YOUR
HANDS IF YOU TAKE THE SWORD

384
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,291
AND RULE AS A GOD ON EARTH!

385
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,666
A WARRIOR GOD!

386
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,291
- DEPOSE TAIGA!

387
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,458
IT CAN WORK!

388
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,666
- I SEE, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE PROBLEM ALL ALONG.

389
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,291
I UNDERSTAND NOW.
- YOU DO?

390
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,791
- I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHY
ALL THAT CRAP RYUKO WAS SAYING

391
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,333
ABOUT KEIRO WANTING PEACE
DIDN'T SOUND LIKE HIM.

392
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,333
IT WAS BECAUSE

393
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,666
HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE
ME BELIEVE YOUR WORDS.

394
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,041
YOU WANT AN ANSWER? I'LL GIVE
IT TO YOU AS PLAIN AS DAY!

395
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,208
( yelling )

396
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,666
NOW, IN CASE
YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND,

397
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,125
I REFUSE TO PLAY YOUR GAME
AND BE THE EMPEROR!

398
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,041
- ( air whooshing )

399
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,291
- ( roars )

400
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,416
- ( chuckling )
- ( neck cricks )

401
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,583
- IT MATTERS NOT. AS I SAID,
THE DECISION WAS YOURS

402
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,708
TO MAKE, MY BOY.

403
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,833
I'LL HAVE PLENTY TO
KEEP ME OCCUPIED.

404
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,083
- HOLD ON!

405
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,958
- LORD KEIRO! IS SOMETHING
THE MATTER, SIR?

406
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,000
( gasps ) YOU'VE DRAWN IT!

407
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,666
THE SWORD OF RULE!
IT'S YOURS, MY LORD!

408
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,791
- AT LONG LAST
THE SHAWN GHEE LAN WU

409
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,083
CHOOSES ME AS ITS TRUE MASTER!

410
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,916
YES!

411
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,166
WITH THE POWER I NOW HOLD,

412
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,666
THE VERY HEAVENS SHALL
SUBMIT TO MY WILL!

413
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,000
( laughing diabolically )

414
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,833
- ( theme song playing )

415
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,500
- Koyo: WHAT HE TRULY DESIRED,
WAS PEACE.

416
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,625
- Keiro: IT WAS NOT THE BRANCHES
OF THE EMPIRE THAT WERE ROTTEN,

417
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,208
IT WAS DISEASED FROM
THE ROOTS UPWARD.

418
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,041
- Shimei: OH, HOW THEY
FLAIL AND STRUGGLE.

419
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,333
LABORING UNDER THE SELF-CENTERED
DELUSION OF FREE WILL,

420
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,583
FIGHTING AGAINST FATE.

421
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,791
- Taito: THAT'S
THE SWORD OF RULE.

422
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:57,500
- Keiro: AND THUS I AM TASKED
WITH RESTORING ORDER BY FORCE.

423
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,625
- Koyo: WHEN A STAR'S
TRAGIC PAST IS REVEALED,

424
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,583
WILL THE CONFLICT
CONTINUE UNABATED?

425
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,833
IN HERO TALES:
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE.

426
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,375
"A COMMONER INFURIATED."

427
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,375
- WHAT HAD LAIN DORMANT
WAS AT ONCE AWOKEN,

428
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,375
MY KARMA AS DUBHE.
