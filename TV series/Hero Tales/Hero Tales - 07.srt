1
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,333
- OKAY, WHERE IS THAT BOY?

2
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,416
I SWEAR. EVERY TIME HE GETS
THE LEAST BIT BENT OUT OF SHAPE

3
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,000
ABOUT SOMETHING
HE JUST TEARS OFF.

4
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,250
I SUPPOSE SOME
THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

5
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,083
- ( theme song playing )

6
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,458
- ( whimpering )

7
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,000
- Shimei: WELCOME BACK.
HOW ARE WE FEELING?

8
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:36,875
- BASTARD!

9
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,916
- OH NOW, THERE'S
NO NEED FOR THAT.

10
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,500
I LET YOU LIVE, DIDN'T I?

11
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,041
ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR
POSITION WOULD BE GRATEFUL.

12
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,791
- I'LL SHOW YOU
GRATEFUL, YOU JERK!

13
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,583
- HARK, DIVINE WARRIOR PHECDA.

14
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,375
YOU'RE TO KILL ALKAID.

15
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,041
- KILL ALKAID?

16
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,958
YOU WANT
ME TO KILL TAITO?

17
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,416
NO! YOU'RE OUT
OF YOUR MIND!

18
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,708
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

19
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,541
- BUT YOU WOULD,
MY DEAR BOY.

20
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,666
IF YOU VALUE THE
LIFE OF YOUR MASTER.

21
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,500
- STAY AWAY FROM HER!

22
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,416
- SORRY. THE TERMS
AREN'T NEGOTIABLE.

23
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
EITHER ALKAID DIES
BY YOUR HAND,

24
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,750
OR YOU AND
YOUR MASTER BY MINE.

25
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,833
A REFRESHINGLY
STRAIGHTFORWARD PROPOSITION

26
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,666
IF EVER THERE WAS ONE,
I SHOULD THINK.

27
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,916
- YOU AREN'T LYING.

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,458
AND FOR A GUY LIKE
ME IT'S A PRETTY

29
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,666
STRAIGHTFORWARD CHOICE.

30
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,041
EVEN MORE THAN YOU THINK.

31
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,625
HERE'S MY ANSWER!

32
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,791
- ( yells )

33
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,416
- SEE, I DON'T RESPOND
ALL THAT WELL TO THREATS.

34
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,833
BUT HEY, NO
HARD FEELINGS!

35
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,416
IF YOU WANNA KILL US,
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME

36
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,541
TO GIVE IT A SHOT!

37
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,708
( laughs )

38
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,333
OKAY, THESE FREAKS ARE
OFFICIALLY NOT NORMAL.

39
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,166
WHAT THE HELL AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

40
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,083
- WATCH OVER THE HOUSE
WHILE WE'RE GONE.

41
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,083
WE'LL TRY TO BE BACK SOON.

42
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,541
- HOPEFULLY HE'LL TURN
UP BEFORE YOU HAVE TO

43
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,875
VENTURE ALL THAT FAR.

44
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,416
- I'M MORE CONCERNED
FOR LADY KOEI THAN

45
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,208
I AM HOSEI AT THIS POINT.

46
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,583
SHE SET OUT TO LOOK
FOR HIM HOURS AGO, NOW.

47
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,166
- THESE MOUNTAINS
MAY BE HER HOME. BUT STILL...

48
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,875
- COME ON THEN. WE'RE NOT
GONNA DO MUCH FROM HERE.

49
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,166
LET'S GO HAVE
A LOOK ALREADY.

50
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,833
- JUST AS I FEARED.

51
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,875
SO, IT WOULD SEEM MY
SENSE OF FOREBODING

52
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,875
WAS WARRANTED
AFTER ALL, EH, SHIMEI?

53
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,958
- HOW FLATTERING TO KNOW
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

54
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,791
REMEMBERS THE LIKES OF ME.

55
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,125
THE YEARS HAVE BEEN
AWFULLY KIND TO YOU.

56
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,375
STILL SO LUSTROUS AT FORTY?

57
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,083
- THIRTY-NINE, VILE SERPENT!

58
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,583
AND DON'T FEEL FLATTERED,

59
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,875
THAT THING YOU CALL A FACE
HASN'T AGED NEARLY SO WELL.

60
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,291
- COME NOW. IT'S
A BANDIT'S FACE.

61
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,666
IN THAT RESPECT
IT'S ON A PAR WITH YOURS.

62
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,333
STILL, I DO INTEND TO BE
MORE SELECTIVE NEXT TIME.

63
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,083
OH, YES. I STUMBLED
UPON YOUR PROTEGE.

64
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,875
- IF YOU TOUCHED
ONE HAIR ON HIS HEAD.

65
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,958
- OH, DON'T WORRY,
THE BOY'S FINE.

66
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,833
I MERELY ORDERED
THAT HE SLAY ALKAID.

67
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,583
NOTHING TOO OVER THE TOP.

68
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,833
THOUGH, I DID THREATEN TO SLAY
YOU IF HE REFUSED TO OBEY ME.

69
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,958
- HIS RESPONSE?

70
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,416
- THAT I WAS MORE THAN
WELCOME TO GIVE IT

71
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,375
A SHOT IF I CARED TO TRY.

72
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,458
LET ME ASK
YOU SOMETHING...

73
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,166
CAN ALKAID FILL THE ROLE IN
WHICH FATE HAS CAST HIM?

74
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,625
IS HE SUFFICIENTLY AMUSING
TO WARRANT ALL THIS WORK?

75
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,166
- TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,

76
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,791
TAITO IS NOT THE SORT TO LET
HIMSELF BE DEFEATED BY YOU.

77
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:55,708
NOR FOR THAT MATTER ARE
LAILA, RYUKO... OR HOSEI!

78
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,333
- SO IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'LL
BE QUITE THE DIVERSION INDEED.

79
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,708
- ( gasps )

80
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,583
BUT THERE'S NOT
EVEN A DRAFT IN HERE.

81
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,375
- ( Hosei yells )

82
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,291
- HELP ME, LAILA!

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,666
THESE GUYS EVER
GIVE UP OR WHAT?

84
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,500
I'M SAVED!

85
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,666
- HEY.
- THERE YOU ARE!

86
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,333
WHERE THE HELL HAVE
YOU BEEN ALL NIGHT?

87
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,750
- DID LADY KOEI FIND YOU YET?

88
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,416
- WHAT DOES MY MASTER
HAVE TO DO...

89
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,833
- MORON!

90
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,208
WHAT? YOU THINK WE'RE
JUST TAKING IN THE NIGHT AIR?

91
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,625
SHE WENT OUT LOOKING
FOR A CERTAIN SOMEBODY

92
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,916
HOURS AGO NOW
AND HASN'T COME BACK YET!

93
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,041
- THEY'RE ALL YOURS!
- HOSEI!

94
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,333
- THAT LITTLE SON OF A...

95
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,791
- GREAT. JUST WHAT WE
NEED, ANOTHER DISTRACTION.

96
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,500
- WHAT?
- WAY TO TAKE HIM DOWN, RYUKO.

97
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,791
THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU?

98
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,458
( laughs )

99
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,833
HEY! YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO STAY DOWN!

100
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,750
- I DON'T THINK
THESE ARE ORDINARY MEN.

101
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,875
- YOU THINK?

102
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,583
- WHERE ARE YOU, MASTER?

103
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:28,958
MASTER!

104
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,875
- WELL LOOK
WHO CAME BACK.

105
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,291
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

106
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,208
YOU KNOW RUNNING OFF LIKE
THAT JUST WORRIES ME.

107
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,041
- WELL, I WASN'T
GONNA BE GONE LONG.

108
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,125
BUT THEN ALL THIS STUFF...

109
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,416
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

110
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,625
I DIDN'T MEAN TO ACT LIKE SUCH
A BRAT EARLIER, IT'S JUST...

111
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,958
- OH, HOSEI. THERE'S NO
NEED FOR THAT, REALLY.

112
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,500
- COME ON! GIVE ME A
BREAK. I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

113
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,750
( chuckles )

114
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,625
- HERE.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

115
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,625
- JUST CLIMB ON. YOU'RE
EXHAUSTED, I CAN TELL.

116
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,541
THE YEARS ARE CATCHING UP.

117
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,791
SERIOUSLY THOUGH, GET ON.

118
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,166
TAITO AND THE OTHERS
ARE WAITING FOR US.

119
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,250
- VERY WELL.

120
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,125
DON'T YOU DARE FALL.

121
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,625
- DON'T WORRY.
I'VE GOT YOU.

122
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,416
HEY, YOU'RE MUCH LIGHTER
THAN I THOUGHT YOU'D BE.

123
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,583
- OF COURSE I AM,
SILLY. LOOK AT MY FIGURE.

124
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,833
- SO, I'VE NEVER DONE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

125
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,375
IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING.

126
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,291
- MASTER?
- HMM?

127
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,458
- WOULD YOU... WOULD YOU BE
UPSET IF I WENT WITH LAILA

128
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,750
AND THE GUYS TO THE CAPITAL?

129
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,125
- HONESTLY, WHAT A QUESTION.

130
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,791
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD
I BE UPSET WITH YOU FOR THAT?

131
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,708
YOU STILL HAVE
SO MUCH TO LEARN.

132
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,666
THE BEST REMEDY
FOR THAT IS EXPERIENCE.

133
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,541
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

134
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,875
- HOSEI, PROMISE ME
THAT YOU'LL TAKE CARE

135
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,708
OF TAITO AND THE OTHERS.

136
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,416
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO
YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN?

137
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,791
- FATE MAY HAVE BROUGHT
THE FOUR OF YOU TOGETHER.

138
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,083
BUT IT IS FRIENDSHIP
THAT WILL BIND YOU.

139
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,750
IF I LEAVE YOU WITH NOTHING
ELSE, PLEASE REMEMBER THAT.

140
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,083
- FRIENDSHIP?

141
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,625
- WHAT I'M SPEAKING
OF TRANSCENDS FATE.

142
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,125
SOMETHING RICHER
AND MORE BRILLIANT

143
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,750
THAN EVEN THE STARS
RESONATES BETWEEN TRUE FRIENDS.

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,458
- OH, YEAH, I
MEANT TO TELL YOU,

145
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,791
I RAN INTO SOME PRETTY
NASTY CUSTOMERS EARLIER.

146
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,208
EVERY TIME I TOOK THEM DOWN
THEY'D COME RIGHT BACK UP.

147
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,083
IT'S LIKE THEY WERE
INVINCIBLE OR SOMETHING.

148
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,416
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD
A RUN-IN WITH THE UNDEAD.

149
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,208
- THE UNDEAD?

150
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:41,416
- YES, CORPSES.
WELL, SO TO SPEAK.

151
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,208
THAT WHICH NO LONGER LIVES,
AND CANNOT BE KILLED.

152
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,375
- BUT THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME WAY TO DEAL WITH THEM!

153
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,166
- THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY.

154
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,208
THE FOREHEAD...
STRIKE THEIR BROW,

155
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,458
AND ONCE AGAIN THEY'LL
RETURN TO THE EARTH.

156
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,000
- AH-HA! THEN THE
FOREHEAD IT'LL BE.

157
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,708
YOU SURE DO HAVE A LOT
OF THINGS RATTLING AROUND

158
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,625
IN THAT HEAD OF YOURS, HUH?

159
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,375
- NATURALLY...

160
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,333
I'M LADY KOEI, THE FOUNT
OF KNOWLEDGE, AFTER ALL.

161
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,958
DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

162
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,625
- NEVER. I'M PROUD
YOU'RE MY MASTER.

163
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,875
JUST MY LUCK.

164
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,125
I FINALLY PRAISE HER AND
SHE FALLS ASLEEP ON ME.

165
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,041
- THAT WAS A BIT AWKWARD.

166
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,166
BUT, I HAVE TO
GIVE HER CREDIT.

167
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,666
MOST FOLKS WOULD'VE DIED
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME.

168
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,041
NOW, THEN, THE REAL FUN
SHALL BEGIN IN EARNEST.

169
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,125
- SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE
HELL WERE YOU THINKING?

170
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,833
YOU COULD'VE AT LEAST
STAYED BEHIND TO HELP US

171
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,166
FIGHT OFF THOSE UNDEAD
CREEPS OR WHATEVER THEY WERE!

172
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,750
- I COMPLETELY AGREE.

173
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,791
FORTUNATELY, THEY RETREATED
BEFORE THE SITUATION

174
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,125
BECAME TOO MUCH FOR
US TO HANDLE ON OUR OWN.

175
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,875
IF THEY HADN'T,
THOUGH, WHO KNOWS?

176
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,375
- AH, COME ON.
DON'T BE THAT WAY.

177
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,625
FOCUS ON THE
HERE AND NOW.

178
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,291
YOU BOTH CAME OUT
OF IT UNSCATHED.

179
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,666
RIGHT, MY DARLING?

180
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,541
- ACTUALLY, AS A MATTER OF
FACT, I CAN SEE WHY THEY'RE MAD.

181
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,708
YOU WENT FROM BEING
A CHILD TO A COWARD.

182
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,416
- WHOA. I THINK I COULD
LISTEN TO YOU SCOLD ME ALL DAY.

183
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,125
- PLEASE DO GO ON!
- SHUT YOUR FACE!

184
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,333
- IN ANY EVENT, WE'D BE
IN WELL OVER OUR HEADS

185
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,916
IF THEY ATTACKED AGAIN.

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,375
OUR ANSWER FOR THE MOMENT
AT LEAST SHOULD BE RETREAT.

187
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,333
BEFORE SUNSET,
IF LADY KOEI AGREES.

188
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,500
- Hosei: TRUST ME,
THERE'S NO NEED.

189
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,625
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

190
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,416
- IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THEY HAVE A WEAK SPOT.

191
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,166
AND I, IT ALSO HAPPENS,
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS.

192
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,083
RIGHT HERE...

193
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,833
HIT THE FOREHEAD AND
EVEN YOUR HEARTIEST

194
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,666
- UNDEAD FREAK'LL STAY DOWN.
- Koei: THAT'S NOT TRUE.

195
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,500
THE HEART IS WHERE THE
UNDEAD ARE MOST VULNERABLE.

196
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,625
HONESTLY, IT'S IN ONE EAR
AND OUT THE OTHER WITH YOU.

197
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,583
- YOU TOLD ME THE
FOREHEAD LAST NIGHT!

198
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,958
- I TOLD YOU
NO SUCH THING.

199
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,166
- "IN ONE EAR AND
OUT THE OTHER."

200
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,125
SORRY, "DARLING," I'M NOT READY
TO ACCEPT THAT YOU KNOW

201
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,500
SOMETHING KOEI DOESN'T.

202
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,250
- NICE GOING, SURE SHOT.
YOU CAN'T EVEN LISTEN RIGHT.

203
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,875
- BUT SHE... LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT I HEARD LAST NIGHT!

204
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,083
- LET IT GO. KOEI'S NOT GONNA
GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRONG.

205
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,125
YOU, ON THE OTHER
HAND, WELL, SURE.

206
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,458
- Hosei: COME ON! YOU
GOTTA BELIEVE ME, LAILA!

207
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,333
- ( grunts )

208
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,166
- MY ARM'S STARTING
TO HATE ME FOR ALL THIS

209
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,916
ENERGY I'VE PUT INTO IT.

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,875
I KNOW I COULD
DO THIS YESTERDAY.

211
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,291
- Koei: LET'S TRY A
CHANGE OF SCENERY.

212
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,083
- UH, OKAY?

213
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,208
- COME ALONG WITH ME.

214
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,958
- WHAT IS THIS?

215
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,041
- THIS IS WHERE HOSEI'S
TRAINING TOOK PLACE.

216
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,000
- NO KIDDING, HUH?

217
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,958
BET HE SPENT A LOT OF
HOURS HERE BEING DRILLED.

218
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,041
- SO, I GOTTA ASK.
IF HE'S SUCH A FLAKE NOW,

219
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,791
WHAT WAS HE LIKE BEFORE
YOU PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN?

220
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,916
HEY, I'M ALL FOR SERIOUS
TRAINING AND EVERYTHING,

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,375
BUT, AREN'T YOU TAKING
THIS A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY?

222
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,833
- ( shouts )

223
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,916
- WHAT THE HELL?

224
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,125
- JUST BACK
AWAY FROM HER.

225
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,791
- BUT WE... SHE AND I...

226
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,166
- TRUST US, IT'S
NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

227
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,458
- THE CONVERSATION THIS
MORNING TROUBLED ME.

228
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,291
SAY WHAT YOU WILL,
HOSEI IS A SKILLED WARRIOR.

229
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,791
HE DIDN'T GET THIS
FAR BY ATTENDING

230
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,833
POORLY TO WHAT
HIS MASTER SAYS.

231
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,708
I DON'T THINK HE
MISHEARD HER LAST NIGHT.

232
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,875
IF HOSEI IS CORRECT
ABOUT THE WEAK SPOT,

233
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,625
THE ERROR WAS LADY KOEI'S.

234
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,708
AND THE REAL KOEI
IS NOT PRONE TO MISTAKES!

235
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,041
- YOU MEAN, SHE...

236
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,291
- Shimei: BRAVO!
SHREWDLY DEDUCED.

237
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,750
- IT'S MOUSTACHE'S
DAMN ERRAND BOY!

238
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,166
- YOU! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH
MY MASTER, YOU FILTHY BASTARD!

239
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,541
- WELL LET'S JUST SAY,
ON THE SUBJECT OF WEAK SPOTS,

240
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,041
THERE'S ONE IN YOUR THEORY.

241
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,000
THE LADY KOEI BEFORE
YOU IS THE GENUINE ARTICLE.

242
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,375
- THAT YOU WOULD DARE EXPLOIT
AN INNOCENT WOMAN AS A PAWN.

243
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,250
WHATEVER BLACK
ARTS YOU EMPLOY,

244
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,041
RELINQUISH YOUR
HOLD ON HER AT ONCE!

245
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,666
- AH, BUT YOU SEE, I CANNOT.

246
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,750
- JUST TURN HER BACK NOW
OR I'LL KILL YOU!

247
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,875
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

248
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,416
YOU SEE, MY FRIENDS...

249
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,541
- NO!

250
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,708
- ( screams )

251
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,958
- NO. WHAT THE
HELL HAVE YOU DONE?

252
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,750
- MASTER? NO!

253
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,916
- POOR LITTLE PHECDA,
THE ARCHER,

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,041
HIS BELOVED MASTER'S
LAST BREATH

255
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,291
EDDIES OUT WHILST
HE BEARS HER ON HIS BACK.

256
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,208
AND HE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW.

257
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,583
- NO! NO, SHE...

258
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,666
- Hosei: YOU LIE!
- ( Shimei laughs )

259
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,750
- ISN'T THAT JUST
THE SADDEST THING?

260
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,291
SHE'S BEEN STONE-COLD DEAD

261
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,166
SINCE LAST NIGHT, YOU DAMN FOOL!

262
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,708
- ( gasps )

263
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,208
- WHAT? BUT HOW?

264
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,875
- MASTER. SHE CAN'T BE DEAD.

265
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,958
- OH, BUT HOW NOBLE SHE WAS.

266
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,041
EVEN AFTER I SKEWERED HER,
SHE BEGGED ME, TEARFULLY,

267
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,791
NOT TO TOUCH A HAIR ON ANY
OF YOUR PRECIOUS LITTLE HEADS.

268
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,250
NOT THAT THAT'LL
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

269
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,083
- YOU EVIL SON OF A BITCH.

270
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,291
- YES, YES. THAT'S IT.
SHOW ME YOUR HATRED.

271
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,375
- LET IT SHINE OUT!
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, TAITO!

272
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,541
- ( roars angrily )

273
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,000
- TAITO!

274
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,916
- NO! THE HATRED
WILL CONSUME YOU!

275
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,583
- THAT'S RIGHT.
SEETHE, ALKAID!

276
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,833
- ( yells )

277
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,416
- STOP THIS NOW!

278
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,166
YOUR BODY CAN'T WITHSTAND THIS
KIND OF POWER FOR LONG. PLEASE!

279
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,416
- TAITO! YOU MADE
KOEI A PROMISE

280
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,000
NEVER TO FIGHT IN
THE HEAT OF PASSION!

281
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,250
YOU OWE IT TO HER TO
TRY AND CONTROL YOUR ANGER!

282
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,583
PLEASE! STOP THIS NOW!

283
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,416
FINE! IF YOU WON'T
USE YOUR HEAD,

284
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,666
THEN MINE'LL HAVE TO
DO FOR THE BOTH OF US!

285
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,625
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, LAILA.

286
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,916
IF I CAN'T KEEP THE
PROMISE I MADE TO HER,

287
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,291
WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE ARE
PEOPLE GONNA THINK SHE WAS?

288
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,125
THANK YOU.

289
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,083
- DAMN KILLJOYS.

290
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,000
OH, WELL, I LEAVE
THEM TO YOU, KOEI.

291
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,083
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA RUN?

292
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,291
- YES, I AM. WHAT WILL
YOU DO, THOUGH?

293
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,166
I THINK STAYING
TO FINISH THE FIGHT

294
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,916
PUTS YOU BETWEEN
A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.

295
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,833
LEST YOU WOULD
HAVE HER DIE AGAIN?

296
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,583
- LOOK OUT!

297
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,291
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

298
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,166
- HIS MAGIC HAS GIVEN
HER INHUMAN STRENGTH.

299
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,875
SHE'S COMPELLED TO DESTROY US.

300
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,666
- RYUKO! NO! STOP!

301
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,750
- ( shrieks )

302
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,291
- TAITO! RYUKO!
HELP THEM, HOSEI!

303
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,666
- MASTER...

304
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,416
THIS... THIS ISN'T REAL.

305
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,208
I CAN'T DO IT!

306
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,625
I CAN'T FIGHT MY
OWN MASTER, LAILA!

307
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,458
I'M SORRY, I JUST CAN'T.

308
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,458
- YOU HAVE TO!

309
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,875
- WE... WE'VE BEEN
TOGETHER SINCE I WAS A KID.

310
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,250
IT'S MY FAULT THIS HAPPENED
TO HER BECAUSE I RAN AWAY

311
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,625
INTO THE WOODS LAST NIGHT
LIKE SOME STUPID LITTLE BRAT.

312
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,708
I...

313
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,416
I CAN'T DO THIS!

314
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,666
- THEN WHAT ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

315
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,125
- I DON'T KNOW!

316
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,958
- WE... WE CAN'T JUST...

317
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,583
GIVE IN TO THIS.
WE HAVE TO FIGHT!

318
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,125
- YEAH. KOEI WOULDN'T
HAVE WANTED...

319
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,791
FOR US TO JUST LET THIS HAPPEN.

320
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,666
- I'M SORRY, YOU
GUYS. SO SORRY.

321
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,208
WAIT, THAT'S...

322
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,666
- AND HOW EXACTLY
IS THAT A SHOT?

323
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,833
BUT MASTER, I TRIED!

324
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,458
- "TRY" MEANS NOTHING!
EITHER SHOOT AT THAT TARGET

325
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,375
WITH THE INTENTION OF
HITTING IT WITH ONE ARROW,

326
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,041
OR LAY DOWN THAT BOW.

327
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,958
YOU HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE
OF GETTING FED TONIGHT.

328
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,125
- NO!

329
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,208
HOLD ON...

330
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,208
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE STANDING
IN THAT EXACT SPOT FOR A REASON?

331
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,083
- ( both grunt )

332
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,375
- ARE YOU... ARE YOU
ASKING ME TO SHOOT?

333
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,458
- BUT...

334
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,208
NO, YOU CAN'T BE.

335
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,625
THAT ISN'T FAIR.

336
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,375
I COULDN'T BEAR TO BE
THE ONE TO KILL YOU.

337
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,333
- ( sobs )

338
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,375
DAMN YOU.

339
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,083
WHY IS IT ALWAYS ME
WHO GETS THE BRUNT END

340
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,833
OF YOUR CRUELTY, HUH?

341
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,041
WHAT'D I EVER DO?

342
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,500
- ( shrieks )

343
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,458
- HOSEI! YOU'RE NOT ALONE
IN THIS, YOU HEAR ME?

344
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,250
- ALL OF US WILL BEAR THE
WEIGHT OF WHAT HAS TO BE DONE!

345
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,041
- Hosei: MASTER...

346
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,125
THE BEST OF ME WILL ALWAYS
BE WHAT YOU PUT THERE.

347
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,208
THANK YOU.

348
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,833
- SEE THERE, DARLING?
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT!

349
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,708
- MASTER, WHAT'S WITH
YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN?

350
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,166
- I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

351
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,375
FOR DINNER I'LL FIX WHATEVER
YOUR LITTLE HEART DESIRES.

352
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,458
WHAT'LL IT BE?

353
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,625
- GREEN PEPPER STEAK!

354
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,708
- GREEN PEPPER STEAK,
BUT, OF COURSE!

355
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,041
- ( both laugh )

356
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,125
- ( sniffles )

357
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,458
STUPID HAG-BEAST.

358
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,458
STUPID HAG-BEAST!

359
00:21:58,541 --> 00:21:59,500
( sobs )

360
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,000
- ( theme song playing )

361
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,791
- Ryuko: BEFORE OUR FRIEND
CAN ABSORB THE STING OF GRIEF,

362
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,250
THE JOURNEY CONTINUES.

363
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,375
- Hosei: WHY ARE YOU SO
WORRIED, MY CHILD?

364
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,041
- Laila: ISN'T IT OBVIOUS
THAT HE'S HAVING TO FORCE

365
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,666
HIMSELF TO LAUGH LIKE THAT?

366
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,500
- Ryuko: BEING FORCED TO
STRIKE DOWN ONE'S MASTER

367
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,208
AND CHILDHOOD CAREGIVER...

368
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:51,666
- Taito: WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING BESIDES JUST

369
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,375
STAND HERE AND TALK ABOUT IT.

370
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,083
- Ryuko: WE KNOW WHAT
HE TRULY DESIRES...

371
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,583
SOME ATTENTION FROM
YOU WOULD HELP.

372
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:59,583
- Laila: I TRIED, BUT JUST
COULDN'T GET THROUGH TO HIM.

373
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,958
- Ryuko: NEXT TIME
ON HERO TALES,

374
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,541
FRIENDS ARE A
COLD COMFORT IN

375
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,000
CHAPTER EIGHT,
"WHAT ECHOES IN THE GORGE."

376
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,375
