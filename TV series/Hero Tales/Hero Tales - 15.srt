1
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,125
- PATIENCE.
THE TIME ISN'T YET RIGHT.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,291
- ( sighing )

3
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,750
- DINNER!

4
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,625
- ( men cheering )

5
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,375
( laughing )

6
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,833
- MEN ARE PIGS.

7
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,750
- ( theme song playing )

8
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,791
- LOOK AT YOU ALL. DISGRACEFUL.

9
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,916
FIGHTING OVER SCRAPS
LIKE ANIMALS.

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,625
IS THAT YOUR IDEA
OF HOW GROWN MEN

11
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,708
ARE MEANT TO BEHAVE?

12
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,250
- LOOK, ENKI, WE WERE...
- NO EXCUSES!

13
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,958
- YES, MA'AM.

14
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,500
- YES. THERE IS BUT ONE WORD
FOR THIS, SHAME!

15
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,416
THE ONLY REGARD YOU LOT SHOULD
HOLD YOURSELVES IN!

16
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,416
- YOU ARE
THE WORST OF THE OFFENDERS!

17
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,416
WHAT KIND OF AN EXAMPLE
DO YOU THINK IT SETS

18
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,041
FOR THESE MEN TO SEE
THEIR OWN CAPTAIN

19
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,750
COMPORT HIMSELF LIKE A BOAR?

20
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,750
- HM. THAT'S UNKIND.
I DID SAVE ENOUGH FOR YOU.

21
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,291
- Enki: NOT THE POINT!
- ( men laughing )

22
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,875
- Enki: SILENCE!

23
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:02,958
- JUST LOOK AT THEM.

24
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,916
MEN ARE THE SAME
NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO.

25
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,250
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

26
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,875
- YEAH. SURE, I GUESS SO.

27
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,875
- IT'S TAITO, ISN'T IT?

28
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,625
- YEAH.

29
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,083
- FEELING POWERLESS TO HELP
IS PRETTY AWFUL, HUH?

30
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,875
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CONCERNS
THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

31
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,791
- Laila: HEY, TAITO.

32
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,708
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T EATEN
IN A WHILE.

33
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,208
RINMEI SHARED SOME JERKY
WITH ME, IF YOU'D LIKE SOME.

34
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,583
IT'S DELICIOUS!

35
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,750
( sighs )

36
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,875
UH... SO, UH...
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

37
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,458
THE WOJIN GUYS
ALL WENT OUT TO HUNT

38
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,166
FOR EVERYBODY'S MEAL EARLIER.

39
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,250
'COURSE, WHAT THEY WOUND UP
CATCHING WAS WAY TOO SMALL

40
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,250
FOR ALL OF US TO SHARE...

41
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,791
- ( grunts )
- ( gasps )

42
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,458
- TELL ME.

43
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,041
- TELL YOU WHAT?

44
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,666
- WHY WAS I SO HELPLESS
AGAINST KEIRO?

45
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,125
WHY DID RYUKO HAVE TO DIE?

46
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,916
JUST EXPLAIN IT TO ME!

47
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,416
- SORRY. I CAN'T.

48
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,000
- YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT SO.

49
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,291
- I'M SORRY.

50
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,375
- THE ISSUE IS PROPORTION.

51
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,500
- Crewman: PROPORTION?

52
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,083
- UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN,

53
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,333
ENKI'S WRATH HAS ITS SOURCE

54
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,666
IN OUR PROVENDER'S
DIMINUTIVE SIZE.

55
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,416
- I'M NOT SO SURE
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

56
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,666
- THAT IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM!

57
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,833
SO, THAT BEING THE CASE.

58
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,833
OUR SOLUTION IS TO GO AFTER
BIGGER PREY. CORRECT?

59
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,333
- UH...

60
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,041
- Men: ( reluctantly ) YEAH.
- Koyo: ENTHUSIASTICALLY!

61
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,750
- ( loudly ) YEAH!

62
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,625
- ( scoffing )
- ( footsteps )

63
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,875
( sobbing )

64
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,083
- Both: HUH?

65
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,416
- OH, I SEE.

66
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,291
- MAN, HAS HE LOST HEART.

67
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,958
THAT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
TAITO AT ALL.

68
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,291
- I'M SORRY.

69
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,291
- Hosei: YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR!

70
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,291
- Laila: I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DO SOMETHING, BUT...

71
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,291
- COME ON, YOU DID
WHAT YOU COULD.

72
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,291
I'LL BET HE WANTS TO IGNORE YOU
JUST SO HE CAN SULK OUT THERE

73
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,500
LIKE A BIG BABY.

74
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,875
HELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT'S

75
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,875
BROKEN UP BY RYUKO'S DEATH.

76
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,208
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

77
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,958
DON'T CENSOR YOURSELF
ON MY ACCOUNT.

78
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,458
THAT SAID, HE'S GOT A LOT
ON HIS MIND.

79
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,541
I DON'T THINK RYUKO
IS THE ONLY THING TROUBLING HIM.

80
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,875
- ( spash )

81
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:01,666
- POOR GUY. HE'S AT A LOSS
AS TO HIS OWN PURPOSE.

82
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,666
I GUESS EVERY ONE OF US
BORN WITH A SIGIL

83
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,041
GOES DOWN THAT
ROAD EVENTUALLY.

84
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,750
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

85
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,416
- DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE
LEGENDS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT US?

86
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,958
- THE DIPPER BEARERS?

87
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,166
WHEN THE EARTHLY PLANE
IS IN CHAOS,

88
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,833
THEY'LL DESCEND DOWN
FROM THE SPHERE ABOVE.

89
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,208
- WELL. YOU'LL NOTICE
THE STORY LEAVES

90
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,416
WHETHER OR NOT
THE DIPPER BEARERS

91
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,166
BRING SALVATION, OPEN TO DEBATE.

92
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,916
SOME PEOPLE TAKE THE VIEW
THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,166
THE HARBINGERS OF THAT CHAOS.

94
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,833
WHETHER IT WISHES TO OR NOT,

95
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,125
A STAR AFFECTS ANY AND
EVERYTHING AROUND IT PROFOUNDLY.

96
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,791
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

97
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,416
- SO THEN, YOU'RE SAYIN'
WHATEVER WE DO,

98
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,375
WE JUST MESS UP
PEOPLES' LIVES?

99
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,375
- WE'D JUST BE FOOLING OURSELVES
IF WE DIDN'T ADMIT IT.

100
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,875
WHEN YOU START DWELLING
ON THAT, THOUGH,

101
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,583
YOU OPEN THE DOOR
TO A HOST OF UGLY QUESTIONS.

102
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,166
EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUDDENLY SEEMS NO MORE

103
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,625
THAN A MIRAGE.

104
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,666
YOU START TO FEEL CRUELLY
CHEATED BY YOUR OWN FATE.

105
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,041
- Hosei: TAITO'S JUST AT A LOW
EBB RIGHT NOW, THAT'S ALL.

106
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,541
HE'LL SHAKE IT OFF.

107
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,500
- Rinmei: ALL OF THIS WILL PASS,
LAILA. YOU'LL SEE.

108
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,041
- HMM.

109
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,166
- ( screeching )

110
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,166
- Koyo: HOW'S HE HOLDING UP?

111
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,583
- RATHER SULLENLY, I'M AFRAID.

112
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,250
- AH.

113
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,958
- I DON'T BELIEVE I'VE EVER
KNOWN YOU TO BE SO CONCERNED.

114
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,333
THIS UNSCHEDULED STOP
IS FOR TAITO'S SAKE.

115
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,833
- HARDLY.

116
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,083
FACT IS, I STOPPED
TO GET OUR BEARINGS,

117
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,416
SO TO SPEAK.

118
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,041
THE BOY'S MOOD IS STARTING
TO RUB OFF ON EVERYONE.

119
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,583
- SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

120
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,416
SORRY.

121
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,708
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE?

122
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,541
- OH, RINMEI ASKED ME
TO HOIST IT UP EARLIER.

123
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,708
IT'S THE INSIGNIA FOR
THE "MEN ARE HOPELESS" LEAGUE.

124
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,708
- UH... ( slowly ) OKAY.

125
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,500
- ( footsteps )

126
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,791
Hosei: TAITO!

127
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,291
( chuckling )

128
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,875
I'M STARVING. YOU?

129
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,625
- WHAT?
- ON YOUR FEET, SOURPUSS.

130
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,958
DINNER LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED,
DON'T YOU THINK?

131
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,625
SO WE'RE GONNA TRACK DOWN
SOMETHING WITH SOME

132
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,916
HONEST-TO-GOODNESS HEFT TO IT

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,375
AND FEAST LIKE THE MEN WE ARE.

134
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,166
HEY, WITH ME?

135
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,458
TAITO.

136
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,833
- SURE, WHATEVER.

137
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,333
- COME ON, MAN.

138
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,708
- Crewman: THERE IT IS!
- ( all gasp )

139
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,333
- COME ON!

140
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,625
- ( men shouting )

141
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,291
- SOUNDS LIKE WE GOT
A BANQUET HEADED OUR WAY!

142
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,166
- ( grunts )

143
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,291
- I'LL HANDLE IT FROM HERE!

144
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,166
- ( grunting )

145
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,666
- Hosei: WHAT?

146
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,916
GREAT, IT'S A SMART ONE.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,791
HEADS UP, TAITO!
YOU'VE GOT COMPANY!

148
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,708
- ( pig grunting )
- ( screaming )

149
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,375
( groaning )
- TAITO!

150
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,416
- ( pig grunting )

151
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,708
- WHAT... WHAT THE...

152
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,458
- Hosei: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

153
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,041
- ( both grunt )

154
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,083
- ( gasps )

155
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,291
HOSEI!

156
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,333
- THERE, NOW. IT SHOULD HEAL
BEFORE TOO LONG.

157
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,500
- THAT'S GOOD.

158
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,500
- THE HELL'S YOUR PROBLEM?

159
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,875
YOU COULD'VE BEEN KILLED!
YOU KNOW THAT?

160
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,125
- I... I DIDN'T MEAN...

161
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,416
- JUST SAVE IT! WHY DIDN'T YOU
FIGHT THE DAMN THING?

162
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,375
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD'VE BEEN
ABLE TO TAKE IT DOWN

163
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,041
WITH A FLICK OF YOUR WRIST!

164
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,208
WHAT KIND OF CRAP
WERE YOU TRYIN' TO PULL?

165
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,875
- SORRY.

166
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,791
- IDIOT!

167
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,416
- THE MAN SAID HE WAS SORRY.

168
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,375
SURELY ONE INJURED PERSON
IS ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

169
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,750
- ( birds chirping )

170
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,625
- ( grunting )

171
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,541
- Koyo: JUST AS I THOUGHT.

172
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,958
- KOYO.

173
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,708
- YOU'VE LOST THE ABILITY
TO CHANNEL, HAVEN'T YOU?

174
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,291
- HOW'D YOU...
- COME, NOW.

175
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,083
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST
TO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS.

176
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,791
SO. WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO?

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,583
- WELL, I GUESS

178
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,500
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
GET THE ABILITY TO CHANNEL BACK.

179
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,291
- IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,750
THE ONLY THING CHANNELING
IS REALLY GOOD FOR IS COMBAT.

181
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,125
BY TAKING IT BACK,

182
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,708
THE PRESUMPTION IS YOU WISH
TO RE-ENTER THE FRAY.

183
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,875
- WELL...

184
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,791
- CHERISHED FRIENDS, STRANGERS.

185
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,625
PEOPLE WILL DIE
BECAUSE OF THEIR LOYALTY TO YOU.

186
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,708
THAT IS, BECAUSE
OF THEIR LOYALTY TO ALKAID.

187
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,250
BUT TO TURN YOUR BACK
ON THE STARS IS TO CHOOSE

188
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,583
A POORLY LIT PATH INDEED.

189
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,458
THE PRICE OF ALKAID'S POWER
IS HIS KARMA.

190
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,583
REJECT THAT, AND, WELL...

191
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,083
- SO, WHAT THEN?

192
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,041
I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT
THIS ALKAID THING'S DESTINY

193
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,625
AS MY OWN ON FAITH?

194
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,000
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO I HAVE
TO HURT IN THE PROCESS?

195
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,625
- TRAGICALLY, THE BRIGHTEST
STAR TENDS TO ECLIPSE THOSE

196
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,708
NEAREST TO IT IN THE SKY.

197
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,583
THEN AGAIN, THAT SAME
HARSH GLARE CAN ILLUMINATE

198
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,250
THE DARKEST CORNER.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,125
( chuckling )
GOOD, HUH?

200
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,916
THAT LITTLE NUGGET OF WISDOM
COMES FROM MASTER SONNEI!

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,166
- YOU KNOW MASTER SONNEI?
WHAT IS ALKAID?

202
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,583
WHAT'S ALL THIS "KARMA OF THE
STARS" STUFF? EXPLAIN IT TO ME!

203
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,666
- IN YOUR PLACE, SON.
I'D SEEK A BETTER VIEW.

204
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,916
CLARITY PREFERS DISTANCE.
A HAWK'S VANTAGE, AS IT WERE.

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,666
- A BETTER VIEW.

206
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,833
- Laila: AT THIS HOUR?

207
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,125
YOU JUST LET HIM GO
WANDERING OFF ALL BY HIMSELF?

208
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:37,166
- THE WAY HE IS NOW, TAITO'D
BE LUCKY TO BEAT A RABBIT!

209
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,541
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME,
OLD MAN?

210
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,916
- CALM DOWN. ( scoffing )

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,875
TRY NOT TO BE SO OVERPROTECTIVE.

212
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,625
- Enki: YOU ARE GUESTS
ON THE DOU YA.

213
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,583
AND THAT MEANS YOU SHOW
ITS CAPTAIN SOME RESPECT.

214
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,541
- THAT'S ABOUT
THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT.

215
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,708
FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

216
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,541
TAITO HAS THE RIGHT TO DO
AS HE PLEASES.

217
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,166
HE'LL RETURN IN HIS OWN GOOD
TIME. I SUGGEST YOU BE PATIENT.

218
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,750
- NEED YOU HAVE BEEN SO HARSH?

219
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,750
I MEAN, YOU COULD'VE AT LEAST
OFFERED YOUR TAKE

220
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,208
ON THE SITUATION.

221
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,083
MIGHT'VE CONSOLED THEM A BIT.

222
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,458
- OH, DEAR. DEFECTING TO
THEIR SIDE NOW, ARE YOU?

223
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,541
- YOU KNOW WHOSE SIDE I'M ON.

224
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,458
I JUST HAVE AN EXCESS
OF SYMPATHY

225
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,291
FOR ANYONE BARKED AT
BY A SELF-CENTERED,

226
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,750
OVERBEARING LOUT, THAT'S ALL.

227
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,375
- SELF-CENTERED LOUT, HUH?
MY KINDA GUY.

228
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,708
- ( laughing )
I'LL BET HE IS.

229
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,791
- "THE BRIGHTEST STAR".

230
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,125
RYUKO, WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN
AS CONFUSED BY ALL OF THIS

231
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,750
AS I AM RIGHT NOW?

232
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,375
- ( cheering and laughing )

233
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,833
- COME ON, LAILA.
HE'LL BE OKAY.

234
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,666
DUMB AS HE IS, AN ANIMAL'D
JUST THINK HE'S ONE OF ITS OWN.

235
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,541
- ( owl hooting )

236
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,416
- DEAD END.

237
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,583
- ( growling )

238
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,708
- WHAT THE...

239
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,583
NOT A GOOD SOUND.

240
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,333
( growling )

241
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,750
DAMN IT. STILL NO GOOD.

242
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,666
- ( rustling )
- ( gasping )

243
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,666
- ( growling )

244
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,875
- ( screaming )

245
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,333
- ( growling )

246
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,333
- GO ON, DO YOUR WORST.

247
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,750
I DON'T CARE.

248
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,416
- ( panting )

249
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,458
I'M COMING. HOLD ON!

250
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,625
- ( men groaning )

251
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,250
- TIME TO SHOVE OFF, I SUPPOSE.

252
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,916
- ( footsteps approaching )
Enki: CAPTAIN!

253
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,125
IT'S LAILA. SHE'S GONE!

254
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,250
- NO LUCK! I CAN'T FIND
A TRACE OF HER ANYWHERE!

255
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,291
- Rinmei: SAME HERE!
- I SEE.

256
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,375
- SOMEBODY TOOK THE SWORD
FROM TAITO'S ROOM.

257
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,958
IT'S POSSIBLE...

258
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,000
- THAT SHE INTENDS TO BRING
THE SWORD TO HER BROTHER...

259
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,416
SHE'S PUT HERSELF
AT GREAT PERIL, I'M AFRAID.

260
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,375
- WE HAVE TO FORM
A SEARCH PARTY!

261
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,791
- ROUSE THE CREW IMMEDIATELY.
FIND HER.

262
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,875
- SIR!

263
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,166
- NOT ENOUGH HEFT TO ME
FOR A BEAST'S MEAL, HUH?

264
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,708
- JUST STAY STRONG.

265
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,833
SCARED AS YOU ARE, LAILA,

266
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,291
REMEMBER YOUR IDIOT BROTHER
NEEDS YOU.

267
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,041
- ( rustling )
- ( gasps )

268
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,291
( sighing )
A BUNNY. HOW CUTE.

269
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,083
HEY. WHY'RE YOU RUNNING OFF?

270
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,250
- ( growling )
- ( gasping )

271
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,250
( screaming )

272
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,916
- LAILA?

273
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,458
- GET AWAY FROM ME!

274
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,666
JUST STAY BACK!

275
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,750
TAITO! TAITO!

276
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,083
- LAILA!

277
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,083
- TAITO!
- ( growling )

278
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,458
- IT'S THAT SAME ONE!
HANG ON, SIS. I'M COMING!

279
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,166
( grunting )

280
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,166
THERE'S NO TIME!

281
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,916
- ( growling )

282
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,083
- ( guttural groan )

283
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,666
HEY, THERE. ARE YOU OKAY?

284
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,458
- YEAH. THANKS, TAI.

285
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,375
THAT MOVE.

286
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,416
YOU'RE ABLE TO CHANNEL AGAIN!

287
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,916
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

288
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,166
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS SAVING YOU,

289
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,000
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN...

290
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,750
- ( footsteps approaching )
( growling )

291
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,833
- NO, WAIT!

292
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,500
- UH.

293
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,833
- ( chuckling )

294
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,041
- Hosei: LAILA!

295
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,750
- SAY SOMETHING!

296
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,458
JUST CALL OUT!

297
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,916
- PLEASE. PLEASE BE ALL RIGHT.

298
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,166
- WE'RE ALMOST TO THE TOP.

299
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,166
- THANK YOU.

300
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,041
- ( both gasp )

301
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,625
- Laila: IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

302
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,791
- YEAH. SO,

303
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,666
THIS IS MY ANSWER?

304
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,708
- THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

305
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,166
- KOYO.
- HOW LONG...

306
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,416
- WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN?

307
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,875
WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO
WITH ALKAID?

308
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,708
- TELL ME. WHAT DO YOU SEE?

309
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,000
- Taito: WELL. LOTS OF VILLAGES
AND LITTLE RIVERS

310
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,583
AND STUFF, I GUESS.

311
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,708
- Koyo: PRECISELY. YOU SEE
THINGS AS THEY ARE NOW.

312
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,833
BUT LONG AGO
THIS VALLEY WAS DESOLATE.

313
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,041
LONG AGO,

314
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,083
THE PEOPLE OF THIS LAND
WERE A WRETCHED LOT.

315
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,791
THEIR POVERTY WAS CRUSHING.

316
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,583
VIOLENCE AND STARVATION
WERE RIFE.

317
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,375
THEN OUT OF THE MISTS,
ONE DAY, EMERGED A MAN.

318
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,375
A WANDERER,
BEARING THE GIFT OF HOPE.

319
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,375
BY A SIMPLE GESTURE OF SEEDS,
THEIR COURSE WAS ALTERED.

320
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,791
HE LIFTED THE SCALES
FROM THEIR EYES AND TAUGHT THEM

321
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,083
TO RESPECT THE LAND.

322
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,791
HOW TO TILL AND IRRIGATE,

323
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,958
EVEN HOW TO MAKE PROVISION
FOR THE LEANER SEASONS.

324
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,583
OVER TIME, THE HARD-SCRABBLE
LIFE THEY'D KNOWN

325
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,458
GAVE WAY TO UNDREAMT OF
PROSPERITY AND PEACE.

326
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,250
ON THAT MAN'S SHOULDER,

327
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,416
EMBLAZONED, WAS WRIT
THE SAME SIGIL AS YOU BEAR.

328
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,791
- ALKAID?

329
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,375
- HIS NAME WAS SHUO.

330
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,000
THE FIRST EMPEROR
OF THE XIAN EMPIRE.

331
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,958
- REALLY? I MEAN,
I KNEW IT WAS HIM.

332
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,416
BUT WAIT.

333
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,666
I THOUGHT... I WAS TOLD
THAT SHOU FOUNDED THE EMPIRE

334
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,583
THROUGH BLOODSHED.

335
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,625
ISN'T THAT TRUE?

336
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,375
- TRUER THAN YOU KNOW.

337
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,458
HE FOUGHT TO PROTECT THIS LAND
AND ITS PEOPLE.

338
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,916
BE THAT AS IT MAY,
THIS IS ONLY ONE PATH.

339
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,291
THE QUESTION IS,
IS IT YOURS? TRULY?

340
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,750
- I DON'T KNOW.

341
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,125
- TAITO.

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,250
- LAILA!

343
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,541
( laughing )

344
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,708
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.
YOU HAD US ALL SO WORRIED.

345
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,000
- I'M SORRY.

346
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,041
- AH, WELL. AS LONG AS
YOU'RE IN ONE PIECE.

347
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,083
- Taito: KOYO.
- YES?

348
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:20,083
- WELL, I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT MY ANSWER IS JUST YET.

349
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,166
WHATEVER ALKAID'S
SUPPOSED TO BE,

350
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,583
WHATEVER IT IS
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO,

351
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,708
WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT ALL,
I JUST KEEP DRAWING A BLANK.

352
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,416
BUT I'LL BE DAMNED
IF I'M GONNA GIVE UP.

353
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,750
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT MY PURPOSE IS,

354
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,458
SO I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOT
AT EVERYTHING UNTIL I FIND IT.

355
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,916
THAT'S CASTING MY NET
PRETTY WIDE,

356
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,750
BUT IT'LL GIVE ME
AN ANSWER EVENTUALLY.

357
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,083
THAT TOO CRAZY?

358
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,750
- NO. JUST CRAZY ENOUGH.

359
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,541
- ( laughing )
YEAH? WELL,

360
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,541
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M STARVING!

361
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,375
- CAST YOUR NET
PRETTY WIDE, HUH?

362
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,333
( chuckles )

363
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,875
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
YOU HAVE AN ANSWER.

364
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,666
- ( theme song playing )

365
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,708
- Koyo: ARE THESE THEATRICS
A MERE RUSE BY WHICH DUBHE HOPES

366
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,833
TO ENSNARE THE LAND?

367
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,583
- SEIZING CONTROL OF THIS EMPIRE
IS BUT MERELY ONE STEP

368
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,958
IN MY PLAN.

369
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,791
- WELL, WE CAN'T JUST
GO ALL CRAZY ON THESE GUYS.

370
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,166
- IN ORDER TO ENSURE
THIS LOVELY CATACLYSM,

371
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,000
ALKAID AND DUBHE MUST CLASH.

372
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,791
- Taito: IF PART OF MY BURDEN
AS ALKAID

373
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,791
MEANS I HAVE TO WIPE OUT
SCUM LIKE THIS, SO BE IT.

374
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,166
- Koyo: NEXT TIME ON HERO TALES,

375
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,208
DARKNESS ENCROACHES IN

376
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:06,500
CHAPTER SIXTEEN: "DUBHE,
DEVOURER OF THE HEAVENS."

377
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:20,250
- Keiro: ALKAID. YOUR LIGHT TOO
SHALL FALL VICTIM TO MY SHADOW!
