1
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,375
- Keiro: TAKI.

2
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,041
- YES, FATHER?
- DO NOT WORRY, MY CHILD.

3
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,750
YOUR FATHER IS HERE.

4
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,750
- MY LORD, THE EMPEROR
HAS ARRIVED AND MAKES HIS WAY

5
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,041
TO THE GREAT HALL.

6
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,458
- THAT LOOK SUITS YOU WELL.

7
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,458
- THANK YOU, FATHER.

8
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,250
- ( theme song playing )

9
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,958
- Enki: WE WILL REMAIN HERE
WITH THE DOU YA.

10
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,250
PLEASE TAKE GREAT CARE.

11
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,500
- AW, THIS PLACE IS PRETTY SAFE.

12
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,791
WE SHOULD BE FINE.

13
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,166
- THIS LAND IS VERY NEAR
TO THE LIAN TONG TEMPLE.

14
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,666
AND THUS UNDER THE EVER VIGILANT
EYE OF THE QING LONG PLATOON.

15
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,625
- YEAH, WEREN'T YOU TELLING ME
THAT'S THE GROUP THAT YOU

16
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,458
AND TAITO'S OLD MAN
RUNS TO TRY TO KEEP

17
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,833
THE PEACE AROUND THESE PARTS?

18
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,750
- THAT'S THE ONE.
I HOPE IT'S BEEN QUIET.

19
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,833
- WELL, LET'S GET A MOVE ON
AND WE CAN ASK HIM OVER DINNER.

20
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,750
- SOUNDS GOOD!

21
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,375
- ( men shouting indistinctly )

22
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,041
- WE SHALL RETURN!

23
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,291
- Taito: WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?

24
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,958
- Laila: THIS IS HORRIBLE.
IT WASN'T LIKE THIS BEFORE.

25
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,833
WHEN WE CAME THROUGH EARLIER,
EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

26
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,333
- WHOEVER DID THIS
TOOK ALL OF THE FOOD AS WELL.

27
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,250
- THE WORK OF ROVING BANDITS.

28
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,375
STILL FRESH.
MAYBE ONE OR TWO DAYS AGO.

29
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,250
THREE AT THE MOST.

30
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,125
- WHERE ARE ALL THE PEOPLE?

31
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,125
AWFUL.

32
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,208
- ISN'T THE QING LONG PLATOON

33
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,125
SUPPOSED TO STOP
THINGS LIKE THIS?

34
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,458
CUT IT OUT.

35
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,458
- BUT WHY?

36
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,041
- IT'S NOT HIS FAULT, DEAR.

37
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,000
I'M SURE IT JUST HAPPENED
TOO FAST FOR THEM TO GET HERE.

38
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,666
- ALL RIGHT, TAIGA!

39
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,458
YOU PROMISED ME THAT
YOU'D CLEAN UP THE EMPIRE

40
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,125
AND YOU'D BETTER NOT FORGET!

41
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,958
YOU HEAR ME?

42
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,708
- I AM HONORED TO HAVE
SO MANY DISTINGUISHED GUESTS

43
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,875
GATHERED TO BID MY DAUGHTER
THEIR BLESSINGS ON HER BIRTHDAY.

44
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:15,666
MOST NOTABLY THE SON OF HEAVEN,
HIS LORDSHIP EMPEROR TAIGA.

45
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,791
I HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU
WILL SHARE IN OUR GOOD CHEER

46
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,750
ON THIS MOST JOYOUS OCCASION.

47
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,791
- Taiga: HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
LADY TAKI.

48
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,500
- MY LORD?

49
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,958
- WHAT? IS IT NOT?
ARE YOU UNHAPPY?

50
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,250
- YOUR LORDSHIP IS BY HER SIDE.

51
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,625
SURELY, ALL IS WELL
WITH MY LADY.

52
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,333
- CHOKA. IT IS NOT YOUR PLACE
TO ANSWER FOR HER.

53
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,750
- EXCUSE THE INTERRUPTION
BUT PERHAPS THE MAGNITUDE

54
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,208
OF YOUR IMPENDING ANNOUNCEMENT

55
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,416
IS WEIGHING HEAVILY
ON HER MIND.

56
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,541
- PLEASE FORGIVE MY TARDINESS.

57
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,666
- OF COURSE.

58
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,666
- YOU'VE ARRIVED!
- HMM.

59
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,416
LADY TAKI. I HOPE THIS SPECIAL
DAY FINDS YOU IN GOOD SPIRITS.

60
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,000
- IT DOES, SIR. THANK YOU.

61
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,458
- YOU HAVE
QUITE AN AUDIENCE ASSEMBLED.

62
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,583
OFFICIALS OF EVERY STRIPE

63
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,166
CONGREGATED TO OBSERVE
YOUR BIRTHDAY.

64
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,125
SUCH SPECTACLE.

65
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,125
YOUR FATHER'S INFLUENCE
IS CERTAINLY A THING TO BEHOLD

66
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,625
IN AND OF ITSELF.

67
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,333
- WHAT'S MORE. I MYSELF HAVE
A MATTER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE

68
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,541
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE
TO OUR GUESTS.

69
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,458
- Shokaku: MY CURIOSITY
IS PIQUED.

70
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,083
- THE TIME WOULD SEEM RIPE.
- YES.

71
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,083
HEAR, HEAR.
I HAVE A DECLARATION

72
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,875
THAT WELL WARRANTS THE ATTENTION
OF SO AUGUST AN ASSEMBLY. LADY.

73
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,791
- Shokaku: HE TAKES THE PATH
OF LESSER RESISTANCE,

74
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,333
BUT GREATER BOND.

75
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,833
- Man: GENERAL TOKAKU!
I BEAR AN URGENT MESSAGE!

76
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,750
- I AM NOT TO BE BOTHERED TODAY.

77
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,125
I HAVE TAKEN ILL

78
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,458
AND WISH TO BE IN SECLUSION
UNTIL SUNUP TOMORROW.

79
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,541
- YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MATTER
IS PARAMOUNT.

80
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,791
- IT REGARDS, THE EMPEROR.
- HMM.

81
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,083
- THE GRAND GENERAL WISHES
TO SPEAK, MY LADY.

82
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,375
- GRAND GENERAL TOKAKU
HAS ARRIVED?

83
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,041
WELL THEN, MAKE HASTE.

84
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,250
- GENERAL TOKAKU. TO WHAT
DO WE OWE THE SUDDEN PLEASURE

85
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,750
OF YOUR COMPANY?

86
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,875
HAS YOUR HEALTH RETURNED?

87
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,500
- I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN,
MY LORD.

88
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,541
HOWEVER, I CANNOT SIMPLY REST

89
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,083
WHILE THE FATE OF THE EMPIRE
IS THROWN INTO PERIL.

90
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,666
- OF WHAT PERIL DO YOU SPEAK?

91
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,375
- YOUR HIGHNESS,
I RECEIVED THIS JUST NOW.

92
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,250
WORD THAT YOU HAVE ANNOUNCED
YOUR UPCOMING UNION

93
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,833
WITH THIS YOUNG LADY.

94
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,416
- IN FACT I HAVE.
- YOU MUST HALT THIS AT ONCE!

95
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
- ( all gasping )

96
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,500
- THE EMPIRE IS A SACRED THING.

97
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,708
ITS FUTURE MUST NOT BE LEFT
TO WAYWARDNESS AND WHIM.

98
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,000
NEITHER TO THAT MAN'S DAUGHTER!

99
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,958
THERE IS STILL TIME
TO RECONSIDER, MY LORD.

100
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,916
- WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
YOUR OBJECTION TO MY HAPPINESS?

101
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,541
SPEAK NOW!

102
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,458
- THE ESTEEMED GENERAL TOKAKU
IS CLEARLY TROUBLED

103
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,500
BY MY ATTENDANCE HERE MY LORD.

104
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,333
I WILL RESPECTFULLY
TAKE MY LEAVE.

105
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:06,041
GENTLEMEN, GRANT THEM
THEIR PRIVACY!

106
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,833
- IS IT WISE TO LEAVE HIM THERE?

107
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,208
- I HAVE NO DOUBT LADY CHOKA'S
SHARP-EDGED TONGUE

108
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,958
WILL DISPOSE OF HIM.

109
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,791
- INDEED, SIR. TAKI...

110
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,125
- TOKAKU, I IMPLORE YOU
TO EXPLAIN.

111
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,375
- MY LIEGE, FORGIVE MY CANDOR
BUT CLEARLY YOU ARE REMISS.

112
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,916
THIS WILL BIND GENERAL KEIRO
UNEQUIVOCALLY TO THE THRONE

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,791
AS A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY.

114
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,375
- WHAT'S THE PERIL IN THAT?

115
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,541
- YOUR HIGHNESS. WE MUST NOT LET
THAT MAN WITHIN ARM'S REACH

116
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,250
OF SUCH GREAT POWER.

117
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,750
- PERHAPS THE GENERAL FEARS
HIS OWN REACH OF THE THRONE

118
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,458
WILL BE OBSTRUCTED BY KEIRO.

119
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,708
- CHOKA.

120
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,166
- SILENCE! MY CONCERNS
ON BEHALF OF THE EMPIRE

121
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,375
WILL NOT BE DISPARAGED
BY THE LIKES OF YOU!

122
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,250
- IT IS SURELY NOT
MERE COINCIDENCE

123
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,125
THAT HE OBJECTS TO A MOVE
THAT MAY RAISE THE PROFILE

124
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,625
OF HIS RIVAL.

125
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,666
PERHAPS THIS BILE WAS THE CAUSE
OF HIS EARLIER INFIRMITY.

126
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,916
- MY LIEGE, I ASK YOU
HAVE THIS LOWLY SERVANT

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,291
BITE HER TONGUE!

128
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,875
STOP INFECTING HIS EARS
WITH YOUR DAMNED LIES!

129
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,458
- ( laughing ) HOW FRIGHTENING.

130
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,791
THE GENERAL SEEMS EAGER
TO PORTRAY THE ROLE

131
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,375
OF SPURNED MISTRESS
TO THE COURT!

132
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,416
YOU DESPERATELY ATTEMPT
TO SEW SEEDS OF DOUBT

133
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
IN OUR DIVINE RULER'S MIND

134
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,541
AND CAST ASPERSIONS
ON THE INTENTIONS

135
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,958
OF A TRUSTED SERVANT
TO HIS HIGHNESS.

136
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,958
THESE ARE ACTIONS FITTING A MAN
WHO FEARS LOSING THE COMFORT

137
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,625
OF HIS POSITION.

138
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,083
- YOU TREACHEROUS WENCH!

139
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,708
- GENERAL.
- LORD.

140
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,833
- HEAR MY WORDS, LADY TAKI
IS NOT A POLITICAL OBJECT!

141
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,083
SHE IS THE WOMAN
WHOM I TRULY ADORE.

142
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,208
I WOULD MOST APPRECIATE
YOUR BLESSING.

143
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,791
I MUST RESTORE
THIS LAND OF OURS.

144
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,625
MY LOVE FOR THE EMPIRE,
IS AS BOUNDLESS AND UNWAVERING

145
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,250
AS THE SUN THAT SHINES
IN THE HEAVENS ABOVE US.

146
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,708
BUT I CANNOT STEWARD IT ALONE.

147
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:03,041
TOKAKU, LEND ME YOUR STRENGTH.
SHARE IN OUR JOY.

148
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,166
- MY SUPPORT
IS BUT YOURS TO ASK.

149
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,541
- I THANK YOU FOR THAT.

150
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,291
- I AM YOUR HUMBLE SUBJECT,
MY LIEGE.

151
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,416
- QUITE UNEXPECTED FROM THE LAD.

152
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,541
PERHAPS AN INDICATION
OF THE FIRE HE HOLDS WITHIN?

153
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,208
ALAS.

154
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,208
ALL FOR NAUGHT WITHOUT
THE POWER OF ALKAID

155
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,833
TO STOKE IT INTO
AN INFERNO'S PROPORTIONS.

156
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,208
AND, WHAT'S MORE...

157
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,708
IN ORDER TO ENSURE
THIS LOVELY CATACLYSM.

158
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,000
ALKAID AND DUBHE
MUST CLASH.

159
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,500
- I SWEAR. I WILL SHINE
THE LIGHT OF PEACE

160
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,333
UPON THIS EMPIRE ONCE AGAIN.

161
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,166
TO HONOR MY LOVE FOR TAKI.

162
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,750
AND, TO HONOR MY WORD TO TAITO.

163
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,125
- MY PATIENCE WEARS THIN.

164
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:56,375
WHEREFORE THIS HESITATION?
COME ALKAID.

165
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,166
- ( sneezing )

166
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,083
- YOU CATCHIN' A COLD THERE?
- NO, I'M FINE.

167
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,250
- THAT'S RIGHT. DON'T WORRY
ABOUT HIM, HE'S SO BACKWARDS,

168
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,666
HE CAN'T EVEN CATCH A COLD!

169
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,416
- Both: OH, IS THAT SO?
- DON'T ENCOURAGE HER, YOU TWO.

170
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,875
- HEY, UH, IS THAT REALLY TRUE?
- DON'T ASK ME. I'M NO DOCTOR.

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,375
WHO'S THERE?

172
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,250
- ( laughing )

173
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,958
PRETTY GOOD MOVE AVOIDING MY
ASTOUNDINGLY SKILLFUL ATTACK.

174
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,083
BUT...

175
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,541
PRETTY BAD MOVE
STEPPING RIGHT INTO THE HEART

176
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,625
OF BA GANG TERRITORY.

177
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,958
- YOUR TERRITORY?

178
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,833
SO YOU'RE THE BASTARDS
THAT DESTROYED THIS VILLAGE?

179
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,750
- IT WASN'T OUR FAULT, RUNT.

180
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,375
YEAH. THEY COULD HAVE PREVENTED
THE WHOLE DAMN THING

181
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,500
- IF THEY JUST DID
LIKE WE ASKED THEM TO.

182
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,750
- WHAT THE HELL?

183
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,125
- ( laughing )
NOT READY FOR THAT?

184
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,333
- WHAT ARE THEY, TWINS?

185
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,583
- Bashi: NOT JUST TWINS, WOMAN!
- WHAT?

186
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,583
- THERE'S FIVE.
- BAEI!

187
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,416
- BABEI!
- BASHI!

188
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
- BADEI!
- BAI!

189
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,791
- All: WE ARE THE BA BROTHERS!
BEHOLD WE FIVE!

190
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,833
- YEAH, THAT'S TELLING 'EM
WHO YOU ARE, BOSSES!

191
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,208
- YOU'RE SCARED NOW, RIGHT?

192
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,458
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
THE SHEER POWER OF OUR LEADERS

193
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,041
AND THAT THERE'S FIVE OF 'EM,
CAN YOU?

194
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,375
- Man: BEG ALL YOU WANT,
YOUR LIVES END HERE!

195
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,416
- THEY'RE SO UGLY.

196
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,916
- SHE CLEARLY CANNOT APPRECIATE
THE FACT THAT WE ARE

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,958
THE TRUE EMBODIMENT OF POWER!

198
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,166
- All: AT HER OWN FOOLISH PERIL!

199
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,750
- AND THEY'RE STUPID, TOO.
- All: MMM-HMM.

200
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:36,541
- WHAT? SHE DARES TO MOCK US?
- WHAT NOW?

201
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,416
WELL, WE CAN'T JUST GO ALL
CRAZY ON THESE GUYS.

202
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,791
I THINK WE SHOULD START
WITH THE ONES IN FRONT.

203
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,125
- RESTRAIN YOUR URGE
TO USE CHANNELING.

204
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,958
WE DON'T WANT A BLOODY MESS
ON OUR HANDS.

205
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,666
- AS MUCH AS I
HATE USING SWORDS,

206
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,375
I GUESS YOU HAVE A POINT.

207
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,250
ALL RIGHT THEN. COME ON.

208
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,875
- WELL, BROTHER?
- I KNOW.

209
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,916
BASH IN THEIR HEADS!

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,541
- ( men shouting )

211
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,166
- IF PART OF MY BURDEN AS ALKAID

212
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,791
MEANS I HAVE TO WIPE OUT
SCUM LIKE THIS, SO BE IT.

213
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,000
AND, I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO
WHAT I CAN TO SAVE THE EMPIRE

214
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,166
FROM OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL WALLS.

215
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,458
- LADY.

216
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,791
- I'M HONORED TO TRAVEL
WITH YOU, MY LORD.

217
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,833
- IGNORE THE NAYSAYERS.

218
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,250
I WILL HAVE YOUR HAND
BEFORE TOO LONG.

219
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,208
- YES.

220
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,708
- ( gurgling )

221
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,666
- LORD KEIRO.

222
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,583
I GIVE YOU ALL I HAVE,
MY ONLY CHILD,

223
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,250
IN HOPES SHE CAN
SERVE YOU IN YOUR GOAL.

224
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,000
- IT'S FOR THE BEST. FOR HER.

225
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,000
- Taiga: KEIRO IS NOT HERE
WITH HIS BLESSING?

226
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,125
- MY LORD, GENERAL KEIRO
SENDS HIS BLESSING

227
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,333
BUT THOUGHT IT BEST
THAT YOU ANNOUNCE

228
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,708
THE GOOD NEWS
OF YOUR ENGAGEMENT

229
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,583
WITHOUT THE FATHER OF THE BRIDE
OVER YOUR SHOULDER,

230
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,041
THUS HE REMAINS INSIDE.

231
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,708
- I SEE.
I ADMIRE HIS THOUGHTFULNESS.

232
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,833
- HE'S NOT HERE.

233
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,250
- IN THE GENERAL'S STEAD,

234
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,541
I AM HONORED TO OFFER
MY SERVICES AS YOUR GUARDIAN.

235
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,750
- YES. AND YOU ARE
WITH THE XUAN LANG PLATOON?

236
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,625
- I AM. MY NAME IS KOCHO,
MY LORD.

237
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,000
- DO WELL
TO KEEP US SAFE, KOCHO.

238
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,541
- I WILL DEFEND YOUR LIVES
WITH MY OWN. I SWEAR.

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,833
- Tokaku: HIS MAJESTY
DOES APPEAR EMBOLDENED.

240
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,708
- Ryusho: BUT, KEIRO BECOMING
PART OF THE ROYAL FAMILY

241
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,083
DOES NOT BODE WELL
FOR THE EMPIRE.

242
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,291
- OUR HAND MAY BE FORCED
TO BECKON HIM TO RETURN

243
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,666
FROM LIAN TONG.

244
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,666
TO HOLD TIGHT THE REINS
ON KEIRO'S AMBITIOUS LUST.

245
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,875
- DOES HE LIVE BY OUR WHIM?

246
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,333
BANISHED SO MANY YEARS AGO
BY THE SAME ONES WHO WOULD NOW

247
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,791
BEG HIM RETURN?

248
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,708
- HE WAS REMOVED
FROM THE CAPITAL IN THE INTEREST

249
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,333
OF PRESERVING HIS VERY LIFE!

250
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,208
- I AM WELL AWARE OF THAT FACT.

251
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,166
BUT HIS RETURN WOULD
INCREASE THE SCHISM

252
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,833
NOW PRESENT
IN THE COURT.

253
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,458
WHAT'S MORE...

254
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,375
IT ENSURES THE CLASH
BETWEEN THE STARS.

255
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,000
- RIDICULOUS.
THE CELESTIAL DEITIES NEVER

256
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,041
INHABIT THE EARTH
CONTEMPORANEOUSLY.

257
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,208
- DUBHE'S VESSEL IS AMONG US.
IT'S GENERAL KEIRO.

258
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,708
- KEIRO? THIS CANNOT BE.

259
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,500
- KEIRO'S DESIGNS ON POWER
ARE THE MANIFESTATIONS

260
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,666
OF DUBHE'S BLOODY KARMA.

261
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,958
- ( cymbals clashing )

262
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,541
- SURELY GENERAL TOKAKU
SEES THE FOLLY

263
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,000
IN CHALLENGING YOUR WISHES.

264
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,791
YOUR DESIRES WILL INDEED
BE MADE FLESH.

265
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,041
CONTROL OF THE EMPIRE IS YOURS.

266
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,583
- WHAT OF ALKAID?

267
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,166
HE STILL HIDES, YES?

268
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,416
- THE SEARCH FOR ALKAID'S VESSEL
IS STILL AFOOT, MY LORD,

269
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,375
BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN LOCATED.

270
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,250
MY DEEPEST APOLOGIES.

271
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,291
- SEIZING CONTROL
OF THIS EMPIRE IS BUT MERELY

272
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,250
ONE STEP IN MY PLAN.

273
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,916
IT IS NOT THE TERMINUS
FOR MY AMBITION.

274
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,250
- YES, MY LORD.

275
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,166
- IS THERE SOMETHING
TROUBLING YOU, YOUR LORDSHIP?

276
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,083
- NOTHING.
IT IS OF NO MATTER.

277
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,291
- ( laughing )

278
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,458
WERE YOU HOPING TO FIND
TAITO IN THE CROWD?

279
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,500
- MY DEAR BELOVED CERTAINLY
DOES KNOW WELL MY HEART.

280
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,666
I FEEL MY MEETING WITH TAITO
THAT DAY HAS LEFT ME

281
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,375
A MAN TRANSFORMED.

282
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,041
FOR THAT SERVICE,
I OWE HIM MY GRATITUDE.

283
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,875
YOU FIND THAT ODD?

284
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,916
- NO. IF YOU FEEL THIS WAY
YOU SHOULD BY ALL MEANS

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,375
SHARE IT WITH HIM.

286
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,833
- I THOUGHT
I MIGHT FIND YOU HERE.

287
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,708
- AH, SO YOU'VE RETURNED.

288
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,458
HAS THE BANQUET CONCLUDED?

289
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,750
- IT HAS AND QUITE
ABRUPTLY IN FACT.

290
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,208
I WAS NOT COMPELLED
TO PARTICIPATE

291
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,166
IN THE SUBSEQUENT SPECTACLE.

292
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,500
- WHAT SPECTACLE?

293
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,375
- THE CAVALCADE CELEBRATING
OUR DIVINE EMPEROR'S

294
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,250
UPCOMING MARRIAGE
TO KEIRO'S DAUGHTER TAKI.

295
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,958
IT WAS JUST NOW ANNOUNCED.

296
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,125
PERHAPS WE SHOULD ENJOY
THE WARM SUN OUTSIDE.

297
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,750
- HEY LOOK!
- THE SUN IS BEING SWALLOWED UP.

298
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,750
- THE END IS UPON US!

299
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,291
- ( all screaming )

300
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,416
- TAKI!

301
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,208
ARE YOU INJURED, MY LADY?

302
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,125
- NO, I'M FINE.

303
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,000
- MY LORD, LADY TAKI,
ARE EITHER OF YOU HARMED?

304
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,083
- WE ARE SHAKEN BUT UNINJURED.

305
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,416
WHAT IS THIS?

306
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,833
- ( laughing )

307
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,291
EVEN HEAVEN HAS BENT TO MY WILL!

308
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,833
ALKAID, YOUR LIGHT TOO
SHALL FALL VICTIM TO MY SHADOW!

309
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,458
- WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING?

310
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,000
- MY PEOPLE BE CALM!
DO NOT FEAR!

311
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,583
WE MUST NOT BE AFRAID.

312
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,000
WE MUST SHOW RESOLVE AND
CONFIDENCE IN TIMES OF DANGER,

313
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,583
NOT PANIC AND CONFUSION.

314
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,208
THE SKIES MAY DARKEN AND
THE HEAVENS MAY FALL UPON US,

315
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,333
BUT YOUR EMPEROR IS HERE
TO BE YOUR SHEPHERD.

316
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,583
WHATEVER WICKEDNESS MAY COME,
I WILL PROTECT MY PEOPLE!

317
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,541
- ( gasping )

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,166
- IT'S HIM.

319
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,375
- BEHOLD! THE SUN'S LIGHT
HAS BEEN RESTORED!

320
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,541
SO TOO SHALL THE GLORIOUS LIGHT
OF THE XIAN EMPIRE

321
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,250
BE RESTORED ANEW!

322
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,750
WE SHALL EMERGE
FROM THE DARKNESS

323
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,791
AND SHINE WITH THE BRILLIANCE
OF A THOUSAND SUNS!

324
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,000
- ( crowd cheering )

325
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,125
- Man 1: LONG LIVE
THE PRINCE OF HEAVEN!

326
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,625
- Man 2: HEAR, HEAR!
LONG LIVE EMPEROR TAIGA!

327
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,375
- THIS IS THE FIRST
YOU'VE LAID EYES ON HIM.

328
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,208
THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE BEEN IN
THE PRESENCE OF EMPEROR TAIGA,

329
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,541
DIVINE RULER OF THE XIAN EMPIRE.

330
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,000
- THE EMPEROR, TAIGA.

331
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,875
THE RESEMBLANCE IS UNCANNY.
BUT WHAT CAN THIS MEAN?

332
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,250
- Laila: OH MY GOSH,
THAT WAS SO SCARY.

333
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,708
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT
GET DARK LIKE THAT

334
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,916
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

335
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,833
I THOUGHT THE WORLD
WAS COMING TO AN END.

336
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,666
- SURELY IT'S AN OMEN
OF SOME KIND.

337
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,541
A SIGN OF A MAJOR CHANGE
ON THE HORIZON.

338
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,583
- Both: NOTHING SEEMS
TO BE HAPPENING SO FAR.

339
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,666
- ( grunting )

340
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,375
- ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN
MERCILESS KILLERS

341
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,500
DEFEATED BY
THESE FIVE INSECTS?

342
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,791
- OH. WOW, ARE YOU GUYS
STILL HERE?

343
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,708
- YEAH, I PRETTY MUCH FORGOT
ABOUT THOSE GUYS.

344
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,750
- PERHAPS WE NEED
TO REMIND YOU WHO WE ARE!

345
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,208
- All: BUT THIS MEMORY
WILL SURELY BE YOUR LAST.

346
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,416
- ( grunting )

347
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,666
- I CAN HANDLE THESE CLOWNS.

348
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,916
- ( screaming )

349
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,041
- BABEI, BADEI, BASHI, BAI!

350
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,458
- FROM FIVE DOWN TO ONE!

351
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,958
I'LL SPARE YOUR LIFE

352
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,083
IF YOU PROMISE YOU'LL CHANGE
YOUR WAYS FROM HERE ON OUT!

353
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,250
- ( grunting )

354
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,416
YOU MAY HAVE BESTED
MY YOUNGER BROTHERS.

355
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,208
THEY MATCHED MY HANDSOME LOOKS
BUT NOT MY SKILL IN BATTLE!

356
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,166
( grunting )

357
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,666
WHAT? HOW COULD YOU STOP
MY UNRIVALED AND FLAWLESS ATTACK

358
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,625
WITH JUST ONE SWORD?

359
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,000
- JUST WORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!

360
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,666
- NICE TRY, KID!

361
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,208
( laughing )

362
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,750
BUT I WIN!

363
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,458
- OH YEAH?
- YOUR SWORD'S GONE. I WIN!

364
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,125
- I DON'T NEED TO USE
A SWORD OR CHANNELING!

365
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,875
- ( groaning in pain )

366
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,458
- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A WORK-WITH-MY-HANDS

367
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,625
KIND OF GUY!

368
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,208
- ARE YOU SOME KIND OF MONSTER?
- YOU WANT TO FIND OUT?

369
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:16,541
- NO! NO, SIR!
- VERY WELL DONE, MY FRIEND!

370
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,666
- Laila: THAT WAS GREAT!
- OH HEY, THANKS.

371
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,958
- ( Baei grunting )

372
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,291
- OH MAN, ARE THERE
MORE OF THEM?

373
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,041
- I'LL GO LOOK.

374
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,083
- DON'T JUST RUN OFF, TAITO!

375
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,083
- WE'VE GOT COMPANY!
- THESE GUYS SEEM GOOD.

376
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,500
- NOTHING LIKE THAT
BAND OF MISFITS

377
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,208
WE DISPATCHED
WITH EARLIER.

378
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,166
- ( gasping )

379
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,458
- THAT FLAG.

380
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,458
- SO YOU'RE BACK.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

381
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,041
- FATHER!

382
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,958
( crying )

383
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,000
- ARE YOU WELL, DAUGHTER?
- I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

384
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,625
- SO THAT BADASS OVER THERE
IS YOU GUYS' OLD MAN?

385
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,833
- HE IS A GREAT MAN.
LEADER OF THE QING LONG.

386
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,458
- AND GOOD FATHER.

387
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,500
- HEY THERE.
- MASTER.

388
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,875
- Soei: TAITO.

389
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,750
- I'M BACK.

390
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,750
- YES.

391
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,541
- YOU SURE HAVE GROWN, TAITO.
- ( laughing ) YEAH?

392
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,125
- ( Japanese song playing )

393
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,750
- Koyo: THE FRESH AIR
OF TAI SHAN IS A BALM

394
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:39,750
TO THE SOUL.

395
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,625
ABATING THE PAIN, AND SADNESS.

396
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:42,500
- Taito: THIS WHOLE
THING HAS BEEN LIKE

397
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,250
SOME CRAZY DREAM I HAD.

398
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,250
TO GO FROM THE CAPITAL
TO BEING BACK HERE AT HOME

399
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,500
WITH YOU.

400
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,000
- Laila: WHAT GREAT NEWS.
ISN'T IT AMAZING?

401
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,291
- Taito: THIS IS MORE LIKE IT.

402
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,916
YOU AND ME
WALKING THE BEAT AGAIN,

403
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,833
MAKING SURE
THAT THERE'S NO TROUBLE.

404
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:58,666
- TAITO. I FEARED THAT THIS DAY
WOULD EVENTUALLY COME TO PASS.

405
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,541
- Koyo: A LIFELONG CLOUD
OF SECRECY IS DISSIPATED.

406
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,916
IN HERO TALES,
"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN,

407
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,291
THE FATHER-SON BOND."

408
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,750
- Laila: IS HE EVER GOING
TO GROW UP AND STOP

409
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,333
BEING SO STUPID?
