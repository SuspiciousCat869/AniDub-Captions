1
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,625
- ( thunder rumbling )

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,375
- CAPTAIN, DARE I ASK WHY
WE SEEM TO BE IN SUCH A RUSH?

3
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:36,166
JUST WHAT EXACTLY IS WAITING
FOR US IN THE CAPITAL?

4
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,541
- THE STARS OF THE GREAT DIPPER
CAST THEIR LIGHT UNEVENLY.

5
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,583
- I TAKE THAT TO MEAN
SOMETHING IS AMISS?

6
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,000
- INDEED, THERE IS.

7
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,541
THE FIERCE, WARLIKE TWO
STAND OUT AMONG THEIR BRETHREN

8
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,375
IN THE HEAVENS TONIGHT.

9
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,666
IF I READ THE SKY CORRECTLY,

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,458
ALKAID AND DUBHE STAND ON
THE VERGE OF BATTLE.

11
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,583
THAT BEING THE CASE,
I HAVE A DUTY TO FULFILL.

12
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,208
AS DOES EACH ONE OF THE FIVE.

13
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,791
COME NOW.
LET'S MEET OUR FATE HEAD ON.

14
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,958
- ( theme song playing )

15
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,166
- KEIRO!

16
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,333
CAN HE...
CAN HE REALLY BE MY FATHER?

17
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,541
- DIE, BASTARD!

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,375
- IF YOU INTEND TO KILL MY LORD,

19
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,250
YOU'D BETTER BE PREPARED
TO DEAL WITH ME FIRST.

20
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,375
FIRE!

21
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,041
- YOU CALL THIS A FIGHT?
COME ON.

22
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,000
GET DOWN HERE
AND FACE ME LIKE A WARRIOR.

23
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,083
- WE'RE OFFICIALLY
OUT OF OUR DEPTH HERE.

24
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,000
I SAY WE RETREAT AND LIVE TO
FIGHT MOUSTACHE ANOTHER DAY.

25
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,541
- HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

26
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,416
- RYUKO. THE PARADISE CAVE.

27
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,791
WE'RE NOT VERY FAR
FROM THERE, ARE WE?

28
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,916
- NO, WE'RE NOT.

29
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,708
NOW. THIS MIGHT BE
OUR ONLY CHANCE OF ESCAPE.

30
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,916
- ( panting )

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,041
- THERE'S THE ENTRANCE.

32
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,958
- THEY'RE FLEEING INTO
PARADISE CAVE. DON'T LOSE THEM.

33
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,166
- ( shouting )

34
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,500
- DON'T WORRY.

35
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,583
I'LL BE COMING BACK
FOR YOU, MOUSTACHE.

36
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,375
MY BUSINESS WITH YOU
IS NOWHERE NEAR OVER.

37
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,500
- HURRY UP.

38
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,958
- DAMN IT! THE BASTARDS
HAVE SEALED THE ENTRANCE.

39
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,916
- ( grunting )

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,541
- JUMP ACROSS! LET'S GO!

41
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,166
RANK COWARDS.
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

42
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,250
- LEAVE THEM.

43
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,041
A LARGE FORCE WILL
ONLY SLOW US DOWN.

44
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,208
YOU AND I SHOULD BE
MORE THAN SUFFICIENT.

45
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,708
- BUT, SIR, THE PARADISE CAVE
IS NOTORIOUSLY TREACHEROUS.

46
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,750
I CAN'T GUARANTEE
WE WON'T GET LOST.

47
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,625
- HOWEVER LABYRINTHINE
OUR PASSAGE MAY BE,

48
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,958
IF FATE DECREES IT,
WE WILL FIND THEM.

49
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,083
- ( chuckling )

50
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,416
MY MOST SINCERE APOLOGIES.

51
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,000
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE TROUBLE
I MUST'VE CAUSED YOU.

52
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,291
BUT, THERE AGAIN,

53
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,791
LEARNING YOU'VE GOT
A WANTED MAN IN YOUR MIDST

54
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,375
IS A BIT PETRIFYING.

55
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,875
I COULD BUT WATCH
HELPLESSLY AS HE FLED.

56
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,458
- FORGIVE ME FOR NOT BEING
ABLE TO THINK YOU A COWARD.

57
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,625
- HOW KIND.
LOOKS DO DECEIVE, THOUGH.

58
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,500
STRIP AWAY THE GRUFF
EXTERIOR AND AT HEART

59
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,125
I'M A MEWLING CHILD.

60
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,166
NIGHT AIR IS BAD FOR THE SKIN.
I SUGGEST YOU TAKE YOUR LEAVE.

61
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,416
- ( scoffs )

62
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,416
- YOU'LL REGRET THIS, PRIEST.
I SWEAR.

63
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,916
- I'M SURE I WILL.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,500
- SHOULD I NOT HAVE, THEN?
I'M CONFUSED.

65
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,333
LADY CHOKA WISHED
TO QUELL A PLOT AGAINST ME.

66
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,708
HOW COULD I NOT ACQUIESCE?

67
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,875
- INDEED, HIGHNESS.
DID SHE DESCRIBE THIS PLOT?

68
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,583
- WELL, NOT EXACTLY, NO.

69
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,750
I GAVE CONSENT FOOLISHLY,
DIDN'T I?

70
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,500
- TROUBLE YOURSELF NOT,
YOUR MAJESTY.

71
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,125
YOU'VE DONE NO WRONG.

72
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,291
- YES, WELL. IF YOU SAY SO.

73
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,750
- THAT WAS CLOSE.
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO SCARED.

74
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,208
- WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF FOR NOW.

75
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:39,541
- SO, I'M GUESSING THIS CAVE
WAS MADE BY PEOPLE, AM I RIGHT?

76
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,958
- VERY GOOD.
PARADISE CAVE WAS ACTUALLY

77
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,958
CARVED OUT
OVER A PERIOD OF CENTURIES

78
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,291
BY ASCETICS
FROM THE TONG YO SHRINE.

79
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,250
THEY USED IT
AS A TRAINING GROUND.

80
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,166
MONKS OF THE ORDER
HAVE KNOWN ITS LAYOUT BY HEART

81
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,416
FOR GENERATIONS.

82
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,708
- SO, KEIRO'S GOONS
ARE SURE TO GET LOST.

83
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,166
AND OUR SIDE'S
THE ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS

84
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,791
ALL OF THE SECRET EXITS?

85
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,291
- THAT'S THE IDEA.

86
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,458
HERE WE ARE.

87
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,541
- KOCHO.
- SIR?

88
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,250
- TAKI'S BIRTHDAY
IS APPROACHING.

89
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,666
- AH. SO IT IS, MY LORD.
SO IT IS.

90
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,916
- WHAT'S MORE?
THE AGE IS ALMOST UPON HER

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,500
WHEN SHE COULD MAKE THE
EMPEROR AN EXCELLENT WIFE.

92
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,625
AN ENCOURAGING THOUGHT,
IS IT NOT?

93
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,750
- QUITE, MY LORD.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,083
- AGES AGO, I HAD A CHILD.

95
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,083
- YOU DID, SIR? YOU HAD
A CHILD OF YOUR OWN?

96
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,208
SO, WHAT BECAME OF THEM?

97
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,833
- I CHOSE TO LEAVE HIM
TO HIS FATE WHILE DOGGEDLY

98
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,375
PURSUING MY OWN.

99
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,458
- YOU WHAT?
- I DID SO OUT OF NECESSITY.

100
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:52,083
I FELT A SAPLING AT HEEL
WOULD ONLY ENCUMBER MY PROGRESS.

101
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,208
IF HE STILL LIVES,
HE DOES SO AT DESTINY'S WHIM.

102
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,250
- YOUR MASTER,
DO YOU THINK HE'S ALRIGHT?

103
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,666
- AH, THE OLD MAN'S GOT
A FEW TRICKS UP HIS SLEEVE.

104
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,875
- WHAT A GREAT GUY.

105
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,250
YOU CERTAINLY DON'T MEET
PEOPLE LIKE THAT EVERY DAY.

106
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,583
NOT THAT MINE'S A SLOUCH
OR ANYTHING.

107
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,000
BUT YOU ARE PRETTY LUCKY
TO HAVE HIM AS A DAD.

108
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,666
- YEAH.

109
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,958
- DON'T FRET.
YOU COME FROM GOOD STOCK.

110
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,833
QUITE GOOD.
THE ONLY SON OF MY LORD KEIRO.

111
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,750
- NO. I WON'T BELIEVE IT.

112
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,291
- OH, YEAH.
THAT'S JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

113
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,291
- SO, IF WE LEAVE YOU
TO DEAL WITH KEIRO

114
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,541
ALL ON YOUR OWN,

115
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,708
THE QUESTION BECOMES,

116
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,375
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO HANDLE HIS ARMY?

117
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,833
- THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
CONSIDERING HOW HUGE IT IS.

118
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,083
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

119
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,916
HOW DOES A GUY LIKE HIM
GET SO MANY FOLLOWERS?

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,208
- BEST THING FOR US
TO DO RIGHT NOW

121
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,750
IS FIND THE REST OF THE FIVE.

122
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,916
I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE
WE CAN TAKE ON

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,666
THE WHOLE XUAN LONG PLATOON.

124
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,041
- THE FIVE?

125
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,458
- YEAH. WE GET ALL THE DIVINE
WARRIORS IN ON THIS

126
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,000
AND WE MIGHT HAVE A SHOT.

127
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,708
- ALL FIVE OF THEM
FIGHTING ON THE SAME SIDE?

128
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,750
- THAT'D BE GREAT!
- YEAH. SWEET, HUH?

129
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,541
- FIVE AGAINST
AN IMPERIAL REGIMENT?

130
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,125
- I DON'T KNOW.
- IT WON'T WORK?

131
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,208
- WELL, TO BEGIN WITH,

132
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,208
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT THE OTHER TWO

133
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,375
WILL JOIN OUR SIDE.

134
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,250
THEIR POLITICS AREN'T
NECESSARILY OURS.

135
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,166
THE FIVE ONLY HAVE
ONE DUTY TO FULFILL.

136
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,416
BUT, DON'T YOU WORRY.

137
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,416
AT THE VERY LEAST,
I CAN PERSONALLY GUARANTEE

138
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,708
THAT THE THREE OF US HERE
WOULD NEVER THINK

139
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,291
OF TURNING AGAINST YOU.

140
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,791
RIGHT, RYUKO?

141
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,375
- OKAY, WHAT EXACTLY
IS HIS PROBLEM?

142
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,875
- ( whispering ) KEIRO. KEIRO.

143
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,625
( screaming )

144
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,000
- ( grunting )

145
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,791
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
SERIOUSLY.

146
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,625
- SORRY. I WAS A BIT
PREOCCUPIED THERE.

147
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,666
- WHAT'S THE DEAL?
THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU.

148
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,750
- MUST I APOLOGIZE AGAIN?

149
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,208
- WATCH IT.

150
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,125
NICE ONE. REALLY.

151
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,625
- AH, OUR EXIT ISN'T FAR NOW.

152
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,041
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

153
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,208
- ( all gasp )

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,333
- THING IS HUGE.

155
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,041
- ( loud rumbling )

156
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,000
- THAT SOUND. WHAT'S GOING ON?

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,333
- ( all gasp )

158
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,375
- RYUKO!

159
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,833
- RYUKO! TAITO!

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,583
- ANOTHER CLOSE ONE.

161
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,333
YOU ASLEEP ON YOUR FEET?
COME ON.

162
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,125
- THAT'S IT. I DON'T CARE
IF YOU ARE "PREOCCUPIED".

163
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,458
SNAP THE HELL OUTTA YOUR MOOD

164
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,708
BEFORE SOMEBODY
REALLY GETS HURT.

165
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,750
DON'T GLARE AT ME!

166
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,166
- WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY

167
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,166
IS THAT IF YOU DON'T
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER,

168
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,083
WHAT KINDA HOPE
DO WE HAVE AS A TEAM?

169
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,625
I MEAN, I KNOW
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

170
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,625
THE ONLY REAL CHANCE WE'VE GOT
OF DEFEATING MOUSTACHE...

171
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,041
- STOP PATRONIZING ME!

172
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,500
- RYUKO.

173
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,583
- THE DIVINE WARRIORS
ARE NOT ALKAID'S SERVANTS.

174
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,083
LEAST OF ALL, ME.

175
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,500
AND DON'T THINK
ME AN ALLY JUST BECAUSE

176
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,458
I'M ALONG FOR THE JOURNEY.

177
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,833
IT'S NOTHING MORE
THAN A ROLE TO PLAY.

178
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,666
- SO WHAT?
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE?

179
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,750
- TRUTH BE TOLD.
SINCE I'VE MET YOU,

180
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,916
MY LIFE HAS BEEN
IN COMPLETE SHAMBLES.

181
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,083
THANKS TO YOU,

182
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,333
I AM NOW THE ENEMY
OF AN IMPERIAL GENERAL.

183
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,666
I'VE HAD TO FLEE THE TEMPLE.

184
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,750
MY HOME.

185
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,000
IF NOT FOR YOU,

186
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:31,208
I MIGHT HAVE HAD
SOMETHING LIKE A NORMAL LIFE.

187
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:36,166
- ( chuckling )

188
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,750
DON'T HOLD BACK, MIZAR.
SPEAK YOUR MIND.

189
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,708
INDEED, THE MORE YOU LET FLY,
THE MORE RIVETED I BECOME.

190
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,458
- YOU MEAN THAT? REALLY?

191
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,250
- NO, I...

192
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,916
I LASHED OUT.
MY MIND'S IN A FOG.

193
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,750
- FORGIVE ME.
- A FOG?

194
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,458
- ( rumbling )

195
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,666
- NOT AGAIN.
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

196
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,833
- IT'S GETTING CLOSER!

197
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,000
- IT'S MOUSTACHE!
- BUT HOW?

198
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,291
HOW DID HE FIND US?

199
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,625
- SO, THE HEAVENS DO CALL
FOR BLOOD TONIGHT.

200
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,083
YOU OUGHT TO BE PLEASED.

201
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,500
I'VE COME TO FACE YOU
LIKE A WARRIOR.

202
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,708
- WE HAVE NO CHOICE NOW.
HE'S FORCING OUR HAND.

203
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,875
- HIS LAPDOGS AREN'T HERE,
THOUGH, SO I THINK THE ODDS

204
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,541
ARE STACKED IN OUR FAVOR.

205
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,833
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

206
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,708
- YEAH. I'M READY LIKE
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

207
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,458
KEIRO, LET'S GO.

208
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,916
- RINMEI, PROTECT LAILA.
- YOU GOT IT.

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,750
- ALRIGHT.
IT'S THREE AGAINST TWO.

210
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,500
LET'S ATTACK THEM EN MASSE.

211
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,625
- YEAH.

212
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,208
- RYUKO!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

213
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,250
- YES!

214
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,583
- ( grunting )

215
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,250
- HOSEI!

216
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,500
- TAITO!

217
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,916
- YOU'RE DEALING WITH ME, BOY.

218
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,000
AH, AN OUTER RESERVOIR.

219
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,791
AS OBSOLETE A SKILL
AS THEY COME THESE DAYS.

220
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:28,916
- WHAT?

221
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,041
- ( grunting )

222
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,291
- JERK! THAT WAS
A DAMN CHEAP TRICK

223
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,625
YOU PLAYED ON HOSEI.

224
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,875
- SUCH IS OUR FATE.

225
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,166
I STAND HERE WITHOUT
THE AID OF MY SOLDIERS

226
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,708
AND, YOU, WITHOUT
THE AID OF YOUR FRIENDS.

227
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,166
DESTINY ALLOTS US NO BULWARK
IN THIS FIGHT, SAVE OUR FISTS.

228
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,500
COME, ALKAID.

229
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,541
BEDECK MY GLORIOUS ASCENSION
IN YOUR BLOOD!

230
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,791
- SHUT UP.

231
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,500
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S GOING TO BLEED!

232
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,541
- OH, NO.

233
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,875
- I FEEL IT.

234
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,708
ALKAID AND DUBHE
ARE ABOUT TO GO AT IT FULL ON.

235
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,250
- YOU'VE MANAGED
SOME DEGREE OF CONTROL

236
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,625
OVER YOUR INNER RESERVOIR.

237
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,416
COMMENDABLE.

238
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,583
- I'M FULL OF SURPRISES,
AREN'T I?

239
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,625
- NO. DON'T DO IT.

240
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,000
- RYUKO, WHY DID YOU HESITATE?

241
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,166
- HOW COULD YOU?

242
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,916
YOU AND YOUR FORCE'S SUBMISSION
TO THIS WARMONGERING TRAITOR

243
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,041
CASTS A PALL OVER
THE EMPEROR'S GOOD NAME.

244
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,791
- YOU SEE, BUT, DARKLY.

245
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,500
WHAT MATTERS THE EMPEROR'S
NAME IF THE EMPIRE DIES?

246
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,875
HIS LORDSHIP KEIRO
IS THIS LAND'S LAST,

247
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,500
BEST HOPE FOR SURVIVAL!

248
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,291
- UNLIKE YOU,
I DON'T NEED TRICKS.

249
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,458
THE ONLY THING I NEED

250
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,291
TO SEND YOU STRAIGHT
TO HELL IS MY FIST.

251
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,166
- ALKAID!

252
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,958
- ( screaming )

253
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,041
- IF KEIRO REALLY IS MY FATHER,

254
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,500
THIS ISN'T MERELY A CLASH
BETWEEN TWO CELESTIAL DEITIES.

255
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,666
IT'S A FIGHT BETWEEN
MY CLOSEST FRIEND

256
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,250
AND MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD.

257
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,000
- ALKAID, HAVE YOU EVEN
THE FAINTEST NOTION

258
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,750
OF WHY SOMEONE OF MY ILK

259
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,375
CONDESCENDS TO FIGHT LIKE THIS?

260
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,791
POWER, YOU FOOL.

261
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,458
A MAN'S WORTH IS MEASURED
IN VOLUMES OF BLOOD SPILT,

262
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,833
OF LIVES DEVOURED.

263
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:06,000
FOR HE WHO WOULD RULE THE WORLD
MUST FIRST SEE THE WISDOM

264
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,083
OF ABSOLUTE CRUELTY.

265
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,000
- OH, YEAH? WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING

266
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,291
ABOUT BEING A MAN.

267
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,500
WHAT GOOD IS POWER
IF IT MAKES YOU A SAVAGE?

268
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,458
- SIMPLE, IMPUDENT VERMIN!

269
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,916
I AM THE TOLL THIS LAND
MUST PAY FOR PEACE.

270
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,791
- FOR PEACE?

271
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,000
- AND IF SAVAGERY BE THE MANTEL
I MUST DON TO SECURE

272
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,500
THE PEOPLE'S FORTUNE,

273
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,750
SO BE IT!

274
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,500
- TAITO!

275
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,333
- FEAR NOT.

276
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,083
THE WARRIORS I'VE SLAIN
SURVIVE WITHIN ME.

277
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,916
THEIRS IS THE STRENGTH
BY WHICH I WILL LEAD

278
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,250
THIS EMPIRE TO PEACE.

279
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,375
- THEY'RE NOTHING MORE
THAN SACRIFICIAL LAMBS TO YOU.

280
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,291
- ONLY WHEN I'M ATOP THE THRONE,

281
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,166
WILL THE FALLEN TRULY HAVE REST.

282
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,958
- TO HELL WITH YOU.

283
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,291
- IN YOUR PLACE,

284
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,083
I WOULD COUNT MYSELF PROUD
TO BE SUCH A SACRIFICE.

285
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,000
- TO HELL WITH YOU!

286
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,500
( screaming )

287
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,416
- OH, NO. ALKAID'S POWER
HAS TAKEN THE REINS.

288
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,000
- DIE, ALKAID!

289
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,416
- ( Laila screaming ) TAITO!

290
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,125
WAKE UP!
COME ON, YOU GOTTA WAKE UP.

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,833
- ( shouting )

292
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,166
RINMEI! HOSEI!

293
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,708
GET TAITO AND LAILA
OUT OF HERE NOW!

294
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,291
I'LL STAY AND FEND OFF KEIRO.

295
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,708
- NO, DON'T.
- RYUKO, YOU CAN'T.

296
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,875
- GO!

297
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,666
- WAIT, PLEASE. NO!
- FAREWELL, RYUKO.

298
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,958
- THAT HAS TO BE THEM.

299
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,083
- THROW THOSE PEOPLE A LIFELINE,
IMMEDIATELY.

300
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,791
- FAREWELL, TAITO.

301
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,166
IF SUCH IS YOUR VERDICT,
I AM PREPARED TO DIE.

302
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,666
DO AS YOU WILL.

303
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,916
- YOU WOULD FORFEIT YOUR
OWN LIFE FOR THEIR SAKE?

304
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,625
QUITE AN ADMIRABLE TRAIT,
I HAVE TO ADMIT.

305
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,500
MY LORD, I BEG YOU
TO SHOW THIS MAN CLEMENCY.

306
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,750
- YOU BEG ON BEHALF
OF THE ENEMY?

307
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,791
MY LORD, THIS MAN
SHOULD BE EXECUTED.

308
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,666
- A WORD WITH YOU, SIR?
IF I MAY.

309
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,041
- WHAT?
- DOCTOR, YOU'RE...

310
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,250
- FORGIVE MY INTRUSION,
YOUR LORDSHIP.

311
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,458
- SHOKAKU,
WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS?

312
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,791
- I HAVE COME HERE TO PLEA
FOR THIS YOUNG MAN'S LIFE.

313
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,958
HIS ACTIONS WERE COMMITTED
AT THE BEHEST OF FATE,

314
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,333
NOT BY HIMSELF, PER SE.

315
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,083
NOR NEED HE BE AN ENEMY.

316
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,125
AS A DIVINE WARRIOR,

317
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,833
HIS ONLY NECESSARY ROLE
IN THIS LIFE

318
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,416
IS TO ACT AS A LEVEE.

319
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,375
AND IF I MAY BE SO BOLD, SIR,

320
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,000
THAT IS ALL
ANY OF US REALLY ARE.

321
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,083
- ( gasps )

322
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,041
- YOU, YOU'RE ONE OF US.

323
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,541
ONE OF THE FIVE.

324
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,666
- MY STAR IS ALIOTH. THE WISE.

325
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,500
AND IF IT PLEASES YOU,
MY FIRST DUTY IS TO THE EMPIRE.

326
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,166
NEITHER TO DUBHE NOR TO ALKAID.

327
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,875
I WILL DO ANYTHING
TO SEE THE LAND THRIVE.

328
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,583
WHATEVER THE COST,
WHATEVER THE SACRIFICE.

329
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,875
AND, I KNOW
IN MY HEART OF HEARTS,

330
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,291
FROM THE FIRE IN HIS EYES

331
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,291
AS I SAY THIS NOW,
MY FRIEND WOULD AVOW THE SAME.

332
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:58,000
BEFORE YOU METE OUT PUNISHMENT,
CONSIDER THAT CLOSELY, LORD.

333
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,916
WOULDN'T YOU PREFER INSTEAD
HAVING MIZAR AND I

334
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,666
AT YOUR BECK AND CALL?

335
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,333
- AM I THEN TO CLING
TO KEIRO'S HEEL?

336
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,458
- ( laughs ) WELL SAID, DOCTOR.

337
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,875
- ABSURD.
MUST WE BEFRIEND A FOE?

338
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,916
LENIENCY INVITES DISASTER.
HE IS OUR SWORN ENEMY!

339
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,958
- I BELIEVE THE OLD ADAGE IS,

340
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,916
"KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE,
KEEP YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER."

341
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,416
RYUKO, HAVEN'T YOU
ANYTHING TO SAY?

342
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,291
- ANSWER ME THIS.
WHILE TRADING BLOWS WITH TAITO,

343
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,875
YOU AVERRED TO BRING
PEACE AND PROSPERITY

344
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,958
TO THIS LAND.

345
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,083
DO YOU STILL?

346
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,000
- YES.

347
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,583
- RYUKO.

348
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,333
- ( Japanese song playing )

349
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,208
- Koyo: HE TURNS AROUND,
BUT HIS FRIEND

350
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,791
NO LONGER REMAINS.

351
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,333
- WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
PROTECTING ONE ANOTHER

352
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:43,458
OUT HERE.

353
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,000
NO ONE IS ALONE!

354
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,333
- ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
IS ACCORDING TO OUR FATE.

355
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,541
RYUKO KNEW THAT.
HE WOULDN'T BLAME YOU.

356
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,833
- I THOUGHT WE WERE
OF THE SAME SPIRIT.

357
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,333
THAT WE COULD COMMUNICATE
WITHOUT WORDS.

358
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:57,541
THE TRUTH IS, I DIDN'T KNOW
HIM AND HE DIDN'T KNOW ME.

359
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,208
- Koyo: NEXT TIME,
ON HERO TALES.

360
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,083
THEIR SHIP SAILS ONWARD.

361
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,708
IN CHAPTER FOURTEEN,
"THE DOU YA CHANGES COURSE."

362
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,500
- Taito: I DON'T WANT TO BE
ALKAID ANY MORE.

363
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,166
I DON'T WANT THIS CURSE.
