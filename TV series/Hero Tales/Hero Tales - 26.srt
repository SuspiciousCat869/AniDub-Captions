1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,250
- ( thunder rumbles )

2
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,083
- WOW! LOOK UP
INTO THE SKY, MASTER.

3
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:31,708
- THE HOUR HAS COME.
ONE SMELLS IT IN THE AIR.

4
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,833
DUBHE AND ALKAID WILL CLASH.

5
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,875
- WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO TAI?

6
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,916
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,916
- SO, UH, NOW WHAT?

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,375
- HA! SURPASSED, MY FOOT!

9
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,541
WHEN THE HELL WERE YOU
EVER PART OF HUMANITY?

10
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,833
- A TRIFLING STEP ON THE
ROAD TO MY DESTINY.

11
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,750
- ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP! WHEN YOU
LOSE COUNT OF ALL THE CORPSES

12
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,125
YOU'VE HAD TO WALK OVER ON THAT
ROAD, I DON'T CALL IT DESTINY!

13
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,625
I CALL IT THE COWARD'S WAY OUT!

14
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,833
- Laila and Hosei together:
TAITO!

15
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,708
- ( laughing )

16
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,833
- EXCELLENT! THE BODY OF
A GOD SUITS ME WELL.

17
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,250
YOU GRAZE ME LIKE
AN AUTUMN BREEZE,

18
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,250
THOUGH THAT IS, PERHAPS,
AN INSULT TO THE SEASON.

19
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,500
- STOP RUNNING YOUR MOUTH!

20
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,166
YOU DIRTY SON OF A...

21
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,416
HE'S NOT JUST SPOUTING OFF.
HE REALLY IS DIFFERENT.

22
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,583
- CAN YOU STILL NOT PERCEIVE?

23
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,291
YOU AND I NOW OCCUPY TWO VASTLY
DISTINCT LEVELS OF EXISTENCE.

24
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,791
- HE'S TRADED LIFE
FOR SHEER POWER.

25
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,333
- Shimei: AN ASTUTE
OBSERVATION, YOUNG LADY.

26
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,375
- YOU COWARD! COME OUT!

27
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,291
- Shimei: BUT I PRACTICALLY
DANCE AT THE CROOK

28
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,791
OF YOUR SHOULDER.

29
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,666
- ( he laughs )

30
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,416
GHASTLY, ISN'T IT?
PERHAPS TO SAY THAT I DANCE

31
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,458
AT THE CROOK OF YOUR SHOULDER
WAS A WEE BIT MISLEADING.

32
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,000
ONE'S METAPHORS PLAY SOMEWHAT
LOOSE IN THE PRESENCE OF A GOD.

33
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,541
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE
UNMITIGATED ATROCITY

34
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,666
OF THIS SPECIMEN.

35
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,625
HORROR FEASTS UPON HORROR,
YOU SEE. SOMETIMES LITERALLY.

36
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,875
NOW ALKAID, BEHOLD THE GOD
THAT CONSUMED EVEN ME.

37
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,083
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU
LEAVING HERE ALIVE!

38
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,000
- ( he laughs )

39
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,000
- SO KEIRO'S CONSUMED HIM?

40
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,541
- HE'S INHUMAN!

41
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,291
- THE LANDSCAPE OF
NIGHTMARE MADE FLESH,

42
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,791
THE HARBINGER OF YOUR
DEMISE REALIZED.

43
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,041
OH, MY BOY.
THE FUN WE'LL HAVE.

44
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,875
- ( thunder rumbles )

45
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,166
- DAMN IT! IS THERE NOTHING
WE CAN DO FOR THEM

46
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,625
IN THEIR HOUR OF NEED?

47
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,458
FOR HEAVENS' SAKE, MY
BROTHER'S IN THE THICK OF IT!

48
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,625
- CALM YOURSELF, YOUR MAJESTY.

49
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,000
YOUR ROLE IN THIS WILL BE AS
EMPEROR ONCE THE WAY IS CLEARED.

50
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,916
- ALAS! ONLY TAITO POSSESSES
THE STRENGTH TO PRY

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,958
KEIRO'S HOLD FROM THIS LAND.

52
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,833
- ( he grunts )

53
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,375
- TAITO! TAITO!
- DAMN IT, NO!

54
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,083
- YOU'RE A DISGRACE
TO THE INFIRM.

55
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,833
TO THINK YOU BEAR THE MARK
OF A WARRIOR GOD.

56
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,750
YOU WHO WHIMPERS
LIKE A BABE.

57
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:51,208
IT SEEMS EVEN THE WRETCHED CAN
STIR A TITAN FROM HIS SLUMBER.

58
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,083
YOUR FATE WAS BUT TO STOKE
THE FIRES OF MY WRATH.

59
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,500
GIVE IT LIFE. HAD YOU NEVER
RISEN TO CHALLENGE ME,

60
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,458
I MIGHT'VE REMAINED AS I WAS.

61
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,291
- Hosei: TAITO!
- Laila: TAITO! NO!

62
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,833
- ( Shimei laughs )

63
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,041
- WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.

64
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,958
I EXPECTED SO MUCH BETTER
OUT OF YOU, DEAR BOY.

65
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,041
- ENOUGH! I'M PUTTING A STOP
TO THIS NOW.

66
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,250
- THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
- NO.

67
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,500
I WON'T LET YOU FIGHT HIM.
YOU'VE GOTTA PROTECT LAILA.

68
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,583
MUSTACHE, BELONGS TO ME.

69
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,833
- TAITO!

70
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,666
- ( whispers ) - RUN AT HIM
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT.

71
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,375
- LAILA?
- YEAH?

72
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:56,166
- I CAN'T KEEP MY PROMISE
TO YOU. FORGIVE ME.

73
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,333
- IS ALKAID PRACTICING
HIS GENUFLECTION?

74
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,375
I MUST SAY, THE ATTITUDE
SUITS YOU BETTER

75
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,291
THAN ONE MIGHT FIRST SUSPECT.

76
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,375
- ( he grunts )

77
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,083
- YOU CHARGE TO YOUR DOOM.

78
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,791
- SHIMEI! LOOK AT ME!

79
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,083
- FOOLISHNESS. THE BODY IN WHICH
HE'S SUBSUMED IS INVIOLATE.

80
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,125
YOU'VE MORE OR LESS
LANCED A BOIL.

81
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,458
- Laila: HOSEI!

82
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,500
- HOSEI.

83
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,333
HOSEI!

84
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,125
- LISTEN TO ME. WE HAVE TO SET
A COURSE FOR LUO CHANG.

85
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,541
I KNOW I'M ESSENTIALLY
POWERLESS TO HELP.

86
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,791
BUT I WILL NOT LUXURIATE WHILE
MY BROTHER WAGERS HIS LIFE.

87
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,375
- PLEASE, YOUR HIGHNESS,
BE REASONABLE.

88
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,291
- NO!

89
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,000
WORDS WILL NOT ASSUAGE ME!

90
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,333
- AT YOUR MAJESTY'S
INSISTENCE, WE MUST COMPLY.

91
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:35,916
- Enki: LIKE HELL WE DO.

92
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,000
- I BEG YOU, FOR THEM!

93
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,458
- MY ORDERS ARE TO ESCORT YOU

94
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,625
AS FAR AWAY FROM
DANGER AS POSSIBLE.

95
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,875
I AM NOT ABOUT TO BREAK RANKS.

96
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,333
WHETHER YOU LIKE THOSE TERMS
OR NOT, YOUR MAJESTY,

97
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,750
THAT IS HOW IT'S GOING TO BE.

98
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:56,458
- LOOK, MY REIGN WAS THAT
OF A FECKLESS SCAPEGOAT

99
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,041
SCARCELY ABLE TO BLEAT.

100
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,875
IF I ABANDON THIS EMPIRE'S
TRUE HEROES NOW,

101
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,958
NOT A SINGLE THING
WILL HAVE CHANGED.

102
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,750
NOT ONE, AND IT WILL ONLY BE
A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE

103
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,541
FOLLOWS KEIRO'S EXAMPLE.

104
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,333
PERHAPS I HAVE NOT THE
MEANS TO MARSHAL AN ARMY.

105
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,666
PERHAPS I HAVEN'T
THE STRENGTH TO FIGHT.

106
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,791
EVEN SO, AT MY PERIL,
I WILL LEAD THE CHARGE!

107
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:35,000
- TURN THE SHIP AROUND. SET
A SWIFT COURSE FOR LU CHONG!

108
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,583
WE SAIL FOR THE CAPITAL!

109
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,000
- ( all cheering )

110
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,750
- YOU HAVE MY THANKS, ENKI.

111
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,958
I WILL APOLOGIZE TO
KOYO ON YOUR BEHALF.

112
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,541
- YEAH, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

113
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,791
- ONLY ONE OF THEM LEFT.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

114
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,166
- ( she growls )

115
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,458
- YOU WERE LOVELY ONCE.

116
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,083
BEFORE KEIRO AND CHOKA
SUNK THEIR TALONS INTO WHAT

117
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,708
WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

118
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,666
COME! I'LL RELEASE YOU.

119
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,791
- RINMEI!

120
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,291
- RYUKO!

121
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,416
- HER POWER'S IMMENSE!

122
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,000
- INDEED. RIVALED ONLY
BY HER MADNESS.

123
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,083
- HOW YOU SCUTTLE TO
ONE ANOTHER'S SIDE.

124
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,166
LIKE SCAVENGERS TO THE BAIT
OF FRESH CARRION.

125
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,666
YOURS IT NOT A GENUINE LOVE!

126
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,958
YOU FEAR TOO MUCH THE
OTHER TO DIE.

127
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,541
YOU CHEAT THE TRUE
MEASURE OF DEVOTION!

128
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,041
- YOU'RE WRONG. THE MEASURE
OF OUR DEVOTION IS THAT

129
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,291
WE DESPAIR EACH OTHER
TO BE USED AS BAIT.

130
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,208
A SENTIMENT KEIRO
DOES NOT SHARE.

131
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,958
- ( he screams )

132
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,166
- Rinmei: RYUKO!

133
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,958
- Choka: INSOLENT LITTLE TRAMP!

134
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:05,291
I AM NO DECOY. KEIRO'S LOVE
FOR ME DEFIES IMAGINATION.

135
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,125
- WHAT THE?

136
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,208
- SHE IS DELUSIONAL.

137
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,166
SHE SUMMONS EVERY SCRAP
OF HER POWER TO SUPPORT THE LIE.

138
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,708
- IT'S SAD, HER STATE. ONE FEELS
PITY FOR SUCH A CREATURE.

139
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,916
WILL YOU HELP ME TO FREE HER?

140
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,958
- YOU FOOL, DO YOU
EVEN HAVE TO ASK?

141
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,416
- DIE!

142
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,791
WHAT IS YOUR ARM
TO HELL'S FURY?

143
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,333
- RINMEI! NOW!

144
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,583
- ( she yells )

145
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,666
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

146
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,541
- THERE GOES EACH OF US BUT
FOR THE GRACE OF HEAVEN'S WHEEL.

147
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,916
IN ANOTHER LIFE, WE...

148
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,916
- LET'S GO. OUR FRIENDS
ARE ALL COUNTING ON US.

149
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:50,291
- NOW. STAND, ALKAID.
THAT I MAY KNOCK YOU DOWN.

150
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,875
YOUR MIND HAS NOT YET BEGUN
TO REEL AT MY POWER!

151
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,458
- IN YOUR PLACE, I'D OBEY.

152
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,625
OR ELSE SCURRY TOWARDS THE
SUREST MEANS

153
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,291
OF TAKING MY OWN LIFE.

154
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,958
- ( whimpers )

155
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,750
- Taito: WHY TRY TO STAND?

156
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,375
I'LL ONLY GIVE HIM THE PLEASURE
OF SEEING ME DOUBLE OVER.

157
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:26,083
HOSEI'S MORE OR LESS DONE
FOR. RYUKO, RINMEI, KOYO...

158
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,833
NONE OF US EVER STOOD A
CHANCE AGAINST THIS GUY.

159
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:37,416
BUT YOU KNOW. IT'S OKAY.
I'VE DONE MY BEST.

160
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,458
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY'D
BLAME ME FOR STAYING DOWN.

161
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,041
- ACQUAINTED WITH
YOUR LIMITS, ARE WE?

162
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,916
- ( he grunts )

163
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,125
- WALLOW IN IT, ALKAID!

164
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,833
DROWN IN THE
BITTER TIDE OF DEFEAT!

165
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:01,166
- I GUESS THIS IS IT.
FOR ALL MY CHEST THUMPING,

166
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,041
I'M JUST A PATHETIC,
LOUD-MOUTHED WEAKLING AFTER ALL.

167
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:10,333
- ON THE WINGS OF MY TRIUMPH.
SOARS THE ANNIHILATION OF ALL!

168
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,833
- Ryuko, Rinmei, Koyo together:
TAITO!

169
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,500
- YOU MADE IT THROUGH!

170
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,833
- ( he chuckles )

171
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,750
- JUST IN TIME.

172
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,500
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME. I'VE
A LONG WAY TO GO YET

173
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,666
BEFORE I CAN HOPE TO...

174
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,083
- ( Both groan in pain )

175
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,458
- RYUKO! KOYO!

176
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,791
- YOU STILL THINK TO WIN?

177
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,833
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
RINMEI! GET BACK!

178
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,833
- YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

179
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,583
I HARBOR NO ILLUSIONS
OF DEFEATING KEIRO.

180
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,291
THAT SAID, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
BUY YOU A FEW MOMENTS

181
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,208
WITH WHICH TO RECUPERATE,
SUCH AS I CAN.

182
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,375
- BUT WHY?

183
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,125
- BECAUSE WITHOUT YOU,
HOPE WILL FALTER.

184
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,541
YOU ARE A BEACON, TAITO. THE
EMBODIMENT OF THAT INNOCENCE

185
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,083
THIS LAND AND ITS PEOPLE
WOULD SEE RESTORED.

186
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,458
IMMUNE TO DEGRADATION'S GRIP.

187
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,000
IT'S PLAIN TO ALL OF US.

188
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,500
TO SEE YOU THRIVE, WE FIGHT!

189
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,208
- THAT'S IT! COME TO ME!

190
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,250
- WHAT!
- Rinmei: TAITO!

191
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:32,916
- THIS CANNOT BE!
ALKAID'S POWER IS SPENT!

192
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,250
- THANKS, RINMEI,
I OWE YOU ONE.

193
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,041
I WAS ABOUT TO CALL IT QUITS
FOR A SECOND THERE.

194
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,166
KEIRO PRETTY MUCH HAD ME
BELIEVING HIS WHOLE LINE

195
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,041
ABOUT INVINCIBILITY.

196
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,250
I WAS JUST KNUCKLING UNDER
BY CHOICE.

197
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,750
BUT THERE REALLY IS NO CHOICE.

198
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,291
IF I LET HIM WIN,
EVERYONE SUFFERS.

199
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,125
HEY, SIS, WOULD YOU KNOCK
SOME SENSE INTO ME?

200
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,625
- SHAPE UP, TAI!
GET OVER YOURSELF!

201
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,083
- ( groans in pain )

202
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,791
- THAT'S THE STUFF. THANK YOU.

203
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:21,791
- Keiro: NO! YOU REJECTED
YOUR FATE, ALKAID.

204
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,916
THE WHEEL OF HEAVEN DOES
NOT RESCIND ITS VERDICT.

205
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,833
- FATE HAS A LOT LESS TO
DO WITH THIS THAN YOU THINK.

206
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,833
NO STAR HOLDS A
CANDLE TO FRIENDS

207
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,250
WILLING TO FIGHT FOR YOU.

208
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,583
THE SKY CAN TURN ALL IT WANTS!

209
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:41,958
RYUKO, RINMEI,
KOYO, HOSEI, LAILA,

210
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:46,250
GRANDPA, THE MONKS,
THE QING LONG PLATOON,

211
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:53,375
LIEN, THE CHILDREN, RYUSHO,
TOKAKU, THE WO JIN SQUAD,

212
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,208
TAKI, MY BROTHER THE EMPEROR,

213
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,791
COUNTLESS KIND HEARTED
STRANGERS ALONG THE WAY.

214
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:03,416
THOSE OF US WHO FELL.
SHOKAKU, KOEI,

215
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
THE MAN I WAS PROUD
TO CALL MY FATHER, SOEI.

216
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:10,208
I'M NOT IN THIS MESS FOR
MY OWN SAKE, BUT THEIRS.

217
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,166
AND NOT A DAMN THING
YOU'VE GOT COMPARES TO THEM.

218
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,625
- BLASPHEMY! EARTHLY TIES ARE
EPHEMERA BEFORE THE STARS.

219
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,583
YOU AND YOUR LITTLE RAGTAG
ENTOURAGE ARE AS NOTHING!

220
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,000
- HEH. FOR ALL THAT FANCY TALK,
YOU'RE KINDA MISSIN' THE POINT.

221
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,666
HOW MUCH MORE YOU GONNA
RATTLE OFF ABOUT FATE?

222
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,916
- Keiro: WHY DO YOU
PIT YOURSELF AGAINST DESTINY?

223
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,875
- BECAUSE YOU REALLY
PISS ME OFF!

224
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,125
- ( he screams )

225
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,208
- THIS WILL END.
ALL OF IT WILL END.

226
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,583
I SHALL SUNDER YOU, ALKAID!

227
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,625
- COME ON! AND WHILE WE'RE
AT IT, THAT'S NOT MY NAME.

228
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,791
IT'S TAITO!

229
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,708
- TAITO.
- TAITO

230
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,333
- TAITO.
- TAITO.

231
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,958
- Laila: TAITO!

232
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,500
- WHAT IN THE WORLD?
- THE SWORD OF RULE.

233
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,458
- Tokaku: SWORD OF
RULE INDEED!

234
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,916
- Taito: WE'RE ALL
COUNTING ON YOU.

235
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,791
- Taito: DON'T YOU DARE FORGET
THAT PROMISE.

236
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,958
- I SWEAR I WON'T.

237
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,125
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, MY DEAR?

238
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,250
- OH, NOTHING.

239
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,875
I SHALL MAKE THINGS
RIGHT AGAIN.

240
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,083
- ( theme song playing )

241
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,750
- SO, ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO US
ONCE MY BROTHER'S BEEN AVENGED.

242
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,541
YOU SEEMED TO STOP JUST
SHORT OF AN ANSWER.

243
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:43,250
- WHY WAS THAT?
- UH, WELL. YOU SEE, I...

244
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:02,500
- Ryusho: TAIGA ACCEPTS HIS NEW
ROLE WITH APLOMB, DOES HE NOT?

245
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,500
- Tokaku: QUITE SO. AND STEEPED
IN BEAUTIFUL IRONY, TO BE SURE.

246
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,291
KEIRO'S REIGN OF TERROR ROUSED
IN PRINCE AND PROLE ALIKE

247
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,083
A NEWFOUND ARDOR FOR
THE WORK OF PEACE.

248
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:22,458
- HEY, I'M SENDING A LETTER TO
LIAN TONG. ANYTHING TO ADD?

249
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,125
- NO, NOTHING INTERESTING.

250
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,000
WELL, PERHAPS TELL THEM
I'LL VISIT ONCE MY HAIR'S

251
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,541
GROWN BACK OF COURSE.

252
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,500
- I LIKE YOU BALD. THINK IT
GIVES YOU CHARACTER.

253
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,625
- Ryuko: REALLY?

254
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,416
- Laila: SHE SAYS THE CAPITAL
IS IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE NOW.

255
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,666
- Hosei: THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

256
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,333
I GUESS TAIGA'S REALLY
TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF.

257
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,125
- Laila: SOUNDS LIKE IT.

258
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,583
- HOSEI, DOES IT EVER FEEL
TO YOU AS IF NONE OF THIS

259
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,166
REALLY HAPPENED?

260
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,541
YOU EVER THINK,
MAYBE TAI WAS WRONG?

261
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,458
I MEAN ABOUT FATE
BEING A SHAM.

262
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:03,333
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
REALLY ALL THAT CUT AND DRY.

263
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:07,000
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SKY!
THE STARS GO ON AND ON.

264
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,041
EVERY PERSON
WHO'S EVER LIVED,

265
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,208
WHO EVER WILL LIVE COULD BE
A PART OF SOME AGE OLD DANCE

266
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,708
GOING ON UP THERE.

267
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,291
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

268
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,708
MAYBE EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF US HAS A STAR.

269
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,041
NOT JUST THE DIPPER BEARERS.

270
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,583
BUT I STILL AGREE WITH
WHAT TAITO SAID ABOUT FATE,

271
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,458
THAT OUR DESTINY IS
UP TO US.

272
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,916
HEY! WHICH STAR DO YOU THINK
BELONGS TO YOU?

273
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,458
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
THE BIG ONE!

274
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,625
- ( Hosei laughs )

275
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,875
- Hosei: WOW! SO MUCH
FOR MODESTY, HUH?

276
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,583
- YEAH, WELL. I SAW IT FIRST,
SO THERE.

277
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,250
- I'D HAVE PICKED THE
SAME ONE FOR YOU.

278
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,500
- YEAH, IT'S A PERFECT MATCH.

279
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,458
YOU DEFINITELY GOT THE
ROUND CRATER FACE THING

280
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:48,958
GOING ON AT LEAST.

281
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,916
- PLEASE! LIKE YOU'VE GOT
ANY RIGHT TO DISH OUT INSULTS.

282
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,958
I'D SAY HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR
OWN MUG IF I DIDN'T THINK

283
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,375
IT'D SCARE YOU HALF TO DEATH!

284
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,041
- Hosei: SCARES ME JUST SEEIN'
THE THING IN PROFILE.

285
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,875
- Taito: YEAH,
THAT'S IT, LOSERS.

286
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:01,250
SCRAMBLE TO OVERCONFISCATE LIKE
THE GREEN EYED YEASTS YOU ARE!

287
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:05,750
- Sonnei: ALKAID TRIUMPHS,
DUBHE FALLS.

288
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,583
AND FOR NOW IT SEEMS
THE WHEEL OF HEAVEN

289
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:11,333
TURNS A TRANQUIL EYE
TO OUR HUMBLE SPHERE.

290
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:15,333
BUT 'ROUND AGAIN WILL COME A
TIME WHEN EVIL HARRIES GOOD.

291
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:18,791
WHEN SOULS MUST RISE
TO HEED THE CALL OF DESTINY

292
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,666
AND BRAVE ANEW
THE RAZOR'S EDGE.

293
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,333
SOULS PERHAPS MUCH
LIKE OUR DEAR TAITO,

294
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,041
FOR WHOM JUSTICE
IS BUT COMPASSION,

295
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:32,708
STARS BUT FLECKS OF LIGHT,
AND FATE BUT A HERO'S TALE.
