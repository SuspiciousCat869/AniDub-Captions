1
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,666
- TRAITOROUS FILTH, TELL ME,

2
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,541
EXACTLY WHERE WERE YOU
ESCORTING HIS FORMER MAJESTY?

3
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,875
- JUST WHERE DO YOU THINK?

4
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,625
TO A PLACE FAR AWAY
FROM KEIRO'S CLUTCHES!

5
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,083
- DON'T DELUDE YOURSELF!

6
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,333
THERE IS
NO SUCH PLACE NOW, NAIF!

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,500
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
SO WE GOTTA BUILD IT.

8
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:47,375
- IDIOT! YOU'RE JUST
BABBLING INCOHERENTLY.

9
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,916
- A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN
LIVE SAFELY AND HAPPILY, FREE...

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,125
- YOU STILL CLEAVE
TO SUCH NONSENSE?

11
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,541
YOUR VISION IS AN EMPTY ONE,
IT WON'T COME TO FRUITION!

12
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,666
- OH, YES, IT WILL!

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,458
YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE,
OLD FRIEND.

14
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,541
BESIDES, TAKE A LOOK AT US.

15
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,333
WE ACTUALLY HAVE
THE REAL EMPEROR ON OUR SIDE

16
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,791
IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED YET.

17
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,291
IF ANYONE CAN BUILT IT,
IT'S HIM.

18
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,958
MARK MY WORDS.

19
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,291
- ( theme song playing )

20
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

21
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,791
- Ryuko: IS THAT YOUR
POSITION, THEN?

22
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,375
- Taito: THAT'S RIGHT.

23
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,541
AND NO AMOUNT OF FANCY TALK IS
GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND, EITHER.

24
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,958
BUT WHO KNOWS. MAYBE IT'S OUR
FATE TO DISAGREE LIKE THIS.

25
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,916
- INDEED. THEN I'VE NO CHOICE!

26
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,500
- LET'S FINISH IT, RYUKO,
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

27
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,875
- WITH PLEASURE!

28
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,208
- I AM ALKAID!

29
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,166
USER OF THE EIGHT STYLES,
CHOOSE YOUR STANCE!

30
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,458
- I AM MIZAR!

31
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,958
I CHOOSE YOUR ANNIHILATION!

32
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,208
- ( both screaming )

33
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,916
- STOP THIS! ACT LIKE MEN!

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,666
THIS IS INFANTILE!

35
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,083
LAILA, PLEASE, CONVINCE
THEM TO WITHDRAW.

36
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,416
- YEAH, SURE THING.

37
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,125
AND WHILE I'M AT IT,
I'LL MOVE A MOUNTAIN TOO.

38
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,833
- YOU JEST...

39
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,750
- NAH. WE'RE PRETTY MUCH
GONNA HAVE TO LET THEM

40
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,625
DUKE IT OUT, I'M AFRAID.

41
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,750
CALLING MEN BULLHEADED WOULD
BE AN INSULT TO LIVESTOCK.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,416
- THAT REMINDS ME.

43
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,291
HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE LITTLE
CLUB WE'VE GOT, LADY TAKI?

44
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,375
- Choka: FORGIVE ME, MY LORD...

45
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,083
IT SEEMS ALKAID HAS
ABSCONDED WITH TAKI

46
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,125
AND HIS FORMER MAJESTY.

47
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,375
- ( Shimei chuckles )

48
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,041
QUITE THE FAUX PAS.

49
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,833
- Choka: SHIMEI...

50
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,333
- TAIGA'S TRUANCY ALONE
IS OF LITTLE ACCOUNT.

51
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,333
HE IS MERELY
THE DETRITUS OF A BYGONE ERA.

52
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,958
- BUT THAT HE'S NOW IN THE
COMPANY OF YOUR NEMESIS,

53
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,125
SURELY THAT IS
NO SMALL CONSIDERATION?

54
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,666
- THE SWORD OF RULE HAS
CHOSEN ME TO BE EMPEROR.

55
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,375
ALKAID CONCERNS ME
NOT IN THE LEAST.

56
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,583
MY AMBITION IS REALIZED.

57
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,083
BUT SHOULD OUR ABSENT FRIENDS

58
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,291
COLLUDE IN HOPE OF
BRINGING ME DOWN...

59
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,625
...I WILL SEE THEIR HOPES
DASHED PERSONALLY.

60
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,583
- TAKI...

61
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,083
- ( chuckles ) AW, COME ON.
YOU WORN OUT?

62
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,333
YOU'RE PANTING LIKE AN
OVERLOADED PACK MULE THERE,

63
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,791
HOTSHOT.

64
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,416
- IMBECILE. YOU'RE IN NO
POSITION TO MOCK ME.

65
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,333
- ( both grunting )

66
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,666
- EXPLAIN IT.
- DO WHAT?

67
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,916
- YOUR FAITH. HOW CAN YOU
PUT SO MUCH STOCK IN SOMEONE

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,458
AS INEFFECTUAL AS TAIGA?

69
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,791
- DO WHAT?

70
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,750
- NO QUALMS. NO HESITATION.
JUST BLIND FAITH.

71
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,958
- OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

72
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,125
WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?

73
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,791
- ONE THAT BEGS AN ANSWER!

74
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,041
- LOOK, YOU EITHER GET IT
OR YOU DON'T, OKAY?

75
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,208
- AND I DON'T?

76
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,166
- LET ME ASK YOU, SMART GUY.

77
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,750
WHEN YOU BELIEVE IN SOMEBODY,
DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KNOW WHY?

78
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,083
- OF COURSE I DO!

79
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,916
ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE
THE SURRENDER OF REASON.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
- IF YOU WANT A REASON,
JUST LOOK HIM IN THE EYE!

81
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,625
WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED?

82
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,375
HELL, THAT'S ALL IT TOOK
FOR ME THE FIRST TIME WE MET.

83
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,000
REMEMBER?

84
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,416
- DON'T THINK TO SWAY ME!

85
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,083
WHY DO HIS PLATITUDES LURE ME?

86
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,000
HE BRINGS OUT THE
BEST IN EVERYONE,

87
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,666
EVEN WHEN HE SPEAKS NONSENSE.

88
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,666
AM I LOSING SIGHT OF
THE HORIZON LINE

89
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,166
WHERE WISDOM BECOMES CLICHE?

90
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,791
OR IS HE RIGHT?

91
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,000
FOR THAT MATTER, WHEN
COULD I LAST EVEN LOOK

92
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,083
SOMEONE IN THE EYE
WITHOUT MY GUARD UP?

93
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,541
- NOW, PICK IT UP.

94
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,291
- DON'T PATRONIZE ME!

95
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,833
- OH, PLEASE. GROW UP.

96
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,833
I'VE BEEN LOOKIN' FORWARD
TO THIS.

97
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,791
COME ON. DO YOU WANT A REMATCH
OR DON'T YOU?

98
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,875
- TAITO. I HAVE NEVER
ENCOUNTERED YOUR LIKE.

99
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,458
- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
A LITTLE REMATCH SOMETIME?

100
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,833
- TAITO.

101
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,291
- CALL IT FATE IF YOU LIKE.

102
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,958
LET'S SPAR. IT'LL BE FUN,
LIKE BACK IN THE OLD DAYS.

103
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,500
AFTER THE CRAP
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

104
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,958
YOU OWE ME A FAIR FIGHT.

105
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,083
- YOU IDIOT.

106
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,166
- VERY WELL. THOUGH I FEEL
I OUGHT TO REMIND YOU...

107
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,208
IN THE REAL WORLD "FAIR"
IS ENTIRELY RELATIVE.

108
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,666
- TRUST ME. I KNOW.

109
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,208
- MORONS. I KNEW IT WOULD
COME TO THIS.

110
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,875
WHY DO MEN HAVE TO BE SO...

111
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,916
- Taki: I BELIEVE THE WORD
IS "HOPELESS," IS IT NOT?

112
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,875
( chuckles )

113
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,583
- YOU DO GET IT.

114
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,708
- OH, YES.

115
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,625
- WHAT THE...

116
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,166
- Kocho: YOUR MAJESTY!
LADY TAKI!

117
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,875
- FATH... KOCHO!

118
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,250
- DAMN THEIR EYES.
TO HAVE KIDNAPPED YOU.

119
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,208
I'LL TEACH THEM
A LESSON IN RESPECT!

120
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,875
- NEITHER WOMAN NOR CHILD
WILL KNOW MERCY!

121
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,708
- KOCHO. STOP!

122
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,000
- Kocho: YOUR HIGHNESS?

123
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,291
- THEY ARE NOT OUR FOE.

124
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,708
LISTEN, PLEASE, THEY RISKED
BOTH LIFE AND LIMB

125
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,625
IN ORDER TO SET US FREE!

126
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,500
KEIRO WOULD HAVE SLAIN TAKI
AND MYSELF IF NOT FOR

127
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,708
THEIR INTERCESSION!

128
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,625
- THEY WHAT?
NO, YOU, YOU'VE BEEN BEWITCHED.

129
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,916
- BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,208
LORD KEIRO WOULD HAVE
SEEN US PUT TO DEATH!

131
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:42,000
- Kocho: BUT, MY NOBLE LORD,
SURELY HE WOULD NEVER...

132
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,375
- HERE WE ARE AT LAST.
IT'S THE END!

133
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,500
- BRING IT!

134
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,083
- ( screams )

135
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,250
- ( shrieks )

136
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,958
- Kocho: TAKI!

137
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,750
- ( both grunting )

138
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,958
- WAY TO GO, TAI!

139
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,875
- I AM BESTED. GO.

140
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,375
- Laila: TAITO!

141
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,333
( laughing )

142
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,583
- ( chuckles )

143
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,041
- I WAS HIS SERVANT.

144
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,833
HIS DOG.

145
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:55,708
- WITH YOUR BELOVED EMPEROR,
DIE AS ONE!

146
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,416
- TAIGA!
- LOOK OUT!

147
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,791
- ( screaming )

148
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,750
- ( groaning )

149
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,416
( grunting )

150
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,583
- FATHER!

151
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,458
- Kocho: STAY BACK!

152
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,833
I BEG OF YOU.

153
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,750
I WILL NOT HAVE
THE TWO OF YOU...

154
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,083
...STEEPED IN MY BLOOD.

155
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,541
- ( crying ) FATHER, NO...

156
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,750
- ( continues groaning )

157
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,083
FORGIVE ME, MY LORD...

158
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,541
SO STRONG A BOND

159
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,291
WOULD NOT BE RENT ASUNDER.

160
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,125
- FATHER!

161
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,000
( crying )

162
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,291
- TAITO.

163
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,166
- KEIRO!

164
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,916
- TAITO. PLEASE,
YOU MUSTN'T GIVE IN.

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,291
DISASTER WILL RAIN DOWN ON US
ALL IF YOU CLASH.

166
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,500
- LAILA. TAKE THE OTHERS
AND GO.

167
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,833
GET THEM OUT OF HERE, QUICKLY.

168
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,291
I'LL STAY AND HOLD HIM OFF.

169
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,416
- YOU SURE?

170
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,000
- JUST HAVE FAITH.

171
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,583
I PROMISE NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS, I'LL FIND YOU GUYS.

172
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,833
- YOU'D BETTER, TAI.
YOU HEAR ME?

173
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,250
- SO YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD
ME OFF THEN ARE YOU?

174
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,500
INTERESTING.

175
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,500
THE HEAVENS HAVE PAVED
A ROAD FOR ME, BOY.

176
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,833
CHECK MY PROGRESS
IF YOU DARE!

177
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,833
- OH, I DARE A LOT MORE
THAN THAT.

178
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,333
- FATHER. DON'T DO THIS.

179
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,458
- IT'S TIME TO FALL!

180
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,083
- ( both screaming )

181
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,083
- IMPOSSIBLE. TAITO TOOK
A DIRECT HIT FROM HIM

182
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,583
WITHOUT FALTERING.

183
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,708
- KEIRO!

184
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,750
( explosion booms )

185
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,208
- IT'S HAPPENED.

186
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,250
THE WAR OF ALKAID AND DUBHE
HAS BECOME MANIFEST.

187
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,666
- YOU ESCAPED UNHARMED, MAJESTY?
- YES.

188
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,500
- THAT'S GREAT, BUT WHO
GIVES A DAMN ABOUT YOU?

189
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,416
COWARD! YOU LEFT TAITO
TO FACE THE MUSIC ALONE!

190
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,416
- CALM YOURSELF, PLEASE.

191
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,125
TAITO WILLED HIS MAJESTY
TO BREAK AWAY.

192
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,541
HE DID NOT SIMPLY FLEE
THE SCENE OUT OF COWARDICE.

193
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,666
YOU KNOW THAT.

194
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,291
OUR MISSION WAS TO FREE HIM.

195
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,375
- FORGIVE ME. I WAS ONLY DOING
AS TAITO WANTED.

196
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,750
- DAMN IT, TAITO.

197
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,125
IF YOU DIE ON US, LAILA
WON'T HAVE ANY FAMILY LEFT.

198
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,500
WHAT KIND OF LIFE WILL SHE HAVE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO?

199
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,000
- I KNOW! YOUR SWEET SIS
AND I WILL HAVE TO GET HITCHED.

200
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,083
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO HONOR
YOUR MEMORY!

201
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,666
- Taito: NOT TO STEAL
YOUR THUNDER,

202
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,416
BUT MY MEMORY DOESN'T NEED
HONORING JUST YET.

203
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,875
- TAITO!

204
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,916
- THANK HEAVENS!

205
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,958
- TAITO, YOU
EAVESDROPPING SCOUNDREL.

206
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,791
- SO, UH, YOU DO KNOW ALL
THAT WAS JUST ME

207
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,041
KIDDIN' AROUND, RIGHT?

208
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,375
- SURE. WHATEVER.

209
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,041
- YOUNG TAITO.

210
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,500
IT WAS I WHO CAST YOU OUT.

211
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,625
I WHO TORE YOU FROM
YOUR BROTHER'S SIDE

212
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,791
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

213
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:25,916
- YOU WHAT?

214
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,041
- HEY, ITS ALRIGHT. YOU DID
WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS BEST.

215
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,333
- BUT...

216
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,291
- TELL ME, OF WHAT ARE
THE TWO OF YOU SPEAKING?

217
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,791
- MY LORD, IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO KNOW.

218
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,875
THE HERO BEFORE US
IS YOUR OWN TWIN BROTHER.

219
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,958
- TWIN BROTHER?

220
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,000
- YEAH. HOW'S THAT
FOR A SURPRISE?

221
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,833
- 'TWAS TO MY EVERLASTING SHAME,
BANISHING YOU FROM THE CAPITAL.

222
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,416
ALL DRIVEN BY FEAR
OF YOUR FATE. THE SIGIL.

223
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,000
WHATEVER PUNISHMENT YOU DEVISE,
I WILL HUMBLY SUBMIT TO.

224
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,833
- AW, DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

225
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,750
AFTER ALL, I CONSIDER IT
AN HONOR TO BE RAISED

226
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,583
BY SOEI AND SONNEI.

227
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,916
ACTUALLY, SIR,
I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU.

228
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
WITHOUT YOUR HELP, I NEVER
WOULD HAVE MET THEM.

229
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,333
SO, I GUESS, THANKS.
I'M GRATEFUL FOR IT.

230
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,250
- AND I FOR YOUR KINDNESS.

231
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,125
- UH, WHAT'S UP?

232
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,625
WHOA, WHOA! HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

233
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,708
- BROTHER.

234
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,750
- THE TIME HAS COME.

235
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,916
- INDEED, YOUR HIGHNESS.

236
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,750
- Ryuko: YOUR LORDSHIP.

237
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,708
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

238
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,208
- WHY DID YOU DO IT, SIR?

239
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,041
WHY DID YOU CAST
YOUR BLADE ALOFT?

240
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:06,125
- WHY ELSE? TO SLAY ALKAID.

241
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,958
- AND YET IT FOUND PURCHASE
AT LAST IN KOCHO'S BREAST,

242
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,416
NOT HIS.

243
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,625
- SO IT DID.
AND JUSTLY, TOO.

244
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,041
WEAKNESS IS THE WORST
BETRAYAL OF ALL.

245
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,208
DEATH, A COWARD'S
ONLY REWARD.

246
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,333
- BUT MY LORD...

247
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,666
- YOU QUESTION
LORD KEIRO'S JUDGMENT?

248
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,208
LEST WE FORGET,
THAT SAME JUDGMENT SAW FIT

249
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,208
TO SPARE YOUR HEAD WHEN
WHAT FILLED IT WAS TREASON!

250
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,041
YOUR MAJESTY.

251
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,541
NO SUCH VEIL OF DOUBT
SHROUDS MY LOYALTY,

252
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,375
I WOULD LAY DOWN MY LIFE
FOR YOU IF NECESSARY.

253
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,041
- OF THAT I'M SURE.

254
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,291
YOU'VE CONVICTION.

255
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,166
WHY ELSE WOULD I HAVE KEPT
YOU UNDER MY WING?

256
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,583
- TO SPEAK THIS WAY.

257
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,125
- CHOKA, GATHER UP THE CITIZENRY
IN JIALING SQUARE.

258
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,125
- YES. WITH HASTE.

259
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,541
- AND SO IT BEGINS
AT LONG LAST.

260
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,291
KEIRO'S ASCENT.

261
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,166
THE EMPIRE'S DEMISE AND
DUBHE'S SATISFACTION.

262
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,541
- HE'S REALLY GONNA TAKE
THE THRONE?

263
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,791
- YEAH. I'M AFRAID SO.
AND THAT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP.

264
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,916
- FIRST STEP?

265
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,625
WHAT MORE COULD HE DESIRE?

266
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,166
THERE'S NOT A SOUL LEFT
FOOL HARDY ENOUGH

267
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,666
WHO'D DARE CONTEST HIM.

268
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,041
DOES THE HELM OF THE EMPIRE
LEAVE HIM WANTING?

269
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,625
- WELL, WHATEVER HE'S GOT
IN MIND,

270
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,833
THERE'S NO WAY IT COULD BE GOOD.

271
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,666
WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE DOES

272
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,583
ANY MORE DAMAGE.

273
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,833
- WE CAN BET THE PURPOSE
HIS BLACK HEART'S CONCEIVED

274
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,333
BODES POORLY.

275
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,625
- ONCE HE'S GONE, IT'LL BE UP TO
YOU TO RESTORE THE EMPIRE.

276
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,625
REMEMBER THAT. THINGS
CAN'T GO BACK TO THE WAY

277
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,625
THEY WERE BEFORE.

278
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,875
YOU MADE ME A PROMISE.

279
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,000
- MAY I ASK THIS OF YOU, PLEASE?

280
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,708
- ASK ME WHAT?

281
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,416
- IN MY PLACE, I WOULD
LIKE VERY MUCH FOR YOU

282
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,833
TO SIT AS EMPEROR.

283
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,250
- HIGHNESS. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

284
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,458
- I'M NOT EVEN SURE
WHAT SCARES ME MORE,

285
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,291
KEIRO OR A HALF WIT LIKE TAITO
PERCHED ON THE THRONE.

286
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,583
- PLEASE, SIR.
DO NOT DECIDE IN HASTE.

287
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,083
- BUT, I... I HAVEN'T THE
STRENGTH TO FIGHT EVIL MEN.

288
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,708
AND TAITO DOES. I'VE SEEN IT.

289
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,000
THE EMPIRE WOULD BE BETTER,
FAR BETTER SERVED BY HIM.

290
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,416
- SORRY, PAL. I'VE GOT
ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION

291
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,833
OF TAKING THAT JOB.

292
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,916
- BUT YOU...

293
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,666
OW! WHY DID YOU STRIKE ME?
I WAS ONLY...

294
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,208
- TRUST ME. YOU DON'T NEED
STRENGTH TO FIGHT EVIL,

295
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,458
JUST A GOOD HEART.

296
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,833
LOOK. THE EMPIRE
DOESN'T NEED A HERO.

297
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,000
IT NEEDS SOMEBODY WITH
THE VISION TO LEAD IT.

298
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,416
SOMEONE WHO REALLY CARES.

299
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,291
- TAITO.

300
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,375
- BESIDES, WE'LL BE AROUND
TO HELP YOU. EVERY ONE OF US.

301
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,666
SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'LL BE
ALONE IN THIS FIGHT.

302
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,375
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL.

303
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,458
- THERE YOU HAVE IT.

304
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,750
IT'S KISMET.

305
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,666
THE DAY NOW BELONGS
TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE

306
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,083
WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE
OF STANDING BESIDE.

307
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,166
- YOUTH IN REVOLT.

308
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,875
HUMBLING THOUGHT.
BUT THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE. YES.

309
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,750
- ( bell ringing )

310
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,791
- ( crowd exclaims in surprise )

311
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,083
( murmuring )

312
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,041
- BEHOLD!

313
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,333
Man: THE SWORD OF RULE!

314
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,958
Man 2: THE SHAWN EMPIRE
WILL BE LIFTED FROM FILTH AND

315
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,416
DEGRADATION TO BE BORN ANEW!

316
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,583
