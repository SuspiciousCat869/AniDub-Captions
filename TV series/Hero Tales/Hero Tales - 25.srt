1
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,958
- Rinmei: LUO CHANG'S BECOME
A CHARNEL HOUSE.

2
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,375
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

3
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,708
WE WERE JUST HERE OURSELVES
NOT ALL THAT LONG AGO.

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,750
- FEELS LIKE A TRAP.

5
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,500
- YEAH THIS PLACE IS
WAY TOO QUIET.

6
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,583
- SOMETHING'S DEFINITELY POISED
TO CATCH US OFF GUARD.

7
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,541
TROUBLE OF THE WORST KIND
IS ALWAYS AFOOT

8
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,541
WHEN THE HAIRS ON THE BACK
OF MY NECK BRISTLE.

9
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,291
- ( growling )

10
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,708
- Koyo: WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

11
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,166
- ( theme song playing )

12
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,500
- Rinmei: THE SHEER NUMBER
OF THEM!

13
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,375
- DAMN IT! YOU'D THINK
MY INSTINCTS

14
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,666
WOULD LEAD ME ASTRAY
ONCE IN A WHILE.

15
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,708
- EVERY LAST ONE OF THESE POOR
SOULS CALLED THIS THEIR HOME.

16
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,708
- POOR SOULS.
LIKE LADY KOEI.

17
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,291
- HOSEI, I'M SORRY.

18
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,291
- MOWED DOWN OUT OF SPITE.

19
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:01,208
THEIR CORPSES BENT LIKE A REED
TO THAT BASTARD'S WHIM!

20
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:04,333
NO ONE DESERVES THAT.
NOT THE WORST OF US.

21
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,708
- THE ODDS ARE DECIDEDLY NOT IN
OUR FAVOR AGAINST SUCH A HORDE.

22
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:15,458
- TO HELL WITH ODDS. THEIR
DEFILEMENT ENDS RIGHT NOW.

23
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,125
EVERY ONE OF THEM
WILL REST IN PEACE!

24
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,916
- I FOR ONE SHARE IN
HOSEI'S NOBLE SENTIMENT.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,333
- WE CAN'T LET THEM SUFFER.

26
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,625
WE HAVE TO AVENGE THEM
AND SET THEM FREE.

27
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:27,291
- CAI FEI PALACE IS UP AHEAD.
IN THE DEAD CENTER OF TOWN.

28
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,333
- LET'S DO THIS! FOLLOW ME!

29
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,375
- ( all yelling )

30
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,541
- LADY CHOKA.

31
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,250
- ALKAID MOVES TOWARD
THE INNER SANCTUM.

32
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:59,000
- TAITO. I SEE. SO HE
COULDN'T BE STOPPED.

33
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,916
- TELL ME, WOULD YOU KILL
A LOVED ONE AT KEIRO'S BEHEST?

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,625
OR DOES YOUR OWN LIFE NOT HOLD
A CANDLE TO FRIENDSHIP?

35
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,500
- I WILL NOT BE PERSUADED.

36
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,958
DUBHE, NO.

37
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,375
KEIRO'S BLOODY INDULGENCE IS
NOT A CHARGE I WILL KEEP!

38
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:19,541
- YOUR SCRUPLES ARE FICKLE.
- YOU MOCK ME.

39
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,250
KEIRO'S AMBITIONS DREW ME IN
BECAUSE I HAD NOT THE WIT

40
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,416
TO SEE THEM FOR WHAT THEY WERE.

41
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,791
BUT I WILL ATONE YET.

42
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,500
- ATONEMENT? SO YOU ARE EAGER
TO LAY DOWN YOUR LIFE.

43
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,208
WELL, THEN YOUR SCRUPLES
WILL BE ACCOMMODATED.

44
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,541
- ( screams )

45
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,666
- ALAS! THE END COMES.

46
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,583
I MUST DEPLOY THE MOMENTS
ALLOTTED ME WELL AND QUICKLY.

47
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,916
- Rinmei: THE ZHU KEH GATE!

48
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,208
- Koyo: THE FINAL BULWARK
BETWIXT US AND LORD KEIRO!

49
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,333
- Choka: NOT QUITE!

50
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,625
- Taito: YOU!

51
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,916
- WHATEVER GARB IT
CONDESCENDS TO WEAR,

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,166
MUTINY IS AT LAST

53
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,250
JUST THE COUNTENANCE OF
COWARDS AND VERMIN!

54
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,708
- Koyo: STAND ASIDE, WITCH!

55
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,875
OR DO YOU INTEND
TO TAKE US ON YOURSELF?

56
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:30,416
- OH, NO. I WAS MERELY
CORRECTING YOUR MISAPPREHENSION.

57
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
- MOVE!

58
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,833
- NO WAY!

59
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,416
RYUKO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

60
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,791
- DON'T! YOU MUST
ALL GET BACK.

61
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,208
- THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?

62
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,125
- TAITO!

63
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,333
- YOU ROTTEN SON OF A--

64
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,208
- NO, WAIT. HOLD ON.

65
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,875
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.
HE CAN'T HELP IT!

66
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,291
- Choka: PRECISELY.

67
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,916
ONCE A FIGURATIVE PAWN,
NOW A PAWN IN FACT.

68
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,916
- STOP HIM!
HE'S GONNA KILL TAITO!

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,041
RYUKO OR NOT, WE CAN'T
JUST STAND HERE!

70
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,166
- THE ONLY REMEDY
FOR HIM IS DEATH.

71
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,541
- BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT.

72
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,500
- I KNOW. WE HAVE TO LET
TAITO HANDLE THIS.

73
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,125
- RYUKO.

74
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,625
- LOOK AT ME. I AM NOT GONNA
FIGHT YOU, YOU UNDERSTAND?

75
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,375
GO RIGHT AHEAD. I WON'T!

76
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,333
- THE LOYALTY OF A FOOL.

77
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:02,250
HOW SAD. NOW FERRY THE ALTRUIST
TO HIS REWARD!

78
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,333
- ( screams in frustration )

79
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,916
- FIGHT IT.
YOU'RE ABOVE THEIR TRICKS.

80
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,541
- NO, I'M NOT.

81
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,083
- STRIKE ME DOWN.
- WHAT!

82
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,125
- FOR THE WRONGS I'VE DONE.

83
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,833
FOR THE WRONGS
I WILL PERPETRATE YET.

84
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,625
KILL ME
BEFORE I SPILL YOUR BLOOD!

85
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,500
- YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
I SAID I'M NOT GONNA KILL YOU!

86
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,541
- WHY DO YOU HESITATE?
SLAY ALKAID!

87
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,166
-TAITO, PLEASE, I BEG OF YOU.
KILL ME NOW!

88
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,583
IT'S THE ONLY WAY!

89
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,083
MY LIFE IS MEANINGLESS.

90
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:59,500
ONLY YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO END KEIRO'S TYRANNY.

91
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:03,583
IF YOU FALL BY MY HAND, THE
MONSTER WILL REIGN UNCHALLENGED!

92
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,041
- AND IF YOU FALL BY MINE?

93
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,291
STOP AND THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME.

94
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,833
NEITHER ONE OF US
SHOULD HAVE TO DIE.

95
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,416
PEOPLE STILL CARE ABOUT YOU,

96
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,041
WARTS AND ALL.
PEOPLE LIKE RINMEI.

97
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,791
PEOPLE LIKE HOSEI AND LAILA.
HELL, ALL OF US!

98
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:30,625
REMEMBER THE CLIFF?
WE'RE BOTH SEEING THIS THROUGH.

99
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,583
YOU HEAR ME?
I'M NOT GONNA KILL A FRIEND.

100
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,875
- ARE YOU INSANE?

101
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,500
AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE DONE
YOU STILL CALL ME... AH!

102
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,833
- YOU FOOL! ANY ATTEMPTS TO
RESIST KEIRO'S HOLD ARE FUTILE!

103
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,625
- THAT MAY BE SO.
BUT THE CHOICE BEFORE ME,

104
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,708
BETWEEN MY LIFE AND
THAT OF A FRIEND.

105
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,708
BEHOLD MY ANSWER!

106
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:02,125
- NO, YOU MUSTN'T! PLEASE!
- FORGIVE ME.

107
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,583
- NO!

108
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,375
- WHAT THE...
- RYUKO!

109
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,666
- SHOKAKU! WHAT IS
THE MEANING OF THIS?

110
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,916
- KEIRO'S MADNESS
SHALL BE HIS OWN RUIN.

111
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,416
RYUKO SHALL BE FREE.

112
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,916
- VERY WELL! KEIRO HAS NO NEED
OF FEEBLE SYCOPHANTS!

113
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,291
- DOES HE BEAR A SIGIL?

114
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,541
- ( blood splatters )

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,625
- DAMN YOUR EYES!

116
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,666
- INDEED. WHAT NEED HAS HIS
LORDSHIP FOR FEEBLE SYCOPHANTS?

117
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,083
- HOLD ON, RYUKO!
KEEP FIGHTING IT!

118
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,791
- Taito: WHAT THE HELL'S
HAPPENING TO HIM?

119
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,791
- MIZAR AND THE DARK MAGIC
OF THE WAN XIANG SHI MING

120
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,916
ARE WARRING WITHIN HIM
TO THE DEATH.

121
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,875
- SO, HOW DO WE
GET THEM TO STOP?

122
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,750
- THE TEMPEST IN HIM IS MIGHTY.

123
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,791
- IF WE CANNOT STAUNCH
ITS RAGE, HE'LL DIE.

124
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:15,916
- WHAT!

125
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,541
- HE WILL NOT DIE.

126
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,000
NOT AS I DRAW BREATH.

127
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,250
- Taito: WHAT THE HELL'S
HAPPENING TO HIM?

128
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,458
- MIZAR AND THE DARK MAGIC
OF THE WAN XIANG SHI MING

129
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,291
ARE WARRING WITHIN HIM
TO THE DEATH.

130
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,125
- SO, HOW DO WE
GET THEM TO STOP?

131
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,166
- THE TEMPEST IN HIM IS MIGHTY.

132
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,250
IF WE CANNOT STAUNCH
ITS RAGE, HE'LL DIE.

133
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,375
- WHAT!

134
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,500
- HE WILL NOT DIE.

135
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,291
NOT AS I DRAW BREATH.

136
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,833
ENDURE IT JUST
A BIT LONGER, FRIEND.

137
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,833
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

138
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,541
- I WILL DRAW
THE DARK MAGIC FROM HIM

139
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,416
AS ONE DRAWS WATER FROM A WELL.

140
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,166
- YEAH, BUT HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DO THAT?

141
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,291
- BY RYUKO'S IRONCLAD WILL.

142
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,125
HIS BODY REJECTS
THE EVIL WITHIN ITSELF.

143
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,416
IT DWELLS NOW ON THE SURFACE
WHERE IT CAN BE SIPHONED OUT.

144
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,708
- ( screams in pain )

145
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,208
- ( thinking ) THE DARKNESS
IS STRONG. CAN I OUTSTRIP IT?

146
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,916
- OUR STAR SIGILS
ARE RESONATING.

147
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,041
- I'M RIGHT HERE.

148
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,833
- WHAT THE HELL'S IT
DOING TO YOU?

149
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,083
- IT'S NO MATTER.
DEATH HAS LONG BEEN MY SHADOW.

150
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,500
MY LIFE HAS RUN ITS COURSE.

151
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,208
I BROUGHT THIS UPON
US, MY FRIEND.

152
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,458
BUT YOU HAVE THE POWER TO
SET THINGS ARIGHT IN MY STEAD.

153
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:18,000
- ALIOTH. THE SAGE MAKES FIVE
AT THE HEEL OF ALKAID.

154
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,583
IT IS OF LITTLE MOMENT.

155
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,833
- RYUKO.
- RINMEI.

156
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,833
- THANK THE STARS.

157
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,000
- HE'S OKAY!

158
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,250
- OH, WOW! HE REALLY HAD US
WORRIED FOR A SECOND THERE.

159
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,291
- COME ON, MAN.
ON YOUR FEET.

160
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,166
- NO. I AM UNFIT
TO TAKE YOUR HAND.

161
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,291
- NO YOU'RE NOT!

162
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,583
- ( bang )

163
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,375
- Ryuko: SHOKAKU!

164
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,791
- I AM MAIMED.
FORGIVE ME, MY LORD.

165
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,791
ALKAID DRAWS EVER
NEARER AS I SPEAK.

166
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,666
HE WILL STAND
WHERE NOW I KNEEL.

167
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,333
WITH SHOKAKU'S DEFECTION,

168
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,958
ALL FIVE ARE NOW AGAINST YOU.

169
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,208
- THESE THINGS I KNOW.

170
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,625
- I AM THE ONLY ONE
ON WHOM YOU MAY RELY.

171
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,416
WE ARE ONCE AGAIN BUT TWO AS IN
THE DAYS WHEN FIRST WE MET.

172
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,208
I BESEECH YOU! USE MY CORPSE
AS YOU SEE FIT!

173
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,333
LET ME BE OF USE
TO YOU IN DEATH!

174
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,125
- YOU SHALL.

175
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,791
- OF ALL PEOPLE, WHY LAY DOWN
YOUR LIFE FOR ME?

176
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,208
- IT WAS ON MY ACCOUNT

177
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,083
THAT YOU STRAYED SO FAR AFIELD
FROM THE PATH OF LIGHT.

178
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,375
THE EMPIRE WAS MY CHIEF CONCERN.

179
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,333
I WOULD SEE PEACE AT ANY COST.

180
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,625
IT MATTERED NOT
WHO SAT ATOP THE THRONE.

181
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,541
I CARED NOT WHICH
WARRIOR GOD PREVAILED,

182
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,250
SO LONG AS THIS LAND
INHERITED THEIR TRIUMPH.

183
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,500
SO LONG AS THIS LAND
COULD KNOW PROSPERITY.

184
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,583
BUT KEIRO SLIGHTED FATE.
RUNNING AFOUL OF HIS STAR.

185
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,666
AND FOR IT, THE LAND SUFFERS.

186
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,625
FOR ME IT IS TOO LATE.

187
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,875
OTHERS MUST REAP WHAT
MY ARROGANCE HAS SOWN.

188
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,666
BUT YOU, YOU CAN BE
AN INSTRUMENT OF HOPE.

189
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,000
- NO, I RAN AFOUL OF MY STAR.

190
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,125
KEIRO AND I ARE
ONE AND THE SAME.

191
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,333
- THERE'S TIME ENOUGH FOR YOU

192
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,291
TO WEND YOUR FOOTFALLS
BACK TO THE PATH.

193
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,750
BETTER STILL, YOUR FRIENDS
ARE CONTENT TO WAIT FOR YOU.

194
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:07,541
PLEASE, RYUKO.
FIND YOUR TRUE WAY.

195
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,375
BE AS THE DAWN.

196
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,875
- SHOKAKU! SHOKAKU!

197
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,500
- FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

198
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,291
THIS MAN WAS PREPARED TO
LAY HIS LIFE DOWN FOR YOU.

199
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,625
- THEN IN ATONEMENT,
ALLOW ME THE HONOR OF

200
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,333
FIGHTING ALONGSIDE YOU
ONCE MORE.

201
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:41,375
- OF COURSE, NO NEED TO GET ALL
FORMAL ON ME ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

202
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,500
THING ABOUT MISTAKES IS
WE CAN ALWAYS CORRECT THEM.

203
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,500
AS LONG AS WE CAN STILL SEE
WHERE WE WENT WRONG,

204
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,625
WE HAVEN'T GONE
ALL THAT FAR OFF TRACK.

205
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,750
- I, I AM HUMBLED.

206
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,791
- HE'S RIGHT YOU KNOW.
AND WITH ALL OF IN TOW,

207
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,000
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO FIND
YOUR WAY BACK ALONE.

208
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,250
- I'M GRATEFUL.

209
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,666
KEIRO WILL BE STOPPED.

210
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,458
AND PEACE RESTORED
TO THE EMPIRE BY US.

211
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,166
TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF SHOKAKU.

212
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,041
- PLACE LOOKS DESERTED, HUH?

213
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,958
- HE LAYS COILED IN THE
THRONE ROOM. LET'S HURRY.

214
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,333
- YEAH, RIGHT.

215
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,375
WHAT THE...

216
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,583
- THE FIVE OF YOU GO ON AHEAD.

217
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,666
YOU HAVEN'T THE TIME TO SPARE
PLAYING KEIRO'S GAMES.

218
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,875
I'LL HOLD THEM OFF WHILE
YOU GAIN THE THRONE ROOM.

219
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,000
- GOOD PLAN.

220
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,916
- SO, LADIES,
AT LAST WE'RE ALONE.

221
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,333
WHAT!

222
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,541
- ( growling )

223
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,291
- SORRY, MY DEARS,

224
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,208
I RATHER PREFERRED
YOU ALL AS WOMEN.

225
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,541
- PITIFUL, MISLED YOUTH.

226
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,333
OH, HOW YOU CLING TO HOPE
WHEN HORRORS ARE IMMINENT.

227
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,750
- CHOKA!
- I'LL HANDLE THIS!

228
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,875
- WAIT, RINMEI!

229
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,541
- JUST GO! YOU HAVE MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO ATTEND TO!

230
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,250
- COME ON!

231
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,916
- EVEN AS WOUNDED AS YOU ARE,
YOU'RE STILL COMPELLED TO FIGHT.

232
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,125
IS THIS WHAT FEALTY
TO KEIRO BEGETS?

233
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,375
- I COMMEND YOU.

234
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:58,458
PLUNGING HEADLONG INTO
HARM'S WAY FOR YOUR BELOVED.

235
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:03,791
BUT YOURS IS NOTHING COMPARED
TO THE SACRIFICE I'VE MADE!

236
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,791
MY VERY SOUL IS KEIRO'S!

237
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,750
- RINMEI!

238
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,291
- GONNA GIVE HER A HAND?

239
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,916
- NO! I MUST FULFILL MY SACRED
DUTIES AS A DIVINE WARRIOR!

240
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,833
- OH, WAKE UP!
TO HELL WITH ALL THAT,

241
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,541
THE WOMAN YOU LOVE
NEEDS YOU NOW!

242
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,833
- I MEAN COME ON, RIGHT?

243
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,041
WHAT KIND OF GUY LET'S
HIS OLD LADY FIGHT ALONE?

244
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,500
- FOLLOW YOUR HEART, RYUKO.

245
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,041
- GO ON, THEN.
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU.

246
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,166
- THERE'S NO END
TO THESE HARPIES.

247
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,833
SO YOU FEAST ON YOUR
OWN WOUNDED, HUH?

248
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,000
NOT THE FRIENDLIEST
OF GESTURES, I'D SAY.

249
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,041
NO WONDER
YOU'VE GOT SUCH PLUCK.

250
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,958
- IS THIS THE STRENGTH OF MERAK?

251
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,708
HOW WILL YOU SUBDUE KEIRO WHEN
EVEN HIS MINIONS OVER TOP YOU?

252
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,125
HE COURSES THROUGH ME.
MY TRUE LIFE'S BLOOD.

253
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,625
HIS WILL ENLIVENS EVERY FIBER.

254
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:37,750
- YOU WOULD PRAISE HIM.
THAT USES YOU IN DEATH?

255
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:42,916
- IN DEATH WE ARE ONE.
BUT YOU'LL DIE, ALONE!

256
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,166
- RYUKO?
- NOW YOU DEAL WITH ME.

257
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,125
- CURSE YOU! CURSE YOUR MEDDLING
AND YOUR SLIPSHOD LOYALTIES!

258
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:02,750
THE FIVE DIVINE WARRIORS ARE
THE VERY ESSENCE OF PERFIDY!

259
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,541
- I DO NOT FACE YOU AS MY STAR.
NOR AS A TRAITOR.

260
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,250
MY PURPOSE IS STRAIGHTFORWARD.

261
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,083
I'VE COME TO PROTECT
THE ONE I LOVE!

262
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,625
- RYUKO!

263
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:18,958
- WHAT DO YOU, ANY OF YOU
KNOW OF LOVE?

264
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,375
- CHOKA, AS ONE WHO KNOWS
SOMETHING ABOUT LOSING HIS WAY,

265
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,666
I ASK WHAT ILL WIND COULD
POSSIBLY HAVE DRIVEN

266
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,000
SO FINE A VESSEL
SO FAR FROM THE LIGHT?

267
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,916
WHY ANCHOR YOURSELF
TO A DESPOT?

268
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,041
- DESPOT?

269
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:44,083
( laughs ) ONLY THE FALSE
CALL GREAT MEN DESPOTS.

270
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,625
LORD KEIRO IS MY STAR!

271
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,666
HIS IS THE FIRE
THAT PURIFIES ALL.

272
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,041
YEAH, THE FIRE THAT SCOURS CLEAN
AS BONE THE NIGHT!

273
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,250
WITHOUT HIM, ALL IS
DARKNESS AND MISERY.

274
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,916
I SERVE HIM AS A LOVER OF LIGHT.
AS ONE, HAPPY TO DIE!

275
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
- I'M SURE HE'D BE HAPPY
TO INDULGE YOU.

276
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,791
- SILENCE!

277
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,083
- THE JIG IS UP, MUSTACHE.
LET'S END THIS!

278
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,375
- YOU'VE FINALLY
ARRIVED, ALKAID.

279
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:49,083
A MOMENT WE'VE BOTH
YEARNED FOR. BUT ALAS,

280
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,500
YOU'VE COME TOO LATE
TO VANQUISH ME.

281
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,625
- OH, YEAH?

282
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,041
- BEHOLD!

283
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,916
( in hoarse voice) I HAVE
SURPASSED HUMANITY!

284
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,625
- ( theme song playing)

285
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,875
- Ryuko: THE FINAL BATTLE
BETWEEN TAITO AND KEIRO BEGINS.

286
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,000
- Taito: WHEN YOU LOSE COUNT OF
ALL THE CORPSES YOU'VE HAD TO

287
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,833
WALK OVER ON THAT ROAD,
I DON'T CALL IT DESTINY!

288
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,708
- Keiro: WALLOW IN IT, ALKAID!

289
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,708
DROWN IN THE BITTER
TIDE OF DEFEAT!

290
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:54,166
- Taito: COME ON! AND WHILE
WE'RE AT IT, THAT'S NOT MY NAME!

291
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,250
- Laila: TAITO!

292
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,250
- Ryuko: AT LAST
THE PENDULOUS SKY BURSTS OPEN.

293
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:04,333
IN HERO TALES: FINAL CHAPTER -
"THE END OF THE TALE."

294
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:20,666
- ON THE WINGS OF MY TRIUMPH.
SOARS THE ANNIHILATION OF ALL!
