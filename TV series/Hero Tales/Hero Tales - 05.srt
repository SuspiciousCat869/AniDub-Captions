1
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:27,000
- Soldier A: HONORED FRIENDS,
HIS LORDSHIP KEIRO.

2
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,458
- I HAVE RETURNED, MY LIEGE.

3
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,208
- IMPECCABLY TIMED.

4
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,291
- YOUR BEARING
IS AS GALLANT AS EVER.

5
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,208
WE TAKE IT THE CAMPAIGN THEN
WAS A ROUSING SUCCESS?

6
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,916
- THE ENEMY WAS RESILIENT
DESPITE THEIR LOWBORN STATUS.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,375
- DO NOT FEIGN INNOCENCE!

8
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,833
EXPLAIN YOUR SIEGE
OF LIAN TONG TEMPLE!

9
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,416
- THE BANDITS OF TAI SHAN
TOOK REFUGE THERE.

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,583
I MERELY FOLLOWED
WHERE MY QUARRY LED.

11
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,166
- QUARRY?

12
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,416
- THE EMPEROR CHARGED ME WITH
THE TASK OF FERRETING OUT REBELS

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,125
WHEREVER THEY MIGHT BE.
I DID SO.

14
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,583
- THIS IS TRUE?

15
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,708
- YOUR HIGHNESS,
I TAKE MY LEAVE NOW.

16
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:24,541
- LADY TAKI LONGS
TO SEE HER FATHER, MY LORD.

17
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,291
SO LONG AS YOU DEIGN
TO INDULGE THE COURT

18
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,666
WITH YOUR PRESENCE, SIR.
WHY NOT HER?

19
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,000
- HOW DEEP DO YOU THINK
TOKAKU'S SUSPICIONS LIE?

20
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,250
- HE MATTERS NOT.

21
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,541
THE STRATEGY WILL BE REVISED
SOMEWHAT, YES.

22
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,666
BUT NOT BECAUSE OF HIM.

23
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,291
- NO. I DIDN'T IMAGINE SO.

24
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,375
BUT SURELY REVISION
IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

25
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,333
OUR SITUATION
GROWS EVER DESPERATE.

26
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,375
YOU CANNOT DRAW THE SWORD.

27
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,875
I SPEAK OUT OF TURN.

28
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,750
- THE SWORD.

29
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,041
A PALTRY THING. WITH OR
WITHOUT IT, MY PATH IS ASSURED.

30
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,041
I PROMISE YOU.

31
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,750
- ( theme song playing )

32
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,083
- ( birds chirping )

33
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,000
- ( speaking inaudibly )

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,208
- OH, MAN! WHOA! IT'S SO HUGE!

35
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,500
DON'T STAND THERE AND GAWK.
IT'S DISGRACEFUL.

36
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,125
- GIVE THE POOR YOKEL A BREAK.

37
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,000
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CITY
IN JING PROVINCE.

38
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,250
- WELL! SOMEBODY KNOWS
AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT THE REGION,

39
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,583
DON'T THEY?

40
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,041
- KIND OF, YEAH. WHEN YOU TRAVEL
AS LONG AS I HAVE,

41
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,291
TRYING TO FOLLOW
YOUR MASTER'S ORDERS,

42
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,625
YOU PICK UP SOME STUFF.

43
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,875
HEY! COME TO THINK OF IT,

44
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,375
I'VE PRETTY MUCH DONE
WHAT SHE ASKED ME TO.

45
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,583
GUESS THAT MEANS
I'LL BE GOING BACK SOON.

46
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,041
UGH. BELIEVE ME, IT'S THE
LAST THING I WANT TO DO.

47
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,750
- OH? COME ON, SHE CAN'T BE
ALL BAD. I'LL BET SHE'S PRETTY.

48
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,625
- SHE'S A HAG BEAST!

49
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,583
WITH A SOUL MORE GNARLED
AND TWISTED THAN

50
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,583
A WEATHER-BEATEN JASMINE TREE
GROWING ON A CLIFF.

51
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,541
HER ONE JOY IN LIFE IS WORKING
TENDER YOUNG LADS LIKE ME

52
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,791
TO THE BONE!

53
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,416
"TRAINING." THAT MIGHT BE
WHAT SHE CALLS IT,

54
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,291
- BUT IN REALITY,
IT'S JUST SLAVE LABOR!

55
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,041
- ( chuckles forcefully )

56
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,416
SHE, UH, SOUNDS INTENSE.

57
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,000
- YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT.

58
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,291
I'M JUST AN INNOCENT LITTLE BOY
IN THE EVIL CLUTCHES OF A WITCH.

59
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,708
IF ONLY I COULD WEEP
ON SOMEONE'S AMPLE BOSOM!

60
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,458
- Taito: I'M STARVING.

61
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,625
- OH, LAILA, MY SWEET,

62
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,708
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL GIFT
YOU'RE GIVING ME.

63
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,583
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
- HUH?

64
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,875
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO DRIVE
A WEDGE BETWEEN US?

65
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,458
I DON'T EVEN WANNA KNOW WHAT
I JUST MISTOOK FOR A BOSOM.

66
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,041
( whimpers )

67
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,416
- I'D BE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT
YOU'VE MISTAKEN FOR A BRAIN.

68
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,125
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
HEY, HAND OVER SOME GOLD.

69
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,333
- ( sarcastically ) WOW,
HOW POLITE.

70
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,916
HERE. JUST DON'T SPEND IT ALL
ON SOMETHING DUMB.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,958
- I WON'T!

72
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,250
( laughs )

73
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,083
- Ryuko: HE ACTS
LIKE SUCH A CHILD SOMETIMES.

74
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,833
- Girl: RUN FOR IT!

75
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,625
- HEY! GET BACK HERE!

76
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,875
THOSE LITTLE RUG RATS TAKE
WHATEVER ISN'T NAILED DOWN.

77
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,125
- Taito: HEY, LADY.

78
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,916
SWEET BUNS, PLEASE.
I'LL TAKE ALL THAT YOU GOT.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,250
- I'M SORRY, SIR. WE'VE ONLY GOT
ONE LEFT, I'M AFRAID.

80
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,208
- WELL, LIKE I SAID,
I'LL TAKE ALL THAT YOU GOT.

81
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,666
- HERE YOU ARE.

82
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,625
- MMM. THAT'S THE STUFF.

83
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,958
- Mo Gai: MOVE ASIDE, KID!

84
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,041
- BUSINESS IS PRETTY GOOD
TODAY, I SEE.

85
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,916
- YEAH.
- LUCKY FOR YOU, HUH?

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,708
SEE, WE'RE HAVING A BIT
OF A FINANCIAL DOWNTURN,

87
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,750
YOU MIGHT SAY.

88
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,250
- BUT JUST YESTERDAY, I...

89
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,625
- HEY, YOU WANT WE SHOULD
REDECORATE THE PLACE AGAIN?

90
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,916
- THIS IS EVERYTHING
I'VE MADE SO FAR TODAY.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,125
- HMM.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,916
QUITE A SENSE OF HUMOR
YOU GOT THERE.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,416
- YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER
THAN TO HOLD OUT ON US BY NOW.

94
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,833
OR DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT THIS
POOR LITTLE HOLE IN THE WALL?

95
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,250
- I'M TELLING THE TRUTH!

96
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,583
- GUESS THIS'LL HAVE TO DO.

97
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,916
- LET'S GO.

98
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,333
- WELL, WE'VE GOT OURSELVES
THE MO BROTHERS.

99
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,333
- THAT'S US. WHO'RE YOU?

100
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,333
- WE'RE THE GUYS
WHO'RE GONNA COLLECT

101
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,250
THE 100-SILVER-PIECE BOUNTY

102
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,708
ON YOUR HEADS.
QUITE AN HONOR.

103
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,541
- Mo Gai: 100 SILVER PIECES,
HUH? NOT BAD.

104
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,666
BUT THERE'S NO BOUNTY ON US
IN THESE PARTS YET, IS THERE?

105
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,166
- AFRAID SO. THE MAN YOU KILLED
THREE DAYS AGO

106
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,750
HAPPENED TO BE
A PROVINCIAL OFFICIAL.

107
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,458
- THREE DAYS AGO? SERIOUSLY?
NO BELLS HERE. HOW ABOUT YOU?

108
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,250
- EH, YOU KILL ONE OFFICIAL,
YOU KILLED THEM ALL.

109
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,625
- YOU THREE SCUMBAGS SHOULD
LAUGH IT UP WHILE YOU CAN.

110
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,166
WHEN I SAID THERE WAS A BOUNTY
ON YOUR HEADS I MEANT JUST THAT.

111
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,500
THE REST OF YOUR BODIES
CAN JUST ROT IN THE STREET.

112
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,208
- ( crowd panicking )

113
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,541
- OOH. FIVE AGAINST THREE.
THINK WE GOT A SHOT, BOYS?

114
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,958
- ( laughs )

115
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,416
THE ODDS CERTAINLY DO SEEM
TO BE STACKED AGAINST US,

116
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,083
DON'T THEY?

117
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,083
- TAKE THEM DOWN!

118
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,375
- OH, WHAT TO DO? THE BIG,
SCARY MEN ARE GONNA MAR

119
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,000
MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!

120
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,500
- ( both groan )

121
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,458
- NOW, THESE ODDS
ARE MORE LIKE IT.

122
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,458
- DAMN YOU ALL!

123
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,916
- ( bounty hunters yelling )

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,458
- INCREDIBLE.
- YEAH.

125
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,916
THOSE THREE KNOW
HOW TO HANDLE THEMSELVES.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,791
- ( Mo Gai growls )
- ( bounty hunters groans )

127
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,500
LET'S GO.

128
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,625
- IT'S HORRIBLE. JUST BARBARIC.

129
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,041
- THEY COULD'VE GOTTEN AWAY
WITHOUT KILLING THESE MEN.

130
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,416
- IS THAT SO?

131
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,791
THIS KIND OF THING IS
A HECK OF A LOT MORE COMMON

132
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,250
THAN YOU'D CARE TO BELIEVE.

133
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,416
- SO YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD
ACCEPT PEOPLE LIKE THAT

134
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,000
RUNNING LOOSE IN THE WORLD?

135
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,916
- WHOA, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
TAKE DOWN EVERY SINGLE BAD GUY

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,333
YOU COME ACROSS?

137
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,875
TRUST ME ON THIS, SOMETIMES
YOU GOTTA LET THE WORLD

138
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,458
HANDLE ITS OWN PROBLEMS.

139
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,541
RIGHT, TAITO?

140
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,958
IT'S JUST A SWEET BUN, MAN.
GET OVER IT.

141
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,708
- BUT IT WAS MINE.

142
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,958
ONE MORE, PLEASE!

143
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,458
- I TOLD YOU,
THAT'S THE LAST ONE I HAD TODAY.

144
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,333
- Taito: HEY!
- YOU THIEF!

145
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,125
- YOU LITTLE BASTARD!
GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE!

146
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,583
GET DOWN HERE! I'M NOT PLAYING!

147
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,750
- ( blows raspberries )

148
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,583
- OH, OKAY.

149
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,208
( laughs )

150
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,916
YUCK IT UP NOW.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,291
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA REGRET
YOU EVER PICKED ME

152
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,625
OF ALL PEOPLE TO MESS WITH,
YOU FILTHY LITTLE BRAT.

153
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,750
( laughs )

154
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,666
- ( growls )

155
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,875
- ( screams )

156
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,208
- ( thief laughs )

157
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,458
WHOOPS.

158
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,583
- ( screaming )

159
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,333
- ( chuckling )

160
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,125
- ( Taito panting )

161
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,625
LOOKIE HERE.

162
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,833
NO PLACE FOR YOU TO RUN TO, HUH?

163
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,041
GIVE ME MY MONEY. NOW!

164
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,916
- I WOULD STAY BACK IF I WERE
YOU. THINGS COULD GET UGLY.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,250
- THERE'S NO "COULD" ABOUT IT.

166
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,125
THINGS ARE GONNA GET
PLENTY UGLY WHEN I GET...

167
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,583
( screaming ) HEY!
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

168
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,750
( grunting )

169
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,000
- CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YA.
- YOU LITTLE...

170
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,416
( grunting )

171
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,791
- SEE YOU AROUND. THANKS
FOR THE GIFT, BY THE WAY.

172
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,041
- GIVE THAT BACK TO ME.
GIVE IT BACK TO ME RIGHT NOW

173
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,625
OR I SWEAR I WILL BE
YOUR PERSONAL NIGHTMARE!

174
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,041
- ( girl laughing )

175
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,375
- SCREW YOU!

176
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,708
- Laila: SORRY.

177
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,416
- ( both laugh )

178
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,833
- THAT'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY GOOD LOOK FOR YOU.

179
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,250
- Taito: I HATE YOU SO MUCH
RIGHT NOW.

180
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,791
- LET'S GET HIM DOWN.

181
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,750
- NOT YOU, TOO, RYUKO! DAMN IT!

182
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,500
( guttural cry )

183
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,916
- OKAY. DOES HE EVEN KNOW
WHERE HE'S GOING?

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,458
- HE'S RUNNING ON INSTINCT,
I'M GUESSING.

185
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,958
WE'D BETTER JUST TRY
TO KEEP UP WITH HIM.

186
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,791
- Taito: YOU WILL SHOE
THE DAY YOU STOLE FROM ME!

187
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,416
- I DO HOPE HE MEANS "RUE."

188
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,208
- ( panting )

189
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,000
( sniffing )

190
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,291
THAT'S THE SCENT.

191
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,500
I CAN SMELL THE SWEET BUNS.
WE'RE VERY CLOSE.

192
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,791
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

193
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,125
- THE KID SMELLED
LIKE SWEET BUNS.

194
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,791
THAT'S HOW I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO TRACK HIM.

195
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,541
- WHAT, ARE YOU A DOG?

196
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,208
- LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

197
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,666
- I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE, THIEF!

198
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,541
AND UNLESS YOU WANT
TO MAKE ME ANGRIER,

199
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,375
YOU'LL COME OUT
NOW. UNDERSTAND?

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,291
- HA!

201
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,791
SO DID YOUR FRIENDS CUT YOU DOWN
OR WERE YOUR FORCED

202
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,666
TO CHEW YOUR WAY OUT OF
MY LITTLE TRAP BACK THERE?

203
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,500
- I FEEL FOR YOU. YOU'RE IN
FOR A WORLD OF HURT NOW,

204
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,375
YOU PUNK.

205
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,625
- I'M IN FOR A WORLD OF HURT?

206
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,750
YOU MUST BE DUMBER
THAN YOU LOOK, TOUGH GUY.

207
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,500
- HA! ALL RIGHT, KID.
BRING IT ON!

208
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,875
- TAITO, WAIT. IT'S A TRAP!

209
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,208
- TAITO!
- ( loud smash )

210
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,750
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE BACK DOWN TO THREE.

211
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,750
- YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK
I'D JUST SURRENDER, RIGHT?

212
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,750
- ( grunting )

213
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,666
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DIDN'T.

214
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,041
- THERE'S NO WAY!

215
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,208
- ( grunts )

216
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,541
THAT THE BEST YOU GOT?

217
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,416
- UH...

218
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,083
- TO GET TO LIEN
YOU'VE GOTTA GO THROUGH ME!

219
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,458
- ( all making guttural noises )

220
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,583
- MORE KIDS. OKAY.

221
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,833
- Girl: OH, WOW!
THAT LOOKS REALLY, REALLY GOOD!

222
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,083
- BE CAREFUL, ALL RIGHT?

223
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,416
THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH
FOOD FOR EVERYONE,

224
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,166
I PROMISE. NO NEED TO CROWD.

225
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,666
- GIVE HER SOME ROOM.
COME ON. LINE UP!

226
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,375
- Kids: OKAY!

227
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,708
( giggling )

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,666
- THAT'S MY MONEY,
MY FOOD MONEY.

229
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,125
- IT CAN'T BE HELPED.
AT LEAST THEY HAVE THE DECENCY

230
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,750
TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THE MEAL
YOUR MONEY PAID FOR.

231
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,083
- I KNOW.

232
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,791
- HI. MY NAME'S SHULAN.
YOU LIKE IT? WHAT'S YOURS?

233
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,166
- MY NAME'S TAITO.

234
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,041
- HERE, TAITO. YOU SHOULD HAVE
SOME OF THIS, TOO.

235
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,416
- WELL, AREN'T YOU SWEET?

236
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,833
- ( giggling )

237
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,666
- Kids: THANKS FOR THE MEAL!

238
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,500
- MOMMY, I...

239
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,291
- SORRY WE GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT,

240
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,541
BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

241
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,125
SINCE WE'VE BEEN ABLE
TO GET A DECENT MEAL.

242
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,166
- UH... YEAH, SURE THING.

243
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,541
- SO, YOU LIVE
ALL BY YOURSELVES?

244
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,125
- YEAH, WE'RE ORPHANS.

245
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,375
- ALL OF YOU?

246
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,458
- THEN WHY NOT TURN TO
THE OFFICIALS FOR HELP?

247
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,625
- TRUST ME, WE'D ALL RATHER
TAKE OUR CHANCES OUT HERE.

248
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,791
THOSE GUYS ARE BAD NEWS.

249
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,416
ALL THEY DO IS BEAT US.

250
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,791
- MY GUESS IS THAT WOULDN'T BE
THE CASE IF YOU DIDN'T STEAL.

251
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,166
- YOU GOT A BETTER WAY FOR US
TO SURVIVE, I'M ALL EARS!

252
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,375
- STOP IT. THE TWO OF YOU
WILL WAKE UP SHULAN.

253
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,833
- ANYWAY, THANKS,

254
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,666
BUT YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT
US POOR SOULS FOR NOW.

255
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,583
YOU'VE DONE YOUR GOOD DEED.

256
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,833
- THE ONLY PEOPLE THESE KIDS
HAVE IN THE WHOLE WORLD

257
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,625
IS EACH OTHER.

258
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,291
- I SYMPATHIZE WITH THEM
BUT I'M SORRY,

259
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,250
THEIR SITUATION IS NO EXCUSE
FOR LIVING LIKE PARASITES.

260
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,125
- ONLY SOMEONE WHO'S
NEVER WANTED FOR ANYTHING

261
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,000
COULD SAY SOMETHING SO COLD.

262
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,083
- WHAT?

263
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,666
- COME ON,
BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF.

264
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,166
YOU'VE LIVED A PAMPERED LIFE.
HUNGER'S JUST AN IDEA.

265
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,583
- SO HUNGER EXEMPTS US
FROM OUR MORAL OBLIGATIONS,

266
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,375
IS THAT IT?

267
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,125
- THAT ISN'T WHAT I SAID.

268
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,458
I'M SAYING NONE OF US HERE HAVE
THE RIGHT TO JUDGE THESE KIDS

269
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,541
AND WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO
TO GET BY.

270
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,375
ESPECIALLY A SELF-RIGHTEOUS SON
OF PRIVILEGE WHO SEES EVERYTHING

271
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,166
IN BLACK AND WHITE.

272
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,708
- ( angrily ) HOSEI!

273
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,208
- BOTH OF YOU, KNOCK IT OFF
RIGHT NOW. THIS IS ABSURD.

274
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,958
- Taito: WHAT HAVE WE
REALLY DONE TO HELP THEM?

275
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,375
- ( birds chirping )

276
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,666
- ( laughs )

277
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,708
- Kids: WOW!

278
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,208
- Shulan: WHAT'S
HE GONNA DO NOW?

279
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,916
- ( all gasp )

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,416
- NO WAY!
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

281
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,000
- NOW, IF WE CHANNEL
OUR ENERGY CORRECTLY...

282
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,416
WELL, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

283
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,750
YOU COULD DO THE SAME THING
WITH A BLOCK OF IRON.

284
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:33,916
- OKAY, YEAH.

285
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,291
- CHANNELING IS THE KEY
TO MASTERING

286
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,875
THE EIGHT GREAT STYLES.

287
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,458
THIS IS WHAT LORD KEIRO OF THE
IMPERIAL GUARD IS SAID TO USE.

288
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,083
AND THOUGH HE'S SELF TAUGHT,
HE'S VERY ACCOMPLISHED.

289
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,166
SO, UNLESS YOU CAN
TRULY MASTER CHANNELING

290
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,250
BEFORE CONFRONTING HIM,

291
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,333
HE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY
DEFEAT YOU.

292
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,875
- I'M TRYING TO, REALLY.
I JUST CAN'T GET MY HEAD AROUND

293
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,083
TRANSFERRING THE ENERGY
INTO A WEAPON.

294
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,333
( sighs )

295
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,583
FOCUS, TAITO.
YOU CAN DO THIS, ALL RIGHT?

296
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,708
- ( gasps )

297
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,583
- DAMN IT. I MEAN, DANG IT.

298
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,041
- ONCE AGAIN, I'M NOT SURE
HOW YOU'RE DOING THAT,

299
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,458
BUT IT SEEMS
THE ENERGY INSIDE YOU

300
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,541
REFUSES TO BE CONTAINED.

301
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,083
- ( kids laughing )

302
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,166
- THAT WAS GREAT!

303
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,291
- DO IT AGAIN!

304
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,250
- OKAY, OKAY. SETTLE DOWN.

305
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,375
HEY! STOP YANKING ON ME!

306
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,041
- WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?

307
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,041
- AH-HA! THERE YOU ARE.

308
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,833
HAVE YOU GOTTEN WATER
LIKE I ASKED YOU TO,

309
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,333
LIKE, FOREVER AGO?

310
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,500
- UH, I FORGOT.

311
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,083
- WELL, HOP TO IT, MISTER!

312
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,250
- ( groans )

313
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,916
- Mo Han: LOOK WHO WE HAVE HERE.

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,416
FEAST YOUR EYES, MY BROTHERS.

315
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,791
IT'S THE BOLD LITTLE AMATEUR
WHO RAN OFF WITH MY MONEY.

316
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,708
- OH, MY, SIMPLY SCRUMPTIOUS,
ISN'T HE?

317
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,375
- YOU KNOW, KID,
SOMETHING TELLS ME

318
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,291
IN ANOTHER LIFE
WE COULD'VE BEEN FRIENDS.

319
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,291
BUT YOU JUST HAD TO GO
AND TOY WITH US.

320
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,000
- YOU FREAKS
AREN'T GONNA GET ME!

321
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,250
- ( growls angrily )

322
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,625
- NO WAY!
- ( Mo Han laughing )

323
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,333
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?
AMATEUR ALL THE WAY.

324
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,250
I GIVE HIM CREDIT
FOR TRYING, THOUGH!

325
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,583
- ( grunts )

326
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,958
- IF YOU LIKE TO PLAY GAMES,

327
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,541
WHY DON'T WE INTRODUCE YOU
TO A FEW OF OUR OWN?

328
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,708
- ONE OF OUR FAVORITES IS CALLED

329
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,625
"HOW WE DEAL WITH PEOPLE
WHO PISS US OFF."

330
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,541
THOUGH I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT VERY MUCH.

331
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,875
- GET OFF! LET GO OF ME,
YOU BASTARD!

332
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HIM?

333
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,083
- Lien: GET OUT OF HERE, SHULAN!

334
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,375
- STOP BULLYING LIEN,
YOU MEANIES!

335
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,333
- THE HELL'S THIS VERMIN?

336
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,291
- ( cries )

337
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,875
- EW, YUCK! SHE GOT GRIME
ALL OVER MY BEST ROBE.

338
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,375
- I'LL KILL YOU! YOU HEAR ME?

339
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,875
- AW, ARE WE UPSET?

340
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,791
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO HER,
THE ONLY PERSON TO BLAME IS YOU.

341
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,541
( laughs )

342
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,125
- DAMN YOU!

343
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,541
- WHAT THE...

344
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,041
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
BUT YOU NEED TO STOP.

345
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,625
- OH, WELL.
ANOTHER LITTLE FRIEND.

346
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,000
- Taito: GET YOUR FOOT
OFF THE BOY.

347
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,000
- EH? COME AGAIN?

348
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,166
- I SAID
TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE BOY.

349
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,958
- DON'T GET ALL HIGH-HANDED
ON US, KID.

350
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,916
THE BOY HAPPENS TO BE A LIAR
AND A THIEF.

351
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
- OH, YEAH. LIKE THE THREE
OF YOU ARE UPSTANDING CITIZENS!

352
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,541
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOUR BEEF IS WITH HIM.

353
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,916
YOU'RE GONNA ANSWER TO ME NOW.

354
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,583
- UH-OH.

355
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,000
- LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
A TOUCH MORE TO THIS ONE

356
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,041
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

357
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,291
- I ASSUME
WE DO THE USUAL ROUTINE?

358
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,791
- ( blades clanging )

359
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,291
- ( guttural ) HMM.

360
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,291
- ( chuckling )

361
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,375
- ( blows raspberries )

362
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,416
- GUESS I'LL START WITH YOU!

363
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,666
- ( Mo Han laughs )

364
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,833
WHAT'S WRONG?
I THROW YOU FOR A LOOP?

365
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,250
( continues laughing )

366
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,083
- OH, CRAP!

367
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,875
RYUKO!

368
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,958
- HEY! LOOKS LIKE FUN!
MIND IF I JOIN IN?

369
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,208
- CRAP. EXACTLY HOW MANY
OF THESE PEOPLE ARE THERE?

370
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,708
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE,

371
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,541
BUT I'M MORE THAN HAPPY
TO BACK YOU UP!

372
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,666
- TAITO, HERE!

373
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,916
- HA! NOW YOU'RE IN FOR IT!

374
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,208
- OH, SO MANY HEAVENLY BOYS.

375
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,125
- YIKES. THAT ONE'S A LOOKER.

376
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,958
HEY, RYUKO, IF WE'RE CHOOSING,
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THIS GUY.

377
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,416
- WHY DO I GET STUCK WITH HIM?

378
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,916
- DON'T BE SHY.
HE'S A PERFECT MATCH FOR YOU.

379
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,416
- STOP BEING VULGAR!

380
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,708
- ( angrily ) I CAN HEAR
EVERY WORD YOU'RE SAYING!

381
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,250
- Mo Han: YOU'RE FEELING
SO COCKY, GO AHEAD

382
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,125
AND MAKE A MOVE!

383
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,000
- I'D SAY A PRAYER
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

384
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,458
- IDIOT!
- TAITO, WAIT!

385
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,000
- ( guttural cry )

386
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,250
- ( grunts )

387
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,291
- ALL RIGHT, STAY SHARP.

388
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,666
THESE CLOWNS HAVE GOT
SOME SKILL.

389
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,041
- Ryuko and Hosei: MORON!

390
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,458
- HONESTLY, AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

391
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,166
HAVE YOU NOT LEARNED
A SINGLE THING?

392
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,000
- NEVER CHARGE A GROUP
BY YOURSELF!

393
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,458
- BUT, I WAS JUST TRYING TO...
- LOOK AT THEM.

394
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,916
INDIVIDUALLY, THEY'RE
AVERAGE FIGHTERS AT BEST.

395
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,541
BUT BY WORKING
TOGETHER AS A UNIT,

396
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,791
THEY ACTUALLY POSE A THREAT

397
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,875
TO ANYONE UNABLE TO LEARN
BY THEIR EXAMPLE.

398
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,333
- WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO THEN?

399
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,541
- THINK, TAITO.
THERE ARE THREE OF US.

400
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,750
- NEVER MIND. FINE,

401
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,041
I'LL KEEP 'EM ON THEIR TOES
AS LONG AS I CAN.

402
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,750
- AND I'LL CREATE AN OPENING
FOR YOU.

403
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,083
- WHAT DO I DO?

404
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,625
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?
YOU FINISH THEM OFF.

405
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,916
- ALL RIGHT!

406
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,166
- MY NAME IS RYUKO.

407
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,083
I AM A MONK. I HAIL FROM
THE TONG YOU TEMPLE.

408
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,083
PREPARE!

409
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,041
- ALL THAT FANCY TALK'S
JUST GONNA MAKE YOU LOOK

410
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,833
PATHETIC IN THE END.

411
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,958
( grunts )

412
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,916
- HE DEFLECTED MY SHOT!
- OH, WOW.

413
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,708
- DON'T WORRY!
I'VE GOT HIM, BIG BROTHER!

414
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,791
- NO DICE.
BUT DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONAL.

415
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,708
- ( screams )

416
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,833
- ( cries out )

417
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,875
MO HAN, ARE YOU OKAY?

418
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,666
- RYUKO!

419
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,208
- Ryuko: NOW, TAITO!

420
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,208
- ( guttural cry )

421
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,375
THIS IS FOR THE SWEET BUN!

422
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,166
AND THIS IS FOR PICKING ON
SOMEONE WEAKER THAN YOU!

423
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,500
- ( all Mo Brothers scream )

424
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,416
- THEY... THEY'RE ALL MONSTERS.

425
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,791
- LIGHTS OUT, SHORT STUFF.

426
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,166
- ( giggling softly )

427
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,291
SO, YOU'RE REALLY LEAVING?

428
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,416
- Taito: AFRAID SO, KIDDO.

429
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,416
WE'VE GOT BUSINESS
IN THE CAPITAL.

430
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,791
- IF YOU LET ME COME ALONG,
I CAN HELP WITH STUFF!

431
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,416
TEACH ME HOW TO BE AS STRONG
AS YOU! PLEASE!

432
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,916
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE LITTLE ONES?

433
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,250
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO LEAD THEM
ALL SAFELY TO THEIR NEW HOME,

434
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,708
AT THE LIAN TONG TEMPLE.

435
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:46,791
IT'S QUITE A TREK,

436
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,833
BUT YOU'LL BE GREETED
WITH OPEN ARMS.

437
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,958
- SO, UH, IF I GO THERE,

438
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,875
WILL THEY HELP ME
GET AS STRONG AS YOU?

439
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,166
- WELL, AT THE VERY LEAST
YOU WON'T HAVE TO RISK LIFE

440
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,541
AND LIMB ANYMORE,
STEALING TO SURVIVE.

441
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,583
- OKAY, WE'LL GO.

442
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:06,375
- OH, YEAH. HERE, TAKE THIS.

443
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,916
- BUT THIS IS THE BOUNTY
FROM CATCHING THOSE GUYS.

444
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,166
ARE YOU SURE?

445
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,250
- OF COURSE I AM.
YOU NEED MONEY TO TRAVEL.

446
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,583
WE EVEN WROTE YOU GUYS A
LITTLE LETTER OF INTRODUCTION.

447
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,958
WELL, I MEAN...

448
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,041
- Laila: I DID.

449
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,750
- ( all laugh )

450
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,750
- Kids: BYE! SEE YOU! THANK YOU!

451
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,208
- TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES!
- SO LONG! WE'LL MISS YOU!

452
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,791
- THANKS AGAIN!
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR JOURNEY!

453
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,500
- SAME THING GOES
FOR YOU, KIDDO!

454
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,958
- THE ALKAID BOY'S A FOOL.
ABSOLUTELY IN THE DARK.

455
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,666
IF ONLY HE HAD AN INKLING
OF HIS STAR'S TRUE POWER.

456
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,250
ENOUGH OF THIS
LURKING IN THE SHADOWS.

457
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,125
LET'S SPICE THINGS UP A BIT.

458
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,833
- ( theme song playing )

459
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,583
- Ryuko: A NEWFOUND ALLY
CALLS FORTH A GREATER POWER

460
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,083
HIDDEN WITHIN TAITO.

461
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,041
- Laila: THIS IS HER? TOTALLY
NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

462
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,333
- Ryuko: AND DOES THIS
INNER RESERVOIR

463
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,666
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

464
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,333
WITH THE EIGHTH STYLE
LONG BELIEVED TO BE LOST?

465
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,375
- Taito: HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?

466
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,750
I'M THE ONE
WHO DID ALL THE WORK!

467
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,750
- Hosei: NOW SAY HELLO
TO KOEI'S NUMBER ONE PUPIL!
