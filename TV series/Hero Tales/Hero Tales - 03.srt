1
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,625
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:16,250
- COULD YOU WALK ANY SLOWER?
I COULD'VE PAVED A ROAD BY NOW.

3
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,708
- CALM DOWN, TAITO.
WHAT'S THE BIG RUSH?

4
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,291
THERE'S NO HARM IN PACING
OURSELVES.

5
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,250
IT'S NOT LIKE THE
CAPITAL'S GOING ANYWHERE.

6
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,625
- WHAT ABOUT MOUSTACHE?

7
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,333
YOU THINK THE BASTARD
IS JUST ROOTED TO THE SPOT?

8
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,208
IF HE'S GONE WHEN WE GET THERE,
I'M HOLDING YOU RESPONSIBLE.

9
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,541
- PLEASE LOWER YOUR VOICE,

10
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:33,416
WE CAN HEAR YOU. BESIDES,
THE MAN IS A GENERAL.

11
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,916
HARDLY THE TYPE TO TAKE UP
THE MANTLE OF VAGABOND.

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,458
- YEAH, WELL, SO HE MAYBE,
HE COULD TAKE UP THE MANTLE

13
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,000
OF SOME OTHER KIND OF BOND.

14
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,291
- AH, DO YOU PRACTICE
BEING A MORON?

15
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,666
- SHUT UP. 
NO ONE ASKED YOU.

16
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,000
- WHY, YOU JERK.

17
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,416
- DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF.
THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR.

18
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,625
WE'LL ARRIVE IN
OUR OWN GOOD TIME.

19
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,375
BELIEVE ME, KEIRO WILL MOST
LIKELY BE WAITING FOR US.

20
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,583
IT'S YOUR DESTINY. THAT SAID,

21
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,916
THE QUESTION YOU SHOULD BE
ASKING IS WHETHER YOU'RE

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,250
STRONG ENOUGH
TO FACE HIM.

23
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,083
- FACE HIM? HEY, HOLD ON.

24
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,541
THE ONLY REASON HE BEAT ME
IS 'CAUSE I WAS TIRED

25
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,208
AND HE CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.
IF IT'D BEEN A FAIR FIGHT HE...

26
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,791
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

27
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,041
AS A FAIR FIGHT.

28
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,500
YOU'D BEST LEARN THAT.

29
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,333
IN THE MEANTIME, I SUGGEST
WE TRAVEL AT OUR LEISURE.

30
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,833
BESIDES, THIS IS A GOOD SPOT
TO WASH UP.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,208
- ( humming )

32
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,583
- SO, YOU REALLY THINK
I'VE GOT MY WORK CUT OUT

33
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,875
FOR ME, DON'T YOU?

34
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,166
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

35
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,875
YOU DO KNOW THE EIGHT
GREAT STYLES, YES?

36
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,291
- OF COURSE, I WAS RAISED
BY THE PRIESTHOOD.

37
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,416
- VERY WELL. THEN WHAT EXACTLY
ARE THEY? NAME THEM ALL OFF.

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,458
- AH. YOU'VE GOT THE FIST,

39
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,166
AND YOU'VE GOT THE STAFF
THEN THE ROPE, THE BOW,

40
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,041
THE SPEAR, THERE'S THE SWORD
THEN THERE'S THE...

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,166
- SO, UH, THERE'S ONLY SIX?

42
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,750
- THAT'S KINDA STRANGE, HUH?

43
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,625
YOU'D EXPECT THERE
TO BE EIGHT OF THEM.

44
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,250
- VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW
THE REMAINING TWO.

45
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,916
THEY BOTH ENCOMPASS
THE TECHNIQUE KNOWN

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,916
AS CHANNELING.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,833
- CHANNELING? WHAT'S THAT?

48
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,666
- OF THE TWO, TRAGICALLY,

49
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,416
THE OLDEST STYLE IS NOW LOST
TO US.

50
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,416
LIKELY AS NOT BECAUSE
FEW PEOPLE WERE ABLE

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,083
TO MASTER IT.

52
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,583
- AH. WHO CARES?

53
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,500
COME ON, I'M NOT HERE
FOR A STUPID HISTORY LESSON.

54
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,833
WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS HAVE
TO DO WITH ME? HEY, WAIT,

55
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,291
DON'T JUST WALK AWAY.

56
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,333
I WANT TO HEAR WHY YOU THINK
I CAN'T DEFEAT LORD KEIRO.

57
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,166
- ( grunts )

58
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,083
- ( gasps ) MY WORD.

59
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,291
- THAT, FRIENDS, IS CHANNELING.
NOT THE BEST EXAMPLE.

60
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,833
CLOTH IS A POOR CONDUIT.

61
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,833
BUT I'M SURE YOU GET
THE BASIC SENSE.

62
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,000
INCIDENTALLY, IT MAY INTEREST
YOU TO KNOW, KEIRO'S REPUTATION

63
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,791
AS A CHANNELER IS UNMATCHED.

64
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,541
TAITO, UNTIL A WARRIOR
LEARNS SELF-CONTROL,

65
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,833
THINGS DO NOT
AUGER WELL FOR HIM.

66
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,583
WE MUST TAKE THAT TO HEART.

67
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:58,375
IT IS THE ESSENCE OF
CHANNELING. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

68
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,416
- HMM. GIVE ME A BREAK.
HOW HARD COULD THIS BE?

69
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,583
WORK YOU PIECE OF CRAP.

70
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,166
- PATIENCE IS NOT HIS
STRONG POINT.

71
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,458
- ( grunts )

72
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,000
- ( chuckles ) THAT THING
IS COLOSSAL.

73
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:19,208
- THE WO JIN SQUAD. WHAT BRINGS
THEM TO SUCH A RURAL PORT?

74
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,541
- WOW. THIS IS
INCREDIBLE, TAI.

75
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,291
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY
BUILDINGS IN ONE PLACE.

76
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,666
LOOK UP THERE.

77
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,625
CAN YOU IMAGINE LIVING
IN THE SHADOW OF THAT THING?

78
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:43,791
- NOT REALLY. IS IT ME OR
DOES THIS PLACE FEEL WORN OUT?

79
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,125
- YOU KNOW, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT.

80
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,208
- I'VE HEARD STORIES
ABOUT IMPERIAL MAGISTRATES,

81
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,041
PASSING THROUGH ONE
AFTER ANOTHER.

82
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,958
BLEEDING TOWNS LIKE THESE
OF ALL THEIR WEALTH.

83
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,916
SUCH TRAGEDY IS RIFE THESE DAYS.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,916
- MAGISTRATES? I SEE.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,625
THE GUYS BACK HOME
USED TO TALK.

86
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:04,000
THEY'D SAY THE SAME THING.
EVER SINCE THE CURRENT EMPEROR

87
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,625
PARKED HIS RUMP IN THE THRONE,

88
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,708
THEY SAY IT'S GOTTEN WORSE.

89
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,958
NOT JUST IN TOWNS LIKE THIS,
BUT EVERYWHERE.

90
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,375
DAMN IT. BETWEEN MOUSTACHE
AND WELL, WHOEVER IS RUNNING

91
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,791
THE SHOW HERE, IT'S A TRAVESTY.

92
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,250
THE EMPIRE IS NOTHING
BUT A BUNCH OF FAT...

93
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,666
- SHUT UP. YOU TRYING
TO GET US ARRESTED?

94
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,041
- TELL YOU WHAT.
SINCE WE'RE HERE,

95
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,250
I'LL GO PROCURE LODGINGS
FOR THE NIGHT.

96
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,083
AND YOU TWO CAN TAKE
A LITTLE TOUR OF THAT BIG SHIP.

97
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,708
- I'M SURE THEY'D WELCOME
THE CURIOUS.

98
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:30,916
- NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,208
- HOW DO YOU ALWAYS KNOW
JUST WHAT TO SAY?

100
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,458
- SEE YOU IN A BIT.

101
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,958
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

102
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,125
- CAN'T YOU MAKE AN EXCEPTION
FOR US? COME ON, PLEASE.

103
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,250
WE JUST WANT TO HAVE
A LITTLE PEEK INSIDE.

104
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,458
- THIS IS THE DOU YA, KID.
NOT SOME FLOATING MUSEUM.

105
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,458
THE WO JIN SQUAD
DOESN'T PLAY TOUR GUIDE

106
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,916
TO SNOT-NOSED COMMONERS.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,708
- WHO ARE YOU CALLING
A SNOT-NOSED COMMONER,

108
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,125
YOU ONE-EYED RIVER RAT?

109
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,500
- COME ON, LET US ON BOARD.
- TAITO.

110
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,583
- ( coughs )

111
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,458
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
IS IT TOO COLD OUT FOR YOU?

112
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,958
DEAR SISTER, CURSE THIS
INCURABLE DISEASE

113
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,291
LAYING WASTE TO YOU.

114
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:10,375
- ( coughs ) BROTHER, I HAVE
BUT ONE WISH BEFORE

115
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,541
THE DISEASE CLAIMS
ITS FINAL TOLL.

116
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,666
- SPEAK IT ALOUD, DEAR SISTER.

117
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,250
- WHILE I, WHILE I STILL
POSSESS THE STRENGTH TO STAND,

118
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,916
I WISH TO BOARD THIS SHIP.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,375
- OF COURSE. ANYTHING
AT ALL FOR MY DEAR SISTER.

120
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:27,291
SURELY, THIS KIND SAILOR'S
HEART CANNOT BE MADE OF STONE.

121
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,791
- WELL THEN, HOW ABOUT IT?

122
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,083
YOU GOING TO LET US ON?
- GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

123
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,041
- WHAT A JERK.
YELLING AT A SICK GIRL.

124
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,625
- I'M KINDA SHOCKED, ACTUALLY.

125
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,500
THAT WAS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME
PERFORMANCE.

126
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,750
- AH, THERE YOU ARE.
- HUH?

127
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,541
- I FOUND A PLACE FOR US
TO STAY.

128
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,750
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

129
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,000
- NOT TO NITPICK,

130
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,791
BUT, UH, THIS PLACE LOOKS
A LITTLE RUN-DOWN.

131
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,250
- THAT IT IS. BUT FOR
OUR HUMBLE PURPOSE,

132
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,916
IT WILL MORE THAN SUFFICE.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
- YOU AGAIN? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

134
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,291
- YES, MA'AM.

135
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,083
THESE TWO ARE MY FRIENDS.
THE ONES I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT.

136
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,916
WE SEEK SHELTER FOR THE EVENING.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,250
- I SUPPOSE. THE RAIN
WILL BRING A CHILL.

138
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,625
I'LL MUSTER UP SOME EXTRA
BLANKETS FOR YOU. SOMEWHERE.

139
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,708
- WE'RE GRATEFUL TO YOU.

140
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:20,583
- WELL, UH, SHE SEEMS NICE.
- YEAH, REAL NICE.

141
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,000
- Oen: IMAGINE ME, SHARING
MY TABLE WITH NONE OTHER THAN

142
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,875
KOYO OF THE WO JIN SQUAD.

143
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,166
PRESIDING OVER
A HOLE IN THE GROUND

144
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,625
LIKE THIS DOES HAVE ITS PERKS.

145
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,583
FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AS THEY ARE.

146
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,458
- ( people chattering )

147
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,958
- ( chuckles ) YOU FLATTER ME.

148
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,708
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,
IF I MAY SPEAK CANDIDLY, SIR,

149
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,875
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN
YOU WERE POISED TO RETURN,

150
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,250
I'D HAVE COME SOONER.

151
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,000
THE CAPITAL'S IN NEED
OF SHREWD MEN LIKE YOURSELF.

152
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,500
- ( chuckles ) WELL PLAYED.

153
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,416
THAT SAME SILVER TONGUE
MUST'VE MANEUVERED YOU

154
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,291
INTO THE POSITION OF CAPTAIN.

155
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,708
- I THINK YOU FLATTER ME.
- NOT ONE BIT, SIR.

156
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,000
- WE LOWLY ENTREPRENEURS MAKE
IT A POINT OF READING THE TIDE.

157
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,708
THAT'S HOW WE STAY AFLOAT.

158
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,750
I HOPE IT'S NOT VULGAR OF ME
TO SAY, BUT WHEN ALL SIGNS

159
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,625
POINT TO A MILITARY COUP,

160
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,708
I'M THE KIND OF MAN
WHO LIKES TO HEDGE HIS BETS.

161
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:18,083
- ( laughs ) YOU ARE
A PIECE OF WORK.

162
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,125
MORE FOOD AND DRINK
FOR MY GOOD FRIEND,

163
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,875
THE WATER-FARING SOOTHSAYER.

164
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,125
- AS YOU WISH.

165
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,083
- CARE FOR SOME
LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT?

166
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:26,958
- HUH?

167
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,333
- MY SPECIALTY, ONE OF SEVERAL.

168
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
- ( screams )

169
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,291
- ( people cheering )

170
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,875
- FORGIVE ME,
I'M A BIT OUT OF PRACTICE.

171
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,000
- BAH, IT WAS SPLENDID.

172
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,333
- HMM.
- DID YOU SEE, KORIN?

173
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,041
- THE FAMOUS CAPTAIN
OF THE WO JIN SQUAD.

174
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,291
A VERY GOOD SIGN,
DON'T YOU AGREE?

175
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,375
- QUITE. KOYO'S REPUTATION
DOES PRECEDE HIM, SIR.

176
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,666
AND HE SEEMS EAGER
TO BE AT YOUR DISPOSAL.

177
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,500
- WHAT HAVE I ALWAYS TOLD YOU?

178
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,791
POWER FOREVER GRAVITATES
TOWARDS POWER.

179
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,500
- INDEED.

180
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,541
- MY RETURN MUST BE GRAND.

181
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,833
I'LL SPARE ABSOLUTELY
NO EXPENSE.

182
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,666
BID FAREWELL TO OBSCURITY.

183
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,000
AND TAKE WITH ME
WHAT RICHES

184
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,375
THIS STAGNANT
BACKWATER STILL HOLDS.

185
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,666
- ( chuckles )

186
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,666
- TROUBLE SLEEPING?

187
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,375
- ( screams )

188
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,916
- THERE'S A CORNER OF THE
COURTYARD THAT'S RELATIVELY DRY.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,291
IDEAL FOR KEEPING
ONE SELF SHARP.

190
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,041
FEEL FREE TO USE IT.

191
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,541
- OKAY. SHE'S A NICE PERSON.
REMEMBER THAT.

192
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,208
CHANNELING BEGINS WITH BEING
CONSCIOUS OF THE BODY'S

193
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,333
NATURAL FLOW OF ENERGY.

194
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,458
THE TRICK IS TO REDIRECT
THAT FLOW.

195
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,916
THEN, LET YOUR
WEAPON DO THE REST.

196
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,458
( grunts )

197
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:01,416
COME ON. WHY WON'T THIS WORK?
GEEZ, MAYBE, IT'S THE CLOTH.

198
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,000
( grunts )

199
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,208
DAMN IT.

200
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,708
- Ryuko: REMEMBER, LET
THE OBJECT BE YOUR CONDUIT.

201
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,250
YOU'RE ALLOWING THE ENERGY
TO DAM UP IN YOUR RIGHT ARM.

202
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,125
DON'T TRY TO FORCE THINGS.
LET THE WEAPON RECEIVE IT.

203
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,666
ENERGY FOLLOWS THE PATH
OF LEAST RSISTANCE.

204
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,791
YOU HAVE TO SIMPLY
LEARN TO LET IT FLOW.

205
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,375
- YEAH, YOU SAY THAT

206
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,583
BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO LET IT FLOW INTO THIS?

207
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,458
IT'S JUST A STUPID RAG.

208
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,833
- TO DEFEAT KEIRO,

209
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,041
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO WORK THAT OUT FOR YOURSELF.

210
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:31,041
- ALL RIGHT THEN.
LET'S DO THIS.

211
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,500
- YOU'VE ALREADY USED
CHANNELING ONCE, TAITO.

212
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,291
WHETHER YOU KNOW IT OR NOT.

213
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,916
DO I DARE RISK RE-AWAKENING
ALKAID BY TEACHING YOU

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,875
HOW TO USE IT CONSCIOUSLY?

215
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,208
MAY THE STARS GUIDE US.
THEIR WAY IS OUR WAY.

216
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,041
- WOW, LOOK AT ALL
OF THEM.

217
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,416
SOLDIERS AS FAR
AS THE EYE CAN SEE.

218
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,250
WAVE AFTER WAVE. LED BY
THE BIG MAN HIMSELF, NO LESS.

219
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,625
THE ONE WHO IS SITTING PRETTY
WHILE HIS MEN TOUGH IT OUT

220
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,583
HERE IN THE WILDERNESS.

221
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,083
( whimpers ) THESE POUR SOULS.

222
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,500
( chuckles ) LET'S GO SEE
IF I CAN LIGHTEN THEIR LOAD.

223
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,083
- ( snoring )

224
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,541
- TAITO, WAKE UP. WAKE UP

225
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:28,208
- ( grunts ) I SAID WAKE UP!
- Taito: OW.

226
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,125
- SO, NOW, WE ARE
STRANDED HERE. GREAT.

227
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,458
- THE FLOODING'S BOUND
TO SUBSIDE BEFORE TOO LONG.

228
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,875
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT.
TRY TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT.

229
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,750
- YEAH, I GUESS.

230
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,166
HEY, AT LEAST THIS GIVES ME
A CHANCE TO GET SOME MORE

231
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,500
TRAINING UNDER MY BELT, RIGHT?

232
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,541
- HA. TRAINING FOR WHAT,
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

233
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,875
SLEEPING IN ALL DAY?

234
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,458
- THAT'S ABOUT ALL
YOU'VE DONE SO FAR.

235
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,875
- SHUT YOUR FACE!

236
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,583
- HMM.
- HMM.

237
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,208
- EXCUSE ME FOR JUST A MOMENT.

238
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,500
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
MA'AM?

239
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,333
IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO?

240
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,041
- NO, NO. YOU'RE FINE.

241
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,750
THIS ROOM IS WHERE I HAVE
THE BEST VIEW, THAT'S ALL.

242
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,750
FORGIVE MY POOR MANNERS.

243
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,458
I'LL BET YOU'D LIKE ME TO BRING
IN SOME MORE TEA, WOULDN'T YOU?

244
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,875
- AH. YES PLEASE.

245
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,875
- WE CALL HIM THE SACRED BEAR.

246
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,500
HE IS THE VILLAGE'S
GUARDIAN SPIRIT.

247
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,708
FOR UNTOLD GENERATIONS,
HE HAS PROTECTED US.

248
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,041
WE'VE WORSHIPED HIM
SINCE TIME OUT OF MIND

249
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,833
AND GLADLY, HIS BENEVOLENCE
HAS BEEN OUR BOON.

250
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:34,000
BUT AS OF LATE, CORRUPT
OFFICIALS LIKE OUR LATEST

251
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,541
BLOCKHEADED LORD MAYOR

252
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,833
FORBID US FROM PAYING HOMAGE
TO ANYTHING BUT WHAT THE EMPIRE

253
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:39,875
DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

254
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,791
- REALLY?

255
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,958
- POOR AS WE ARE, IN ORDER
TO SURVIVE AT ALL,

256
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,708
WE MUST DO
AS WE'RE TOLD.

257
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,083
WE'VE HAD TO SURRENDER
OUR FAITH.

258
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,208
- THAT'S WRONG. IT'S CRUEL.

259
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,291
YOU GUYS SHOULD ALL BAND
TOGETHER AND KICK THE MAYOR OUT.

260
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,458
STAND UP AND FIGHT.

261
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,708
- Man: OPEN UP.
WE'VE GOT AN EMERGENCY.

262
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,375
- THAT IS UNTHINKABLE.
YOU MEN. PREPOSTEROUS.

263
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,333
THE SACRED BEAR HAS STOOD
FOR CENTURIES.

264
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,125
IT'S NOT GOING TO COME
CRASHING DOWN NOW

265
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,333
ON ACCOUNT OF A LITTLE RAIN.

266
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,083
- THERE'S NO POINT IN DENYING
IT ANYMORE.

267
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,166
THAT ROCK IS
TEETERING ON THE BRINK.

268
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,083
THE TOWN IS IN JEOPARDY.

269
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,833
- WORSE YET, THE ROADS
ARE FLOODED.

270
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,666
WE HAVE NO
OPTION BUT TO STAY HERE.

271
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,125
- PERHAPS, THIS IS NO MORE
THAN WE DESERVE FOR HAVING

272
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,958
ABANDONED OUR GUARDIAN.

273
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,458
- WHAT'LL WE DO?

274
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,125
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO DO BUT FLEE.

275
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,000
WE'LL TAKE OUR CHANCES.

276
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,708
THIS TOWN'S FATE IS NOT OURS.

277
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,166
- WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE
THESE POOR PEOPLE TO BE CRUSHED.

278
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,666
- WE'RE NOT LEAVING THEM.
THEY NEED OUR HELP.

279
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,666
I DON'T GIVE A
DAMN ABOUT FATE.

280
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,166
AH, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

281
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,333
- IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE
AND DEATH.

282
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,458
- WE BEG YOU.

283
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,000
- I TOLD YOU THE ANSWER IS NO.

284
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,208
I DON'T CARE IF THAT ROCK
SPROUTS LEGS AND WALKS.

285
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,375
THEY'RE NOT SETTING FOOT
ON THIS SHIP AND THAT'S FINAL.

286
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,708
- SCREW YOU.
I DEMAND TO SEE THE CAPTAIN.

287
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,708
- PLEASE, JUST LET US
TALK TO HIM.

288
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,000
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

289
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,500
I'M NOT GOING TO PESTER
THE BOSS FOR YOU TWO.

290
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,291
NOW, GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE
BEFORE I START TO GET MAD.

291
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,708
- AH, YOU SON OF A...

292
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,916
- ( grunts )

293
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,833
- YOU LITTLE PUNK.

294
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,000
- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DEAL
WITH PISSANTS LIKE YOU.

295
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,875
GET YOUR CAPTAIN
OUT HERE RIGHT NOW.

296
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,333
- WHO ARE YOU
TO BARK ORDERS AT US?

297
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,458
- WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM?

298
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,625
THREE AGAINST ONE STRIKE
YOU FELLAS AS THE BEST WAY

299
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,000
TO REPRESENT THE WO JIN SQUAD?

300
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,791
- THIS KID'S THE ONE
THAT THREW THE FIRST PUNCH.

301
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,750
- DO I HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT?

302
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,250
- SO, I GUESS YOU ARE
THE CAPTAIN OF THIS RIG, HUH?

303
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,500
- NAME'S KOYO. AND YOU ARE?

304
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,625
- MY NAME'S TAITO.
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

305
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,416
THAT BOULDER UP THERE
IS GOING TO FALL ANY MINUTE.

306
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,833
NOW LOOK. THE PEOPLE HAVE
NO WAY OUT.

307
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,958
THEY'LL ALL BE KILLED.
LET THEM ON BOARD.

308
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,083
- PLEASE, SIR.
WE'LL DO ANYTHING.

309
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,500
- Oen: CLEAR A PATH.

310
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,666
SORRY TO MAKE YOU WAIT, CAPTAIN.

311
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,875
- NOT AT ALL, LORD MAYOR.

312
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,208
YOUR APPEARANCE
IS IMPECCABLY TIMED.

313
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,375
- HMM. BELIEVE ME, MY FRIEND,
YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT.

314
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,416
THAT TREASURE'S NOT
GOING TO HAUL ITSELF.

315
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,291
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
CHOP CHOP, WASTRELS.

316
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,583
- MY GOOD MAN, WE GREATLY
APPRECIATE THE ASSISTANCE.

317
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,000
- DON'T THINK WE WILL FORGET
YOU IN THE DAYS TO COME.

318
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,458
- YOUR GRATITUDE HONORS ME.
THANK YOU, SIR.

319
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,875
- HEY, HOLD ON.
WHAT ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE?

320
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,708
ISN'T A POOR PERSON'S
GRATITUDE ENOUGH FOR YOU?

321
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,333
- OH, WHAT A WIT. WHO'S THE
RUNT? NOT ONE OF YOURS I HOPE.

322
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,208
- NO, SIR. HE MISTAKES ME
FOR A PHILANTHROPIST

323
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,750
AND EXPECTS MY SHIP
TO HARBOR THE ENTIRE TOWN.

324
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,250
- DON'T BE ABSURD.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

325
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,291
I'M NOT SHARING QUARTERS
WITH PEASANTS.

326
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,375
THE RABBLE WILL JUST
HAVE TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES.

327
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,791
IT'S NONE OF MY CONCERN.

328
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,166
- YOU HEARTLESS MONSTER.

329
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,583
- LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

330
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,708
THEY'VE HELD THE OLD FAITH
SECRETLY ALL THESE YEARS.

331
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,333
MAYBE THEIR GOD
WILL SPARE THEM.

332
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,958
( laughs )

333
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,750
- TAITO, WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

334
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,458
- ( laughs )

335
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,875
BEHOLD THE SECRET
KINGS OF MEN.

336
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,375
I'VE SPENT AN AGE BUILDING
THIS LITTLE NEST EGG.

337
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,750
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO HEDGES HIS BETS.

338
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,541
- I CAN TELL BUT SURELY
THIS CAN'T BE ALL.

339
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,625
THAT IS, I'D EXPECTED TO SEE
THE JEWEL OF THE SACRED BEAR.

340
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,791
- JEWEL OF THE SACRED BEAR?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

341
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,333
- WELL, SIR.
ACCORDING TO MY INFORMATION,

342
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,041
THE JEWEL SAID TO HAVE BEEN
BURIED BY YOUR PREDECESSOR,

343
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,125
IS ONE OF THE LARGEST
IN THE REALM.

344
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,708
DON'T TELL ME IT'S NOT HERE.

345
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:17,000
I ASSUMED YOUR MEN WOULD
HAVE DISCOVERED IT BY NOW.

346
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,166
- HURRY IT UP, CRETINS!

347
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,291
- MY WORD. THAT KOYO
IS WORTH HIS WEIGHT IN GOLD.

348
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,208
- I'LL SAY. A GEM OF THAT
CALIBER HAS BEEN UNDER

349
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,791
OUR FEET THIS WHOLE TIME?

350
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,708
JUST WHAT I NEED TO SECURE
MY FORTUNES.

351
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,541
- THE OLD BEAR IS NOT
GOING TO HOLD MUCH LONGER

352
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,375
IN THIS DOWNPOUR.

353
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,625
HEY, YOU THERE, GIRL.
THE VIEW'S FAR BETTER ON BOARD.

354
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,458
- THIS IS A LOAD OF CRAP.

355
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,541
POOR PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE JUST
SO RICH BASTARDS LIKE HIM,

356
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,625
CAN CLEAR OUT WITH EVERYTHING?

357
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,916
WELL, NOT ON MY WATCH.

358
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,708
TRY TO HOLD ON, OKAY?
JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

359
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,541
GIVE YOUR PEOPLE A CHANCE
TO ESCAPE.

360
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,083
HOLD ON, DAMN IT!

361
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,833
- YOU KNOW, TAITO.
I FEEL FOR YOUR SISTER.

362
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,583
- SHE'S GROWN UP HAVING TO DEAL
WITH THIS KIND OF STUPIDITY.

363
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,000
- RYUKO.

364
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,625
- AS MASTER SONNEI SAYS,
NO ONE FORGES THEIR PATH ALONE.

365
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,041
THOUGH YOU CAN BELIEVE
AS YOU LIKE.

366
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,916
- PUT YOUR BACKS INTO IT, MEN.

367
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,583
WHOEVER FINDS THE JEWEL,
GETS A PROMOTION.

368
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,208
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.
SO CLOSE I CAN TASTE IT.

369
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,458
( laughs )

370
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:32,083
- HAVE YOU GOT IT YET OR WHAT?
- DONE. YOU CAN LET GO NOW.

371
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,500
- I DO BELIEVE THAT
WILL HOLD QUITE NICELY.

372
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,916
THEN AGAIN, IF THIS RAIN
SOFTENS THE GROUND ANY MORE,

373
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,333
WHO KNOWS?

374
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,791
- AH.
- RYUKO!

375
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,541
- WHA... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

376
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,875
- ( grunts )

377
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,041
- LET GO OF ME. THERE IS
NO POINT IN BOTH OF US FALLING.

378
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,416
I'LL BE FINE, TRUST ME.

379
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,000
- YEAH, NICE TRY. I DON'T
CARE HOW STRONG YOU ARE.

380
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,166
A FALL FROM THIS
KIND OF HEIGHT?

381
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,208
PLEASE, THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'D SURVIVE IT.

382
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,125
- TAITO, NEITHER ONE OF US
WILL SURVIVE IF YOU DON'T.

383
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,541
LET GO OF MY ARM. LET GO!

384
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,625
DAMN IT, DO AS I TELL YOU.

385
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,208
- THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

386
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,500
YOU MADE A PROMISE TO COME
WITH ME TO THE CAPITAL

387
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,083
AND I'M GOING TO HOLD YOU TO IT.

388
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,166
YOU'RE NOT JUST MY CUSTODIAN,
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

389
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,916
WHAT WAS ALL THAT CRAP
ABOUT NONE OF US

390
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,250
BEING ALONE IN THIS, HUH?

391
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,208
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME
HELP ME SAVE THESE PEOPLE

392
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,375
OR EVEN COME WITH ME ON THIS
JOURNEY IN THE FIRST PLACE

393
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,583
BUT WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER NOW.
I'M NOT GOING TO LET GO!

394
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,125
- TAITO.

395
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,875
THE ALKAID SIGIL.

396
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:41,833
- ( screams )

397
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,750
- ( panting )

398
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,125
- YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

399
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:57,166
- YEAH, WELL,
WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?

400
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,416
- ( thunder rumbling )

401
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,083
- THE BOULDER!
- OUR SACRED BEAR.

402
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,958
- MY LORD, THE ROCK!
- WHAT?

403
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,250
- ( people screaming )

404
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,791
- I'M SORRY. WE REALLY
TRIED TO SAVE THIS PLACE.

405
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,041
- DON'T BE DAFT.
THE THREE OF YOU ARE HEROES.

406
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,666
ROADS AND BUILDINGS
ARE EASY TO REPLACE.

407
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,708
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT
LIVES HAVE BEEN SPARED.

408
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,000
AND FROM NOW ON,

409
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:49,500
OUR BELOVED GUARDIAN
IS THAT MUCH NEARER TO US.

410
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,416
- THAT CAPTAIN, WHY DID HE
SUDDENLY DECIDE TO HELP?

411
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,041
- I MEAN, HE SEEMED LIKE
SUCH A MEAN GUY AT FIRST.

412
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:00,416
- I DON'T KNOW.

413
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,250
- ( laughs )

414
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,250
I ALMOST FEEL SORRY
FOR THE MAN, FALLING FOR

415
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,916
SUCH AN OBVIOUS CHARADE.

416
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,125
JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU
HOW FAR GREED CLOUDS THE MIND.

417
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,250
- I MUST SAY, THOUGH,
COMING OUT HERE WAS CERTAINLY

418
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,291
PROFITABLE FOR US.

419
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,083
TOO BAD FOR THE TOWN.

420
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,333
I NEVER WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
THE SACRED BEAR

421
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,791
TO COME DOWN SO SOON.

422
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,708
- OH, WELL,
HE WHO MOVES MOUNTAINS

423
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,583
MOVES THEM STONE BY STONE.

424
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:25,250
THE BOY, TAITO. I'LL HAVE
TO REMEMBER THAT NAME.

425
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,583
- FINALLY, MAN. I WAS STARTING
TO THINK WE'D NEVER GET BACK

426
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,208
ON THE ROAD TO THE CAPITAL.

427
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,916
- HAVE SOME PERSPECTIVE.
WE ONLY LOST A DAY OF TRAVEL.

428
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,708
YOU ACT LIKE WE JUST GOT OUT
OF PRISON OR SOMETHING.

429
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,625
- HEY, SHUT UP. IT MIGHT
HAVE ONLY BEEN ONE DAY,

430
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,083
BUT IT WAS A LONG ONE!

431
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,583
- WELL WE'RE NOT GOING TO
MAKE UP FOR IT BY DAWDLING,

432
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,791
NOW ARE WE? COME ALONG.

433
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,916
- YOU'RE NOT LEADING.

434
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,416
- WHY IS HE IN SUCH A HURRY
ALL OF A SUDDEN? THAT'S ODD.

435
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,541
- WE'RE NOT GOING TO REACH
THE CAPITAL ANY MORE QUICKLY

436
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,916
BY DISCUSSING OUR PACE.

437
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,583
- OH, LIKE YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

438
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,666
- ( both laugh )

439
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,875
- OH, WELL, WAIT UP, GUYS.

440
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,291
- ( theme song playing )

441
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

442
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,375
- Ryuko: SPURRED ON
BY THEIR DESTINIES,

443
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,208
THE STARS BEGIN TO CONVERGE
ON THE EARTHLY PLANE.

444
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,416
- Hosei: DIVINE WARRIORS?
I KNOW HOW THIS LOOKS,

445
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,250
BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
AS MY REAL MASTER TOLD ME,

446
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,833
ALL RIGHT?

447
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,958
- Laila: YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD
AS MINE, BUT I SMELL STUPIDITY.

448
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,541
- Ryuko: KNOW THAT WHOEVER
ALIGNS THEMSELVES TO DUBHE,

449
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,958
I AM BOUND BY A SACRED DUTY
TO DESTROY.

450
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,458
NEXT TIME, ON HERO TALES,

451
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,583
HE WHO CARRIES THE PHECDA
SIGIL MUST CHOOSE HIS COURSE

452
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,416
IN, "CHAPTER FOUR
DIVINE WARRIOR."

453
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,958
- Taito: HEY, YOU STAY
THE HELL AWAY FROM HER.
