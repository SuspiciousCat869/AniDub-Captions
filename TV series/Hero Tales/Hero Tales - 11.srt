1
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:20,375
( baby crying )

2
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,916
- ( chuckling evilly )

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,375
- Kocho: IS THE EMPIRE
IN SUCH DISARRAY?

4
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,416
THESE BANDITS ARE EMBOLDENED
ENOUGH TO ACT

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,083
WITHOUT FEAR OF REPRISAL.

6
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,708
- ( guttural cry )

7
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,250
- OUR FATE IS SEALED.
I'M SORRY I FAILED YOU, TAKI!

8
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,791
- ( screaming )

9
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,875
- WHAT? BUT HOW?

10
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,666
- ( baby continues to cry )

11
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:00,875
- MY LORD, IT'S YOU!

12
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,166
- ( theme song playing )

13
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:40,416
- ( birds chirping )

14
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,791
- LET ME TELL YA, I KNEW THE
EMPEROR'S PLACE WOULD BE HUGE,

15
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,666
BUT THIS WAS UNBELIEVABLE!

16
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,375
LIKE EVEN HIS OWN
PERSONAL BATHTUB,

17
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,166
THAT THING WAS AS BIG AS A LAKE!

18
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,583
A GIANT, WARM LAKE INSIDE!

19
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,416
I ACTUALLY RAN INTO THE MAN,
EMPEROR TAIGA...

20
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,750
I WAS WRONG ABOUT
HIM BEING SOME BIG GUY.

21
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,000
NOT AT ALL.

22
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,166
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT A REAL
SHRIMP FOR AN EMPEROR!

23
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,833
( laughs )

24
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,958
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

25
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,708
- WHAT'S WRONG IS THE LACK OF
JUDGMENT YOU SHOWED

26
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,041
BY SNEAKING INTO
THE PALACE.

27
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,875
IT'S MORE THAN DISTURBING.

28
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,708
- GEEZ, RYUKO, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ACT LIKE IT'S

29
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,208
THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST CRIME.

30
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,291
- THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT.

31
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,625
- THERE ARE THOSE LURKING
IN THE CITY WHO DESIRE

32
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,958
YOUR FOOLISH HEAD AS A TROPHY!

33
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,291
- THAT'S RIGHT!

34
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,916
WE WERE WORRIED SICK ABOUT
YOU BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
HOW STUPID YOU CAN BE!

36
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,291
- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I EVER
ASKED YOU GUYS TO WORRY

37
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,041
ABOUT ME OR ANYTHING, DID I?

38
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,583
- DID YOU REALLY JUST SAY THAT?

39
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,000
- ARE YOU GUYS WORRIED,

40
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,708
OR DO YOU JUST LIKE TO ANNOY ME
ABOUT EVERYTHING I DO?

41
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,541
- TAITO!
- Ryusho: ENOUGH!

42
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,041
- FATHER, LET ME EXPLAIN.

43
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,083
- UH, YES, SIR?

44
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,166
- HMM.
- UH...

45
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,291
( laughs nervously )

46
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,458
( grunts )

47
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,166
- ( both gasp )

48
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,583
- I CAN FORGIVE
YOUR SHORT-SIGHTED

49
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,000
AND FOOLISH MISADVENTURES

50
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,125
IN THE CAPITAL, BOY!

51
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,916
BUT I CANNOT FORGIVE
THE FOOLISH ARROGANCE YOU SHOW

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,791
TO THE ONES WHO CARE FOR YOU.

53
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,166
YOU MUST NOT FORGET,

54
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,333
POWER MEANS NOTHING
IF IT IS WITHOUT COMPASSION.

55
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,375
IT IS ITS GUIDING HAND.

56
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,416
UNDERSTOOD?

57
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,708
- I'M SORRY, SIR.

58
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,458
- NO WAY!

59
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,458
- DID HE JUST SAY SORRY?

60
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,583
- ( pants )

61
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,583
HA!

62
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,166
( yells )

63
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,041
UH, UH, UH! AAH!

64
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,291
- ( gasps )

65
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,541
WOW! THAT IS AMAZING!

66
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,875
I FEEL LEFT OUT. I WISH
I COULD DO THAT KINDA STUFF.

67
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,833
- TO BE TOTALLY HONEST, YOU'RE
PROBABLY BETTER OFF WITHOUT IT.

68
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,791
- OH? WHY IS THAT?

69
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,666
- WELL, BECAUSE...

70
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,083
IF THE MEN KNOW
THAT YOU'RE STRONG,

71
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,708
THEY USUALLY JUST
LEAVE YOU ALONE

72
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,125
TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

73
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,416
- ( chuckling )

74
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,916
THAT'S OKAY WITH ME.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,208
I DON'T WANNA BE TREATED
LIKE SOME WEAKLING

76
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,250
THAT NEEDS TO BE SAVED,

77
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,625
I WANNA BE OUT THERE, TOO.

78
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,208
JUST KICKING SOME BUTT!

79
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,208
I THINK IT SOUNDS KINDA FUN!

80
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,625
- I SUPPOSE THERE ARE
WORSE THINGS THAN THAT.

81
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,916
- IT'S SO EXCITING!

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,083
I CAN JUST SEE MYSELF BEING
ALL BIG AND SCARY

83
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,375
TO ALL THE BAD GUYS!

84
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,583
- HEY, RYUKO.
- YES, WHAT?

85
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,750
- LET'S KNOCK OFF
FOR THE DAY ALREADY.

86
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,666
KILLING OURSELVES WITH TRAINING
KINDA DEFEATS THE PURPOSE.

87
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,958
- IF YOU'RE RESTLESS,

88
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,333
YOU AND TAITO CAN GO
AMUSE YOURSELVES TOGETHER.

89
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,458
- IF THAT WAS REALLY AN OPTION
WHY DO YA THINK I'M OVER HERE

90
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,875
TALKING TO YOU?

91
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,875
THAT GUY'S IN A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT WORLD RIGHT NOW.

92
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,083
( grunts )

93
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,250
- YES, HE IS INTENSELY FOCUSED
AT THE MOMENT.

94
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,041
- WELL, HE'S PROBABLY
GOT A LOT ON HIS MIND

95
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,333
AFTER YOUR OLD MAN
DECIDED TO REARRANGE

96
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,166
HIS FACE FOR HIM EARLIER.

97
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,500
- STAY CALM AND FOCUSED.

98
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:05,416
ENVISION A SOFT TUBE
STARTING AT MY HEART,

99
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,791
AND EXTENDING OUTWARD,
THROUGHOUT MY BODY,

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,458
IMAGINE THAT TUBE

101
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:17,000
SLOWLY FILLING WITH LIGHT
AND ENERGY FROM DEEP WITHIN.

102
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,500
- THE SIGIL. DOES THAT MEAN
TAITO IS NOW TRULY ABLE

103
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,333
TO HARNESS ALKAID'S POWER?

104
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,541
- ( shouting )

105
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,541
- ( rumbling )

106
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,333
- THE POWER RELEASED THROUGH
INNER CHANNELING IS INDEED

107
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,958
SOMETHING TO BEHOLD.

108
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
- ( panting )

109
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,416
BUT IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO
DEFEAT THAT BASTARD, MUSTACHE.

110
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,166
( exhales )

111
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,916
( stretching )

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,416
WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS
I JUST GOTTA KEEP ON TRYING.

113
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,875
- TAITO.

114
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,958
- OH, RYUSHO,
IS IT LUNCHTIME, ALREADY.

115
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,708
- LUNCHTIME. NO,
BUT COME WITH ME.

116
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,375
- I REALLY DON'T WANNA STOP
WHAT I'M DOING UNLESS

117
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,000
YOU CAN PROMISE ME FOOD.

118
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,125
- TO REALIZE YOUR
ENERGY'S TRUE POTENTIAL,

119
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,458
YOU MUST NOT
EXHAUST ITS SOURCE.

120
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,416
DO SO AT YOUR OWN PERIL, MY BOY.

121
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,583
- ( grunts )

122
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,458
- Taito: OKAY! OKAY! I'M COMING!

123
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,166
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PULL SO HARD,
YOU'LL RIP MY ARM OFF!

124
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,291
- WHERE ARE THEY GOING?

125
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,625
- Taito: WHAT IS THIS?

126
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,625
- YOU COULD SAY THE TIAN YI
SHRINE IN WHICH WE STAND

127
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,000
IS THE HEART
OF THE TEMPLE.

128
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,208
- IT'S THE HEART?

129
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,458
- THE TONG YO TEMPLE
WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT

130
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,041
FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING
THIS SACRED CHAMBER.

131
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,958
- HMM.

132
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,208
- TAITO, LOOK UP.

133
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,791
- THOSE ARE THE SIGILS.

134
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,791
- INDEED, THE SACRED MARKS
OF THE DIPPER BEARERS.

135
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,166
AND THERE...

136
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,041
THE SEAL OF THE EMPIRE.

137
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,833
- THE EMPIRE? BUT WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS TEMPLE?

138
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,875
- THIS HOLY GROUND
IS THE BIRTHPLACE

139
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,125
OF THE XIAN EMPIRE.

140
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:33,375
BEHOLD, THE PAINTING
AT THE CENTER DEPICTS

141
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,208
THE SWORD OF RULE.

142
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,125
- THE SWORD OF RULE.

143
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,333
- Ryusho: 400 YEARS AGO,

144
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,750
THE WORLD ROILED
LIKE A GREAT CAULDRON,

145
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,833
RIFE WITH CHAOS AND EVIL.

146
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,375
HOWEVER, A WARRIOR
NAMED SHOU APPEARED,

147
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,708
INTENT ON TAMING
THIS PANDEMONIUM,

148
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,791
ARMED WITH TWO WEAPONS
OF UNSTOPPABLE FORCE.

149
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:00,833
THE XIAN JIA LAN WU,
AND THE DIVINE POWER OF ALKAID,

150
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,541
WHICH THE HEAVENS
HAD IMBUED DEEP WITHIN HIM.

151
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,083
- THE SWORD OF RULE
WAS ONCE WIELDED BY ALKAID?

152
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,000
- HMM.

153
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,041
AFTER SHOU SUCCEEDED
IN CALMING THE LAND

154
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,083
AND PEACE REIGNED THROUGHOUT,

155
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,791
HE DECLARED TO ESTABLISH
HIS EMPIRE ON THIS VERY SPOT.

156
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,375
HE WOULD RULE IT
JUSTLY AS EMPEROR.

157
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,166
- YOU MEAN THE EMPIRE WAS
ACTUALLY CREATED BY ALKAID?

158
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,416
- INDEED. AND THROUGHOUT
OUR HISTORY,

159
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,125
WHEN THE LAND
FALLS INTO TURMOIL,

160
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,833
ALKAID APPEARS TO RESTORE
ORDER AND PEACE.

161
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,916
"WHEN SUFFERING CLOAKS
THIS LAND IN DARKNESS,

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,208
THE STAR WILL PROVIDE US LIGHT."

163
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,208
CONSIDER YOUR FATE,

164
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,250
THINK AS TO WHY YOU WERE CHOSEN
TO BEAR THIS SACRED MARK

165
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,083
AND THE POWER GIVEN YOU.

166
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,916
- WHY WAS I CHOSEN TO BE ALKAID?

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,625
WHY ME?

168
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,125
TO BE HONEST,

169
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,958
I DON'T UNDERSTAND MY FATE
OR THE RESPONSIBILITY I CARRY.

170
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,208
ACTUALLY, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS

171
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,666
"KARMA OF THE STARS" STUFF.

172
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,041
BUT, IF ANY OF THAT STUFF IS
WHAT BROUGHT ME TOGETHER

173
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,208
WITH THE DIVINE WARRIORS

174
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,625
AND ALL THE OTHER
PEOPLE I'VE MET SO FAR,

175
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,958
I GUESS THERE'S A BRIGHT SIDE
TO THIS RESPONSIBILITY CRAP,

176
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,458
AFTER ALL.

177
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,583
I MEAN, THOSE GUYS ARE
A PRETTY WEIRD BUNCH AND ALL

178
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,250
AND WE DO KINDA GET ON
EACH OTHER'S NERVES

179
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,833
FROM TIME TO TIME,

180
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,541
BUT THEY'RE THE BEST FRIENDS A
GUY LIKE ME COULD EVER ASK FOR.

181
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,791
HEY, DON'T TELL 'EM I SAID
ANY OF THIS STUFF, OKAY?

182
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,083
I DON'T REALLY WANT 'EM
TO GET BIG HEADS OVER IT.

183
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,000
- HMM.

184
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,958
- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT JUST SAYING
ALL THIS ABOUT THEM

185
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,125
BECAUSE OF THE BEATING
YOU GAVE ME EARLIER, DON'T YOU?

186
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,416
IT'S REALLY HOW I FEEL.

187
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,541
- OF COURSE IT IS.

188
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,458
THE WARRIOR GODS OF OLD,
ALKAID AND DUBHE,

189
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,375
APPEARING SIMULTANEOUSLY.

190
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,625
I PRAY THIS DOES NOT PORTEND
A CONFLICT THE LIKES OF WHICH

191
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,375
WE'VE NEVER SEEN.

192
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,458
- Hosei: YOU WANT
A COUPLE OF MINE? HERE YA GO!

193
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,625
- YEAH. WOW, THANKS.

194
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,625
- OH, YOU'RE OUT OF TEA.
I'LL GO GRAB YOU SOME MORE.

195
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,083
- THAT WAS WEIRD. WHAT'S UP?

196
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,416
- WELL, I SUPPOSE SOMETHING
HAS FILLED HIM WITH

197
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
THE SPIRIT OF GOODWILL.

198
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,875
- IT'S STILL WEIRD.

199
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,083
- ( birds chirping )

200
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,250
- IS THAT SHOKAKU?

201
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,208
- YOU ARE IN PERFECT HEALTH.

202
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,541
NO DOUBT A RESULT OF YOUR
RELENTLESS TRAINING, SIR.

203
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,958
- AS HIS MAJESTY'S PHYSICIAN,

204
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:43,333
YOUR TIME IS TOO VALUABLE
FOR ME TO WASTE.

205
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,958
FORGIVE ME.

206
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,875
- NO NEED FOR THAT.

207
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,625
THE TIME SPENT WITH
AN OLD FRIEND HAS BECOME

208
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:53,625
FAR TOO RARE FOR ME THESE DAYS.

209
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,750
- Ryuko: SHOKAKU!

210
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,375
IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU.

211
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,958
- Shokaku: WHEN DID YOU RETURN
FROM LIAN TONG TEMPLE?

212
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,625
- A FEW DAYS AGO.

213
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,375
- TELL ME OF YOUR JOURNEY.
HOW WAS IT?

214
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,166
- IT WAS QUITE AN ORDEAL.

215
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,541
OFFICIALS IN THE REMOTE
PROVINCES USE THE DISTANCE

216
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,541
FROM THE CAPITAL AS A SHIELD
TO LINE THEIR POCKETS.

217
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,958
WHILE THE LOCALS OFTEN STEAL
JUST TO PROVIDE THEMSELVES

218
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,041
BASIC SUSTENANCE.

219
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,791
WAR AND DISORDER ARE RAMPANT
AND THE POPULOUS LIVES IN FEAR.

220
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,541
SORROW AND DESTRUCTION
SEEMED TO AWAIT US

221
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,458
AT EVERY NEW DESTINATION.

222
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,708
IT MAKES ONE QUESTION
NOT ONLY THE WISDOM,

223
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,666
BUT THE VERY MOTIVES
OF THE EMPEROR AND HIS CABINET.

224
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,916
PLEASE, FORGIVE ME, SIR.

225
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,458
I SHOULD LEARN TO
BETTER HOLD MY TONGUE.

226
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,666
I ASK THAT YOU DISREGARD
MY CARELESS WORDS.

227
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:47,875
GOOD DAY.

228
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,750
- ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.

229
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,875
IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS,

230
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,791
OR FIND YOURSELF TROUBLED,
PLEASE, SEEK ME OUT.

231
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,916
I SWEAR THAT I SHALL ALWAYS
WELCOME YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,583
AS A FRIEND.

233
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,166
- THAT IS VERY KIND.

234
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,791
- Shokaku: IF I CANNOT
HELP EASE YOUR MIND,

235
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,125
I WILL INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOMEONE WHO CAN.

236
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,791
- ( Laila grunting with effort )
- ( staffs swooshing )

237
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,208
- Rinmei: NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

238
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,416
- ( Hosei grunting with effort )

239
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,166
- ( grunting with effort )

240
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,875
- THE PURPOSE OF THE DIVINE
WARRIORS IS TO MAINTAIN PEACE

241
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,708
AND ORDER IN THE XIAN EMPIRE.

242
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,416
IT IS OUR DESTINY,
OUR SACRED MANDATE.

243
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,875
WE CANNOT FAIL.

244
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,458
- ( grunts )

245
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,666
HEY, RYUKO!

246
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,833
( screams )

247
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,333
( laughs )

248
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,458
WHOA, SORRY.

249
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,875
- IF ALKAID AND DUBHE
CLASH SWORDS,

250
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,000
IT WILL MOST LIKELY RESULT
IN THE EMPIRE'S DEMISE.

251
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,250
BUT CAN I POSSIBLY CONVINCE
TAITO THAT HE GIVE UP

252
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,083
HIS QUEST TO DESTROY KEIRO

253
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,791
WITHOUT LOSING HIS RESPECT?

254
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,708
- HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE LONG FACE THERE?

255
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,500
- AH, A TRIVIAL MATTER.

256
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,875
- OH, GOOD!

257
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,083
- ( Laila grunting )

258
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,125
- THAT'S THE EVENING BELL.

259
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,041
I SHOULD START
PREPARING TONIGHT'S MEAL.

260
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,250
- ( laughing )

261
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,708
SO, ARE YOU READY
TO GIVE UP THE CROWN?

262
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,500
- DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

263
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,333
HEY, RINMEI! WHAT ARE YOU
WHIPPING UP FOR US TONIGHT?

264
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,291
- STEAMED PORK DUMPLINGS!
ONE OF MY SPECIALTIES.

265
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,125
- I'M GONNA EAT THOSE THINGS
UNTIL I POP WIDE OPEN.

266
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,458
- DREAM ON, PAL, IT'S GONNA BE
ME STUFFING MY FACE TONIGHT.

267
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,875
- WHAT, YOU GONNA TELL US
TO STOP?

268
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:36,958
- I'M NOT.

269
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,708
- WELL, THAT'S WEIRD.

270
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,000
"A MEAL NOT QUARRELED OVER
NOURISHES BOTH BODY AND SOUL".

271
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,916
THAT'S MORE LIKE WHAT YOU'D SAY.

272
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,416
- THIS IS DIFFERENT.

273
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,458
- ( both gasp )

274
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,333
- I WOULD MOVE HEAVEN, EARTH

275
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,541
AND ANY FOOL THAT DARES
STAND BETWEEN ME

276
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,833
AND MY SHARE
OF RINMEI'S DUMPLINGS!

277
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,416
- WHAT A SHAME. THESE DUMPLINGS
ARE LEGENDARY,

278
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,041
AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
SETTLE FOR WATCHING ME EAT THEM.

279
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,125
- I'LL BE WATCHING YOU
EAT MY SCRAPS THEN.

280
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,125
I'LL PROBABLY GIVE YOU
ONE OUT OF PITY.

281
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,208
- GEEZ, IS IT REALLY WORTH
GETTING THIS WORKED UP

282
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,750
OVER PLAIN, OLD DUMPLINGS?

283
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,541
BOYS ARE SO PRIMITIVE.

284
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,791
( sighs )

285
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:12,833
LIKE CAVEMEN.

286
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,833
- WE GO AT HER SIGN!

287
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:15,875
- GO!

288
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,250
- ( all yelling )

289
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,083
( all grunting with effort )

290
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,208
- YOUR UNREFINED PALATES
COULD NOT COMPREHEND

291
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,000
THE COMPLEXITIES OF OUR COOKING!

292
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,333
THEY'D BE LOST TO YOUR RABID
GLUTTONY. SO TASTE DEFEAT!

293
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,500
- YOU'VE HAD THEM BEFORE AND
YOU WON'T EVEN LET ME TRY THEM?

294
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,250
WHERE THE HELL'S
THE JUSTICE IN THAT?

295
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,375
- YEAH, I SHARED MY LUNCH
WITH YOU TODAY, TAITO!

296
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,666
COME ON! CAN'T YOU EVEN
TRY TO BE THE KINDA GUY

297
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,458
THAT RETURNS THE
FAVOR ONCE IN A WHILE?

298
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,833
- NO WAY!

299
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,708
- SO DUMB!

300
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,166
- ( all grunting )

301
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,291
- ( screams )

302
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,583
- ALL RIGHT! THAT'D BE ONE DOWN!

303
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,625
- HM, DAILY TRAINING
HAS ITS BENEFITS, DOES IT NOT?

304
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,958
- ( both grunting )

305
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,583
- MAN, HE'S LIKE A BOULDER.
HE WON'T BUDGE AT ALL!

306
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,291
I NEVER KNEW HE WAS THIS STRONG.

307
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,208
- HIS POWER SEEMS TO INCREASE
BY THE DAY.

308
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,166
PERHAPS HE'S HARNESSED
WHAT HAD LAIN DORMANT IN HIM

309
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,458
ALL THESE YEARS.

310
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,458
- BUT STILL...

311
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,916
- I CAN'T LOSE!

312
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,958
- OH, WOW!
IT'S RIDICULOUS, BUT WOW!

313
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,791
( screaming )

314
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,250
- LAILA!
- THE COLUMN!

315
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,500
- LAILA, NO!

316
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,375
- ( exclaims in fear )

317
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,416
- ( all yelling )

318
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,750
- ( whimpering )

319
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,125
- LAILA, ARE YOU OKAY?

320
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,166
- I GUESS. THANKS, HOSEI!

321
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,458
( giggling )

322
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,625
- LET'S CALL THAT ONE A DRAW.

323
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,666
- SURE.

324
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,041
- Laila: YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING!

325
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,291
- ( Hosei chuckles )

326
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,208
- THAT'S RIGHT!
A THREE MAN FORCE! RIGHT?

327
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,333
- IF YOU THREE
CAN WORK LIKE THAT,

328
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,416
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU WON'T DEFEAT HIM!

329
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,791
- I CAN'T WAIT!

330
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,916
- YES, MA'AM!
AS OF NOW WE'VE GOT ALKAID

331
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,125
AND THREE OTHER DIPPER BEARERS
ON OUR TEAM.

332
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,708
TOGETHER WE CAN
TAKE CARE OF OLD FURRY LIP

333
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,791
WITH NO PROBLEM.

334
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,916
- ALL FOUR OF US? YOU'RE RIGHT.

335
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,083
WE FIGHT TOGETHER,
WE CAN TOTALLY TAKE HIM DOWN.

336
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,000
YEAH.

337
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,666
- THAT JERK DOESN'T STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST US.

338
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,208
- ( softly ) YOU'RE WRONG.

339
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,833
- I SEE. SO YOU'RE THE CHAMPION
AGAIN TODAY, ARE YOU?

340
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,041
- YOU BET!

341
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,625
- ALL I WANTED
WAS JUST A LITTLE TASTE.

342
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,250
- ( Laila grunts in anger )

343
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,458
GEEZ! YOU'RE SUCH A GREEDY PIG!

344
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,416
DON'T FORGET YOU'VE GOTTA
GIVE RYUKO HIS FAIR SHARE,

345
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,083
TOO. RIGHT?

346
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,416
- UH, NO, I'M FINE.
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

347
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,208
- HUH?

348
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,416
- OH, I THOUGHT YOU'D BEEN

349
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,791
"MISSING MY GIFTS
AT THE HEARTH SIDE"

350
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,166
ALL THIS TIME YOU'VE BEEN GONE.

351
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,875
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER, RYUKO?

352
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,625
- NO.

353
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,916
NOTHING IMPORTANT ANYWAY.

354
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,916
- MM.

355
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,708
- HAVE YOU SEEN LORD KEIRO?

356
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:35,583
- HE'S GONE.

357
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,208
HE AND ENSIGN KOCHO WENT AHEAD.

358
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,750
THEY'VE ENTERED
THE REBELS' BASE.

359
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,333
- ALONE?

360
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,458
WHY THE HELL DID THEY
EVEN BRING US ALONG?

361
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,750
- MY LORD,
THERE IS NO ONE LEFT STANDING.

362
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,916
- THIS VIEW WILL RESEMBLE
A MERE CANDLE FLAME

363
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,833
COMPARED TO THE
HOLOCAUST TO COME.

364
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,000
I'LL LEAVE MY WAKE IN ASH!

365
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,416
- AS IT SHOULD BE.

366
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,375
- ( baby crying )

367
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,875
- MY LORD, IT'S YOU!

368
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:27,125
MY LORD, I BEG OF YOU,
PLEASE TAKE US WITH YOU.

369
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,583
OUR SURVIVAL RESTS
IN YOUR HANDS.

370
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,375
A TRUE WARRIOR'S STEEL WILL RID
THIS WORLD OF SCUM AND CHAOS.

371
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,125
YOU WILL BE THE ONE
TO SET IT RIGHT.

372
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:40,416
- I HAVE NO DESIRE FOR
A GROVELING SLAVE. BE GONE.

373
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,166
- I AM BY NO MEANS A WEAKLING.

374
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,500
I WILL PROVE MY STRENGTH AND
PLEDGE MY FEALTY TO YOU, SIR.

375
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,541
- HERE IS YOUR WEAKNESS. CAN YOU
LEAVE THIS CHILD BEHIND?

376
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,791
- IF YOU REQUIRE IT,

377
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,791
I WILL SEVER MY BOND
TO MY BELOVED DAUGHTER,

378
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,375
AND TAKE UP YOUR BANNER
IN HER PLACE.

379
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,750
- ( cooing )

380
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,958
- LORD KEIRO, I GIVE YOU
ALL I HAVE, MY ONLY CHILD,

381
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,125
IN HOPES SHE CAN SERVE YOU
IN YOUR GOAL.

382
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,541
- TELL ME YOUR NAME.

383
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,791
- THAT DAY I SURRENDERED
MYSELF AND MY PARENTAL RIGHT

384
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,166
TO LORD KEIRO.

385
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,375
I AM HIS RIGHT HAND, HIS SHADOW.

386
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,666
- SHOW YOURSELF!

387
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,958
- TRULY NO MEANS TO PENETRATE
THE GENERAL'S SPHERE.

388
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,166
- I'LL PENETRATE YOUR SKULL,
YOU RAT!

389
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,333
- ENOUGH.

390
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,000
- BUT, SIR...

391
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,333
- I SAID, STOP!

392
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,875
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

393
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,250
- YES, WELL, ALKAID HAS
SEEN FIT TO PLACE HIMSELF

394
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,583
AMONG THE "NON-CELESTIAL"
LUMINARIES IN OUR FAIR CAPITAL.

395
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,208
- WHAT? THAT BRAT IS THERE?

396
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,958
MY LORD!

397
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,500
- SO YOU'VE ARRIVED.

398
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,708
I HOPE YOU'RE READY
FOR THE CHALLENGE.

399
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,750
I DO NOT WISH TO BE
DISAPPOINTED, ALKAID.

400
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,291
- ( theme song playing )

401
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,541
- Ryuko: RYUKO'S HEART
IS IN CONFLICT WHEN LOYALTIES

402
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,208
THREATEN TO RIP IT IN TWO.

403
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,958
- Shokaku: MOST OF US
WOULD DENY OUR FATE.

404
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,375
WE DON'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL
TO SEE WHAT MUST BE DONE.

405
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,250
- Ryuko: TAITO. COULD I DO IT?

406
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,708
- Taito: YOU FEELING
CRUDDY OR SOMETHING?

407
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,375
- Ryuko: NOW IT SEEMS
THE VERY PATH THAT LED ME

408
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,625
TO FORGE THOSE BONDS
DEMANDS I BREAK THEM VIOLENTLY.

409
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:54,708
- Shimei: SEE, MY FRIEND,

410
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,375
I'M A VERITABLE
FOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE.

411
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,458
KNOWLEDGE THAT CONCERNS YOU.

412
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,666
- Ryuko: NEXT TIME
ON HERO TALES,

413
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,000
UNDER THE COLORLESS
GLOW OF THE LUNAR SPHERE,

414
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,875
A HARSH TRUTH IS REVEALED,

415
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:08,000
IN CHAPTER 12:
"A GLIMMER IN THE MOONLIGHT."

416
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,208
THEN WHAT?
WE COMMIT MURDER?
