1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,500
[HARU]
What's going on with the human?

2
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,291
[grunting]

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,083
He's acting kind of strange.
Something's definitely up.

4
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:52,541
Most days,
he's usually like this.

5
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,541
But today he's like this.

6
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,833
[muttering]

7
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,583
[frustrated groan]

8
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,291
[HARU]
Hey, human, are you okay?

9
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:09,000
Did you make sure
and eat all your food?

10
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,708
Where are you going?

11
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,791
I don't want you
falling over again!

12
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,833
Wait!

13
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,958
Don't worry, I left some
extra food in your bowl.

14
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,333
I don't have any time
to hang out, though.

15
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,541
[HARU]
How dare you?

16
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,375
Well, I refuse to worry
about you anymore, got it?

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,541
Fine, then!
At least now I can nap

18
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,875
without anyone bothering me!

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,375
[sighs]

20
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,250
This is pretty much paradise.

21
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,333
[TARO]
Kitty!

22
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,791
[HARU]
Huh? What was that?

23
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,333
[TARO]
Hi, wanna play?

24
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,416
[HARU]
For real?

25
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,083
All I wanna do is nap.

26
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,458
[TARO]
Come on, let's play together!

27
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,083
None of my humans
are around here today.

28
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,416
So, I'm stuck
being all by myself.

29
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,125
I feel lonely.
I hope they come home real soon.

30
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,708
[HARU]
I'm all alone, too.

31
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:23,416
But what is that word he used?
"Lonely"? What's that mean?

32
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,458
[TARO] Huh? It's the man
from the meat place!

33
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,666
Hey, there, Taro, my buddy!

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,791
[TARO]
Aw, yeah! Pets!

35
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,416
[MAN] Who's a good boy?
You are! Yes, you are!

36
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,708
[HARU] Ugh, finally.
Some peace and quiet.

37
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:21,208
Hey, that's my food,
put that down right now!

38
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,875
Huh?
Hold on. What?

39
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,708
Where did all the food go?

40
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,166
I swear it was just here.

41
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,791
[yawns]

42
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,416
Oh, that's right!

43
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,291
Mm, so tasty!

44
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,083
Wait, gone already?

45
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:42,583
But I'm not even full yet.
Hey, give me more food!

46
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:47,041
Need some food in here!
Hang on, where is he?

47
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,166
Has he seriously
not come back yet?

48
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,291
Oh! I've got it!

49
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,916
[whimpers]

50
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,208
But, he's always in here.

51
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,958
Human?

52
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,416
[whimpers]

53
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:18,000
The smell in here is relaxing,
and this place is cozy.

54
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,375
But, still...

55
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,916
[TARO] So, I'm stuck
being all by myself.

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,833
I feel lonely.

57
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:27,458
[HARU] "Lonely."
Is that what this feeling is?

58
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:31,083
Nuh-uh!
Being here alone is no big deal!

59
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:35,291
I mean, I'm super strong!
I can totally live on my own!

60
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,333
It's not about that.

61
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,375
I'm just worried
about that human!

62
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,916
That's all! Humph!

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,875
Anyway, it's nice
and warm in here.

64
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,708
Although, if the human
were here with me,

65
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,375
it would feel even warmer.

66
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,666
[gate creaks]

67
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,500
[gasps] I know that sound!
It means he's home! Huh?

68
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,833
[TARO laughing]

69
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,041
[TARO]
Welcome home! I love you!

70
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,875
You're glad to see us,
and you've been

71
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,500
such a good boy
guarding the house today!

72
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,708
[HARU sighs]
Where is he?

73
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:26,041
He's never gone this long.
So, why? Why isn't he here?

74
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,041
I don't like it!

75
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,375
[screams]

76
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,750
What the heck is happening?

77
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,958
-[crashing]
-[angry grunts]

78
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,375
You better come home
right now, human!

79
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,041
-[angry grunting, screaming]
-[clawing]

80
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,375
[TARO] Oh, my goodness,
little kitty. What's wrong?

81
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,750
You need to calm down!

82
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:54,083
-Where the heck is that human?
-[gnawing]

83
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,583
[SUBARU] Why the heck
did I agree to this?

84
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,750
[KAWASE]
Thanks for your patience, folks.

85
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,708
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

86
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,000
Without further ado,
welcome to the first

87
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,000
official signing
for Subaru Mikazuki's

88
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,791
"Shining in the Dark of Night!"

89
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,750
Wow. We announced
this on short notice.

90
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,875
And despite that,
so many of you showed up!

91
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,041
I'm thrilled to see
such a large crowd!

92
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,666
You don't know how
happy that makes us.

93
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,666
Isn't that right, Mikazuki?

94
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,625
-Oh, no.
-[SUBARU] Take me home.

95
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,916
I can't do this!

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,250
Hey, Mikazuki!

97
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,708
You sure you're
feeling all right?

98
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,041
I wasn't in my right mind
when I agreed!

99
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,208
I didn't think the whole
thing through at all.

100
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,750
My instincts were right.

101
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,375
I can't handle this kind
of human interaction. Save me!

102
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,041
[KAWASE] It's okay.
Just take a deep breath.

103
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,333
Come on. Sit down.
Here.

104
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,750
Oh, your tie is
a little crooked.

105
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,416
[SUBARU]
Take me home.

106
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,750
[KAWASE]
It's okay. I'm right here.

107
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:05,500
[SUBARU]
Nothing is okay right now!

108
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,291
[KAWASE] All right, first guest,
we're ready for you!

109
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:13,541
-This is so exciting!
-Uh. Hi. Hello.

110
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,541
I've got this.
Just have to write my name.

111
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,583
Don't think about
anything else.

112
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,500
Be careful,
and make sure it's straight.

113
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,041
If I can just manage that...

114
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,583
It's crooked!

115
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,041
And in permanent marker!
I can't rewrite it!

116
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,583
Um, I'm so sorry.
It's crooked.

117
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:43,333
It's hopeless. I can tell
he's disappointed. I knew it.

118
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,958
I was an idiot for thinking

119
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,500
I could handle
something like this.

120
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:52,166
Oh, man! I'm gonna treasure it!
Keep up the great work!

121
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,833
-Huh?
-Thank you so much for coming!

122
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,583
Wow.
Thanks for being here today.

123
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,000
[SUBARU] They don't care
if my writing is sloppy.

124
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:08,041
Whoa, awesome! I'm your
biggest fan! Thanks so much!

125
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,041
[SUBARU] They're just happy
to be meeting me.

126
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,458
[FAN] From the very first page,
I could not put it down!

127
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,083
I was dying to find out
what was going to happen next!

128
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,416
I stayed up all night

129
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,625
and finished the whole thing
in one sitting!

130
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,958
-I'm exactly like you!
-Huh?

131
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,291
Wait, no, what I meant
to say is that I...

132
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,333
Yep, I think a lot of us
book worms can relate!

133
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,916
Oh, I understand. You've gotten
swept up by a novel, too?

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,833
And you stayed up
all night reading?

135
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:37,583
[SUBARU] How frustrating.
The words won't come out.

136
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:41,375
I write for a living.
Why can't I speak?

137
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,583
Um, sorry.
Wait, I mean... I, uh...

138
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,958
Well, hello!

139
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,958
There's no need
to be nervous, sir!

140
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,458
Uh, right. I guess not.
I... I just love this book!

141
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,625
And I've read it over
and over again!

142
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,583
I think it's my favorite ever!

143
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,666
Um, I'd be honored
to shake your hand!

144
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,916
[SUBARU]
Have I ever had the courage

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,791
to reach out
to anyone like this?

146
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,500
Let alone someone I admired?
Nope, I'm a chicken.

147
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,583
Once he starts talking
about that cat story,

148
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,041
you can't get him to stop!

149
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,833
Come on. I'm telling you, bro.
The cat's awesome.

150
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,958
[SUBARU] I couldn't even tell
them I'm the one who wrote it.

151
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:26,166
I don't deserve
to be here right now.

152
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,750
No. I'm honored.
That means the world to me.

153
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,750
Um, my name is Kota Iijima.
If you don't mind,

154
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,791
can you address
the inscription to me?

155
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,583
Ha!

156
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,916
[KAWASE] Whelp,
just about time to wrap up.

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,916
Thanks so much for all
your hard work today.

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,583
Uh, Mikazuki?
Is something the matter?

159
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:12,208
[SUBARU] Oh. No,
although... Just occurred to me,

160
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,750
I didn't thank anyone
in the first part of the day.

161
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,875
After all, they came to see me.

162
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,291
[KAWASE]
Let yourself off the hook.

163
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,958
Nobody does everything
perfectly, you know.

164
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,291
Just do your best
to thank everyone next time.

165
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,291
And until then,
we'll be working hard.

166
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,708
So there'll be a next time.

167
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,083
I really appreciate that.

168
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,000
Uh, I'll walk through the store.
There might be some stragglers,

169
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,333
and we don't want to leave
any book unsigned!

170
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,291
[SUBARU] Just beyond my fear
of reaching out,

171
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,833
there is more warmth than
I could have expected.

172
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,250
When I stop to think about it,

173
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,791
there's warmth
everywhere I look.

174
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,833
That reminds me.

175
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,291
She was meowing more
than usual before I left.

176
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,333
I was in a hurry, so I didn't
have time to find out why.

177
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,666
I left her food and water,

178
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,041
and her litter box
should be fine.

179
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,333
Is this the first time
I've been away from home

180
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,083
this long since I got her?
I hope she's okay.

181
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,541
[KAWASE] Right this way, Miss.
Ah, Mikazuki, look!

182
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,208
I found one last reader.
She rushed here to catch you.

183
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,541
[SUBARU]
Wha-- ? Oh. Uh, hello.

184
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,083
[NANA] Sorry I'm late!
I'm so glad I made it in time!

185
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,000
My younger brother
is also a big fan of yours,

186
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,583
but he couldn't make it.
He was so disappointed!

187
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,500
I thought I'd pop over here
in his place

188
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,875
and surprise him
by getting your autograph!

189
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,125
[BOTH]
Huh?

190
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,708
-[SUBARU] Huh?
-[NANA] Wait, Subaru?

191
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:48,250
-What are you-- ? Huh?
-[SUBARU] Okami?

192
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,458
[BOTH]
Huh?

193
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,958
[NANA]
Does this mean you're Mikazuki?

194
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,125
The Subaru Mikazuki?

195
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,750
[SUBARU]
I can't believe it.

196
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,583
I never imagined
this would happen!

197
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,333
Wait. Oh, gosh. Did I-- ?

198
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,416
I did. I totally talked to you

199
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,750
about "Shining in
the Dark of Night!"

200
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,416
Yeah. I couldn't bring myself
to tell you who I was that day.

201
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,875
Why? I sat there like a jerk,
not saying anything.

202
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,250
How is that any different
than lying to them?

203
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,000
She must think
I'm a complete ass.

204
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:28,625
No, it's even worse than that.
She probably feels betrayed.

205
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,833
She went to the trouble
of running down here to meet me,

206
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,125
and all she got from me
was disappointment!

207
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,625
[KAWASE] Uh, anyway,
we're happy you made it.

208
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,666
Mikazuki, how about it?

209
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,125
[SUBARU] Someone openly talked
about how much

210
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,291
they like my book,
and I can't even respond?

211
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,416
-I...
-[BOTH] I'm sorry.

212
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,666
I'm incredibly
embarrassed, Subaru!

213
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,458
I had no idea
you are who you are,

214
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,083
and I acted like
a complete idiot,

215
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,875
talking about your book
like that!

216
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,583
Huh? Wait.

217
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,166
What is she apologizing for?

218
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,500
That day you came over, I acted
like some literature expert!

219
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,375
And that must have been
so infuriating for you.

220
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,166
[SUBARU] What?
No way. She's got it wrong!

221
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,833
Makes sense. Now that I think
back about that day,

222
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,333
that's why you left.

223
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,708
You were so mad you had
to get out of there, right?

224
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:19,250
[SUBARU] Not at all! I wish...
I just... I couldn't...

225
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:23,041
No! I was really happy!

226
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,666
When you guys started talking
that way about my novel,

227
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,875
being so complimentary,
it was a first for me.

228
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,833
And now, you want my autograph?
I'm floored by it all.

229
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,750
But, that day,
it caught me way off guard,

230
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,833
and I just didn't know
how to tell you.

231
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:43,083
-I'm sorry.
-Huh? What? No way!

232
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,125
You have no reason to apologize!
I get it.

233
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,916
I'm still kind of in shock
right now, honestly.

234
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,583
Look, I haven't the slightest
clue what's going on,

235
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,375
but it seems like
there's some sort of

236
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,291
wonderful coincidence,
yeah?

237
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,041
-Guess so!
-Well...

238
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,291
like the saying goes,
it's a small world, right?

239
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,041
Oh, by the way,
how's Haru's diet going?

240
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,208
It's going really well,
thanks to you.

241
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,166
-Yay, that's wonderful.
-[KAWASE] Haru?

242
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,541
My curiosity
is officially piqued!

243
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,500
What kind of relationship
do they have?

244
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh, wow! You don't know
how much this means to me!

245
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,458
And thank you for staying
late on my account!

246
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,375
You've got yourself
two new lifelong fans

247
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,750
in my brother and me!

248
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,916
-Oh. That's nice.
-[NANA] Best of luck!

249
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,791
What? Yeah!

250
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,541
See you around
the neighborhood!

251
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,375
Crap.
I forgot!

252
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,333
I was so shocked I didn't
thank her for coming!

253
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,916
She's pretty far away
at this point.

254
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,458
Oh, well. It's fine.

255
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,291
I can go back to her store
and say thanks there.

256
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,500
I'll do that.
No. That's wrong!

257
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,791
Hey! Okami, hold on!
Thanks!

258
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,708
I'm honored
that you came to meet me!

259
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,875
[giggles]

260
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,666
She heard me.

261
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,041
[KAWASE]
Excellent work, friend.

262
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,041
[SUBARU]
I can't change the past.

263
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,250
There's no reliving the moment
once it's passed you by.

264
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,458
Hope so. It feels good.
Just that...

265
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,208
I was able to get through it.
Thank you.

266
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,750
I couldn't have done it
without you here.

267
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,125
You helped me.

268
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,375
Words can't express
how grateful I am.

269
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,958
I look forward to what
the future holds for us.

270
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,208
If I reach out my hand...

271
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,833
Wow. Thanks, Mikazuki.

272
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,458
[SUBARU]
There's always a chance

273
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,083
someone will be there
waiting there to take it.

274
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,875
I'm just so happy right now.

275
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,291
Hey, come on!
Try to pull yourself together!

276
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,791
[KAWASE]
You're right. Sorry!

277
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,500
[SUBARU]
And when someone is there,

278
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,791
it gives me a courage
I've never known.

279
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,333
If I got through this,
who knows what else I can do?

280
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,291
Or what I could change.

281
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,333
[keys jingling]

282
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,916
I didn't know
I could feel this tired.

283
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,458
All I wanna do is relax.

284
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:16,333
Wha-- ? What happened?
Did I get robbed? Vandalized?

285
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,625
Wait. Calm down.
Everything's fine.

286
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't have anything
worth stealing.

287
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,375
Haru? Haru!

288
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,958

[SUBARU]
Jeez. Are you okay?

00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,250
-You're not hurt, are you?
-[yawns]

293
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,375
Thank goodness. Wait.

294
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,500
Should I call the police
and report this?

295
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,166
Why are there tissues strewn
all over the place?

296
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,875
And what's this?

297
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,208
Scratches and bite marks
covering this novel.

298
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,791
What does the forensic
evidence lead us to?

-That the culprit is...

00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,750
You did this?

You jerk.

Hey, why are you
scooting around like a seal?

[laughs]

304
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,458
How long has it been
since I laughed out loud?

305
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:32,000
And on my own? No.
I guess I'm not on my own now.

306
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,333
[meows]

307
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,041
What is it?

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,333
Does she want more food?
Of course.

It'd be great if I could learn
to understand her better.

00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,291
It sure would be easier.

311
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,041
[HARU]
Sheesh.

312
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,291
Here I was, worried out
of my mind over this guy

313
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,791
and he just shows up
again like it's nothing.

314
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,208
-[HARU screaming]
-[crashing]

315
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,166
That punk human!
Where is he?

316
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,375
-What could he be doing?
-[scratching]

317
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,833
I can't figure it out!

318
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,750
This awful feeling
isn't going away!

319
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,500
It's driving me crazy!

320
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,208
[frustrated grunts]

321
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,416
Time to hide
in that thing he wears!

322
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,458
Oh, no! It went dark!
Now I can't see anything!

323
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,208
What is going on?

324
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,666
[exhausted panting]

325
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,375
I can't go on.
I'll just rest my eyes.

326
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,958
[HACHI]
Hey, sis, wait up!

327
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,583
[HARU]
Come on, this way.

328
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,791
We have to go
before it starts raining.

329
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,333
You guys stick
close behind me.

330
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,000
[HACHI, SIBLINGS]
Okay!

331
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,625
[HARU]
Kittens? Are you keeping up?

332
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:51,291
That's right. I don't need
to look back anymore.

333
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:55,208
It's just me.
No siblings to care for.

334
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:59,958
Just me.
But that's not entirely true.

335
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,291
Because it isn't just me.

336
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,541
[SUBARU]
Haru.

337
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,083
[HARU]
That's the signal for food.

338
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,291
[SUBARU]
Haru.

339
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,875
[HARU]
And food is important.

340
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,791
[SUBARU]
Haru.

341
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,666
[HARU] No, wait.
That doesn't mean food.

342
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:18,541
It means something else now.
It belongs to me. It's mine.

343
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,125
[SUBARU grunts]

344
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,875
-[HARU] My special sound.
-Thank goodness.

345
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,791
[HARU]
You seem like you're all right.

346
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,250
-[SUBARU groans]
-[thudding]

347
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,041
[HARU]
No! He's not all right!

348
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,250
This is why I told you
to eat all your food!

349
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,375
What's wrong with you?

350
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,416
[laughing]

351
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,541
[HARU] He's acting even
weirder than usual!

352
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:48,166
For real. You need to eat food!
Come on, this way.

353
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,833
The food bowl
is over here, remember?

354
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,833
Let's go. Follow me.

355
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,666
[wind rushing]

356
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:04,083
[HARU] That's it!
Just stick close behind me.

357
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,625
[laughs]

358
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,875
[HARU] I forgot!
I was really hungry, too!

359
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,958
[eager munching]

360
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,333
You better be eating,
human, you hear?

361
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,041
[SUBARU sighs]

362
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,250
Oh, jeez. This mess.

363
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,750
I don't even know where
to begin cleaning it all up.

364
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:27,291
[HARU] That was yummy!
It's weird, now that I've eaten,

365
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,375
that awful feeling
is totally gone!

366
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,083
I feel great!
Of course!

367
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,083
I didn't feel that way because
the human went away a long time.

368
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,583
It was just because
I was so hungry!

369
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:41,000
Food really is important, huh?

370
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,208
Good morning, Subaru, buddy!

371
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,125
I brought another batch
of my mom's famous cooking!

372
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,208
Hey, Suba--

373
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, gosh. Subaru?

374
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,541
No. My best friend.

375
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,291
He's... been murdered!

376
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,708
He's in a suit?

377
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,791
Did they dress him up
and kill him?

378
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,583
What am I supposed to do?

379
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:39,250
Did he leave these weenies
as his dying message?

380
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:43,916
Weenies. Huh.
What could it mean?

381
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,416
The culprit?

382
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,375
[screaming]

383
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,875
[HIROTO] Haru! Cut it out!
Ah! Come on!

384
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,166
[SUBARU]
Aw, dammit.

385
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,416
Guess I fell asleep
on the floor again.

386
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,291
-[HARU meows]
-[TARO] Flower.

387
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,375
[HARU] Wrong!
Okay, try this. Meow, meow!

388
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,291
-[TARO] Doodle bug.
-[HARU] Wrong again!

389
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,708
[TARO] At this rate,
I'll never learn to speak cat!
