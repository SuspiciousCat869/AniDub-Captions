318
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,166
[KAWASE] Oh, thank goodness!

319
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,625
I couldn’t get a hold of you.

320
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,541
I thought maybe
you’d passed out again. Phew.

321
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,916
I’m sorry. I just drifted off.

322
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,583
[KAWASE]
Your eyes are red.

323
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,666
Did you get
any sleep last night?

324
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,958
Uh, that’s because...

325
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,291
[gasps]

326
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,416
[SUBARU]
He ran over in the rain.

327
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Got himself soaked.

328
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,125
Listen. Kawase.

329
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,000
-I want to thank--
-Hi, Haru!

330
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,958
[HARU screams]

331
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,875
[KAWASE]
You came to say hello?

332
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,875
Such a sweet kitty!
And so cute!

333
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,958
Kawase, would you like
to feed her?

334
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,958
What? For real?

335
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,000
[SUBARU]
Uh, yeah.

336
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,000
[sighs] Precious kitty!

337
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,291
[laughs]

338
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,041
-[sighs contentedly]
-[eager munching]

339
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,750
[laughs softly]

340
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,000
[HARU]
I just love the smell of food!

341
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,875
[TARO]
I just love the smell of humans!

342
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,625
[HARU]
I think naps are the best!

343
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,083
[TARO]
I think walks are better!

344
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,333
We’re lucky to have
so many things to love.
