1
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,333
[SUBARU]
Wow, this book was great!

2
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:37,083
The main character was so cool,

3
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,375
and the plot twist at the end
really took me by surprise!

4
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,666
The whole class
should read this.

5
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,125
I wonder if anyone will.

6
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,458
Someone else borrowed it!

7
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,958
[laughs]

8
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,041
The hell?

9
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,625
What's going on
between you and Nana, bro?

10
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:35,166
[SUBARU] Is that
a philosophical question?

11
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,666
What's going on
between any of us?

12
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,541
What binds humanity together?

13
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:44,666
Friendship? Family? Love?
We are all adrift at sea.

14
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,250
Hey! Are you listening?

15
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,666
[SUBARU]
Crap. I totally wasn't.

16
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,875
[NANA] It's just
a misunderstanding, I promise!

17
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,041
He didn't mean anything.
I'm so sorry.

18
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,916
Yeah, my bad, bro.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,958
[SUBARU] It's fine, but I'm
still kind of confused, here.

20
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,958
[YUGO] Well, you were
crouched on the floor

21
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,458
like some kind of weirdo,
so I thought

22
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,250
you were creepin'
on Nana on something.

23
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,958
[SUBARU]
Creeping? Huh?

24
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,750
Do you really think
I would invite somebody

25
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,166
like that into my home?

26
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,708
You get pretty spacey
sometimes, so maybe.

27
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,625
Anyway, his name is Subaru.

28
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,375
He's a customer
from the pet shop!

29
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,666
-Now, please apologize!
-[groans]

30
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,458
[YUGO]
I regret my actions.

31
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,708
It's fine. Please get up.

32
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,375
Let's all try this again,
shall we?

33
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,125
This is my little brother, Yugo.

34
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,375
He's in eleventh grade
this year.

35
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,666
Nice to meet you, Subaru.

36
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,375
[SUBARU]
“Little” brother?

37
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,541
Are you kidding me?
He's huge!

38
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,666
Oh, right, you needed
those scissors!

39
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,458
Wait here a sec!

40
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,291
[objects clattering]

41
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,208
[SUBARU]
Can I please go home already?

42
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,458
-This is awkward.
-[meowing]

43
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,458
You two sure seem
to get along well.

44
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,750
Yeah. I come here a lot.

45
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,750
[SUBARU]
Maybe he's a nice guy after all.

46
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,625
Wait. Am I just saying that
because the cat likes him?

47
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,500
[NANA] Those scissors
were really hiding!

48
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,500
-Okay, let's do this!
-[YUGO] Do what?

49
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,416
Cut that fluffy keychain
off his cat's claw.

50
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,458
Come here, Haru.
This'll only take a second.

51
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,041
[NANA sighs]

52
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,916
And now you're free!
Much better, right?

53
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:40,125
-[SUBARU] I appreciate it.
-No prob. Any time!

54
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,458
I should go put on
some tea for us.

55
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,666
“Haru”? That's a cool name.

56
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,916
Cool? Really?

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,458
[YUGO]
For a cool cat.

58
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,416
[SUBARU]
That's a new one.

59
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,166
Scary kitty!

60
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,375
You just have resting
scary face, I guess.

61
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,916
[sighs]
Precious kitty!

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,250
[SUBARU] Nobody seems to be
in agreement about Haru.

63
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,708
I guess everyone
sees things differently.

64
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:09,041
I bet Kawase
would be surprised.

65
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,375
[KAWASE sneezes]

66
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,750
It's not fair.
Stuck at work with no Haru!

67
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,291
All I can think about
is your fluffy-wuffy fur!

68
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,625
I need loves and snugs!

69
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,458
[SUBARU]
But never mind all that.

70
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:24,125
I did what I came here for.
Time to go home.

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,750
Wait, that's the magazine
my work is published in!

72
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,958
[YUGO] Oh, this? It's a fiction
magazine called “Polaris."

73
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,958
-You heard of it?
-Well, sort of.

74
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:45,000
Actually, there's a story in
here about a cat you might like.

75
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,000
Reminds me a lot of Haru,
now that I think about it.

76
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,291
[SUBARU] What the hell
is going on right now?

77
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,083
I'm done!
I'm getting out of here!

78
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,083
Once he starts talking
about that cat story,

79
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,750
you can't get him to stop.

80
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,875
In fact, now he's even
got me reading it, too.

81
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,083
It's not just
a normal cat, though.

82
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,833
It's a kitty assassin!
Isn't that a cute idea?

83
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,583
[SUBARU]
I never talk to anyone!

84
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,125
How'd I find two people
who read my work?

85
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,916
-How far have you gotten in it?
-Uh, let me see.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,458
[SUBARU] I know I should be
grateful for readers, and I am.

87
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,250
Oh, right here, the part where
the letter arrives at the lab!

88
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,833
[SUBARU] But this situation
is too awkward.

89
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,791
[SUBARU]
I can't handle this at all!

90
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,166
I wanna talk to you about it!

91
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,375
-Read faster!
-Sorry about this, Subaru.

92
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,416
Like I said, he can go all day
when it comes to this story.

93
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,250
I really recommend it, though.
Do you read much?

94
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,750
Uh... Um, sort of.

95
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:38,500
Come on. I'm telling you, bro,
the cat's awesome.

96
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,958
[SUBARU] I've never been able
to talk to people,

97
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,416
to recommend a book that I love.
But this is...

98
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,791
[YUGO] The main guy,
he's kind of a loner.

99
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,750
He solves all the cases
without help from anyone.

100
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,375
He's so cool.

101
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,791
[SUBARU] Is this...
what I've been missing?

102
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:01,083
Hey, listen.
I should really get going.

103
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,833
Haru.

104
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,416
Thanks.
I'll see you later.

105
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,625
[NANA]
Wait! Subaru!

106
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,833
[panting]

107
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,666
I can't believe
I literally ran away.

108
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,708
[NANA]
Subaru!

109
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,083
[SUBARU]
Okami.

110
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,708
I'm sorry.
That was awkward, huh?

111
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:31,666
No. I mean, I think it was
probably my fault.

112
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,208
[NANA] It's fine. I know
my brother can be a bit much.

113
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,916
He's really not a bad kid,
I promise.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,833
But when he's talking
about the things he likes,

115
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,250
he forgets everything else.

116
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,583
[SUBARU] No, I get it.
I didn't take offense.

117
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,000
If that's the case, great!

118
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,000
Because I was going to say...

119
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,000
you're welcome to come
and visit us any time!

120
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,500
Haru too, of course.

121
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,750
[SUBARU]
I never knew...

122
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,875
or more like, I never made
an effort to find out.

123
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:14,291
But I didn't think my work
would mean so much to someone.

124
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,291
That it would have such
a big place in their lives.

125
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,833
Every book is someone's
favorite, I suppose.

126
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:25,458
Everyone's heart has a different
wish that it longs for.

127
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,291
The nights have been
getting pretty cold lately.

128
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,208
But you're nice and warm.

129
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:44,666
[HARU] Fate. Family.
A place where I belong.

130
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,125
I don't really get
any of that stuff.

131
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,250
But what I do know
is no matter what,

132
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,375
I want to protect him.

133
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,625
Uh-oh. I didn't realize this was
another cat's territory.

134
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,583
You gotta respect that.
I learned that the hard way.

135
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,916
[shrieks]

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
[HACHI]
Oh, hey. Let me introduce you.

137
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,583
This guy here is Roku.

138
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,666
He's also lived here
since forever,

139
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,708
so he knows
all kinds of stuff!

140
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,208
[ROKU]
Who are you?

141
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:21,416
[HARU] I'm Hachi's big sister.
Thanks for looking out for him.

142
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,208
[ROKU]
Ah, I've heard all about you.

143
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,833
[HARU]
I can't back down.

144
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,625
I know it's another
cat's territory,

145
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,833
but I'm here for my brother!

146
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,041
I see.
You may be young,

147
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,791
but you've been
through a lot, haven't you?

148
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,458
That look on your face
says it all.

149
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,000
I used to live outside,
myself, so I get it.

150
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,000
But now, I got a safe place
where I belong.

151
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,791
-Looks like you do, too.
-[HARU] Safe?

152
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,333
-[HACHI] Oh, hey! Yu's here!
-[HARU] Huh?

153
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,583
[HACHI]
Yu! Come on, let's play!

154
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,625
[HARU]
Whoa, that guy is massive!

155
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,083
How can you feel “safe” here
with a monster like him around?

156
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,333
[ROKU] Nothin' to worry about.
He's a gentle giant.

157
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,458
[HARU] How am I supposed
to believe that?

158
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,708
[ROKU]
Stand back. I'll show you.

159
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,125
-[HARU] Huh?
-[ROKU] This is my turf.

160
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,666
I won't let nothin' happen
to you or Hachi while I'm here.

161
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,833
[ROKU laughing]

162
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:27,541
So, yeah, uh... Like I said,
“gentle giant," right?

163
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,583
[HARU]
Something like that, sure.

164
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,208
[sighs]
But I'm an intruder.

165
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,875
Why are you being so nice?

166
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,541
[ROKU] Huh? ‘Cause you're
Hachi's sister, of course.

167
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,375
That means you and I
are family, too.

168
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,000
[HARU] “Family”?
There's that word again.

169
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,375
[ROKU] You pick each other up
when things are looking down

170
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,666
and share a laugh
when they're lookin' up.

171
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,458
That's what family's about.

172
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,458
[NANA] Come here, Haru.
This'll only take a second.

173
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,916
[snipping]

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,916
And now you're free!
Much better, right?

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,708
[HARU]
My paw is back to normal!

176
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,708
-[HARU whimpers, screams]
-[HARU] The giant! The giant!

177
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,958
[YUGO]
How far have you gotten, in it?

178
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,833
[NANA]
Uh, let me see.

179
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,416
Oh, right here, the part where
the letter arrives at the lab!

180
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,916
[YUGO] That's, like,
at the very beginning!

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,833
[HARU]
So this is family. Huh.

182
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,833
[SUBARU]
Haru.

183
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,875
[HARU]
Is something wrong?

184
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,166
Hey! Wait! What's going on?

185
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,791
[SUBARU]
Thanks. I'll see you later.

186
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,083
[HACHI] Sister!
You're not leaving me, are you?

187
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,958
Come back!

188
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,083
[HARU]
I don't want to lose you again,

189
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,291
but I have to
take care of him.

190
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,083
[HACHI]
Please.

191
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,041
[ROKU]
She can always come visit again.

192
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:05,291
[HACHI] Really? Yay!
See you next time!

193
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,958
[HACHI]
Sis, where did you go?

194
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,541
Come back!

195
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,500
[HARU] It's dark.
I can't see anything.

196
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,166
Is everyone here?

197
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,625
-[SIBLING 1] Yeah, I'm okay!
-[SIBLING 2] Sis, where are we?

198
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,708
[HARU] Wait! I think we can
get out from up here!

199
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,416
[SIBLING 1]
Are we lost?

200
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,833
[SIBLING 3]
Everything's so big!

201
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,166
[SIBLING 2]
Yeah! What is all this stuff?

202
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,958
[SIBLING 1]
Look! He's coming our way!

203
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,458
I bet he'll give us food!

204
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,958
[HARU]
I want food!

205
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,125
[ALL]
Feed me! Feed me! Feed me!

206
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,833
[MAN]
What the-- ?

207
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,625
-Ugh! I hate cats!
-[ALL] Huh?

208
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,625
[SIBLING 2]
Why is he running away?

209
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,416
[HARU]
I don't know. I...

210
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,666
[panting]

211
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,708
[terrified screaming]

212
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:10,166
[HARU] What was that thing?
It's too big!

213
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,208
[truck rumbles past]

214
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,625
[whimpering]

215
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,166
[HARU] I hate this place!
Everything's scary!

216
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,333
-[TORA] Hey you!
-[HARU gasps]

217
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,583
-[HARU] M-Mom?
-[TORA] I'm not your mama!

218
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,708
And what are you punks
doing on my turf?

219
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,541
[HARU] Turf?
I don't know what that means.

220
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,458
I don't even know
why we're here.

221
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,375
[TORA]
You're lost, huh?

222
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,000
Looks like your mom's
not around, either.

223
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,666
Unless...

224
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,041
[SIBLING 1]
Do you know where she went?

225
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,083
[SIBLING 2] I wanna go home.
Sis, I'm scared!

226
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,708
[HARU] Don't worry,
we'll get through this.

227
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm with you, I promise.

228
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,500
I'll keep you safe,
no matter what!

229
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,791
-[TORA] You.
-[HARU] Wh-What?

230
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,083
[TORA] If you wanna live,
then come with me.

231
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:14,291
[HARU] Okay. We followed her
like she said, but now what?

232
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,291
[KURO]
Hey, Tora!

233
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,833
You better get those
little brats out of here.

234
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,750
We don't got enough food
to share and you know it.

235
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,958
[TORA]
Shut up, Kuro.

236
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,125
Nobody's trying to take
your food, so calm down.

237
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,625
-[HARU] His eye.
-[KURO scoffs]

238
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:35,416
[TORA] All right, Listen up.
Living out here's not easy.

239
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,875
But if you learn to hunt
and learn to protect yourself,

240
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,208
then you should be
able to scrape by.

241
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,333
Just be sure you never
let your guard down.

242
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,791
‘Cause a fight could sneak up
on you when you least expect it.

243
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,833
You there. Look like you're
the biggest of the lot.

244
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,625
[HARU]
Uh-huh.

245
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,416
[TORA] That means you gotta
look after the runts, all right?

246
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,416
They won't last
long out here otherwise.

247
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,541
[HARU] But I don't get it, Tora.
Why are you...?

248
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,791
[TORA]
That's Ms. Tora to you!

249
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,708
[HARU]
Sorry, Ms. Tora.

250
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,333
Why are you helping us
like this?

251
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,125
[TORA]
Just felt like it.

252
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,000
[HARU]
After that, Ms. Tora taught us

253
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,250
everything we needed
to know to survive.

254
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,958
She told us how to find food
and how to hunt.

255
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:29,666
She taught us how to run away,
but also how and when, to fight.

256
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,208
She taught us about this world.

257
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,083
Our place in it,
and about our “fate."

258
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,541
It was too complicated
for me to understand,

259
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:43,333
but I knew it was important,
so I remembered every word.

260
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,833
[humming happily]

261
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:48,125
I'm gonna find a ton of food
today. I just know it!

262
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,125
There's a yummy smell
coming from over there!

263
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,375
[KURO]
Hold it!

264
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,625
-[KURO] Stay back.
-[HARU] Kuro?

265
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,625
Why?
I smelled food over there!

266
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,416
[KURO]
Look up.

267
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,500
[HARU]
What is that black thing?

268
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,458
It's so big
and creepy looking.

269
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,291
[KURO] Those beaks
and talons are sharp.

270
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,083
Even Tora and I steer clear.

271
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,000
[KURO]
Remember, you only get one life.

272
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,041
So you better
take good care of it.

273
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,166
[HARU] I thought Kuro
was mean at first.

274
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,541
He was just trying to stay
alive, like anyone else.

275
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,208
[KURO]
Right, they're gone.

276
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,583
Better look for food
someplace else.

277
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,250
[HARU]
Kuro.

278
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,458
You saved my life. Thank you.

279
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,791
[KURO]
It's nothin'.

280
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,250
[HARU] I guess there's
still a bunch of stuff

281
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,166
I don't know about the world.

282
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,666
I need to be more careful.

283
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,208
[HACHI]
You guys smell that?

284
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,583
[SIBLING 2] They've got
something yummy over there!

285
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,208
[HARU]
You're right.

286
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,666
But we can't just
run up and grab it.

287
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,708
We need to figure out
whether they're good humans

288
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,333
or bad humans first.

289
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,541
I mean, sure. But look.

290
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,416
-They already went.
-Huh?

291
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,125
-Kitty, is your owner somewhere?
-They're so cute!

292
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,458
-[MAN] No collars.
-[HARU] You bunch of fools!

293
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,166
[TORA]
Something the matter?

294
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,500
[HARU]
Ms. Tora, what should I do?

295
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,875
Meeting the right human
isn't a bad thing.

296
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,416
In fact, it can turn
your fate around.

297
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,208
Or so I hear, at least.

298
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,375
-[HARU] Your fate?
-That's right.

299
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,458
Those aren't just
any humans they met.

300
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,375
It's their new family.

301
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,125
[HARU]
Family?

302
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:50,833
I wonder if I'll have a family
like that someday.

303
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,583
[birds cawing]

304
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,833

-[HARU] You okay?
-[HACHI] Yeah.

308
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,166

309
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,916
-[KURO] Tora!
-[TORA] On it!

310
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
[HARU]
What are you gonna do?

311
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,875
[TORA] Don't worry about me.
Just run!

312
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,875
-Got it?
-But...

313
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,708
Hurry!

314
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,166
[HARU]
Let's go!

315
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,791
[SIBLING 2]
Sis?

316
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,833
[HARU]
Ms. Tora. Kuro.

317
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,875
[HACHI]
Are they gonna be okay?

318
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,833
-[SIBLING 2] Let's stop.
-[HARU] It's fine.

319
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,166
[HARU]
I have to keep it together.

320
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,291
I have to stay strong.

321
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,916
As long as I can protect them,
we'll be fine.

322
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,291
[HACHI] Sister.
We haven't eaten in a long time.

323
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,375
I'm hungry.

324
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,083
[HARU]
I know I need to look for food.

325
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,666
But if they go with me
and we run into danger again,

326
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,916
what am I going to do?
You wait here.

327
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,583
I'll come back with something
to eat real soon, okay?

328
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,541
[HACHI]
No! Don't leave us!

329
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,041
[SIBLING 2]
We'll go with you!

330
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,208
[HARU] I'll only be gone
a second. Don't worry.

331
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,083
[SIBLING 2]
Are you sure?

332
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,458
[HACHI]
Be careful.

333
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,041
[SIBLING 2]
We'll stay right here.

334
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,750
[HACHI]
Promise you'll come back!

335
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,833
[HARU]
Promise.

336
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,833
[HARU] I didn't think
that would take so long.

337
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,416
It's getting late.

338
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,625
Hope they didn't worry
about me too much.

339
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,041
What?

340
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,416
Did something happen?

341
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:57,250
What's up? Why won't you move
or open your eyes?

342
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Oh, no.

343
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,583
[HACHI]
Promise you'll come back!

344
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,833
[HARU]
Where did he go?

345
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:22,500
I looked and looked,
but I never found him.

346
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,833
This was my fault.

347
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,375
I shouldn't have
left them alone like that.

348
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,958
I was supposed
to protect them.

349
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,250
[HARU]
Wherever he'd gone,

350
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,916
I was sure I'd never
see him again.

351
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,875
But then...

352
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,208
[HACHI]
Yay! See you next time!

353
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,958
I'd given up hope,
but there he was,

354
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,166
in a nice new home.

355
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,083
Is it fate
that brought me there?

356
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,833
That brought him there?

357
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,083
[ROKU] You pick each other up
when things are looking down

358
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,708
and share a laugh
when they're lookin' up.

359
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,666
That's what family's about.

360
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,375
[HARU] “Family” again.
I still don't get it.

361
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:13,500
But if I stay with him,
maybe someday I'll understand.

362
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,583
-[door opens]
-[running footsteps]

363
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,541
Haru!
Oh, how I've missed you!

364
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,375
[meows angrily]

365
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,708
Oh, by the way.
Look!

366
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,125
My wife made me
a Haru phone strap!

367
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,041
Now I can take you with me

368
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,166
everywhere I go.
Lucky me!

369
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,583
[gasps] Haru, no.
You're gonna break your claw!

370
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:13,375
I know it's cute,
but please let go!

371
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,166
Don't tell me. You came
to visit Haru again, right?

372
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,166
Actually, not quite.
I came to bring you this.

373
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,375
Uh, surprise!

374
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,416
[SUBARU]
It's heavy.

375
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,333
[KAWASE]
Yeah, but it's heavy with love.

376
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,875
Those are all fan letters!

377
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,375
They've been piling up
at the office every day!

378
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:34,000
Your new story's been a big hit!
You should read some of them!

379
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:38,083
Might be inspirational! Huh?
How do you read this name?

380
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,083
Weird. Oshimori?
Oshikami?

381
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,416
[SUBARU]
Are you kidding me?

382
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,833
I've never met anyone
with that last name before.

383
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:53,750
[SUBARU] Yeah, that's, uh,
something else, huh?

384
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:59,541
[TORA]
Ms. Tora. Lady Tora. Tora-poo.

385
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,125
[KURO] Still don't know
what you wanna be called?

386
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,000
[TORA]
First impressions are important!

387
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,541
[KURO]
Then I'd drop Tora-poo.

388
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,625
[TORA]
I didn't ask you!
