No kitties on the counter,
okay?

316
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,416
[HARU groans] It’s that minion
from the other day!

317
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,083
If you think you can
take me one-on-one,

318
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,208
you’ve got
another thing coming!

319
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,208
[HARU]
Come to assist me, huh?

320
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,708
Good! Let’s trounce
that minion!

321
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,208
[hisses]

322
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,666
[heavy footstep]

323
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,250
Open up, you filthy traitor!

324
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,458
How dare you
treat me like this!

325
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,791
Huh? Changed your mind, then?

326
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,250
Maybe you’re not
so hopeless after all.

327
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,500
Just let me out and we’ll
settle this in no time!

328
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,875
[HARU grunts]
Fine!

329
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,958
Don’t come crying to me
when this blows up your face!

330
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,958
You’re dead to me!

331
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,458
Ah!

332
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,291
You don’t know
the first thing about gratitude!

333
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,000
I’ve been so worried about you
and this is the thanks I get?

334
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,791
[GIRL] Haru,
come and get it! Haru!

335
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,500
[HARU] I know that smell!

336
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,416
It’s the best food in the world!

337
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,708
-This is a dream come true!
-[munching]

338
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,750
It's so good!

339
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,750
Wait, I need to share
some of this food with him!

340
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,083
He’s the hungry one,
after all!

341
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,875
[gasps]

342
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:48,333
Oops. It was too yummy.
I ate it all.

343
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,916
But he looks like
he’s about to fall over.

344
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,625
That’s no good. I’m sorry.

345
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,666
I knew you were hungry, too!

346
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,125
But I couldn’t help it!

347
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,208
-[SUBARU] H-Hey.
-[HARU gasps]

348
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,375
[HARU]
You’ve got plenty of food!

349
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,500
[exhausted moaning]

350
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,125
-I was worried over nothing!
-[HARU'S GHOST giggling]

351
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,666
[HARU] But the next day,
it was the same old thing.

352
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,666
Hey! You still haven’t
eaten yet, have you?

353
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,958
Get it together, you dummy!

354
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,708
At this rate, you’re gonna
stop moving like before!

355
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,375
[screams]

356
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,333
Aw, I did it again!

357
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,708
I was supposed to save him some!

358
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,166
Great. Now what?

359
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,458
Hey, you’re gonna eat
something, aren’t you?

360
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,208
You didn’t give all
the food to me, right?

361
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,458
Huh? Where are you going?

362
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,708
Hey, come back here!

363
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,208
He’s acting all weird.
What’s going on?

364
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,333
He left all of a sudden,
came back all wobbly

365
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,833
and now he’s rooting
around in there.

366
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,541
Maybe he’s looking for food!

367
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,750
He tried to go hunting,
but he couldn’t find anything!

368
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,083
Oh, right. I ate all the food
in the food place. Shoot.

369
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,791
I better start
looking somewhere else.

370
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,041
Okay, whoa, this is new!

371
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,166
Sorry, there’s no food
in my mouth!

372
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,375
-It’s all my stomach now!
-Stay still!

373
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,458
I gotta measure
your mouth real quick.

374
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,125
[HARU fussing]
I know you’re hungry,

375
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:30,041
but you’re just gonna
have to trust me on this one!

376
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,458
How rude!

377
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,416
You must be really desperate!

378
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
But don’t worry, I’ve got this!

379
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,666
Miss Tora trained me,
after all.

380
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,375
I’m an expert hunter!

381
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,666
You’re mine now!

382
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,166
-[HARU grunting]
-[SUBARU] Hey! No!

383
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,750
[HARU]
See? I found food for you!

384
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,583
Now grab some and eat,
why don’t you?

385
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,833
Are you hungry already?

386
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,583
[HARU]
There you go. Almost there.

387
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,666
[screams]
No!

388
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,375
[HARU]
Why won’t you eat?

389
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,916
[frustrated groan]

390
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,583
-This is exhausting.
-[stomach growls]

391
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,250
Great, and now I’m hungry too.

392
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,416
But this time, I gotta
take care of him, first!

393
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,583
Wait! That smell.

394
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,583
Were you eating something
awesome in secret without me?

395
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,875
[SUBARU]
Haru.

396
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,416
[HARU screams]

397
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,833
[HARU]
I get to eat the best food...

398
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,791
Again! No! Resist!

399
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,875
He needs to eat first!

400
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,916
Hey, did you find enough food
for yourself, too?

401
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,833
I’ll eat alone.

402
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,375
[HARU sighs]

403
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,375
[HARU] Good. You finally
got something yummy!

404
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,916
Now I can eat without having
to worry about you for once!

405
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
[eager munching]

406
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,041
I feel like I’m in heaven!

407
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,500
[cries joyfully]
Ah! Every time with this food.

408
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,791
[SUBARU laughs softly]
So good.

409
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,791
[HARU] What was that?
Is he happy?

410
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:08,125
I don’t think I’ve heard him
make that noise before.

411
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,875
[HARU]
Honestly!

412
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,375
You have no idea how much
stress you put me through!

413
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,125
But as long as you’re eating
and staying strong enough

414
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,166
for another day,
then I can relax.

415
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,791
That’s all I need.

416
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,708
[HARU] Have you heard of
“eating in moderation?”

417
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,166
[TARO]
Nope. What’s that?

418
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,791
[HARU] It’s the name
of something really bad!

419
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,333
[TARO]
Oh? You mean it’s scary?

420
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,583
[HARU] Eating in moderation
is terrifying!
