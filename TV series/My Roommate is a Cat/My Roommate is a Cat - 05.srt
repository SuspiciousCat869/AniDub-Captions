I’m so happy you’re okay!

Oh, yeah. Remember?
That day...

325
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,208
Those scary flying
things came back.

326
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,375
We ran away
from them really fast,

327
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,750
just like we promised
you we would.

328
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,625
We kept running
so they wouldn’t catch us.

But the next thing I knew,

330
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,833
we got split up.

331
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,958
I was really scared, so I...

332
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:16,416
I just ran away by myself.

to be all right now.

the matter with you today?

This is no time
for food right now!

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,625
[HACHI] Food?
What about food?

359
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,416
[HARU] That word he said
means food, doesn’t it?

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,291
[HACHI]
I’m not really sure,

361
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,458
but I don’t think
it means that.

362
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,708
Because, look at his face.

363
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,916
He’s watching you
really closely.

364
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,708
I think that word means
he’s trying to call for you.

365
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,833
[HARU]
Call for me?

366
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,208
But why would he do that?

367
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,833
Am I supposed to go to him
when he calls me?

368
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,208
[HACHI] Yeah, and when you want
to call me, I have a new word!

-It’s Hachi! Like it?
-[HARU] Hachi?

00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,458
[HACHI] That lady, Nana,
told me it’s my name!

It’s a special word
that’s just for me!

we go to her,
and it makes her really happy!

375

So it makes me happy, too!

about going to the human
