Books are everything.

As long I’ve got books,
I don’t need anything else.

00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,750
This is my entire world.

A world of my very own,

00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,291
where it’s always quiet,
and I can do what--

7
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey, there! You want some stew?

[KAWASE]
Good morning, my dear friends!

9
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,041
I thought I’d stop by
and see Haru

10

-on my way to the office!

[sighs]

12

[SUBARU] I spoke too soon.

00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,958
My quiet world just evaporated.

[KAWASE sighs]

16
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,208
It’s an honor
to see you again today!

17
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,916
-Scary kitty!
-[HARU hisses]

18

You just have resting
scary face, I guess.

00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,583
[KAWASE]
You take that back!

20
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,958
Haru is the sweetest.
She’s adorable!

-[HARU hisses]

23
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,541
[KAWASE] I love her. Haru is

24
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,208
[KAWASE]
But, anyway.

25
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,791
I suppose
you two have been friends

26
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,208
for a really long time, then?

27

That’s right!

Hiroto Yasaka!

I’ve known him-- gosh,
it’s been ten years now!

30
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,500
It’s more like
parasite and host.

31
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,333
[KAWASE]
That sounds lovely.

32
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:46,125
Oh. I’m Kawase, Subaru’s editor
at Koguma publishing.

33
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,083
[HIROTO]
Well, aren’t you polite?

34
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,541
By the way, Mikazuki,
there’s something

35
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,583
I feel the need
to talk with you about.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,750
It all began yesterday
evening, up at work.

37
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,583
[sighs]

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,958
I was about to eat a doughnut
my colleague had given me

39
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,666
when out of nowhere, it hit me!

40
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,958
[gasps]

41
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,416
Yes! I was struck
by a divine revelation!

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,875
Like a bolt from Zeus!

43
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,458
How can you allow precious Haru
to parade around

44
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:16,458
without a collar?

45
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,416
[SUBARU] Why do I have
to leave the house for this?

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,000
Damn Kawase!

47
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,750
You cannot let Haru go
another moment without a collar!

48
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,541
If she got out without one,
she’d be gone!

49
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,166
Just think about it.

50
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,541
Someone might mistake her
for a stray and take her home!

51
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,125
Or even worse,
to some nasty animal shelter!

52
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,166
So, you go out
and buy her a collar

53
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,208
right this instant, understood?

54
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,125
[SUBARU]
Uh, yes.

55
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,625
He laid into me,
then ran off to the office!

56
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,708
And this guy...

57
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,791
So, why did you decide
to come with me, anyway?

58
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,666
I have to take the train home,
and the station’s on the way.

59
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,000
Let’s see.
Should be here somewhere.

60
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,250
[HIROTO]
Told you. There it is!

61
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,291
[SUBARU]
It’s the same shop.

62

[barking, meowing, chirping]

63
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,833
Can I help you?
Oh! Hi, Subaru!

64
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,166
-Do you know her?
-It’s nice to see you!

65
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,875
So, what brings
you guys in today?

66
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:57,166
-Uh, collar for Haru.
-Oh, yay!

67
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,208
So, you named your kitty Haru?

68
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,416
-What a cute name!
-[HIROTO] Yeah.

69
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,333
Thanks for being such a great
help to my buddy, Subaru, here!

70
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,875
He’s new. Never had
a pet before.

71
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,958
Think you could teach him
all there is to know?

72
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,958
Of course! That’s why I’m here!
You leave it all to me.

73
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,791
Wow, would you look at that?
An expert.

74
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,000
-Yeah, but I’m no expert--
-How rude of me.

75
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,625
I’m his best friend
of ten years,

76
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,791
so I take it upon myself
to look out for him.

77
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,166
[SUBARU]
He’s annoying and patronizing,

78
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,333
but Hiroto can be a life saver
in times like these.

79
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,958
[HIROTO] Right.
I’ll leave you to it, then.

80
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,833
[SUBARU yelps]
Hey! Don’t go!

81
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,458
[HIROTO] Sorry, dude.
My apartment’s a pig sty.

82
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,458
Gotta clean.
Good luck, though!

83
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,875
[SUBARU]
Please don’t abandon me!

84
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,583
-The collars are this way!
-Oh, right.

85
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,750
[NANA] Okay,
we’ve got lots to choose from.

86
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,500
Some of them are super cute!

87
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,416
-Ah.
-That one’s great.

88
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,916
There’s a safety release buckle

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,583
that unfastens when it gets
pulled on too hard.

90
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,125
If the collar
gets caught on something,

91
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,750
it could save the poor kitty
from being strangled.

92
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,500
[SUBARU]
Well, that's good.

93
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,000
[NANA]
There’s even a spot on the back

94
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,000
where you can write
your contact info.

95
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,708
Cool.

96
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,208
Although,
cats are picky.

97
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,291
Some really don’t like
to wear collars.

98
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,583
And sometimes, the stress
of being forced to wear one

99
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,166
can even make them sick.

100
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,208
Cats are fascinating creatures.

101
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,291
They all have
unique personalities.

102
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:25,166
All that matters is whether Haru
is comfortable with it or not.

103
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,416
Watch Haru closely.

104
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,583
It’s easy to overlook signs
of stress in cats!

105
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,291
[SUBARU] Owning a cat is a lot
harder than I thought it’d be.

106
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:38,666
By the way,
is Haru a boy or a girl?

107
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,916
Huh?
Haru’s a... girl.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,583
Aw, then you should get her
a cute, super girly collar!

109
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,458
What type-- I mean...
What color is she?

110
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,958
[SUBARU] Uh, she’s black, with,
like, these white triangles

111
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,875
around her eyes
and mouth and chest.

112
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,916
[NANA]
Yay, you’ve got a tuxedo kitty!

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I have a tuxie at home, myself!

114
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,416
Mine’s a boy, though.

115
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,375
[SUBARU]
She’s freaking out.

116
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,208
Do people really love
their cats this much?

117
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,750
[WOMAN]
A little help over here?

118
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,416
[NANA]
Be right there!

119
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,833
Excuse me for a sec
and take your time.

120
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,375
We’ll make sure you find
the perfect collar for Haru!

121
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,583
Uh, okay.

122
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,041
Hmm.

123
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,958
I mean, does it really matter
which one I get?

124
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,833
I doubt Haru’s gonna care.

125
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,958
It’s all for the person
buying it.

126
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,208
[SUBARU'S MOM]
Look at that! I knew it!

127
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,708
That blue sweater
is so lovely on you!

128
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,958
Jeez, Mom.
It’s just a sweater.

129
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, I know.
It just feels good

130
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,666
when something I get you
looks as nice as I thought!

131
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,750
[sighs]

132
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,208
[NANA] Thank you
for your patience, ma’am!

133
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,083
[SUBARU grunting]

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
[SUBARU]
Um, I’ll take this one.

135
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,375
Ooh! I think you made
an excellent choice!

136
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,083
That bow!
I’m sure Haru’s gonna love it!

137
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,791
[SUBARU]
Uh, yeah.

138
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,750
[NANA]
Great. I’ll wrap it up for you.

139
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,875
[SUBARU]
I will never get used to this.

140
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,875
[SHOPPER] Are you a cat owner,
too, young man?

141
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,166
Me? I am.

142
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,083
[SUBARU]
Crap! A complete stranger

143
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,958
is initiating
a conversation with me!

144
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:45,125
But... mine is not
as calm as this one.

145
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,583
[SUBARU]
Wait! That sounded normal.

146
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,708
Well, this gentleman has
mellowed out a lot

147
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,041
in his old age.

148
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,750
But when he goes to the vet,

149
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,458
Mr. Fluffy Britches here
goes crazy.

150
00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:00,083
Doesn’t matter how old they get,
some things will never change.

151
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,000
Sorry. Is he sick?

152
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,916
What? Not at all!
I mean for check-ups.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,708
Don’t you take
your cat to those?

154
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,958
“Check-ups?” No.

155
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,666
I haven’t had mine
for very long,

156
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,041

00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,833
[LEO] Yeah, I’m very brave.
I’m not scared at all!

313
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,791
I’ve been here before.
Three times, in fact.

314
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,541
Coming here is no big deal--

315
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,833
[screams] Ignore that.

316
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,916
-I told you, I’m not afraid!
-[RECEPTIONIST] Kagawa?

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,125
Leo Kagawa,
we’re ready for you!

318
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,291
[LEO whimpers]
I wanna go home!

319
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,000
Please, just take me
home to my bed!

320
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,041
[HARU] What do they do
to animals in here?

321
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,166
No, I can’t let it get to me!

322
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,791
If I let myself show weakness
because I’m scared...

323
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,125
I won’t be able to protect him!

324
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,416
Showing weakness means you lose.

325
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,708
That’s the way of the world.
I can’t control it!

326
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,250
[RECEPTIONIST] Haru,
we’re ready to see you now.

327
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:35,000
[VET] Okay, open up so we can
have a look inside your mouth!

328
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,916
-[VET] Come on. There you go.
-[HARU] I’m scared! I’m scared!

329
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I’m scared! I’m scared!
Why are you doing this?

330
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,583
How can he do
such awful things to me?

331
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:48,041
I was right all along.
All humans are mean to cats!

332
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:53,083
And you, how can you
just sit there and watch?

333
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,166
Is he like them?
Mean and cruel like the rest?

334
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,625
[HARU sighs]

335
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,250
That was a living hell.

336
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,583
[HARU screams]
No! What now? Who are you?

337
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,291
Are you trying to start
a fight with me?

338
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,125
[TARO] Hey, kitty.
I’ve seen you before!

339
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,166
-I know you!
-[HARU] Huh?

340
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,000
[TARO] You live in the house
next door, don’t you?

341
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,833
I’ve always wanted
to meet you.

342
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,166
I hoped that we could
be friends someday.

343
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,666
I’ve been watching that house
for a very long time.

344
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,166
There used to be a nice old lady
who lived over there, too.

345
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,166
I loved her!
She would always give me pets!

346
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,958
I haven’t seen her recently.

347
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,000
It’s been a long time, I think.

348
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,958
I wonder where
that nice lady went.

349
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,750
[HARU] What?
I don't know. Besides...

350
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,750
No humans are nice.
They’re all mean.

351
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,666
-This place is proof of that.
-[TARO] What?

352
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,250
But I always have fun
when I come here.

353
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,666
[HARU]
You’re so weird.

354
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,458
[TARO] One time,
I hurt my paw so bad

355
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,500
that I couldn’t do
my favorite thing in the world:

356
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,083
go on walks outside!

357
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,375
But then I came here,

358
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,708
and I could go on walks
again after that!

359
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,791
Ever since then, I don’t mind
coming to this place at all!

360
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,708
[HARU] Huh. But why am I here?
I don’t feel hurt anywhere!

361
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,958
They just want to poke
and prod and torture me!

362
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,500
[TARO] Oh. Well, maybe
your person was worried

363
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,666
that you might be hurting

364
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,000
and wanted to bring
you here to see.

365
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,583
[HARU]
Worried?

366
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,458
But I’m the one who has to worry
about him all the time!

367
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,041
[TARO] Hmm. But that’s just
what family does.

368
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,541
You worry about each other.

369
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,375
[HARU]
Family? What’s that mean?

370
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,083
-[TARO] I’m not sure.
-[HARU sighs]

371
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:33,291
[TARO] But still, my mom
and dad, and my big sister,

372
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,958
they all call me their family,
so it must be good.

373
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,541
They’re great.
I love them all so much.

374
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:44,750
When they feel sad, I do, too.
And I try to cheer them up!

375
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,500
[HARU sighs]

376
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,083
[HARU]
Worried. Worried?

377
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,750
-[HARU shrieks]
-[TARO] Come on!

378
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,000
-[TARO] Wanna play with me?
-[HARU] Hey!

379
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,625
[SUBARU]
Leave her alone!

380
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:05,458
[HARU] Was he worried just now?
Maybe, he is my family.

381
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,791
[HARU] You don’t need to be
worried about me, human.

382
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,750
Worry about yourself.

383
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,416
You’re in worse shape
than I am.

384
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,958
[HARU]
Hmm? What?

385
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,541
That’s a very
serious look your face.

386
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,750
I know! You’ve finally realized
you’re a terrible hunter

387
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,458
and you want me
to help you get better!

388
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:41,375
That sounds fun!
I accept the challenge!

389
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,458
-[HARU] Ha ha!
-[SUBARU grunts]

390
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,041
That poor, big, slow human

391
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,125
will never be able
catch me, of course.

392
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,041
[food clatters in bowl]

393
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,750
Food!

394
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,708
[eager munching]

395
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,291
What’s this?
What’s around my neck?

396
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,583
He’s got that worried
look going on again.

397
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,500
I’m fine. Don’t worry, okay?

398
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,583
As you can see, I’m eating,
so everything is wonderful!

399
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:24,083
Huh? He’s petting me.
Feels warm. I like this.

400
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,208
I must be extra happy
‘cause I’m full.

401
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,083
Come on, don’t just
sit and watch me.

402
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,083
You have to eat, too! Huh?

403
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,083
What is that?

404
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,666
Hold on. This sound.

405
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,916
I’ve heard it
somewhere before.

406
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,208
[HARU]
Hmm?

407
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,375
-[CAT purring]
-[bell tinkling]

408
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,458
[HARU]
Ah. What a pretty cat!

409
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,791
If I have a thing
that makes this sound,

410
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,958
it must mean
I’m pretty, too!

411
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,083
[HARU giggling joyfully]

412
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:14,416
Pretty! Ha ha! I’m pretty!
Yay! I’m a pretty kitty!

413
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,375
I can’t stand that stupid bell.

414
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,500
[HARU]
Hey!

415
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,875
Why did you take away
my pretty, noisy thing?

416
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,583
[HARU] You don’t have a jingly
thing on your collar.

417
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,375
[TARO]
I used to have one.

418
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,083
[HARU]
So, you used to be pretty, too?

419
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,291
[TARO]
Huh? Sure.
