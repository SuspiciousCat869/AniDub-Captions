[SUBARU]
Haru.

320
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,833
[HARU]
Hang on.

321
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,541
I’ve gotta figure out
how to get the food out.

322
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,291
[SUBARU]
Haru, come down here.

323
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,833
[HARU] I said hold on.
I’m trying to work it out!

324
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,666
[HARU gasps]
What’s wrong?

325
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,958
You look strange.

326
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,833
Did you have a scary dream
or something?

327
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,041
You’re so hopeless, human.

328
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,291
Okay, fine.
Get ready, here I come.

329
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,666
[BOTH grunting]

330
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,916
Hey! You’re supposed
to catch me, dummy!

331
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,041
Right on the face. Nice.

332
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,833
-[HARU screams]
-[thudding]

333
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,833
[HARU]
Jeez. I told you to get ready.

334
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,000
[crashing]

335
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,291
-[HIROTO] Subaru!
-[HARU gasps]

336
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,750
Are you okay, bud?

337
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,083
[HARU]
Human! What happened?

338
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,875
I didn’t kick him
that hard, did I?

339
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,375
[HIROTO] Corned beef with
cabbage is the best thing ever!

340
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,083
[HARU]
Good. The noisy ones

341
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,375
finally decided
to give him some space.

342
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,416
Food!

343
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,333
No, that can wait.
My human comes first right now.

344
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,041
[door slides open]

345
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,291
[HARU] Sorry I kicked you
in the face.

346
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,833
I guess I overestimated
your strength ‘cause you’re big.

347
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,625
-[clattering, yelling]
-[HARU screams, hisses]

348
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,541
You just keep still.

349
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,333
I'll stay alert and protect you
from the noisy ones.

350
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,666
That’s it.
It’ll be all right.

351
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:18,750
I’ll make sure you don’t have
any more scary dreams.

352
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,750
[YOUNG SUBARU] One day, the Sun
and the Crescent Moon

353
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,291
decided that they wanted
to trade jobs.

354
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,083
First,
the Crescent Moon said,

355
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,166
“I want to shine
when morning comes."

356
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,875
And the Sun said, “And I want to
light the world in the evening.”

357
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,875
And so, the two friends
embarked on a new journey!

358
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,166
[HIROTO]
Hey. Haru!

359
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,125
-[metal crunches]
-[HARU] I know that sound!

360
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:15,125
He cracked open
the good stuff!

361
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:18,166
You give me that.
I found it first!

362
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,375
[skidding]

363
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,166
[HIROTO]
Okay, now’s our chance!

364
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,166
Right!

365
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,125
Come on, give it back!

366
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:27,416
Oh. Well, that was easy.

367
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,083
Done. He didn’t even stir!

368
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,291
Green onions are
the best cold remedy!

369
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,250
Yes. But don’t forget that
they’re toxic to cats.

370
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,625
So, we’ve gotta
keep Haru out.

371
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,083
Last thing we want
is for her to get sick.

372
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,791
[HIROTO] Wait. Did you just wrap
the onion around him as-is?

373
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,125
Yeah. Why?

374
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,791
[HIROTO] No, no, no, no!
That’s all wrong!

375
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,125
You’re supposed to wrap it
in a towel,

376
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,708
then wrap it around the neck!

377
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,500
[KAWASE]
What? Are you serious?

378
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,291
[SUBARU] Something tells me
those dummies are both wrong.

379
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,833
And dammit.
It stinks!

380
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,291
[TARO] Hey, wanna hear
a fun story I wrote?

381
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,291
I was outside,
and you were inside,

382
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,500
and our tummies were nice
and full the whole time.

383
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,500
-The end.
-[HARU] Huh? Is that it?

384
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,291
[TARO]
Yep. Awesome, huh?
