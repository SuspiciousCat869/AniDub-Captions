00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:05,833
[HARU] But if I can help it,
you’ll never be in trouble.

321
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:09,333
I’ll make sure your face looks
that happy all the time.

322
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,875
[SUBARU] But if I can help it,
you’ll never feel scared.

323
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,833
I’ll protect you.
Keep you safe and warm.

324
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,708
[HARU]
As long as we’re together...

325
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,041
[SUBARU]
There’s nothing to worry about.

326
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,625
-My roommate is a cat.
-[HARU] On his lap.

327
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,500
[SUBARU]
And sometimes...

328
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,041
-[HARU] On his head.
-[SUBARU] On my head.
