00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,624
<i>(Usagi) Ooh, a dance party!</i>

2
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:25,659
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) Why's Mako</i>
<i>acting so strange?</i>

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,494
<i>(Usagi) It's called love at</i>
<i>first sight! But wait, that</i>
<i>guy...</i>

4
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,965
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) Yeah! I saw him</i>
<i>dancing with lots of other</i>
<i>girls!</i>

5
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:36,670
<i>(Usagi) What a jerk! How dare he</i>
<i>toy with Mako's feelings and</i>
<i>cheat on her like that!</i>

6
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,639
In the name of the Moon...

7
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,674
(Both) We'll punish you!

8
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,990
<i>"Destined Partners? Makoto's</i>
<i>Innocence."</i>

9
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:43,243
Bah.

10
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:48,081
The Sailor Guardians have
defeated you. Time and Time
again.

11
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:53,119
Tell me, do the three of you
think you'll ever manage to
capture Pegasus, or is that
asking too much?

12
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:56,523
With all due respect,
Madame Zirconia...

13
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,802
We've used the Dream Mirror to
peer into the beautiful dreams
of so many humans, I've lost
count!

14
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:05,471
And we haven't been able to find
the slightest trace of Pegasus
in any of them!

15
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:11,778
Good grief. That's the problem
with you young people today, you
don't know how to think for
yourselves.

16
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:16,482
<i>(Zirconia) If what you're doing</i>
<i>isn't working, then use your</i>
<i>heads and come up with something</i>
<i>else...</i>

17
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:18,819
<i>(Zirconia) ...you worthless</i>
<i>good‐for‐nothings!</i>

18
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,287
Or I'll find someone
who will.

19
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:23,189
[Sighs]

20
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,733
Well, it's easy for her to say.
How does she expect us to find
something that just isn't there?

21
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:37,804
Exactly, especially when all
we've got to work with are
miserable targets like these.

22
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:42,175
Yeah, a bunch of silly, lovesick
college co‐eds. So boring.

23
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:44,244
Fine. I'll take them
all myself, then.

24
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:46,747
What do you mean?
What are you up too?

25
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:48,148
A whole new approach.

26
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:52,052
I've been thinking, why waste my
spectacular good looks seducing
one girl at a time,

27
00:03:52,152 --> 00:03:54,988
when I can have dozens of them
swooning over me?

28
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:59,826
Quantity over quality, huh? Even
a lousy marksman can get lucky,
is that it?

29
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:05,105
[Coughing] Yuck!
I hate carrots!

30
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:09,510
You think you can handle that
many at once? Yeah, good luck
with that.

31
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:15,348
It's called using my head, but
of course, you wouldn't
understand that. Watch and
learn, losers.

32
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:16,349
Huh?

33
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:18,519
What's with him?

34
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:19,853
Beats me.

35
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:21,888
Huh?

36
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:25,926
He dropped one.

37
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:42,308
[Laughing/Talking]

38
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,453
You think I went a little
overboard with this dress?

39
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:56,089
Oh, no! Not at all!

40
00:04:56,122 --> 00:04:58,124
That's right, this is a college
event,

41
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:03,069
and the competition is
cut‐throat, so you've got to
stand out if you want to catch
the biggest fish.

42
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,940
Hey! So you all made it!

43
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,408
Oh, hi Mamo!

44
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,814
You're all dressed to the nines.
Could it be for the dance party
in the gym, I wonder?

45
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,916
Yup, you guessed it!
We can't wait!

46
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,321
Our college dance party is
becoming known to the general
public as an unofficial
match‐making event.

47
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:26,693
Yeah, 'cuz you never know if
the next person you dance with
might end up being that special
someone.

48
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:31,131
By the end of it, a lot of dance
partners are serious couples,
and some even get married.

49
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,266
Did you say married?

50
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,304
That's right! Now that you
mention it, brother, I seem to
recall that's how you hooked
Reika.

51
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,973
[Gasps]

52
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:40,941
Yeah?

53
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,276
[Grunts] Not you too,
Mamoru!

54
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,145
Hey, we're wasting
time, girls!

55
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,381
Yeah! Our fateful encounters are
in there waiting for us!

56
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,285
[Laughing] Yeah, c'mon, Mamo!
C'mon hurry up!

57
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,353
I'm coming, I'm coming.

58
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,855
Don't hurt him, Usagi.

59
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:04,070
<i>My fateful encounter...</i>

60
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:28,328
You're not looking
very happy, Mako.

61
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, it's just that when you're
tall like me, no one ever asks
you to dance, but I'm used to
it.

62
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:37,003
I'll ask you to dance,
if you want.

63
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:39,205
Why not?

64
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:47,213
[Laughing]

65
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,882
Whoah!

66
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:51,084
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) Look at Mako go!</i>

67
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:52,185
<i>Woo!</i>

68
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,736
<i>(Tiger's Eye) That tall one's</i>
<i>not bad, not bad at all.</i>

69
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,874
Unfortunately, she isn't one of
the beautiful dreamers I'm
after.

70
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:12,045
Still, there's no reason I can't
use her to get the ball rolling.

71
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,783
Is it over already?

72
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:17,551
What happened?

73
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:20,253
Coming through, excuse me.

74
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:23,790
May I have this dance?

75
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:27,994
Huh? You want
to dance with me?

76
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:47,748
What do ya know.

77
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:49,415
Where did he come from?

78
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:18,118
<i>Am I dreaming? Dancing never</i>
<i>felt like this before.</i>

79
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:23,957
<i>(Makoto) [Sighs] Wouldn't it be</i>
<i>wonderful if this was my fateful</i>
<i>encounter.</i>

80
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:33,466
[Sighs]

81
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:36,803
All right, girls. All right.
Calm down. One at a time!

82
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:44,477
<i>Look at this. I threw in a sprat</i>
<i>and caught a whale. Hm! See what</i>
<i>I'm capable of when I put my</i>
<i>mind to it.</i>

83
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,180
Scuze me?

84
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:49,716
Oh, the sprat. Hello.

85
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:52,318
Do you think you might want
to dance with me again?

86
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:55,321
I'm all booked up.
But maybe later.

87
00:08:58,024 --> 00:09:00,160
Ooh, that is...

88
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:02,335
Definitely love at first sight.

89
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:04,370
She's fallen
hard, all right.

90
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:06,072
[Sighs]

91
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:12,513
Say what? You're kidding, so
Mako's just been waiting around
the gym ever since?

92
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:18,051
Yeah, she said she didn't want
to go anywhere in case that
blond guy came back and wanted
to dance with her again.

93
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:23,123
You know Mako, when she falls
for someone, she falls all the
way. It's like a bottomless pit!

94
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:26,192
Chibi‐Usa said she was going to
try and go get her.

95
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,862
I think maybe we should
all go check on her.

96
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:39,039
<i>And that concludes our dance</i>
<i>party for today. Thank you all</i>
<i>for coming and we hope everyone</i>
<i>will join us again, tomorrow.</i>

97
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,041
<i>[Talking]</i>

98
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,076
[Gasp] That must be him!

99
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:47,080
Oh. Why are you still here?

100
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,383
Hey! Watch your attitude! You're
not very nice!

101
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,886
Mako's been waiting forever to
dance with you!

102
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:58,224
Well, that's a problem. You see,
I promised all these other
lovely ladies that I'd dance
with them.

103
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:00,160
Oh, I'll wait!

104
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:01,201
But Mako...

105
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,738
Yeah! It's all right. I can wait
till you're done.

106
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:10,410
<i>Hmm. I don't have time to waste</i>
<i>on a girl who's not on my list</i>
<i>of beautiful dreamers.</i>

107
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,345
Well, maybe later.

108
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,683
Hey, it's that
blond guy!

109
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:21,021
Did he just leave you? Wow,
that's pretty cold. What a jerk!

110
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:25,859
No, I admire him for not wanting
to break the promises he made to
those girls.

111
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,228
Besides, he remembered who
I was and everything.

112
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,931
Yeah, I guess that's true,
but...

113
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:35,435
Oh well, the dancing is over for
the day so how about we all just
head home.

114
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:42,042
Nah, you all go on ahead, I
think I'll wait. Just in case he
comes back here again.

115
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,410
<i>Oh, Mako...</i>

116
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,386
Pegasus?

117
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:59,826
I don't understand how Mako can
be so crazy about that guy
already. She only met him today.

118
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:08,241
Where feelings are concerned,
time is irrelevant. If the right
person came along, you might
fall in love at first sight too.

119
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,743
Huh?

120
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:15,949
I guess so.

121
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:21,487
When you fall deeply in love,
you become blind to everything
else around you.

122
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:24,324
<i>(Usagi) What?</i>
<i>Are you sure?</i>

123
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:29,429
What's the matter?

124
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,465
It's Mako! She still hasn't
come back home yet.

125
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,867
Huh?

126
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,508
Mako!

127
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,210
Usagi, what's up?

128
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:12,412
<i>(Usagi) Mako, why are</i>
<i>you still here?</i>

129
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:18,418
I can't possibly go home while
there's even a chance he might
come back. I'd never forgive
myself if I missed him.

130
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,222
But you don't even know who he
is or where he's from.

131
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:25,225
True. But that's why I want to
see him again.

132
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:27,027
But Mako...

133
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:34,100
This is why I came! It was my
dream to wear a beautiful dress
and dance with my Prince
Charming.

134
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,172
<i>(Makoto) And my dream came true!</i>

135
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:44,711
If I let my Prince Charming get
away now, I'll regret it for the
rest of my life.

136
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,950
<i>(Ami) You'll really regret</i>
<i>catching a cold by staying out</i>
<i>here in the rain.</i>

137
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,450
Huh?

138
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:54,354
What are you all...?

139
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,056
<i>(Rei) Here, use this.</i>

140
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,191
We're gonna wait
here with you.

141
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,136
Ooh, yeah! Great idea! We'll
hang out together and tell
stories all night long!

142
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:05,105
Sorry, everyone.

143
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:07,908
Hey, no need to be sorry, Mako.

144
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,275
Good luck!

145
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:12,478
Let's leave this to the others

gosh, I'm so happy you made the
right choice!

151
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,748
Hold on! Wait a minute!

152
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:51,785
Get over here, Fish's Eye! What
the hell do you think you're
doing?

153
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,253

Wow, I totally forgot all
about you, Tiger's Eye.

156
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,359
Huh?

157
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:04,104
Yeah, Mako better eat
something or she just might
collapse form hunger.

158
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:05,305
Huh?

What is that?

163
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:19,219
You dropped this from that huge
stack of photos back at the bar,
so I figured that I'd better
come deliver it to you.

164
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:23,389
But then I got distracted by all
these cute boys here and I
forgot all about it.

165
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:28,294
That's so typical of you, Fish's
Eye. [Gasps] It's that girl!

00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:29,796
You know her?

167
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:30,797
Sort of.

168
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:32,465
How's it going, by the way?

169
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,971
After all that boasting about
what a stud you are, it would be
kind of embarrassing if you came
up short.

170
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:40,040
It's going great, as
a matter of fact.

171
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,846
I can't keep the girls off me,
they're like flies to honey. I
can nail twenty of them at a

[Chuckles] I will.

He's a womanizer!

177

That's unforgivable! This guy's
nothing but a lousy playboy!

Hmm!

They're gone!

181
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,962
Hmm. Huh?

182
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:33,734
I can't tell you how touched and
honored I am that you waited for
me.

183
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,970
I was starting to think you
wouldn't come back.

184

Don't be silly! How could I
possibly resist a wonderful
woman like you?

185

Really?

<i>be the one seducing her!</i>

187
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:58,224
I waited because I believed in
you. I knew you'd come back to
dance with me.

188
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,234
Believed, in me?

189
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:04,838
Why would you do that? Why do
you trust me so much?

190
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:06,139
Huh?

191

[Gasps]

207
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,711
You've got yourself to blame.

208
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:49,215
You must be out of your mind to
put your trust in someone after
you've slow‐danced with him one
time.

209

A woman's intuition is
like telepathy!

We can sense when someone's
toying with the heart of a young
girl blinded by love at first
sight!

226
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:05,371
