Palla‐Palla hates losing. Granny
was wrong: This wasn't fun at
all!

The building!

321
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:50,687
Everything's gone!

It was all an illusion.

(Child)
Where are we? What
happened to us?

324
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:04,794
I swear we were just
at the dentist's...

325
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:08,194
Mommy! Guess what! My tooth
doesn't hurt anymore!

326
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:09,794
Yeah! My toothache's gone!

327
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:14,061
Looks like the enemy had put
cavities into their teeth. So,
they're all better now.

328
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:19,894
That's great! So... I guess
that means we were worried for
nothing!

329
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:21,094
Let's see.

Hey. They're still gross.

332
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:33,027
Then...that means our teeth...

333
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:34,794
have real cavities!?

334
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:37,527
Noooo!

335
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:41,861
Calm down! It's all right. You
can get your teeth fixed at the
dentist.

336
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:45,694
And by dentist, you mean...

337
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:48,094
That place? Of horrors?

338
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:56,461
That's right. Open wide. You'll
be fine in no time. [creepy

339
00:21:56,527 --> 00:22:01,934
No! I wanna go home!

340
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:05,101
That sound. That smell.
I'm so scared!

341

Mamo, Mamo! You promised me
you'd hold my hand.
