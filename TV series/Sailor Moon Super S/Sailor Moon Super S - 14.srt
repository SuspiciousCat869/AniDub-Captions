You mean Takano? He's studying
painting at an arts school.

He said I "inspire his
creative urge."

He's even asked me to "model"
for him, know what I mean? In
the nude.

I can't see!
(Rei) I wonder how she's
gonna get out of this?

149
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:54,320
Calm down, Minako. Let's just
assess the situation.

150
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,893
Two handsome guys are waiting to
have dates with you.
Opportunities like this
don't happen every day.

151
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:05,005
That's right! So come on, full
speed ahead! You can make this
work, you know you can!

152
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:06,840

Sorry to keep you
waiting, Torajima.

156
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:18,251
I was starting to wonder.

157
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:23,456
[Panting] Boy am I hot.
I ran to get here.

158
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,858
I'd love a cold drink.

159
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,593
Then let's go get one.

160
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:34,367
Oh I'd really rather be where
there's lots of sunshine and
fresh air, you know, somewhere
like right here!

161
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:37,971
Fine with me. I'll
go get us some drinks.

162
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:42,609
Oh, that'd be great.
I won't go anywhere!

Oh, Minako.

I lost track of the time!
I am such a knucklehead!

167
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:59,626
So, anyway, I was thinking,
it's such a beautiful day, do
you wanna go see a movie?

168
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:04,571
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, c'mon,
slow down! What's the rush?

169
00:12:04,671 --> 00:12:06,907

You stupid girl!

245
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:15,816
Not only stupid. What really
pisses me off is that you're
incredibly indecisive.

00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:20,020
It can't be! You tricked me! The

want you anyway.

304
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,498
[Grunts] Artemis?

305
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,734
Are you okay?

306
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:37,571
You idiot! I'll deal with you
once I've finished with these
bumpkins!

307
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:38,572
You and what army?

308
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:43,977
What a couple of jerks! How
selfish of them to ruin my
perfect method of two‐timing!

309
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:47,313
They're gonna pay for that!

310
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:48,915
[Grunts]

311
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:49,816
What the?!

312
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,752
Time to transform!

313
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:52,686
Hmm.

314
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:59,359
Venus Star Power Make Up!

315
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:19,520
Now finish them off, you two!

316
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,289
See‐saw! See‐saw! See‐saw!

317
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:24,791
<i>(Minako) Hold it!</i>

318
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:27,861
There's another Sailor Guardian
you've forgotten about!

319
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,295
Venus!

320
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:31,698
Why can't you all show
up at the same time!

321
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:35,335
You jerks! What you two
did is unforgivable!

322
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:36,703
Oh yeah? What's
it to you?

323
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:40,741
I am Sailor Venus! Goddess of
love and beauty!

324
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:42,976
And now, feel the wrath...

325
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,211
Of my amazing ...

326
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:48,381
...Crescent Beam Barrage!

327
00:19:48,414 --> 00:19:49,716
[Screams]

328
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:51,484
(Both) What's she so
upset about?

329
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,555
[Screams]

330
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:55,756
Now's our chance!

331
00:19:56,757 --> 00:20:01,267
Please Pegasus! Protect
everyone's dream!

332
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,707
Twinkle Yell!

333
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:33,967
Moon Gorgeous Meditation!

334
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:50,350
Stage Out!

335
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,693
You'll be sorry!

336
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,535
Not today, but soon!

337
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,538
<i>(Minako) Girls?</i>

338
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:05,772
(All) Huh?

339
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,343
Sorry.

340
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:16,349
[Giggling]

341
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:19,886
Rats! I thought I had
it in the bag this time.

342
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,857
Looks like we both came up empty
so let's just call it a draw.

343
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:25,391
Fine with me.

344
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:29,295
Wait. If you both lost, doesn't
that mean you both have to go
away?

345
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:31,297
(Both) What was that?

346
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:33,700
Just kidding, can't you
boys take a joke?

347
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,938
Mina, we should go.
The others are waiting.

348
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:39,973
Mm‐hm.

349
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:42,709
Artemis?

350
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,110
Hm?

351
00:21:44,144 --> 00:21:48,715
I can't belive I let those guys
play me like that. I feel so
dumb.

352
00:21:49,415 --> 00:21:52,719
From what I could see, you had
them going pretty good too.

353
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:58,892
Anyway, maybe that's how it
really works. Only after
experiencing many different
relationships...

354
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,001
...do you find your one true
love.

355
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:04,905
Thanks, Artemis.
Okay, let's go!

356
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,413
<i>I bet he's right. Everyone I</i>
<i>meet, they're all leading up</i>
<i>to that one special someone</i>
<i>I'll find some day.</i>

357
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:55,722
<i>(Usagi) I wonder, what if</i>
<i>we weren't always together?</i>

358
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:57,357
<i>(Mamoru) What do you mean?</i>

359
00:23:57,624 --> 00:24:00,901
<i>(Usagi) What would happen to our</i>
<i>feelings if we were seperated</i>
<i>for twenty years?</i>

360
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:02,736
<i>(Mamoru) Who knows?</i>

361
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:07,307
<i>(Usagi) I'd make you a pot of</i>
<i>pot‐au‐feu to eat when you</i>
<i>return. Wouldn't that be so</i>
<i>romantic?</i>

362
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:08,875
<i>(Mamoru) Ew, twenty‐year</i>
<i>old pot‐au‐feu?</i>

363
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,611
<i>(Usagi) That's not what I meant!</i>

364
00:24:12,245 --> 00:24:15,882
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon SuperS:</i>
<i>"The Secret Mansion: A Menu of</i>
<i>Love for You."</i>

365
00:24:15,982 --> 00:24:18,051

<i>messenger of love.</i>
