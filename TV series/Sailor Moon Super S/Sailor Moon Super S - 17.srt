this is because I

00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:23,724
Every single time,
you brats barge
in and spoil
my fun!

296
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:29,395
Come forth, my lovely Lemures,
Ponko, the Pandemonium
Professional Regurgitator!

297
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,902
Boinng!... Boing!

298
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:37,237
Ahhh!

299
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:44,244
[gulping] Ha!

300
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,278
I don't
get it...

301
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:46,513
what's she
planning
to do?

302
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:50,917
Boink! Boink! Boink!
Okay, call it!
Red or white?

303
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:53,419
Boink! Boink! Boink!
Which? Red or
white?

304
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,421
Uhhh...? Wwwhite?

305
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:56,590
You're wrong!

306
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,526
Boink! Boink!... Bleh!...
Red!

307
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:01,267
THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS, SO DO
NOT IMITATE!

308
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,435
(SAILOR GUARDIANS) [Ooh's and
ahh's]

309
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:03,937
Whoahh... Really good...

310
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,438
That was
incredible.
Wow!

311
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:06,940
Boink boiinng!

312
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:08,441
Huh?

313
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,577
[screams]

314
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:14,447
[grunt] Boink! Boink! Boink!
Try again, red
or white?

315
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:16,583
Boink! Boink! Which
will it be?

316
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:19,152
Who cares? We
don't wanna play
anymore!

317
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,622
If you don't
choose, then you
get the big
one...

318
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,090
[grunting]

319
00:18:24,157 --> 00:18:25,291
Ba‐boink!

320
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,093
Huh?!

321
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,563
Ahhh!

322
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:31,264
[gasp] Sailor Moon!

[groans]

324
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:35,068
Hm!... Now for
those dreams of
yours. Let's have
a look!

325
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:37,437
Ahhh!

326
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:40,440
Oooh, what beautiful
dreams! And so
tidy, too!

327
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:42,075
Leave her alone!

328
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:42,275
Ahhh!

329
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:47,280
Very nice. But
no Pegasus. How
disappointing. [grunt]

330
00:18:47,614 --> 00:18:51,084
[growl] They're all yours,
Ponko! Get rid
of them!

331
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:52,452
Bing‐bong!

332
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:55,121
So annoying! [grunt]

00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,625
[groaning]

334
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:03,436
Boiinnng... Now for
the climax of
our show!

335
00:19:04,004 --> 00:19:07,140
[grunt] Boink! Boink! Boink!
Watch out, it's
a big one!

336
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,479
Boink!... Boink! Boink!... Come
on, big silver ball!... Here we
go...!

337
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,982
Boink! Boink! Boink! [grunt]

338
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,285
[gulping] Ah! Hey‐‐!

339
00:19:21,154 --> 00:19:25,992
The beach is a
garden for beautiful bikini‐clad
blossoms, not a place for
exploding bombs.

340
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,562
You should have
saved them for
the fireworks show
tonight.

341
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:30,897
You came, Tuxedo Mask!

342
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:32,132
Right in the
nick of time!

343
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:37,237
However far off I
may be, the love in
my heart will bring me
running to you.

344
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:39,405
Well, you're gonna
be sorry you
did!

345
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:44,410
Because, just for that, I am now
going to unleash my ultimate
super‐secret surprise weapon,
which is a bomb that I call‐‐

346
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:50,416
Ooh! Wow, that was
close, I almost gave away
the super‐secret surprise...

347
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,519
Anyway, are you
gonna be sorry!
Boink! Boink‐‐!

348
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:54,254
Watch out, here
comes another one...!

349
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:56,389
You guys! Her mouth!
Cover her mouth!

350
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:57,423
Oh!

351
00:19:57,524 --> 00:19:58,224
Uhhh...

352
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:00,333
Her mouth, not
your mouth,
you twit!

353
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,135
Like... <i>this!</i>

354
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,105
Ah‐‐ omph!

355

[muffled struggles]

356
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,476
Chibi Moon! Sailor
Moon! Now, girls!

357
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:15,549
Please Pegasus! Protect
everyone's dream!

358
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:22,388
Twinkle Yell!

359
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:49,082
Moon Gorgeous Meditation!

360
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:05,939
Stage Out!

361
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:18,719
[sigh of relief]

362
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:20,954
Uh, wha' happened?

363
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:22,455
(CHIBI‐USA) Shingo!

364
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:24,457
(USAGI) Oh! You had us
so worried.

365
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,059
[gasp] Where's that creepy
guy?!

366
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:30,230
Don't worry, it's all
over. Sailor Moon and
the others took care of
him.

367
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:33,233
Oh, geez. What
a great bodyguard
I turned out
to be.

368
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,902
When you really
needed protection, I
was useless...

369
00:21:36,436 --> 00:21:41,074
Don't be silly, you
protected me until
Sailor Moon could arrive
and save me.

370
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:42,909
Thanks for that.

371
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:44,077
[embarrassed chuckle]

372
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:54,588
Well, even if we
didn't meet any cute
guys, it was still a pretty
good day.

373
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:57,423
Think we'll still
be single when
we come back
next year?

374
00:21:57,758 --> 00:21:59,593
Well I'm going
to come back
here with Mamo!

375
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:00,166
[annoyed grunts]

376
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,435
Yeah, I'm going
to come back
with Mamo, too!
