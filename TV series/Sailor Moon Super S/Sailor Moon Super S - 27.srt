157
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,826
I guess she didn't want to
clean up.

158
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,326
Huh!?

159
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,126
[groan] This all happened
because of that annoying
little brat!

160
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,026
No, this was all your fault.

161
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:29,060
And besides, you know better
than to try beating Makoto in
handcrafted skills like
knitting.

162
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:31,126
I can't match her in
strength, either!

163
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,693
That's not the point!

164
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,860
Instead of wasting your time
trying to win brownie points
with the principal,

165
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:39,160
you should focus on helping the
school with all your natural
gifts

166
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:40,826
the things
you're best at.

167
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,293
You're right! That's
how I'll beat her!

168
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,726
Uh, I think you
misunderstood me.

169
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:52,893
I was so dumb! Obviously I
shouldn't try to compete with
Mako by doing what she does
best!

170
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,960
So what if Mako's good
at crafts and cooking?

171
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:59,293
...I can sing!

172
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:01,100
Oh, dear lord...

173
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:07,300

will fall head over heels for
me!

You're lucky, Mako. Your dreams
are so simple. And they're right
in front of you.

235
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,920
But my dream of becoming an idol
feels like it's out of reach.
Like it's over a billion light
years away.

struggle because their dreams
are a lot easier to achieve.

239
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,426
So you really think my dreams of
opening a flower store and
having my own family will be
easy ?

cooking, or decorating, or
sewing, or toy making...

242
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:09,693
I had to work hard to learn
how to do those things.

243
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,993
And you have no clue how hard
I'm working to become a teen
idol!

Hey, calm down, you two!

Shut up, Artemis! Stop
catronizing us!

That's right. It's the whole
reason we're hosting this
bazaar.

249

Everyone is helping me realize
this dream.

250
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,760
But, that's such a tiny dream.

251
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,860
Well, I guess that explains why
your school festival is so small
and cheap.

Sorry, I should explain.
This is the children's dream.

255
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,526
I'm doing this so they can see
how it feels when their dreams
big or small come true.

256
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:52,093
Here's a better idea. Why don't
I transform that dream into a
nightmare?
