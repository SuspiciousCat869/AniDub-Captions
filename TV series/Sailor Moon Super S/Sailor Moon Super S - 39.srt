maiden.

155
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:38,805
Do you really have to go?

156
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:41,474
Just when we were finally
getting to know you.

157
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:44,845
There's an empty room at our
shrine that you'd be more than
welcome to stay in.

158
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:50,551
Thank you. But I'm afraid I
can't remain in your world much
longer now that peace has come.

159
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:54,855
I must return to the sacred land
of Elysion to protect the Golden
Crystal.

160
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:56,857
Aw, that's too bad.

161
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:03,269
My Prince, Princess, it's thanks
to you that I was able to
fulfill my duty.

162
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,540
We should be thanking you.

163
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,008
It was you who saved this world.

164
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:10,276
<i>(Mamoru) And me.</i>

165
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,346
He's right. For a moment I
thought we were done for.

166
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,015
Yeah, you can say that again.

167
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:17,851
Come on, Chibi‐Usa! Stop being
shy all of the sudden!

168
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:20,954
Hey, let go! And I'm not being
shy.

169
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,390
Chibi‐Usa, may I?

170
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,392
[gasps]

171
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,666
No way!

172
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,300
Now even Chibi‐Usa...

173
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,637
Has gone and beat us to the
punch.

174
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,742
My young maiden...I'll never
forget you.

175
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,877
Same here.

176
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,979
Hmm?

177
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,881
<i>(Ves‐Ves) Uh look! A UFO!</i>

178
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,883
What? Where? I don't see it!

179
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,418
[sighs]

180
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,925
There, you see? I'm still
capable of a little magic even
without my orb.

181
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:01,034
Well, should we get going then?

182
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:04,905
What? Without even saying
goodbye to everyone?

183
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:08,341
Sad farewells are
definitely not our thing.

184
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:11,678
Don't worry. I'm sure we'll be
seeing them all again someday.

185
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,394
Pegasus!

186
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:35,035
Farewell, young maiden. I can't
thank you enough for everything
you've done for me.

187
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:39,706
Wait, Pegasus, wait! Please
don't go yet!

188
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:42,909
[heavy breathing]

189
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:56,089
I never got a chance to tell you
anything. I never even told you
what my dreams are.

190
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:57,090
<i>(Usagi) [soothing sigh]</i>

191
00:21:57,223 --> 00:21:58,625
[gasps]

192
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:00,901
I'm sure you'll
see him again.

193
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:04,671
Mhm! You're right.

194
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:09,075
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) Yes. I'm sure we</i>
<i>will meet again.</i>

195
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:13,914
<i>And when we do, I'm going to</i>
<i>tell him all about my dream.</i>

196
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:56,189
<i>(Queen Nehalennia) How the</i>
<i>flames of my hatred still burn!</i>

197
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:58,191
<i>(Usagi) Nehalennia? But how?</i>

198
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:01,802
<i>(Queen Nehalennia) Now that I've</i>
<i>returned you don't stand a</i>
<i>chance against me!</i>

199
00:24:01,902 --> 00:24:04,204
<i>Not even your new allies can</i>
<i>save you!</i>

200
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,709
<i>(Usagi) New allies? [gasps] Is</i>
<i>that? Haruka! And Michiru, too!</i>

201
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:14,981
<i>Next time on Sailor Stars: "The</i>
<i>Flower of Nightmares Scatters:</i>
<i>The Queen of Darkness Returns."</i>

202
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:17,918
<i>The moonlight is a messenger of</i>
<i>love.</i>
