(KOBAYASHI) Hey, Saori. Have
you ever been to Chiba's place
before?

9
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:24,725
(SAORI) No, never.

10
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:29,395
I'm willing to bet
a guy like him keeps
his place pretty messy. What do
you think?

11
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:32,398
How should I
know? What makes
you think it
would be messy?

12
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:36,402
Because real men
aren't big on
tidying up. That's
why!

13
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:43,409
Well, then, I
guess your place
is spotless, huh,
Kobayashi.

Ooh, ouch!

15

think he's gonna
invite his girlfriend
over?

May we come in?

Hey! Thanks for coming, guys!
Come on in!

Yeah, I'm actually
a little disappointed
in him.

Uh?!

Something bugging you?

29
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:24,625
Kinda, I noticed you don't
keep any photos.

30
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:26,126
Photos? Of what?

31
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:30,330
Seriously?! I'm asking you why
you don't keep pictures of your
girlfriend around!

Does it really
matter?

36
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:41,808
Of course it does!
Did you even invite your
girlfriend over to meet us
today?

37
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:43,877
Uh, she should
be here any
minute now.

You think so?

You have so
much to look
forward to.

94

I wasn't! I
swear. I thinks
it's really admirable.

Superintendent General? So
cool. Go on and
break that glass

I know exactly
the type.

117
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:25,892
Overachievers who study too
much, prepare things ahead of
time, and follow the rules
down to ever detail.

The teacher's pet.

119

The type that tells
on you for making
even the smallest mistakes.

But... they are
inexperienced when it
comes to love.

121

So what you're saying is, this
girl happens to be exactly your
type.

better, Chibi‐Usa?

Usagi, don't you
ever feel worried?

What do you
mean by that?

130
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:08,775
Have you ever stopped to think,
"Is this really how I wanna live
the rest of my life?" or "Will I
ever find true happiness?"

131
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:10,476
Or do you just not care?

132
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:12,112
What makes you say that?

133
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:18,184
Of course I worry about things.
Like, right now, I'm worrying
about whether I should get the
hippo or the horse.

134
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:21,121
I can't decide which one of them
is going to make me happier!

Hey!

136
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:27,127
And by the way Usagi, those
things are dog toys.

137
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:28,128
What?!

138
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,898
Well, then, uh... Maybe I'm
thinking about getting a dog,
okay!

139
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:35,802
Well, then, don't forget to buy
it some earplugs so it doesn't
have to listen to you.

181

But if we do not get married,
Chibi‐Usa won't exist anymore!

Huh?! To who?

220
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:59,860
To Saori, of
course! Are you
that oblivious?!

Mamo... I don't

me.

00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:43,176
Pushuu, pushuu! Pushuu!

307
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:44,410
Saori! Look out!

308
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:47,413
Huh?

309
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:48,682
Uh‐oh!

310
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,418
[gasp] This one is way more
cute!

311
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:54,020
[grunting]

312
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:56,422
Pushuu! pushuu!

313
00:17:56,523 --> 00:17:58,424
[screaming]

314
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:03,704
Huh?

315
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,472
[struggling]

316
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:08,542
Sailor Moon! Let
go!

317
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:12,478
[struggling] Uh‐uh!

318
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:19,219
You're really sacrificing
yourself to save him? That's
just so... so beautiful!

319
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:22,222
[struggling]

320
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:23,790
Please! Stop it!

321
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:32,398
Don't worry. As soon as I kill
her, I'll make sure to kill
you, too. It'll be just like
Romeo and Juliet.

322
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,238
[squeezing]

323
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:41,808
[gasp] Usako... Usako!

324
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:44,745
[groaning] "Usako"...?

325
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:54,588
I see...

326
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:57,824
[screaming]

327
00:18:59,325 --> 00:18:59,760
[grunt]

328
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:00,767
[gasp]

329
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:03,770
Pushuuuuuuuuu!

330
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:05,772
Usako!

331
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:07,207
[gasp]

332
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:08,609
Please, wake up!

333
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:12,278
[weak breath] I'm okay...

334
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:13,780
Shuu!

335
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:15,882
[pained groans]

336
00:19:16,517 --> 00:19:18,785
Ugh! What an ugly thing to do!

337
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,687
Chibi Moon! Do it!

338
00:19:21,154 --> 00:19:21,688
Mhm!

339
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:26,860
Please, Pegasus! Protect
everyone's dream!

340
00:19:30,564 --> 00:19:33,466
Twinkle Yell!

341
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:42,709
Ugh! This is so frustrating!
[grunting]

342
00:19:57,323 --> 00:20:03,604
Moon Gorgeous Mediatation!

343
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,622
Stage Out!

344
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,464
[gasp]

345
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,166
[panting]

346
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:37,170
[groaning] Huh?

347
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:38,872
[weak breath]

348
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,308
Thanks, Usako.

349
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:43,644
[chuckle]

350
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:51,885
[sigh]

351
00:21:11,512 --> 00:21:12,679
<i>Hey, Saori.</i>

352
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:16,349
How'd it go
yesterday?

353
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:18,785
How'd what go?

354
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:24,357
Don't play dumb, you know
I'm talking about you and Chiba!
You told him how you feel,
right?

355
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,861
Huh? But why
not?!

356
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:30,931
Hey...

357
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:31,932
Huh?

358
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:35,869
<i>You can have this. I'd hate to</i>
<i>throw it away.</i>

359
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,871
This is...

360
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:40,541
So, are you
giving up on
him?

361
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,878
'Cuz I certainly don't
think the Police Superintendent
General of Japan would give up.

362
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:49,883
Oh! I‐I wasn't making fun
of you or anything. I‐It's just
that I‐I really...

363
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,952
[chuckle]

364
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:57,390
I think I'm pretty okay with
losing a guy to a girl who
protects the world.

365
00:21:58,391 --> 00:21:59,392
Uh... Huh?

366
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:01,968
Just let go
of him already!

367
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:03,570
No way! He's
my Mamo!

368
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:04,905
You're ruining everything!

369
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:06,973
Shouldn't you be
off playing with
your dog toy?

370
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:07,941
[frustrated yell]

371
00:23:46,513 --> 00:23:51,852
(USAGI) <i>Mamo, this is awful! Can</i>
<i>you believe Artemis? I think</i>
<i>he's actually cheating on Luna!</i>

372
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:55,021
(MAMORU) Calm down, Usako. I'm
sure he has a good explaination.

373
00:23:55,522 --> 00:23:56,356
(USAGI) <i>But Mamo!</i>

374
00:23:56,422 --> 00:23:56,857
(MAMORU) <i>W‐What?</i>

375
00:23:58,058 --> 00:23:59,526
(USAGI) <i>He even has a kitten</i>
<i>from this torrid affair!</i>

376
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:02,536
(MAMORU) <i>Artemis... you old dog,</i>
<i>or cat...</i>

377
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:07,608
(USAGI) <i>Next time on Sailor Moon</i>
<i>SuperS: "Artemis is Cheating?</i>
<i>Enter the Mysterious Kitten."</i>

378
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:10,711
<i>The moonlight is a messenger of</i>
<i>love.</i>
