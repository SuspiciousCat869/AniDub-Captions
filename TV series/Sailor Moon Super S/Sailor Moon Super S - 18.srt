get cast as

I've told you
before; Giselle is
a fairy.

62

So if you can't
suppress your humanity
then this performance is a

you to do

some competition.

I don't want
to hear it!

I know we constantly argue, but
Mr. Yamagishi wouldn't do
something like that without a
good reason.

157
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,500
And now I
know...

158
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:38,539
I realize that I'm
just not good enough
to be a lead dancer.

so warm and gentle to me.

When it comes to
ballet, Mr. Yamagishi
gets into a zone where
nothing else matters.

166
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:00,100
Woah.

167
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:03,103
His passion for
it is absolutely
incredible.

You have a
crush on
Mr. Yamagishi!

170

Giselle becomes a fairy
after the man she loves ends
up betraying her...

171
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:16,550
...but she still tries
to help him despite
all of that, because she
truly loves him.

172
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:24,390
I thought that maybe I could be
like Giselle. I really want to
help Mr. Yamagishi, even if he
doesn't return my feelings.

173
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,125
But...

174
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,228
Then you should
just try to
do your best
for him.

175
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:29,563
You think so?

176
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,933
Yeah! If you
do that then
something good is
sure to happen.

177
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:36,570
Well, when you say
it like that, it really makes
me feel like it might work.

178
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:38,739
She's right. Let's
all try our
best.

still isn't good
enough.

really necessary?

much Kiriko loves
ballet dancing and
Mr. Yamagishi...

But why can't
he see that?

her feelings right now, but
surely he will someday.

I truly apologize for not
explaining things to you
thoroughly,

234
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:39,773
but I've never considered anyone
other than Kiriko for Giselle.

235
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:42,743
So then you basically tricked
me for your own benefit!

Besides, I'm way better
than she'll ever be!

241
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:58,659
While I agree that you have
better technique than she does,

242
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:04,037
by letting Kiriko play Giselle,
I believe the experience will
help her develop into an amazing
ballerina.

243
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:09,342
That's right& rather than
playing her as a perfect fairy

244
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:15,448
An imperfect Giselle, who has
room to grow, is sure to capture
people's hearts.

245
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,784
She doesn't have
to be so detached.

you talking about?

what does it even matter?!

248
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:29,329
The way Giselle looks isn't
nearly as important as her
ability to appeal to people's
emotions.
