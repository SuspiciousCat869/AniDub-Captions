not sure "person" is the
right word...

152
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:24,525
There's more than one?

153

Careful. Two‐timing can be
tricky if you're not
experienced at it.

Huh?

Have we met
him before? This
person?

156
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,502
Yeah! He's all
white and silky!

157
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:36,803
All white..?

158
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:38,038
...and silky?

Uhh‐‐

160
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,308
What else? What's
his face like?

161
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:45,512
Uh, his face? It's
very, very long.

162

Hey Ami, it sounds to me
like this guy's a real
horse‐butt.

165
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:58,759
Horse butt? No, Minako. I
think you meant to say
he's a jacka‐

166
00:14:58,825 --> 00:14:59,560
What?

167
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:02,368
No, I can't say it.
It's too vulgar.

168
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,171
What?? You mean he's too
vulgar to talk about?!

169
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,541
No! No! That's not
what I meant at all!

170
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,408

Of course.

This is awesome! I
feel so lucky to go

can get the truth out of
Chibi‐Usa, it's Mamoru.

Yeah, but he has to be

gone to an expensive

You're right. It looks
very expensive.

[gasping]

190
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,768
I'll have a glass of apple

191
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,605
This isn't working.
We're too far away
from them!

00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:06,172
I can't hear a

We've got to get closer.

194
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,144
Yeah, so I guess that's it
for now.

195
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:16,517
Still, I suppose sooner or
later a date with me won't
be that exciting.

196
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,285
Mamo, you know you'll
always be my favorite.

197
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,821
Why, thank you.

198
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:24,157
But if you were to find
someone special, Chibi‐Usa,

199
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:26,159
<i>you'd introduce him</i>

00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,663
Well, actually,
there is someone.

Could it... be
a.. boyfriend?

202
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:38,672
Not exactly...It's
complicated.

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,342
It's complicated how?

204

Do you get the feeling
someone's trying to
listen in on us?

207
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:57,357
Because I definitely
get the feeling that
someone's trying to

208
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,859
listen in on us.

209

Uh, Miss..?

00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:05,205
Maybe make that apple juice
to go.

212
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,350
Oh, boy, now we've done
it. She's really upset.

I don't blame her.

00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:21,922
And Mamoru didn't
look happy either when
he ducked out of there.

00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:24,558
I guess we might've gone a
little too far.
