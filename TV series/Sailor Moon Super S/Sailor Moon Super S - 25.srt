Isn't it beautiful?

00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:33,100
I can't wait to wear a dress
like that when Mamo and I
finally get married.

3
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,333
Yeah, me too!

4
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,100
Hey! Mamo's all mine.
Remember that.

[nervous laugh]

6
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:42,166
But still, wearing a gorgeous
wedding dress is every girl's
dream!

7
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,266
Does that mean becoming
a bride is your dream?

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,466
M‐hmm! Don't you
want to get married?

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Oh yeah, definitely!

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,733
But... I have
other dreams too.

11
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:54,600
I want to be a flight attendant,
kindergarten teacher, actress,
and a fashion model.

12
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:56,600
Uh‐huh...

What is it?

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,073
I totally forgot! "RanRan"
goes on sale today!

15
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:02,606
Is it that big a deal?

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,306
So cute!

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,739
I bet it's awesome being on the
cover of a magazine. That would
be a great dream too!

All this from
one magazine?

That's the power
of the press.

43
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:33,920
Rei sure is popular.

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,686
Drop the act.

50
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:47,486
We saw the
magazine article!

51
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:52,753
"The most popular item sold at
Hikawa Shrine is the amulet that
promises love and romance."

52
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:57,653
"These amulets, when offered by
a beautiful shrine maiden, give
their owner mystical power."

53
00:03:57,686 --> 00:04:00,753
Is this "beautiful" shrine
maiden supposed to be you?

54
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:04,626
Someone from the magazine
visited us the other day and
insisted on an interview.

55
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,126
What can I say? He knows a
great story when he sees one.

56
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:11,826
I don't remember Hikawa
Shrine amulets being so popular.
|

57
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,460
It's all a scam.

58
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:14,793
Hold on, I'm confused.

59
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:18,426
Yeah, you don't sell the
amulets. That's Yuichiro's job.

60
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,993
You're right. All I said was
our best‐seller at the shrine
is our love amulet.

61
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:25,460
But they assumed that meant I
sold them. You can't blame me
for that.

62
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:28,593
Besides, what's the harm in
playing the role of "beautiful
shrine maiden?"

63
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,593
Who knows? Maybe I can
keep this trend going!

64
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:35,426
Then we'd become super popular
and famous. We'd be known as
"Hikawa Shrine, the shrine of
love,"

65
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,859
and we'd get a ton
more visitors.

66
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:39,093

release my own pop album!

I don't think you are
being very realistic.

Well, that's 'cause ordinary

Yeah!? And what's
so special about you?

Oh, my dear, isn't it obvious?
I have something that you lack:
irresistible beauty.

If you mean "beauty
sleep" then, okay.

80

I'm not the one who sleeps
through her alarm every day!

to know where I can I find the

And you are...?

My name's Nanako. I was inspired
by the magazine article so I
came here to meet the famous
shrine maiden.

00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:01,560
We just scored!
Yeah!

154
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,460
Oh my gosh he's so hot. I
can't believe our luck.

155
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:07,326
Yeah! So, how do we do this? We
all want to date him, right?

156
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:09,226
Maybe for starters
a group date, then!

<i>Thank you very much.</i>

<i>My pleasure, see ya!</i>

‐Say what?
‐Say what?
‐Say what?

162
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:19,560
There's a "Hawaiian Center"?

163
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:20,493
Sure!

164
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,660

I'm sorry I have to put you
on clean up duty with me.

166
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:29,493
You don't need to apologize.
I'm happy just being with you,
Miss Rei.

[chuckle]

168

This job's a chance for me to
learn from an inspiration.

169
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,326
You're a woman who's
smart and beautiful!

170
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,626
Plus you've achieved your dream
of being a shrine maiden!

171
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,226
<i>Your future is set!</i>

172
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,060
Nanako, I should tell you...

173
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:44,326
I want to be a shrine maiden,
just like you!

174
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:47,060
I wonder what it's like to
make a dream come true.

175
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:51,393
It must feel great!
So I'm gonna help you and make
my dream the same as yours!

176
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,160
Nanako, that's
very nice, but...

177
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,160
I'll work as hard as I can, I
promise, so I can be like you
someday.

178
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,100
Please let me stay here!

179
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,733
[sigh] When I'm with you,
I feel like life is easier.

180
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:09,600
,,,like I'm with
a big sister.

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,566
[gasp]

182
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,933
Okay! Back to work!

183
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,500
[sigh]

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,266
Her "big sister"...

185
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,100
Nanako sure works hard...

186
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,566
Yeah...

187
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,300
...but wanting to be a shrine
maiden just because she idolizes
Rei...?

188
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,966
...that's pretty unusual.

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,566
Especially when Rei hasn't
decided if she'll continue
working here at the shrine.

190
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,100
Lemme talk to Nanako.

191
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:42,600
Wait!

192
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:43,933
Good grief.

193
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:47,300
There she goes again,
meddling in other people's
private business.

194
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,100
But being nosy looks fun!

195
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
‐Diana...
‐Diana...

196
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,333
Nanako...

197
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,100
Oh, Usagi!

198
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,333
So, how are
you liking it here?

199
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,600
Working with Rei is great! I
feel so lucky to be around her.

200
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,340
She's like a big sister and role
model rolled into one perfect
person!

201
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:03,606
She's pure, honest,
And best of all...

202
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:08,973
she's devoted the rest of her
life to staying here at the
shrine, and praying for other
people's happiness.

203
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:14,006
That doesn't sound like the Rei
I know. Doesn't she usually put
her own happiness first?

204
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:18,773
Yeah. Nanako, do you have any
dreams ‐ besides helping Rei
make her dream come true?

205
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:22,340
Chibi‐Usa, you're still
too young to understand
this kind of thing.

206
00:11:22,406 --> 00:11:25,640
See, there are dreams that come
true, and dreams that never
will.

207
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:29,106
It's sad, but my dreams are all
the kind that won't come true.

208
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,473
I'm sure they can come true.
You just have to work hard to
achieve them.

209
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:34,473
Yeah, that's right,
even Rei...

210
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:36,906
Rei's one and only dream is to
be the maiden for this shrine.

211
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:43,640
That's better than my own stupid
dreams. So I'm going to follow
in her footsteps. I'll remain
single forever, just like her!

212
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:47,340
‐Wait a sec...
‐Single...?

213
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,440
Does she mean not having a
boyfriend or a husband?

214
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,740
Mhm!

215
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:53,973
That's right! I'm going
to remain dedicated to
this shrine ‐‐

216
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,273
(Ves‐Ves)
Hang on... Is that
girl the target?

217
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:59,673
She's wearing a wig, that's why
I had a hard time finding her!

218
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,413
Got ya now! [giggle]

222
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:34,580
I said, Nanako thinks you're
going to stay single for the
rest of your life because you've

223
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:37,313
achieved your 1 dream of
being a shrine maiden.

224
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:39,513
That's totally ridiculous!
Where did she get that idea!?

225
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,446
I don't know, but maybe it's
because shrine maidens have a
reputation for dedicating their
lives to the gods.

226
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:46,946
She makes a good point.

227
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:49,413
But that's not
Rei's dream, is it?

228
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:53,413
Darn right! My potential's
unlimited and I plan to do
many things!

229
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:58,846
I want to experience lots of
love, find a great man, become
happily married, and have a
successful career!

230
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:04,086
I have a vision for my life, a
dream of taking my personal
brand worldwide.

231
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,086
I'll travel the globe...

232
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,120
as an icon of success!

233
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:14,286
Yeah, maybe you say that. But
you seem happy with local fame.

234
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:18,320
Well, of course! People from
across the country are coming
here just to see me.

235
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:20,920
It's flattering and wonderful
and humbling too.

236
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:24,453
But I won't be pigeon holed as a
small‐time shrine maiden my
whole life.

237
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:25,520
[groans]

238
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,286
There's the Rei
we know and love!

239
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,120
So you're just pretending to be
a shrine maiden role model.

240
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:33,586
Even when she said, "You're like
a big sister to me!"

241
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,120
For a moment, I thought you were
taking all of her puppy love
seriously.

242
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:39,320
...Were you...

243
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:42,453
Leave me alone! I was just
being nice ‐‐ trying to
support Nanako's dream!

244
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:46,353
But it's not Nanako's dream,
she's following yours.

245
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,820
Mhm.

246
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:49,653
She doesn't have a dream?

247
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:55,520
She said her dreams are too big
to come true. So she just wants
to be like you at the shrine.

248
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:59,453
But this whole time I thought
her dream was to become a shrine
maiden. Was she lying to me?

249
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:04,293
She said her dreams are stupid
and she wants to dedicate
herself to a quiet life.

250
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:06,860
That's crazy. This changes
everything!

251
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:09,526
Nanako told me she wanted to
become a shrine maiden.

252
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:13,093
Rei...
<i>That's why I said she could help</i>
<i>me, even if she got off on the</i>
<i>wrong foot.</i>

253
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:14,660
Off on the wrong foot?

254
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:18,826
But I think she's got a much
bigger problem than idolizing
me. Much bigger!

255
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,260
She's using the shrine as way to
avoid following her own dreams.

256
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:24,126

Our job is to give people
dreams! To keep their hopes
alive!

259
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:32,093
But without dreams of her own,
she's no shrine maiden.

260
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:33,926
Rei, don't say it!

261
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,493
I don't want her around me!

you, Rei...

beautiful...

I'll chase my dreams!

00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,933
Are you telling me
you don't have a dream?

275
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:15,466
No, I... It's none of your
business.

276
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:19,033
Of course it is! You really
don't have any dreams?

277
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,133
Leave me alone. My dreams are
over and I'm all alone, with no
direction.

278
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,933
I'm totally empty!

What?! This is just awful!

00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,300
A girl with no dream
is a loser...!

281
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,100
Get it together! This is no time
for crying in a puddle of
self‐pity!

282
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,133
You must have some
dream... now think!

00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,666
I don't want to.
Please just go away.

There is one thing...

287
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:45,833
Let go. I don't have time for a
