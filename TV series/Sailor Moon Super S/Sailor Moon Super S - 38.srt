Little girl. So you've broken my
curse, have you?

174
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,968
Well, no matter. You people are
still no match for me!

Have you all forgotten that I
possess the Golden Crystal?!

176

That's supposed to
be the Golden Crystal?

What?! [grunting]

Well what do you know, now
you've got the Golden Crystal!

185

With that, you should be able to

Thank you.

shine...

You lie! The people of Earth
have not yet lost their power to

Nonsense! The dim, lifeless
