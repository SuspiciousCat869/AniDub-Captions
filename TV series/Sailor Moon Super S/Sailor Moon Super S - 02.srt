It seems like my dream is just
making the people who love me
feel sad and lonely...

142
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,968
<i>That doesn't sound very</i>
"beautiful" <i>, does it?</i>

143
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:46,379
It's not good enough, Minako. We
have to go to Crown again
tomorrow and find out how Motoki
really feels.

144
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:49,883
Luna, what do
you think will
happen with Reika
and Motoki?

145
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,455
Well, ten years is
a long time. I'm afraid
this might finally be the
end of things for them.

146
00:10:55,722 --> 00:11:00,393
(USAGI TSUKINO) <i>What? Mamo? No,</i>

147
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,404
[sigh] They do say that
long‐distance relationships are
hard to maintain...

148
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:10,476
I guess, when you're far apart
from someone, your heart can
grow distant, too, maybe.

149
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:12,746

150
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,015
Right! See you tomorrow.

Huh...? Minako? That you, again?

152
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:24,958
[scream] Mamo! Where are you?
It's been ages. What have you
been doing? Why haven't you
called, huh?!

153
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:30,363
I'm at a seminar I have to
attend for my major. And I've
been trying to tell you since
last night...

154
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:34,768
But every time I call, the
line's busy! Do you have to make
such long phone calls?

155
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:35,869

158
00:11:41,307 --> 00:11:42,776
About our new enemy. Have you
forgotten?

159
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,612
Oh, right! About our new enemy,
totally!

160
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:48,782
We are carefully formulating an
appropriate plan of action!

161
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:52,819
Correct! Uh huh! First thing
tomorrow! Right!

162

I will eagerly be awaiting your
return! [heavy sigh]

[happy sigh] Ohh, Mamo! [giggle]

164
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:12,579
On the other hand, Luna, no
matter hoe far apart I am from
Mommy and Daddy, I still love
them and I always will.

165
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,751

Earth on horseback.

Ummm...

177
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,604
I can see
you take your
training very
seriously.

178
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:39,940
Yes, but it's
no use.

179
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:44,611
Seems the harder
I try... the less
I can keep my
mind on it.

180
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:47,514
I might be
able to help,

me.

Wha‐‐?

182
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,521
You see, I can tell. Behind
those levely eyes, I see the
anguish of someone facing a
difficult dilemma.

leave the people you really care
about?

290
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:32,032
Yeah, c'mon, you've gotta
at least see Reika and tell
her how you really feel.

291
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,467
Sorry, I <i>can't.</i>

292
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,839
Okay. Suit yourself,
but can't you
at least eplain
why you won't?

293
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:43,009
Otherwise, you know
these girls are
never gonna leave
you alone.

294
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,177
[sigh]

295
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,180
It's cause this is Reika's
<i>dream.</i>

296
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:51,518
So, I promised myself I'd keep
away from her 'til she'd made up
her own mind about it.

297
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:56,022
I don't want her to abandon her
dream just because she's worried
about how I might feel.

298
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,493
The fact is, I can wait ten
years for her. I'll wait as long
as she wants.

299
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,537
(UNAZUKI FURUHATA) <i>Well, you</i>

300
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:06,039
You heard all
that, right?

301
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,542
[gas] Rei‐‐Reika!

302
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:14,214
I was‐‐ I was beginning to get
the feeling that maybe you
didn't love me anymore...

303
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:18,384
That you thought I was, well,
that I was being selfish...

304
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,623
What? Reika, don't be silly!

305
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:26,459
Why would you
even think that?!
I will always
love you.

306
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:27,961
[gasp]

307
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:34,935
Go to Europe... Go and do your
best if that's what you really
want.

[sigh] Motoki...

309
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:41,307
My brother, what
a guy! [giggle]

310
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:42,809
Way to go,
Motoki!
