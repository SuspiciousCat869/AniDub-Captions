<i>uh...</i>

143
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,489
(USAGI TSUKINO) Whoa! Three
months to live?! That's so
dramatic.

144
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:58,892
(MINAKO AINO) Yeah, it's like
a soap opera!

145
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,301
But, who is
this man anyway?

146
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:03,970
I don't know anything about him.

147
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:07,908
Okay, but you told the guy there
was no way you could be his
girlfriend, right?

148
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,877
Well, not... <i>quite.</i>

149
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:12,846
What do you
mean? Why not?

150
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:13,479
I don't know...

151
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:16,416
Wait, I don't get it Naru. What
about Umino

152
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:23,524
(NARU OSAKA) <i>I told the guy I</i>
<i>already had a boyfriend, but he</i>
<i>just kept saying that it would</i>
<i>only be for three months.</i>

153
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:25,258
Wow...

154
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:29,863
He's dedicating his last
precious days to love... How
<i>romantic!</i>

155
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,765
What do you
know about romance?

156
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:35,435
Look, Naru, love and pity are
not the same thing.

157
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:41,441
Yeah, Rei, I think I know the
difference. But I couldn't just
say no right off the bat. I felt
sorry for him.

158
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:46,179
You're such a kind‐hearted
person, Naru. Not like Usagi.

159
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,081
And w does
that mean?!

160
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:49,783
(CHIBI‐USA) <i>You know exactly</i>
<i>what that means!</i>

161
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:50,951
(AMI MIZUNO) <i>Stop it, you two.</i>

162
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:52,452
I am the

163
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:54,555
I'm going. See
you later... Bye!

164
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:55,288
Wait‐‐!

165
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:57,357
Oh, I think
we must have
made her feel bad.

166
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:00,293
I guess, we
might have been
too hard on
her.

167
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,805
But, something's fishy about
this man she met. I have a bad
feeling.

168
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:07,307
I'm gonna go
check on her
to make sure
she's okay.

169
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:10,143
[gasp] Yeah, maybe we
should all go.

170
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:10,977
Good idea.

171
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:11,912
Wait for me!

172
00:13:13,146 --> 00:13:15,315
Luna, I think you
and I better
investigate this further.

173
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:16,316
I agree.

174
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:30,163
Three months... What must it
be like knowing that's all the
time you have left?

175
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:34,601
<i>I</i> want <i>to help him... I really</i>
<i>do...</i>

176
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,506
But how could I ever explain it
to Umino?

177

(UMINO) <i>Naru!</i>

179

Hey, what'sa matter? Why do you
look so serious?

180
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:48,949
Actually, Umino, there's
something I need
to tell you...

181
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:56,356
[crying]

182
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,359
So you see, it's
hard to know what
I should do.

183
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:04,204
[sobbing] That's what I love
about you, you're such a warm
and caring person!

184
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:04,538
Huh?

185
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:10,977

with him, so stay with him!
Don't worry about me! [sobbing]

Umino, wait!

187
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:13,547
I'll just go to the mountains
and meditate!

188
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:15,215
Umino...

189

(USAGI) <i>Don't worry.</i>

190

[gasp] U‐Usagi!

191
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:22,288
He's always overreacting
to everything. You
should really know
that by now.

192
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:24,390
You think Naru
will be alright?

193
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:25,559
Yeah, she'll be
fine.

194
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:27,060
So much <i>drama.</i>

195
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:31,064
Yeah... But Umino's the one I'm
worried about.

196
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:39,573
Oh, no, it's Umino! He's
drowning his sorrows in
milkshakes...

197
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:46,246
One, two, three... Whoa, that's
gotta be about fifteen
milkshakes!

198
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:50,517
Ohh, I'm getting
a tummy‐ache
just thinking about
it! [queasy]

199
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:55,255
[chuckle] Hello there.

200
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:59,526
I'm so glad
you agreed to
see me.

201
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,936
Listen, I really think that we
need to talk.

202
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,271
What's wrong? Why the glum look?

203
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,941
Where's that... beautiful
smile?

204
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:12,278
It's just that, like
I told you before,
I already have a
boyfriend...

205
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:14,114
So, what about him?

206
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,617
Well, I realize
he means a
lot to me.

207
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:17,718
[gasp]

208
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,286
<i>I would never wanna hurt him...</i>

209
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,291
You're worrying too
much about things
that don't really
matter.

210
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:29,462
Right now, it's just you and me
sitting here alone together in
the moonlight.

211
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:35,468
Think of the joy
we could bring each
other... That's all that
matters.

212
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:36,102
Huh?

213
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,472
Aaa! Get away!

214
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:44,477
I'm sorry. But I can't. I just
can't be your girlfriend,
sorry.

215
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,114
Oh, yeah?!... Well, too late,
honey, what you think doesn't
matter now!

216
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,115
Huh?

217
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:55,155
Did you think I
could actually fall for you?
What kind of fantasy are you
living in?

218
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:58,659
Who you?

219
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,169
Who, me? Someone who's only
interested in your dreams!

220
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,671
My what?

221
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,508
I've got to warn Usagi and the
others!

231
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:24,525
Ugh, fifteen milkshakes.
Even I think
that's gross.

232
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,694
Do you think
this means it's
over between Naru
and Umino?

233
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:30,697
Chibi‐Usa, why are
you so obsessed
with this stuff
anyway?

234
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:32,032
Well, uh...

235

Hey! We have an emergancy!
Naru's being attaked by the same
creepy blonde guy who attacked
Reika!

<i>Hep!... Hep!</i>

294
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,354
Whoa, that's not even funny,
sharp knives are dangerous!

295
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,224
Hip, Hip, Hiiip‐‐!

Huh?

298
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:33,900
I can never forgive a villian
who would toy with an innocent
young girl's heart!

299
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,404
I don't remember asking you for
your forgiveness! I'll break you
in half you little geek!

300
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:39,906
I'll break all of you!

301
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,909
If words were deeds, you'd be a
dangerous man.

302
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,410
Do it, Sailor Moon!

303
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,513
Right!

[gasp] A Pegasus...!

310
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:53,820
It vanished. Just what is that
creature?

311
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,004
You're such an idiot, Umino! Of
course, you're gonna get sick
after drinking fifteen
milkshakes!

312
00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:06,006
[nauseous groaning]

313
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:09,009
But you cared
that much, that's
so sweet.

314
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:11,845
So... a get
well gift!
