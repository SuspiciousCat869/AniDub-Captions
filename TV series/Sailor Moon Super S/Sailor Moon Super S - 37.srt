greatest pleasure I have.

319
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:30,964
If that is so, then you can
probably imagine what causes me
my greatest anguish.

320
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:32,633
Huh?

321
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,704
I am sick and tired of seeing
your hideous face in the mirror!

322
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,507
I'm afraid I don't understand.

323
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:44,144
But I don't have to. Not
anymore.

324
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,648
My reflection that I so
detest...

325
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:48,815
Hmm?

326
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,584
[gasps]

327
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,555
Begone, forever!

328
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,990
[laughing]

329
00:20:57,057 --> 00:21:01,034
[groaning] Ahh!

330
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:05,005
The seal has been broken!

331
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:12,012
[laughing]

332
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:15,716
Now, for the world! [chuckles]

333
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,128
[gasps]

334
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:33,700
<i>(Sailor Moon) Chibi Moon!</i>

335
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:39,573
Chibi‐Usa!

336
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:43,209
Come on, Chibi‐Usa,
wake up! [gasps]

337
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:45,245
[gasps]

338
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:49,750
<i>(Sailor Moon) What is it? What's</i>
<i>happening?</i>

339
00:23:53,453 --> 00:24:00,026
<i>(Queen Nehalennia) Sailor Moon!</i>
<i>Now that I possess the Golden</i>
<i>Crystal you are no match for me!</i>

340
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:03,369
<i>(Usagi) If we don't stop her,</i>
<i>the world's precious dreams will</i>
<i>be destroyed!</i>

341
00:24:03,436 --> 00:24:07,808
<i>(Queen Nehalennia) I will bring</i>
<i>you pain, and transform this</i>
<i>world into darkness!</i>

342
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:10,877
<i>(Usagi) Please, everyone, give</i>
<i>me your strength!</i>

343
00:24:10,944 --> 00:24:16,216
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon SuperS:</i>
