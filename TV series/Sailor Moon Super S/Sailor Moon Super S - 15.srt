158
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,039
So, your name
is Chibi‐Usa?

159
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:39,873
Oh, yes.

160
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:44,277
How did you end
up finding out that
Diana was visiting my
house?

161
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:51,217
Well, she insisted on coming
inside. And she usually only
does that when she knows there's
good food.

162
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,285
[muffled meow]

163
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,191
So, um... is there anyone else
living with you? I mean, since
this house is so big and all.

164
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:04,905
No, it's just me. I spent a
fortune to buy this big house,
but never invite anyone over.

165
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:08,074
It's them again!

166
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:10,911
Huh?

167
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:13,747
We're close.

168
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:17,150
So the woman Mamo
shared his umbrella with
lives around here, huh?

169
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,919
I think you're
over‐reacting.

170
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:25,859
I never overreact! This lady
might be attractive. And if she
is, you can bet I'll punish
Mamo!

171
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:26,226

ya?

[chuckle] Well, aren't you
just as stubborn as ever, lady?

184
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:52,352
Don't make this hard
on yourself, sweetheart.
It can be dangerous for old
people to live alone.

185
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:55,355
Who are you
calling old?! So
rude!

186
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:57,891
Those two thugs
are threatening
her.

187
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:03,203
Those two are land
sharks. Seems like the
rumors of them targeting
this house are true!

188
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,905

W‐who're you?

191
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,077
Just someone passing
by.

192
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:15,048
But, I couldn't
ignore a woman
in distress.

193
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:15,415
Ow!

194

This ain't over,

You're not hurt
or anything, are
you, madam?

203
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:37,403
What was that
for?

00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:38,905
Huh?

205
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:45,245
People don't just randomly help
women they don't know. So you
must have some kind of ulterior
motive as well!

206
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,814
A motive? Well,
I...

207
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:53,253
And also, I have
no reason to trust that you
aren't teamed up with those
other men, now do I?

of me!

211
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:14,280
There's definitely something
going on here. Why does she act
so differently to people she
doesn't know?

It's fine.

215
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:25,125
It's not like I
don't know what
rumors my neighbors
are spreading about me.

216
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,397
According to them, I'm
a weird, stingy old lady
who hoards all of her money.

217
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:37,403
No way! You're not stingy at
all! And you've been nothing but
kind to me and Diana since we
got here!

My. What a lovely
home. Those men didn't look it,
but they certainly have good
taste.

222
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:56,823
No one gave
you permission to
be here!

223
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:03,269
What? You're not even going to
offere any tea? Well then, guess
I'll just have to get straight

(ICHIRO) <i>Mayako...</i>

311
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:19,452
Huh?

312
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:20,687
Huh?

313
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,863
Ichiro...?

314
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:33,399
That's right. It
is I, Ichiro
Ono...

315
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:38,872
...the man who once shared
your dream to transform this
house into a restaurant 20
years ago...

316
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,974
Huh?! [gasps]

317
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:51,217
I'm leaving for
France to train!
Don't try to
stop me, Mayako.

318
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:57,724
Wait! What's going to
happen to this house we bought
for the resturaunt we dreamed
of?

319
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:03,904
I want to perfect the world's
finest flavors! I can't open a
resturaunt in a place like this!

320
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,240
Ichiro!

321
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:18,251
In those 20 years, I was able to
train hard enough to secure my
place among the world's top
culinarians.

322
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:23,089
But I never
found a pot‐au‐feu
that comes close to
surpassing yours.

323
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:32,733
I've always kept
a warm bowl
of pot‐au‐feu in case
you returned.

324
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,872
Mayako... Can you please
find it in your heart to forgive
this selfish man?

325
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,978
Of course. We
made a vow...
To do this
together.
