cry every time I read it!

10
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:38,939
Oh, I've read that
one. It's pretty obvious
why it sold over a million

Uh‐huh!

12
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:46,613
Usagi read an actual novel?
Don't you usually only read
things with pictures? So who
bribed you?

13
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:51,952
Hey, that's not very nice, Rei.
You probably haven't even read
the book, have you?

14
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:53,620
Uhhh?!

15
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,624
Seriously, I must have
cried at least ten
times when I read
it.

25
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:39,573
This might be hard to believe,

[grumble] Watch it kitten!

32
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,256
But more importantly; why
didn't you tell us before that
you were friends with a
celebrity, Mako?

33
00:03:56,523 --> 00:04:01,602
I thought if I'd mentioned it, I
probably would have sounded like
I was bragging about knowing
someone famous...

34
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:02,936
...even if I didn't mean to.

35
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:06,940

definitely makes a lot of
sense when you put it that
way...

36
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:10,611
Usagi would've told
everyone about something
like that for
sure.

37
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:11,578
Mm‐hm!

If you don't
have anything
nice to say...

39
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,453
It all began with a suggestion
I made. I wanted her to try
sending one of her stories to a
magazine.

<i>I'd read her manuscript. Then,</i>

<i>My words encouraged Tomoko and</i>
<i>she continued writing.</i>

42
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:35,735
Her hard work paid off and she
released her debut novel, The
Moon Night Pegasus.

43
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:40,907
(CHIBI‐USA) <i>That means we're</i>

44
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:46,046
...because you're the one who
discovered her talent and helped
inspire her, Mako!

45
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:47,914
Yeah, I guess
I did, huh?

46
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,751
So much for
not wanting to
sound like you're
bragging...

47
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:55,756
But that was a
long time ago. Tomoko's
a best‐selling author now.

48
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,759
I got so distracted with
personal stuff...

49
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:02,936
...that I still haven't had a
chance to really congratulate
her on her accomplishments.

50
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:06,773

we can get her to autograph our

be fine!

And I'm sure that Tomoko
would love to see you
again after all this time!

56
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,760
Wait a minute,
Usagi. What if
the others don't
want to...

57
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,428
Oh! I wanna
meet her, too!

58
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:28,762
Uhhh?

59
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:34,434

meet the person who wrote this
beautiful story. Please, Mako.

[sigh]

61
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,842
Mmm, why not? It will be nice to
see her again.

62
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,277
[giggles] Yay for us!

book. It was the most
hilariously awful thing I've
ever laid my eyes on!

75
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:31,765
I know! Didn't you think the
part where the Pegasus gives his
life for the girl was especially
lame?

Her story of Pegasus has
captivated people's hearts.

79
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,743
This writer, Tomoko Takase...
it's possible that she may know
something about Pegasus.

80
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:45,579
In that case, please, leave this
one to me.

81

writes ephemeral love stories...

in my hands.

00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:59,926
Wow! Who would have
thought that you would be
friends with the famous author,
Tomoko Takase?

84
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:03,704
As they say, "Don't
judge a friend, they
might know a celebrity."

85
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:05,606
Yup, no. No
one says that.

86
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:10,611
[giggle] I bought an extra
copy of the book just for her
to sign today!

87
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:14,948
What an amateur. If
you want to do it right, you
need to buy at least three
copies.

[gasp]

89
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:16,717

306
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:53,253
[laughing] So beautiful! But
where's Pegasus?

307
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:54,254
[gasp]

308
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:59,259
I only came all this
way because you were
Madame Zirconia's personal
pick...

309
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:03,103
Tenko, dear. Please
dispose of them
all, would you?

310
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:03,704
Tenko!

311
00:19:04,204 --> 00:19:07,107
Now, setting timer!

312
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:11,678
Huh?

313
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:13,213
What the heck
is that thing?

314
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:16,617
A time bomb. Two minutes and
KABOOM! Kay?

315
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:17,618
No, not okay!

316
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:19,219
You've got to
be kidding!

317
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:22,222
[chukle] Do your best
to escape. Tenko!

318
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:24,224
[struggling]

319
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,193
[grunting] Dammit!

320
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:29,395
[laughing] One minute!

321
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,997
[struggling]

322
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:35,636
[struggling]

323
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:37,003
[smirking]

324
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:38,539
[gasp]

325
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,374
Huh?

326
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:43,376
Huh?!

327
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:51,384
Chains aren't fitting for pretty
girls. The only things that
should be chained are villians
and vicous animals.

328
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,554
Thank you, Tuxedo Mask!

329
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,388
I think this belongs to you!

330
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:57,190
[grunts]

331
00:19:57,323 --> 00:19:59,259
[dodging]

332
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,171
Chibi Moon! Do it!

333
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:11,344
Please Pegasus! Protect
everyone's dream!

334
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,183
Twinkle Yell!

335
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,492
It's a... Pegasus...

336
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,529
[struggling]

337
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,496
I'm gonna blow you all away!

338
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:51,417
Moon Gorgeous Meditation!

339
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:09,242
Stage Out!

340
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,519
Huh?! Oh, forget it!

341
00:21:22,756 --> 00:21:24,925
You okay, Tomoko?...
Are you hurt?

342
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:25,526
I'm fine.

343
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,462
Mako! I saw
it! A real
Pegasus!

344
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,531
Huh?

345
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,534
I'm still able
to have beautiful
dreams.

346
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,636
So, I can
still write...

347
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:38,471
Hm. Actually, I
want to write!

348
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:42,475
Only, this time, it's not for
myself,... it's for everyone!

349
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,377
[chuckles]

350
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:46,212
Well, good luck!

351
00:21:46,547 --> 00:21:48,048
Goodbye!

352
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,383
Wait, Mako!

353
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:51,384
Huh?

354
00:21:52,418 --> 00:21:54,888
When my new novel is done, will
you read it first?

355
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:59,660
Hmph. I'd be honored. You can
always count on me to be your
first reader, got it?

356
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:01,668
[chuckle] Yeah.

357
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:07,908
