1
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,633
Granny Zirconia's upset.

2
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,835
She's upset! She's
upset!

3
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,704
All that anger gives her
wrinkly skin.

4
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,274
Hold on. She doesn't have
any skin. It's just
wrinkles.

5
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,275
[laughing]

6
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,777
No skin, just wrinkles.

7
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,546
No skin, just wrinkles.

8
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,147
So many wrinkles.

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,549
That she looks like a prune.

10
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:54,688
[laughing]

11
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,791
[growling]

12
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,826
Silence!

13
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,168
Silence, you fools!

14
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:07,841
But that game was fun!

15
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:13,680
I said be quiet! This is not
the time for fun. Now listen
carefully. You must find the

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,418
one who possesses a truly
beautiful dream... the one
with the Golden Mirror!

17
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:21,421
Huh? Juban
Civic Hall?

18
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:22,523
What's it say?

19
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:25,859
A coming‐of‐age
ceremony? January 15th.

20
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,193
What's coming‐of‐age?

21
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:30,531
"Young people. Come and
share your dreams
with one another"?

22
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:32,032
Your dreams?

23
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:37,604
Yes, now go! Find the
ceremony and retrieve the
Golden Mirror and Pegasus.

24
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:41,174
And hurry up before I
get any more ugly wrinkles.

25
00:01:41,207 --> 00:01:42,843
[sheepishly laughing]

26
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:26,660
<i>Dream to be an Adult: The</i>
<i>Amazoness' Confusion</i>

27
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:29,295
A part‐time job?!

28
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:33,499
That's right! And the best
part is, we get to work in a
fun, supportive workplace.

29
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,369
Plus, it could lead
to very lucrative careers
for all of us!

30
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:40,340
Sounds great. Count me in,
as long as it's easy,
comes with snacks, has a

31
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:42,576
nap time, and pays
me a lot of money!

32
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:44,878
Do you seriously
think jobs are
like that?

33
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:47,347
Usagi, making a living
isn't that easy.

34
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:51,484
Even I know that. Jeez, you
really don't have a whole
lot of common sense.

35
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:55,856
Okay, okay. It's true
that this job doesn't come
with any yummy snacks or a

36
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,492
nap time, but I'm sure it
would be fun if we all
did it together!

37
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:04,337
Besides, what matters is how
rewarding the job is, not
how easy it is. Am I right?

38
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,607
No idea! But you make it
sound great.

39
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:09,776
That's her way of saying
the job is hard and she
doesn't want to do it

40
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,377
alone. That's why she's
trying to recruit us.

41
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:15,448
You're right. And the fact
that she never told us the
salary means this job

42
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:16,683
probably doesn't pay much.

43
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:18,118
[groaning]

44
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:21,888
Come on, you guys are
overthinking this way too
much. You know, it's like

45
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:24,958
they always say: "Act now,
sink later!"

46
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,226
What does that mean?

47
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:30,463
Minako, using your fancy
quotes isn't gonna
convince us.

48
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:33,900
And I think the phrase you
were trying to say is:
"Act now, think later".

49
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,903
Right, that's the one!
Anyway, let's all go check
it out.

50
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:37,737
Oh, what the heck?

51
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:39,806
Are you seriously
pushing us right now?

52
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:41,074
[chuckling]

53
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:41,742
Sorry, girls.

54
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,745
Why are we at
Juban Civic Hall?

55
00:04:44,778 --> 00:04:48,915
"Friends and Supporters
of the Coming‐of‐Age
Celebration". Is this the

56
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,452
job? We're going to be
volunteers for tomorrow's
coming‐of‐age ceremony?

57
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:53,887
That's one way
of putting it.

58
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,456
Wait, just a minute.
Doesn't volunteering
mean...

59
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:59,660
Yup. As volunteers we're
going to be working
here for free.

60
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:00,901
Working for free?!

61
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,903
You mean like
no pay at all?!

62
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,906
I thought you said this was
gonna be a Part‐time job!

63
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,910
It is! You'll be working.
I never said anything about
getting paid.

64
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,679
What's the point of
working if I won't
get paid?!

65
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,616
Think of it this way:
We'll be helping the
community.

66
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,150
Help shmelp. Why should I
work for free?

67
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,619
<i>Hey, you're back!</i>

68
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,754
It's good to
see you again.

69
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,756
Are these the friends
you said would like to
help us?

70
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,959
Yes! So is there
anything that we can
do for you guys?

71
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,460
So that's her game.

72
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,095
Shoulda known.

73
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,533
Actually, we are a little
shorthanded, so it's nice
to have such cute helpers.

74
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,535
He just said
that we're cute.

75
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,502
He's right.

76
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,971
Flatter me and I'm yours.
My name's Rei Hino.

77
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,174
Makoto Kino At your service
with plenty of muscle.

78
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:41,975
Cool. Later!

79
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:42,843
Bye!

80
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,813
Palla‐Palla found it!

81
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,481
The coming‐of‐age ceremony.

82
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,617
Great. We're finally here.

83
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,619
Palla‐Palla wants
to go inside.

84
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:53,820
Hey, who're those girls?

85
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,889
They're probably also here
to volunteer.

86
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,960
Great! They'll provide
enough help for the
community on their own.

87
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,134
So bye now!

88
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,536
Usagi!

89
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,639
No! I don't wanna work
for free! Don't make me!

90
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:07,040
What's that about?

91
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:08,509
Humans are weird.

92
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:10,844
Well girls, shall
we also go in?

93
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:11,878
Mm‐hmm!

94
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:14,214
<i>Hold on! You've got</i>
<i>to be kidding me!</i>

95
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:17,183
Why do we have to paint
the set? That's so lame.

96
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:19,485
But Palla‐Palla likes
painting things.

97
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:20,153
[grunting]

98
00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:21,487
Calm down, Ves‐Ves.

99
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:25,025
This way, we're
already here when the
targets arrive tomorrow.

100
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:26,593
<i>Almost there!</i>

101
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:28,194
You need to
bring it out more!

102
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:33,700
[grunting]
Easy for her to
say! I give up.

103
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,569
You're never gonna
reach it this way.

104
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:37,671
She's right. You have
to go further out.

105
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:38,605
I can't!

106
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:41,708
<i>But we have to get the sash</i>
<i>to the other end.</i>

107
00:06:41,742 --> 00:06:44,210
Just imagine that you're
walking on a balance beam.

108
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:48,515
Thanks. But the walking part
doesn't scare me... it's the
falling part that does.

109
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:51,518
Ahhhhhh‐
It's so high!

110
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,219
Yeah, I'm done.

111
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:54,621
Hurry up!

112
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:55,889
Fine I'll do it!

113
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,057
You think you can handle it?

114
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,226
Uh, sure I can. It's twice as
wide as the balance beam.

115
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,737
Yeah, and it's only five
times as high off the
ground.

116
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,871
Five times?

117
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:05,739
Sorry!

118
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,240
Okay, Rei. Get on out there.

119
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:08,975
I'm all set!

120
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,611
Here goes.

121
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:13,246
It'll be okay. I'll just
walk in a straight line.

122
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,582
No problem.
You can do this.

123
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:16,650
You...

124
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:18,084
Nope, no way in hell.

125
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,152
Here, let me try.

126
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:19,953
Huh? Wait!

127
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:22,288
What needs to be done?

128
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:23,089
[gasping]

129
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,157
Hello? What do
you want me to do?

130
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,960
Whoa! She doesn't seem
afraid at all out there.

131
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:28,595
We need to take this sash...

132
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:30,964
Mm‐hmm. And hang
it up like this!

133
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:34,901
Oh, that'll be easy. Just
bring the thing here and
I'll do it for you.

134
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:36,637
If we could walk
it out there...

135
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,071
...then we'd have already...

136
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,172
...hung it ourselves.

137
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,574
Give it here.

138
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:42,142
[gasping]

139
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:42,976
Be careful!

140
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:43,810
Hup!

141
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:47,981
Here.

142
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:48,915
Thanks a lot.

143
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:50,617
Amazing!

144

<i>No fair, Ves‐Ves!</i>

145
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:52,619
Huh?

146
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,956
You know that it's against
the rules to hog the
spotlight.

147
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:58,024
Fine, then why don't you
come up and join us?

148
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,100
Okay then, I will!

149
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:04,037
Wow!

150
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:05,171
Bravo!

151
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:07,273
Do you think they're
gymnasts? Or something
like that?

152
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:08,675
I'm ready to help.

153
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,978
Good. Cere‐Cere, start at
that end. I'll do the other
side.

154
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:12,713
Cool!

155
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:15,215
I guess they don't need
any of our help up here.

156

They're real life‐savers.

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,718
Hang it like this?

158
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:19,720
Yeah! And same
for the other side!

159
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:20,787
Got it!

160
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:22,155
Hey Mina.

161
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:23,056
Hi there, Artemis!

162
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:25,125
We just wanted to
see what you're doing.

163
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:27,127
You're all
hard at work.

164
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,630
I'm here to see the large
hand that's loaned to

165
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:30,897
people when they
volunteer for things.

166
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:34,835
Oh. That's not a hand.
You're thinking of a
man who fixes things.

167
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:35,969
He's called a
"handyman".

168
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:38,171
Diana was thinking of a
"helping hand".

169
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:40,907
That's it! So can I
lend a helping paw?

170
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:43,677
I'm glad you're feeling
helpful, but I think
we're all set.

171
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,212
Some ordinary folks
showed up to volunteer.

172
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:47,380
Does it look good?

173
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:48,682
Yeah, I think so.

174
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:49,750
Time for this side.

175
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,585
You call that "ordinary"?

176
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:53,353
That was the last one.

177
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:56,189
We're all done!

178
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:57,390
Nice job.

179
00:08:57,423 --> 00:09:00,266
Thanks. Feels good to put
our circus skills to work.

180
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,234
Circus?

181
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:04,671
Their skills caught my eye,
but I guess they're just
performers.

182
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:05,772
Guess so.

183
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,674
Ami!

184
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:09,610
The stage is all set!

185
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,044
Really? That's great.

186
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:13,614
Yeah, but it's
not pretty.

187
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,248
Hey Palla‐Palla!

188
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:17,718
You know, you could have
been helping instead of
playing in the seats!

189
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:18,384
That's for sure!

190
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:20,787
But it looks kind of yucky.

191
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:22,723
Now that you mention it...

192
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:24,390
It is missing something.

193
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,892
What could be wrong?

194
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:27,961
Maybe something's off with
the sash's symmetry.

195
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:28,729
Huh?

196
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:31,264
What are you doing?

197
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:35,736
To the human eye, the golden
ratio of 1 to 1.618 is the
most pleasing.

198
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:37,971
Everything looks
proportional that way.

199
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:40,406
That hurts Palla‐Palla's
brain...

200
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:46,980
I've got it. You should move
the right sash nine
centimeters over.

201
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,914
Ves‐Ves!

202
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:48,915
On it!

203
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:52,152
[grunting]
About here?

204
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:55,255
Yeah. Now move that five
centimeters left.That's
it.

205
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:59,325
<i>Now pull that end up. Just a</i>
<i>little bit more and...</i>
<i>there!</i>

206
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,034
Does that look right to you?

207
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,368
Mm‐hmm!

208
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,705
You have quite a
good eye for design.
Thanks for your help!

209
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,373
That was super fun. You're
totally smart.

210
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,776
It looks perfect.

211
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,946
Hmmm.

212
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,114
<i>Look out!</i>

213
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,081
Huh?!

214
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,350
[gasping]

215
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,854
[grunting]

216
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,388
It's no use.

217
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:23,890
<i>The sign's too heavy!</i>

218
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:25,892
Someone help!

219
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,228
I'm coming!

220
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:30,697
Step aside.

221
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,968
[lightly grunting]

222
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,971
Mako's the strongest
person I know.

223
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:42,809
[grunting]

224
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,044
That was close.

225
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,746
That was incredible!

226
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,915
It's nothing. Happy to
help in an emergency.

227
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,820
How's yours looking?

228
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,421
Um, I'm almost
done with it.

229
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,225
Beautiful!

230
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,001
<i>Unlike mine...</i>

231
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:03,804
I call it au natural.

232
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:06,272
Could Palla‐Palla have a
balloon?

233
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:07,273
[giggling]

234
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:08,842
Sure. Take it.

235
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,176
Really?

236
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:11,111
Our secret.

237
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:12,445
Thank you!

238
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,148
Well, I think we're
almost done.

239
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:16,917
Let's take a
quick break.

240
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,753
Look what
Palla‐Palla got!
[giggling]

241
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:22,255
You're such a little
kid, Palla‐Palla.

242
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,457
You know, these girls
aren't so bad.

243
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:25,792
Especially, for humans.

244
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:27,460
This is actually
kind of fun.

245
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:31,464
[laughing and cheering]

246
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:34,300
Tomorrow's coming‐of‐age
ceremony is going to look
great!

247
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,869
Thanks to all of us.

248
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:39,806
So neat! Hey, what's a
coming‐of‐age ceremony?

249
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:40,306
Huh?

250
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:41,808
Are you serious?

251
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:43,376
You helped us even though
you don't know?

252
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:44,811
Yeah, that's right.

253
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:46,479
This ceremony...

254
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:47,814
Exactly...

255
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:48,849
...what is it?

256
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:51,184
It celebrates young people
when they turn twenty.

257
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:53,319
It means you're finally
seen as an adult.

258
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:54,320
So what?

259
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,889
Why does growing up...

260
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:58,124
...make people think they
should celebrate?

261
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:00,400
Because most people are
proud to become adults.

262
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:01,334
Not me.

263
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:03,837
Palla‐Palla doesn't want
to be a grown up.

264
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:05,205
Yeah, becoming an adult?

265
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:07,307
No thank you.

266
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,842
[confused groaning]

267
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:40,541
<i>There are so many people!</i>

268
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,942
Wow!

269
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:46,212
So jealous! I can't wait
until I get to be in my
coming‐of age ceremony.

270
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,515
<i>Palla‐Palla doesn't want</i>
<i>to grow up.</i>

271
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:49,215
Huh?

272
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:51,217
Always remember
not to forget...

273
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,418
... A child's
dream...

274
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:54,120
... is a dream they
should never get.

275
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:55,355
Oh, hi girls.

276
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,457
We weren't sure if you'd
show up today.

277
00:12:57,524 --> 00:12:59,860
[chuckling]
Why's that?

278
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:01,401
Come on. We
wouldn't miss it.

279
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:03,937
We're looking forward
to the coming‐of‐age
ceremony, too.

280
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,873
But didn't you just say
you hope you never get
older?

281
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:08,441
Yeah, but, well,
you see.

282
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:11,411
We're interested to see
what young adults dream of.

283
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:13,079
Hm?!

284
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,081
Everybody!

285
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,417
They want us to gather
downstairs.

286
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,060
After this act, they'll
congratulate all the new
young adults.

287
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:27,894
Okay.

288
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:29,262
We'll announce it.

289
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:30,496
Great. Good luck.

290
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:34,100
May I ask you something?

291
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:36,503
Why are you people so eager
to become adults?

292
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,838
Why wouldn't we be?

293
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:39,072
Isn't everyone?

294
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:41,307
My reason is...

295
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:44,344
<i>Once I'm an adult,</i>
<i>I can marry Mamo.</i>

296
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,113
<i>And make delicious miso</i>
<i>soup just for him.</i>

297
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:49,015
Hot! Hot hot hot hot!

298
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:52,185
You're thinking too
small! My reason...

299
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:54,855
<i>... is so I can become a</i>
<i>celebrated idol!</i>

300
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:58,525
<i>The famous person shining</i>
<i>in the spotlight...</i>
<i>will be me!</i>

301
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,435
That's your big dream?
Because I'm in the
spotlight every day.

302
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,204
Is that so?

303
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,307
And I don't even get your
dream. I hate miso soup.

304
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,044
If you don't appreciate
the taste of miso soup,
you're still a child.

305
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:15,048
So what's your point?
Because I don't have any
problem remaining a child.

306
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,382
Okay, fine.

307
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:18,685
Great job, everyone.

308
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:20,654
You're on again
in 30 minutes.

309
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:21,655
Thank you.

310
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:25,491
We set the chairs on stage.

311
00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:26,893
Thanks, Mako.

312
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:28,294
[sighing]

313
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:28,995
Here.

314
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:30,664
Hey, thanks.

315
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:33,333
So, can I ask you
guys something?

316
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,001
Sure. What is it?

317
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:37,638
Are you looking forward to
becoming an adult?

318
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:38,505
Uh‐‐

319
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,009
Yes, The sooner I grow up,
the sooner I can become a
doctor that could go and

320
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:45,679
help all the people
suffering from disease
and illness.

321
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:48,314
Huh. And you?

322
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:52,653
Well, I gotta admit, my
reason isn't as noble as
hers. I want to be an

323
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:56,056
adult so I can start my own
cake shop and make people
happy.

324
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:00,694
Yeah? So, does that
mean you enjoy work that
helps other people?

325
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:04,571
Sure! I think it feels great
to be there for people when
they need assistance.

326
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:07,708
I've always felt that the
greatest reward comes from
helping others.

327
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:12,378
Helping others, huh?
If that's why you wanna
grow up then you guys are

328
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,082
fools. Why care about others
as long as you're happy?

329
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,050
Wait, what ?

330
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:21,021
Here's a tip: Trash those
stupid ideas about helping
people. [laughing]

331
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:21,387
[gasping]

332
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,388
Hold on!

333
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,390
Huh?

334
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:33,567
[screaming and laughing]

335
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:36,637
What's so funny about me
wanting to pursue a
successful career?

336
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,240
Your dream is to be an
icon of success??

337
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,076
You're just going to wind
up working like a slave for
someone.

338
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,445
That is the
lamest dream ever.

339
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,649
No it's not. Finding a
career that helps the world

340
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,383
is what responsible
adults do.

341
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,152
So a responsible adult...

342
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,587
... helps the world.

343
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,288
[laughing]

344
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,157
Sounds terrible!

345
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,158
You really are a weirdo!

346
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:58,759
Why, you...

347
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,826
Stop it!

348
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,235
You should never tease
people about their dreams.

349
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:04,337
Especially a
dream to grow up!

350
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:05,839
Hmmm?

351
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:09,475
Oh no, are you gonna tell me
that becoming an adult is
your dream, too?

352
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,180
Sure it is. My dream is to
grow up so I can become a
wonderful lady.

353
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,616
I don't get it.

354
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:18,351
Don't you realize:
Becoming an adult means
you'll have to give up on

355
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:19,653
all of your
childhood dreams.

356
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:21,287
No, that's not true!

357
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:22,789
Yeah, you're wrong!

358
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:27,293
Adults are pitiful and
dreary creatures who have
no free time to play.

359
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:30,531
If you stay a kid, you can
spend every day doing
whatever you want.

360
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:33,667
You're not responsible
to do anything or being
anywhere.

361
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,637
And if you're caught
being bad, you can get
out of it by just saying,

362
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,671
"I'm sorry!"

363
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:39,039
[gasping]

364
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:42,643
Always remember not to
forget. A grownup is a
dream a child's...

365
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:43,610
...gonna get.

366
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,811

They're all just ordinary
Dream Mirrors.

389
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:46,379
I knew it. The minute people
become adults, all of their

00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:51,585
I think we'll
see them again.

482
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:54,487
I agree. I've got a
feeling we'll cross paths.

483
00:21:56,557 --> 00:21:58,559
An opportunity like
this one is rare.

484
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:02,468
It comes but once
in many centuries and
time is running out.

485
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:06,406
It looks like now I
must take matters
into my own hands.

486
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:57,057
<i>Yikes! The entire city is</i>
<i>covered with spider webs!</i>
<i>What's happening?!</i>

487
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,060
<i>[chuckling]</i>
<i>The end of the</i>
<i>world has come.</i>

488
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:01,568
<i>Who are you?! And</i>
<i>what do you want?</i>

489
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:06,072
<i>I am Nehalennia. I will</i>
<i>transform this whole</i>
<i>world into darkness.</i>

490
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:07,273
<i>I won't let that happen!</i>

491
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:10,076
<i>No matter what it</i>
<i>takes, I will protect</i>
<i>everyone's dreams!</i>

492
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:15,916
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon</i>
<i>SuperS, "Terror in Motion:</i>
<i>The Dark Queen's Evil Hand."</i>

493
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,251
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
