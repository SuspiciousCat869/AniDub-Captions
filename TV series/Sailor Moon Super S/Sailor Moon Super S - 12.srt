Mother, I can't

Yeah, what she said!
If you're her mother,

138
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:26,660
then maybe you
should practice
sparring with her,

139
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:28,729
or try to teach
her some new
techniques, or
something!

This is between
me and my

143
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,541
But you have to
understand that Miharu
really needs you right now!

144
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:43,209
Yeah! Don't you
know that she's
been out there
training with a

145
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,344
single‐minded
purpose?!

146
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,216
That's exactly her
problem. Miharu is
too single‐minded.

147
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:50,551
Huh?

148
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:51,384
Anyway!

149
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:55,556
I have nothing
more to say
to the two of you.

150
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:56,723
Wait, come back!

151
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,726
Why are you

this affects

160
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:29,362
Why? Why can't I beat my

we begin?

deal with that meanie as a

00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:16,316

How so?

It is possible
she has a good

Just leave this
one to me. Hey,
Ayatoriko!

321
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:46,179
Are you going to play cat's
cradle with me?

322
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:50,584
From what I've seen, you can do
up to a five‐step ladder... But
can you do six?!

323
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:51,852
Huh?!

Nice job, Miharu!

352
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,538
Thank you, everyone. It was
really quite interesting to
fight in such a chaotic manner.

[awkward giggles]

354
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:08,542
But now I finally understand.
Everything.

355
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:14,047
See, if you heat
the knife first, onions
won't make you cry.

Wow! That's amazing,
mother!

357
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:22,388
(FUYUMI) Hmph. You must be
feeling quite confident if you
called me out here today.

358
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:24,390
Let's begin!

[grunt] What's this about?

364
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:35,969
You were right,
Mother.

365
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:41,141
I was so intent on becoming a
strong swordsman, that I
completely lost sight of
everything else.

366
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:47,480
From here on out, I will expand
my horizons and one day become
Japan's top multi‐talented
swordsman.

367
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:49,215
So you finally understand.

368
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:50,483
I do!

369
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:51,151
However!

370
00:21:52,418 --> 00:21:54,420
I cannot condone
using such cowardly
tactics in battle!

[giggling]

372
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:56,823
You are in
big trouble!

373
00:21:58,224 --> 00:22:00,834
[giggling] Sorry! But
I never stated we had
to use our swords.

374
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,503
Alright, quit while
you're ahead, kido!

Usagi, do you
think that MIharu
will ever accomplish
her dream?

378
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:12,579
Of course, she will!
Especially since she
has her mother's full
