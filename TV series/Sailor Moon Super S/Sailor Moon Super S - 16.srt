Who's Robert?

Yeah, even the sixth‐grade

Hm.

18

That's what everyone calls you,
right? It's a cute name.

22
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:18,819
Um.

23
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:23,289
Hey, um, would you like to go
out with me sometime?

24
00:03:23,356 --> 00:03:24,725
[Gasps]

25
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,698
I've got a feeling that I'm
gonna like you. And I'm pretty
sure you'll like me, too, once
you get to know me.

26
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:33,634
Uh.

27
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,504
Look, I've got soccer practice,
but I'll be done at four.

28
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:42,142
Swing by then and let me know
your answer, okay? I'll be
waiting. Later!

29
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:47,147
[Sighs]

Well, well, aren't
you a lucky lady!

31
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:51,518
So, what are you
gonna tell him? Hm?

32
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:54,320
Or is there someone else? Don't
tell me there's someone else!

33
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,589
Sneaky girl!

34
00:03:56,923 --> 00:04:00,493
Oh, come on, stop acting so
stupid! This is why I hate
girls.

35
00:04:00,594 --> 00:04:03,670
That was a pretty suspicious
reaction, don't you think?

36
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,341
Sure was. I wouldn't be a bit
surprised if Kyusuke had a crush
on you, too!

37
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:11,512
Chibi‐Usa! Leave some for
the rest of us, will you?

38
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:14,247
<i>(Momoko) Yeah! I'm so jealous!</i>

39
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:20,854
His name's Robert. His dream is
to play professional soccer and
they all say he's really good.

40
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:25,225
He even has his own fan club
and, he is pretty cute I guess.

41
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,260
Oh, really?

42
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:30,263
So you see, I don't
know what to do.

43
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,634
[Sighs]

44
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:38,705
Well? So what do you think
I should do, Pegasus?

45
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:44,277
I really couldn't say. That's a
decision only you can make.

46
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,580
Hm.

47
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:50,617
It's your life,
however it turns out.

Hm.

49
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:59,225
I'm starving! And Mom didn't
even leave any snacks on the
table!

50
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,504
We've just received word that
there has been yet another
sighting of the mysterious horse
with wings.

51
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:08,509
In this case, a truck driver is
claiming that the creature
attacked him last night and
drove his vehicle off the road.

52
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:14,180
<i>We've now had multiple reports</i>

Yeah, me neither.

57
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,427
[Yawns] Boy, am
I bushed.

58
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:33,199
What's the matter, is it turning
out to be harder than you
thought to lure out the Sailor
Guardians?

59
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,169
Yeah, Fish's Eye, I thought you
had 'em in the bag.

60
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:40,641
I've been trying to get their
attention, but they're just too
damn stupid.

61
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:48,114
But that's okay, after all, my
real job is going after people
with beautiful dreams.

62
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,618
So, found anyone good?

63
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,786
Uh‐uh.

64
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,655
No, not even close.

65
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:58,158
Hmm. Ah! This one's intriguing!

66
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,134
Wait, Fish's Eye, this is wrong.

67
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:03,336
Yeah, I mean
that's a little boy.

68
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:05,639

our friend.

Maybe he's not our

all here!

We heard that a boy asked
you out, is that true?

Usagi, you big‐mouth!

Really, Mako, I think we've
got more important‐‐

85
00:06:55,522 --> 00:06:58,592
That can wait, So, Chibi‐Usa,
what happened? What did you
tell him?

86
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:01,201
When it comes to romance,
the first step is key.

Don't think about it!
Full speed ahead!

88
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,774
We've all got lots of
experience, so if you ever need
any romantic advice, feel free
to ask.

89
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:11,612
Yeah, the problem with that is,
I'm the only one here with a
boyfriend.

What? Why not?

95
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,329

96
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:32,332
[Sighs] I guess so.

Well, okay, what's stopping you
then? Or wait, is there
something about this boy you
don't like, Chibi‐Usa?

98
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:42,408
I don't know. I only just
met him today.

99

I have no idea whether
I like him or not.

100

Sometimes you can't really know
if you like someone till you go
out with him.

101
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:55,789
Yeah, take him out for a test
spin. You might actually love
him!

Hm.

Yeah, you're right!

You always want to be near him!

109
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:25,491
And then, when the two of you
are together, you feel like you
want that time to go on forever
and ever!

110
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:28,461
It's kind of like
that, right?

00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:30,897
Uh.

112
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:36,737
Wait a second. The way that came
out, it almost sounded like
you've already got someone like
that, Chibi‐Usa.

[All] Huh?

00:08:55,689 --> 00:09:01,167
Pegasus would never do anything
like, like what they're saying
he did!

They're just making all that
stuff up!

Are you sure? You do seem to
know more about Pegasus than
we do, Chibi‐Usa.

124
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:20,220
Huh? Hey, c'mon, he's come
through for us every time we
needed him, you all know that!

Uh, yeah.

Who am I?

Oh, I'm just someone who's a
little bored, that's all.

135
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,536

[Chuckles]

00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,228
Keep your big fat nose out of my
business and stop spying!

140
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,599
I wasn't sticking my big fat
nose in your business, and by
the way, it isn't big and fat!

141
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,467
And anyway, I wasn't
spying on you!

you doing here?

Well, I'm your guardian, I'm
supposed to look after you!

Jeez, Chibi‐Usa's hard to fool.

145
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,077
Yeah, we probably should
follow her from farther back.

146
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,247
Girls, maybe we should stop
following her altogether.

147
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,049
Are you kidding me?
No way!

148
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,619
Ami, come on, it's not like
we're spying on her for the fun
of it or just because we're
nosy.

149
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:57,323
We're spying on her 'cuz we're
super‐duper worried about her!
And we're nosy.

150
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,302
You know, I just
love the game of soccer.

151
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:09,409
Watching all those beautiful
young men running the bases and
scoring touchdowns. It's just so
magical. Don't you think?

152
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,243
So anyway‐‐

153
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:13,146
Lady, don't you have any
friends your own age?

154
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:13,847
Huh?

155
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,585
I don't mean to be rude, but
this is kinda weird, and I don't
really have time to hang out
with you.

156
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,824
Huh? Listen, when you're lucky
enough to have a beauty like me
willing to spend time with you‐‐

157
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:26,627
Hey, get back here, kid!
I'm talking to you!

158
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,330
Sorry, lady, like I said, I'm
supposed to be meeting someone.

No sign of Pegasus, so I guess
I'll have to get rid of you.

Hold it! How dare you lay your

Glad you could make it.

Oh, never mind.

So it was
an impostor!

188
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,949
Time to call
the real one!

189
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:54,287

Your precious Pegasus can't
penetrate this barrier. Too bad.

199
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:44,210
And without Pegasus, you can't
use your special attack so
you're basically helpless.

200
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,681
What's Pegasus doing here?

201
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:49,516
Maybe he is our enemy!

to do something!

the way, I can deal with the

going on? Why aren't they
hitting you?

<i>getting started!</i>

305
00:21:58,424 --> 00:22:01,935
<i>(Rei) That's right! There's lots</i>
<i>of boys out there! At the beach,</i>
<i>for instance!</i>

306
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:03,737
<i>(Minako) One who's really</i>
<i>good‐looking!</i>

307
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:04,605
<i>(Rei) And kind!</i>

308
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:06,272
<i>(Makoto) And who's</i>
<i>crazy about me!</i>

309
00:22:07,273 --> 00:22:08,675
<i>(All) Yeah! That's the</i>
<i>boyfriend I want!</i>

310
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:09,576
<i>(Robert) What the?</i>

311
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:12,245
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) I knew it! You</i>
<i>were all spying on me!</i>

312
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:14,414
<i>[Groans]</i>

313
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,291
<i>(Usagi) Yay! It's my favorite</i>
<i>time of year again! Time for</i>
<i>summer fun at the beach!</i>

314
00:23:58,358 --> 00:24:03,737
<i>(Ami) It may be summer, Usagi,</i>
<i>but it's not all fun and games.</i>
<i>There's our homework too, we</i>
<i>can't forget that.</i>

315
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,472
<i>(Usagi) Oh, I can! I just</i>
<i>bought a new swimsuit!</i>

316
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:09,442
<i>(Ami) I wish you'd put some of</i>
<i>that enthusiasm into your</i>
<i>studies.</i>

317
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:10,544
<i>[Usagi giggles]</i>

318
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:15,549
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon SuperS:</i>
<i>"Shining Summer Days: Ami Under</i>
<i>the Sea‐Breeze."</i>

319
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:18,451
<i>(Usagi) The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
