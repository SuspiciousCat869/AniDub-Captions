308
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:52,452
Sailor Moon!

309
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:57,924
It's OK! I think I've got it.
As long as it doesn't wobble
or anything!

310
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:03,269
Very well, Sailor Moon. I
challenge you to a duel by
tightrope.

311
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:07,307
I'll leave the rest to you.
Get rid of them all, okay?

312
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:12,946
Oh, this is fun! Haven't you
ever wanted to know what true
fear feels like?

313
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:14,515
Not really!

314
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:17,450
Look, eyes closed and
blindfolded!

315
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,619
You're nuts!

316
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:22,556
You need to accept your fear.
Fear is your friend, use it!

317
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:24,457
I have enough friends already!

318
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:27,528
Now here's where it
gets really dangerous!

319
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:29,295
I am so wearing the
wrong shoes for this!

320
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:33,366
Whatever you do, don't look
down! In fact, don't look at
all! It's scarier that way.

321
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:35,368
You fearless psychopath!

322
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:38,639
How dare you put an innocent
young girl in such a perilous
situation?

323
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:40,507
You're a disgrace to men!

324
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,042
Tuxedo Mask, you came!

325
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:47,581
Whaaat? I'm falling! No! That's
impossible@ I've got this, I've
got this...!

326
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:49,382
...No I don't!

327
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:51,985
[screaming]

328
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:55,388
Chibi‐Moon, call Pegasus!

329
00:19:55,421 --> 00:20:01,502
Please, Pegasus, protect
everyone's dream!

330
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,642
Twinkle Yell!

331
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:13,847
[neigh]

332
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:34,535
Moon Gorgeous Meditation!

333
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,251
Stage out@

334
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,603
[groan]

335
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:04,270
Hi there! You okay?

336
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:08,675
I think so... wait, where
are my fairy rescuers?

337
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:11,612
Heh, I think you must
have been dreaming.

338
00:21:11,678 --> 00:21:14,414
I wasn't! No, I saw
them plain as day.

339
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:18,952
<i>There were 2 fairies, 1 on a</i>
<i>tightrope and 1 ringing a bell</i>
<i>and calling for Pegasus...</i>

340
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:23,890
I believe you! I think those
fairies do exist, Mr. Kitakata.

341
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:25,191
You do?

342
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,228
<i>Next time you see them, do you</i>
<i>promise to introduce me to them?</i>

343
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:29,362
<i>(Mr. Kitakata)</i>
<i>I sure will!</i>

344
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:30,230
<i>(Chibi‐Usa)</i>
<i>Thanks!</i>

345
00:21:30,263 --> 00:21:31,532
<i>[laughter]</i>

346
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,867
[gasp] Hey, whatever happened
to Rei and the others anyway?

347
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:36,703
Huh? What do you mean
what happened to them?

348
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:39,239
You overslept again, and
they left without us!

349
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:43,243
[groaning]

350
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:45,979
This is ridiculous, when are
we gonna get to the lake?

351
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:49,550
Hey, wait! Oh, no. I think we're
more lost than we were before.

352
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,383
Huh!?

353
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,587
Girls, lets call it a
day and go home.

354
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,722
(All)
Not after we've come this far!

355
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:56,890
Okay, sorry!

356
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,326
Mr. Kitakata! Where are you!?

357
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:02,669
It's me, Rei the
fairy! I'm here!

358
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:04,938
<i>(Minako)</i>
<i>You? A fairy? Heh,</i>
<i>that's a good one!</i>

359
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:07,273
<i>(Ami)</i>
<i>I still think we</i>
<i>oughta head home...</i>

360
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:10,443
<i>(Girls)</i>
<i>You're fairies are here, Mr.</i>
<i>Kitakata! Come and get us!</i>

361
00:23:53,754 --> 00:23:58,592
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>A car might look like a pile of</i>

362
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:00,126
<i>(Mamoru)</i>
<i>Where did that come from!?</i>

363
00:24:00,193 --> 00:24:03,069
(Usagi)
I guess I'm just feeling a
little philosophical today.

364
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:04,404
<i>(Mamoru)</i>
<i>Was it something you ate?</i>

365
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:07,140
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Yeah, those pickled pig's</i>
<i>feet I had yesterday...</i>

366
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:10,744
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Of course not! Can't a</i>
<i>girl be philosophical?</i>

367
