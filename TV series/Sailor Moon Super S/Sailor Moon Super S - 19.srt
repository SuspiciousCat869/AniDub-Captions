1
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,424
<i>(Usagi) Yay! It's</i>
<i>festival time!</i>

2
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,126
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) Usagi, that</i>
<i>lady over there...</i>

3
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,161
<i>(Usagi) Okonomiyaki, yakisoba,</i>
<i>shaved ice!</i>

4
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,263
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) Doesn't she look</i>
<i>like she's hiding something?</i>

5
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,298
<i>(Usagi) Sausages,</i>
<i>chocolate‐covered bananas!</i>

6
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,034
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) Are you even</i>
<i>listening to me?!</i>

7
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,870
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Hey! Stop interrupting my</i>
<i>fun, or else...</i>

8
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,839
In the name
of the moon...

9
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,874
(Both) We'll punish you!

10
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:23,557
"Juban Holiday: The Carefree
Princess."

11
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:28,895
And up next, the latest news
regarding the princess.

12
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:33,233
<i>(Newscaster) Princess Rubina of</i>
<i>the Kingdom of Amethyst, who is</i>
<i>currently visiting Japan,</i>

13
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:35,401
<i>(Newscaster) was seen by a</i>
<i>doctor due to a cold.</i>

14
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:41,474
Because of this, her previously
scheduled factory visitation and
reception have been postponed
until further notice.

15
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:42,743
How unfortunate.

16
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:43,977
Yes, indeed.

17
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:51,417
Actually, in the future, King
Endymion and Neo Queen Serenity
would also become ill when they
had royal ceremonies to attend.

18
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:52,285
Huh?

19
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,857
But thankfully, they both seem
to feel completely better by the
time the ceremonies are over,

20
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,324
so there's nothing to worry
about!

21
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,366
You said the King
gets sick too?

22
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:02,002
Yes.

23
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:05,105
<i>I'd expect that from the Queen,</i>
<i>but the King too?</i>

24
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,608
You look like you're worried
about something.

25
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:10,143
[Groans] That's because I am.

26
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:13,814
Chibi‐Usa!

27
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:15,849
Yeah...no.

28
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:17,017
<i>(Usagi) Come on!</i>

29
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,619
Don't think so!

30
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:20,020
<i>(Usagi) You're heartless!</i>

31
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:22,055
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) The insults</i>
<i>aren't helping, you know.</i>

32
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:24,725
And you're really not gonna help
me out with these at all?

33
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,360
And why should I do that?

34
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:30,731
You're the one who went on a
spending spree and blew your
allowance in a day.

35
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:34,568
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) And now you have to</i>
<i>run errands for Mommy to earn a</i>
<i>little cash.</i>

36
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:38,505
Duh, why else would I be doing
this? But I have way too much to
carry now.

37
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:40,541
I was hoping you'd help
with at least one.

38
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,576
I'll do it if you give
me half the money.

39
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:43,977
[Groans]

40
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:48,081
You don't need half of it, you
still have plenty of money!

41
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:49,883
Of course I do!

42
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,385
So then take one of these
bags, you greedy brat!

43
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,087
No way! No way! No way!

44
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:02,769
Hold it for me!
No! No! No! Hold it for me!

45
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:08,274
[Groans]

46
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:11,678
Proper girls shouldn't be
fighting like this. It's
unladylike.

47
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:13,213
Here, I can fix this.

48
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:21,054
Excuse me sir, would you carry
this young lady's bags?

49
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:22,122
[Groans]

50
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,859
And you can help her as well.

51
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:26,727
[Gasps]

52
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:30,597
Uh, that's not necessary!
[Chuckles] Bye‐bye! Keep up
Chibi‐Usa.

53
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:32,599
Oh.

54
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,034
What was that about?

55
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:35,935
Beats me.

56
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:46,713
Wow! A festival! Let's hurry
home and get changed so we can
come back!

57
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,050
[Groans] Guess I'm carrying all
these bags myself!

58
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,385
<i>(Usagi) Ow, my arm, it's</i>
<i>cutting off my circulation.</i>

59
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:56,289
[Gasps] Oh! This looks so fun!

60
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,466
Oh.

61
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,838
<i>(Hawk's Eye) I hear she's a real</i>
<i>princess.</i>

62
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,609
<i>(Hawk's Eye) It's hard to</i>
<i>believe you let this one slip</i>
<i>by, Tiger's Eye.</i>

63
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:13,179
She's a bit old for me. Besides,
from what I've heard she's
bedridden from a cold.

64
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,516
What? You really believe
those rumors?

65
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,852
You're so gullible. That's
totally just a bad cover up
story.

66
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,122
I'm tired of having to go to so
many boring royal events!

67
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,458
What do we do? The Princess has
run off without a trace!

68
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:29,329
Just tell the press that she's
come down with a cold and go
find her right this instant!

69
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,597
(Both) Get it?

70
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,832
It's so obvious.

71
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,535
Hmph. Whatever. She's
still too old.

72
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,837
Pass!

73
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,639
Uh‐huh.

74
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,873
Hmm?

75
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:46,780
<i>(Chibi‐Usa) Come on, Usagi,</i>
<i>hurry up! Let's go, you slow</i>
<i>poke!</i>

76
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,214
<i>(Usagi) Okay, okay I'm ready!</i>

77
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,352
Oh, hi.

78
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,690
Uh, hello, can I help you?

79
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:00,326
Why hello there. How do you do?
My name is Rubina.

80
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,236
Oh! It's a pleasure to meet
you! I'm Usagi Tsukino.

81
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:04,871
And I'm Chibi‐Usa!

82
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:07,574
Well?

83
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,543
(Both) Well, what?

84
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:13,914
Don't let me get in your way.
Feel free to continue. [Giggles]

85
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:16,049
Huh?

86
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:18,318
Well, go on!

87
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:22,055
Okay, I guess we should start
making our way to the festival
then?

88
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:23,189
Sure, let's go.

89
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:26,092
<i>(Usagi) Don't know how you found</i>
<i>our house, but nice talking to</i>
<i>you!</i>

90
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:28,562
Wait, isn't that?

91
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:30,363
Oh.

92
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,602
Oh!

93
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:41,007
Ah! Wonderful!

94
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:01,267
I love everything about this!

95
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,204
<i>(Rubina) Wow!</i>

96
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,040
And you said this type of
cotton is actually edible?

97
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:08,542
Uh‐huh.

98
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:09,075
Oh?

99
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,789
Miss Rubina definitely doesn't
seem like your normal, every day
tourist.

100
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:26,292
Yeah. Guess we'll just
have to keep an eye on
her while she's here.

101
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:31,331
Maybe if we're around
her long enough, we'll
figure out what's going on.

102
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:33,166
<i>(Usagi) Hey! I finally did it!</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

103
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,968
That was my
fifth try!

104
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:38,505
So this is what wasting money
looks like. I feel so informed.

105
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:40,574
[Sighs]

106
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:43,176
[Gasps] Miss Rubina is gone!

107
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,512
Huh? Where do you
think she ran off to?

108
00:07:45,646 --> 00:07:46,412
I donno!

109
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,148
We should probably
find her quickly!

110
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,620
<i>(Child) Mom, buy it</i>
<i>for me!</i>

111
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:54,688
<i>(Mom) No!</i>

112
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:59,325
I want it right now!

113
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:00,193
No way.

114
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:01,968
You can do it
little guy!

115
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:06,973
I! Want! It!

116
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,875
<i>(Mom) Stop acting</i>
<i>so spoiled!</i>

117
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:14,114
<i>(Nanny) You mustn't act so</i>
<i>spoiled, Princess.</i>

118
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,316
I assure you that
I am not!

119
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:20,987
Ordinary women from other
countries are able to freely go
out and about, so why can't I?

120
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:26,492
The Amethyst Princess should
think more about the good of her
people, not her own selfish
desires.

121
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,364
You have to understand that for
this country and our Kingdom to
build good relations, you must‐‐

122
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:36,236
So to accomplish that, are you
saying it's perfectly fine to
simply sacrifice my freedom?

123
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:37,671
That's not what
I meant.

124
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:39,139
Princess Rubina...

125
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:44,410
[Sighs] I understand I'll get
myself ready. You may leave now.

126
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:46,046
Of course.

127
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:52,886
Buy! Me! One! Right! Now!

128
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,388
Here.

129
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:56,823
Uh.

130
00:08:56,857 --> 00:08:57,991
[Laughing]

131
00:08:58,024 --> 00:09:01,367
Hey, where are you going? That's
not yours, give it back!

132
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:03,737
Freedom, huh?

133
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:04,505
Huh?

134
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:08,108
Would you like
a balloon, too?

135
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:09,676
Mhm.

136
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:11,745
[Chuckles]

137
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,247
<i>(Rubina) Here you go!</i>

138
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,551
<i>(Rubina) Oh, you want one too?</i>
<i>Okay!</i>

139
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:19,553
[Chuckles]

140
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,621
You kids have money?

141
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:21,588
Um.

142
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:25,258
[Giggles] All right, one at a
time now.

143
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,860
Get back here!

144
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:30,931
[Sighs]

145
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,136
[Sighs]

<i>(Rubina) It looks so</i>
<i>free up there.</i>

00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:48,448
[Kids yelling]

148
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:55,155
Hey, Miss. 'Scuse me. You do
plan on paying for all those
balloons you gave away, right?

149
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:58,124
Oh, right.

150
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,101
Here.

151
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,505
Huh?

152
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,006
Hm!

153
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:12,212
Uh. Hey! I'm not in the mood to
play games here lady!

think about how the people who
care about you must feel right
now?

that I need to take care of
today.

Huh?

210
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:16,650
Is he a friend
of yours, Usagi?

211
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:19,786
Yeah, but much more importantly,
why did you just run off?

212
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,656
If there's something wrong, then
you should tell us so we can
help you.

213
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:27,794
Usagi, sometimes people have
things bothering them that they
would rather not talk about.

214
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:30,564
Don't be so forward about asking
her to tell you.

215
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:35,101
Excuse me? I bet you got that
from reading one of Mom's
self‐help books again, didn't
you?

216
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:38,304
Anyway, Mamo, why are you here
with Miss Rubina?

217
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:39,439
Oh! Yeah, why?

218
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:43,076
I just happened to run into her
as I was looking for the both of
you.

219
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:46,246
She stopped me to ask for
directions. Isn't that right?

Uh, yes!

Yeah.

00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:58,258
Score!

226
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:01,695
Mamo, you shouldn't
reward children when
they don't actually
deserve it.

227
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:07,440
Well, I guess you do have a
point there. You know, it's a
good thing you're so mature,

So how'd it go?

231
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,618
I'm almost positive she's the
real princess.

232
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:20,721
In that case, is it okay for her
to be out with them?

233

I can't help but worry.

go back eventually.

Usagi.

237
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:33,700
What if being around Usagi all
day makes her assume that's what
all common people are like.

Yeah?

244
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:56,690
I've been wondering, since he's
your friend, do you get to see
Mr. Mamo whenever you want?

245
00:14:56,757 --> 00:15:01,067
Well, yeah, except for when he's
