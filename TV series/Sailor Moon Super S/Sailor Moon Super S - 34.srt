working up a sweat by

too lazy, when it comes
right down to it.

Are you all right?

one of them?

unusual.

Yeah, but...

Hey...what happened?
Why are you still here?

That's like the
fifth one today.

of them, but they just
keep coming back again.

happening outside is
the work of those people

180
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:51,217
trying to find you?

181
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:55,889
That's right. And
now, I must say
goodbye to you.

the person who can
release the power of

And Quickly.

my mission, both this

destroyed by the
Dead Moon.

the power of the Golden

190
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,194
this person, then both
worlds could be saved,
right?

191

wouldn't have to
say goodbye!

192
