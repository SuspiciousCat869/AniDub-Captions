00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,291
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Do you have a beautiful dream?</i>

2
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,428
<i>(Chibi‐Usa)</i>
<i>Life is so complicated,</i>
<i>and full of ups and downs!</i>

3
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,931
<i>...it's hard to make</i>
<i>your dreams come true!</i>

4
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:35,468
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Yeah, and what's even harder is</i>
<i>holding onto those dreams, even</i>
<i>after they do come true!</i>

5
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:39,005
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>But, whatever happens, don't</i>
<i>give up on your beautiful dream!</i>

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,174
‐Hang onto them!
‐Hang onto them!

7
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,553
<i>(Chibi‐Usa Thought)</i>
<i>I've done just like you said...</i>

8
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:25,391
<i>...I haven't told anyone about</i>
<i>you or about this forest!</i>

9
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:29,229
<i>But, Pegasus, why can't you tell</i>
<i>me more about yourself...?</i>

10
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:31,965
<i>Why can't we see</i>
<i>each other more often?</i>

11
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:35,468
<i>When you come to help me,</i>
<i>where do you come from?</i>

12
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:38,471
<i>Please, tell me...</i>

13
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,841
<i>(Pegasus Thought)</i>
<i>Why?</i>

14
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:44,745
<i>(Chibi‐usa thought)</i>
<i>Because... because I</i>
<i>want to be your friend!</i>

15
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:49,850
<i>(Pegasus)</i>
<i>I'm sorry, but I</i>
<i>can't do that...</i>

16
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,253
<i>(Chibi‐Usa)</i>
<i>Yeah, I thought</i>
<i>that's what you'd say.</i>

17
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:56,356
<i>(Pegasus)</i>
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

18
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:05,038
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Connecting Hearts:</i>
<i>Chibi‐usa and Pegasus</i>

19
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:09,710
<i>(Madame Zirconia)</i>
<i>I'll explain it one more time...</i>

20
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:14,815
You must capture Pegasus because
his powers are the key to our
conquest of this world!

21
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:20,320
But, the Pegasus who appears in
this world is merely a shadow of
its actual self

22
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:26,993
So, to capture the real Pegasus,
you must first find the human
host in who's beautiful dreams

23
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:28,662
he is hiding... Understand?

24
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:30,396
But, Madame Zirconia...

25
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:35,536
What would happen if this
beautiful dreamer were to become
aware of the powers Pegasus has?

26
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:38,171
Hm? What do you mean?

27
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:42,576
I'm saying what if the host
whoever she is, suddenly
realizes that the flying horse

28
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:45,378
in her beautiful dreams has the
power to conquer the world?

29
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:49,716
What's to keep her from deciding
to use those powers for her own
purposes?

30
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,387
I kinda doubt that the sort of
person who has beautiful dreams
would want to conquer the world.

31
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,225
Yeah, and if she did, the
minute she started thinking like
that, she wouldn't be a

32
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:03,537
"beautiful dreamer" anymore. Her
dreams would become all dark and
twisted...

33
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,372
What Hawks Eye said
is right for once!

34
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:10,911
And nobody knows that better
than Pegasus, that's why you
must be very careful.

35
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:15,616
He will never let the host learn
who he is or the power he
possesses.

36
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:21,522
<i>...The moment the host becomes</i>
<i>aware of the truth, Pegasus must</i>
<i>find a different host.</i>

37
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:29,429
Hebihanabiko!

38
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:33,600
Yes, Master Tiger's Eye?

39
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:36,803
So, were you listening?
Did you get all that?

40
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,109
Yes. Especially the part about
the Pegasus in this world being
merely a shadow...

41
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:50,316
Right. And you possess the
unique and very handy ability of
being able to enter a person's
heart through their shadow.

42
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:55,589
<i>So, using the shadow Pegasus,</i>
<i>you can sneak into the heart of</i>
<i>the real Pegasus.</i>

43
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:58,892
Then you can find out where that
flying horse has been hiding,

44
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:03,103
learn the identity of his human
host, and save us all a lot of
time.

45
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,438
Not only that, Master
Tiger's Eye...

46
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:10,310
When we find the host, I can use
her shadow to steal into her
heart, too...

47
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,946
And bend her to our will.

48
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,783
So once we have the
host, we'll have Pegasus!

49
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:20,020
He's as good as
ours, master!
[chuckle]

50
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:26,492
I like it. I'll just get Fish's
Eye or Hawk's Eye to draw
Pegasus out. Be ready to move.

51
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,529
Always, Master...

52
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:35,001
[happy giggling]

53
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,204
Chibi‐usa!
You done yet?

54
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,472
Almost!

55
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,843
Wow! You're a really
good artist!

56
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,645
You think so!?

57
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,814
You're even starting to
look like a really good artist,
Chibi‐usa!

58
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,316
Call me, "Monsieur Artistico!"

59
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,619
That's not bad,
for a beginner.

60
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,187
Hmpf!

61
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,157
"Not bad?!" Okay, let's
see yours, Kyusuke!

62
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,159
I'm not done yet.

63
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,636
[arguing]

64
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,305
What's all this? Are you two
done with your paintings?

65
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:08,509
‐Almost done!
‐I'm almost finished,
too, miss Marino!

66
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,343
And, you, Miss Tsukino?

67
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:13,146
[gasp] What on earth...?

68
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:14,981
Why are you dressed
up like that?

69
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:18,919
[giggle] I'm copying a famous
artist I saw on T. V.

70
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:23,489
Well I don't approve. I
wish you would be serious!
This is not playtime.

71
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:26,359
But, I am being
serious, Miss Marino!

72
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:28,895
I feel more talented when
I'm dressed up like this!

73
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:32,766
Fine. Anyway, how is
your painting coming along?

74
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,837
Oh, that's really
very well drawn.

75
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,772
And a fine sense of color.

76
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,907
‐See, I told you!
‐That's just what I said!

77
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,678
However, I'm afraid I can't
give you a very good grade.

78
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:46,179
‐Why not!?
‐Why not!?

79
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:48,515
<i>(Miss Marino)</i>
<i>The assignment was trying</i>
<i>to paint a landscape.</i>

80
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:52,853
<i>That means trying to reproduce</i>
<i>what is really there. Exactly</i>
<i>as it looks.</i>

81
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:58,191
It doesn't mean adding imaginary
creatures and things.

82
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:02,035
Well, no, but I think he
looks good with the scenery.

83
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:04,137
That may be, but
it's not‐‐

84
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:05,939
You're always so strict
and ridged, Miss Marino!

85
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:09,543
Ya know, that might be why
you're still single. Ever
thought of that?

86
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,978
[gasp]

87
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:17,651
In any case, you still have
time, so I would suggest you try
and fix it before turning it in.

88
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:22,623
Now then. How are you children
doing over there? May I see
your work?

89
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:26,226
<i>(Momoko)</i>
<i>You're right. She's so cold and</i>
<i>stern all the time...</i>

90
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,128
<i>...I wonder why that is.</i>

91
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,164
Who knows! Maybe she just
doesn't like kids.

92
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:32,398
Hmm...

93
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:42,643
<i>I wish I knew how to deal</i>
<i>with them better...</i>

94
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:47,814
I think this one would be
perfect for our next target.

95
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:50,984
She doesn't
look that special.

96
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:54,120
You like older women, Hawk's
eye. Why don't you take her?

97
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:56,523
Nah, I'm not feeling it.

98
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,260
Then how about it, Fish's Eye.
It's time you did some work
around here.

99
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:04,270
No way, it's not my thing. Women
just don't do it for me.

100
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:13,013
Alright. So, just what is your
"thing," anyway? The strong,
handsome, big brother type like
me?

101
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:18,018
You have got to be kidding! What
would I want with a leotard
wearing air‐head like you!?

102
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:20,821
Okay, don't get
your knickers in a twist.

103
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:25,859
Rats. I was hoping to get one of
them to lure Pegasus for me.

<i>Oh well. I'll just have to do</i>
<i>the whole thing myself.</i>

<i>...and that way I'll get sole</i>
<i>credit for capturing Pegasus.</i>

00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:40,974
Hop, hop, hop! C'mon! Keep
moving, Usagi!

107
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:44,044
What are you talking about!?
This is the third phone pole!

108
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:46,847
Now, come on! Get back
here and help carry these!

109
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,649
Oh, all right.

110
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:50,717
Hurry up!

111
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:53,520
Hang on! Play you again!

112
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:56,322
‐Rock, Paper, Scissors!
‐Rock, Paper, Scissors!

113
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,234
you lost. You carry them for
three more phone poles.

Hey, wait! Slow down, Chibi‐usa!

115
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:07,541
Wait for me! Come on!

116
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:11,745
The least you can do is carry
one of the small bags!

117
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:14,515
And, you're from the future! You
probably knew what I was going‐‐

118
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:15,916
[gasp]

119
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:19,886
This is not my day! [gasp] The
apples! The meat! The eggs!

120
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,188
Oh no! Eggs!

121
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:24,725
Jeez, she's slow...

122
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:28,729
Why, miss Tsukino.
Good afternoon.

123
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:31,532
Oh, good afternoon.

124
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:33,299
Chibi‐usa, who the
heck is this woman?

125
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:34,968
Miss Marino,
my art teacher.

126
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:36,436
Oh...

127
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:38,605
How do you do!?
Very pleased to meet you!

128
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:41,141
Uh, thank you for
teaching Chibi‐usa!

129
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:42,776
And, you're her...

130
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:45,612
...sister! Tell me, so how
is our Chibi‐usa performing
in school these days?

131
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:47,280
Oh, quit acting
like my guardian!

132
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,983
I bet this sweet little
pain in the neck is quite
a handful, huh!?

133
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,418
You must be talking
about yourself...

134
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:55,388
Well, your sister is
quite popular in class.

135
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:58,391
She seems to make friends
with everyone so quickly.

136
00:09:58,424 --> 00:10:01,568
Sometimes I
almost envy her.

137
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,937
[gasp]

138
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:04,905
Oh, you don't say!

139
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,873
I'm so sorry
about your eggs!

140
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:10,343
Oh, that's perfectly alright! I
like them scrambled anyways, so
don't worry!

141
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,346
Well, if you're sure...
I'll see you at school,
Miss Tsukino.

142
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,282
‐Yes you will!
‐Goodbye, Miss Marino!

143
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,218
Heh heh heh...

144

So are you really that popular
or was she just being polite?

I am, yeah.

Trouble at work? Or, perhaps in
your personal life? I see
something's worrying you.

150
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,313
I'm here to relieve women
of their worries...

And this is your lucky day,
because today only, I'm offering
a free life consultation.

Not that you aren't quite lovely
when you look worried...

But I'm sure a smile would
make you even lovelier...

Wouldn't you like to become
a more wonderful version of
yourself?

Come on, sit down now

Well...

158
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:15,582
You see, I've wanted to teach
ever since I was a little girl

159
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:20,486
The problem is, now that I'm a
teacher I find it difficult to
bond with the children...

160
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:22,155
I see...

161
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:25,325
It's gotten so that I've
lost my self confidence.

162
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:28,962
I'm not even sure I should
be a teacher anymore...

163
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:32,165
Uh huh, interesting...

164
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:38,505

<i>I deserve a metal...</i>

166
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:45,612
If, if only I knew how to get
the children to like me, that
would at least be a start.

167
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:49,115
Well, don't you worry, my
lovely, your troubles are over!

Huh?

kiss all of your cares goodbye.

work trying to be friends with

00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:18,785
Alright, but you know, if you
don't follow the assignment, you
can't expect a perfect grade.

301
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:23,456
That's okay! I'm not perfect,
but I like myself the way I am!

302
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,693
You are an unusual
girl, aren't you?

303
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,863
May I tell you a little secret?

304
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:33,299
Just between you and me,
I loved your painting.

305
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,035
[giggle]

306
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,136
[happy gasp]

307
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,039
Goodbye, Chibi‐Usa.
See you at school!

308
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,241
Goodbye.

309
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:48,515
<i>I like myself the way</i>
<i>I am... right!</i>

310
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:52,352
So bring it on, you little
monsters! I will never give up!

311
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,355
[laughing]

312
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:07,273
Oh?

313
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:15,281
Huh?

314
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,085
Pegasus, why are you here?

315
00:21:19,085 --> 00:21:22,088
Because I want to be
your friend, too.

316
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:24,758
I want to be near you.

317
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:29,429
You mean it? Does that mean we
can see each other all the time
now?

318
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:33,366
Yes. When it's just the
two of us, like this.

319
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:36,436
That's so great! Then we can
stay up all night talking!

320
00:21:36,436 --> 00:21:38,939
Wait, but first, I'll
get ready for bed!

321
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:41,374
[gasp]

322
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:44,110
What's the matter?

323
00:21:44,144 --> 00:21:47,480
Oh, uh, nothing/

324
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:53,554
You know, we all call you
"Pegasus," but that's probably
not your real name, right?

325
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:55,922
What should we call you?

326
00:21:55,956 --> 00:22:00,060
I'm sorry, I can't tell
you that. Not yet.

327
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:02,002
I'm sorry...

328
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:05,005
No, it's okay!

329
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:08,975
We have lots and lots of time
to get to know all about
each other, right!?

330
