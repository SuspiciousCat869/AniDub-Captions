A homebuilt aircraft?

Mhm. Yeah, that's my dream. To
fly in my own aircraft.

It's a lot more than just a

Well, just wait, my
St. Louis will fly!

it'll fly.

He's frustrated he can't
get his aircraft to fly.

And the more frustrated he
gets, the more he wants to
do it all himself.

What he really needs are friends

I wish Hiroki would
let us be his friends.
