someone like me?

I saw your fashion
show the other day.
My favorite part was that
beautiful wedding dress.

181
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:23,423

promise to myself! I'm going to
wear one just like it when I get
married.

glad. Hm?

So, Mr. Usui...
I have a small request
if you're willing to hear it?

00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:33,166
Okay?

185
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:38,572
I didn't want to ask because I
might come off as shameless, but
then I realized that I am
shameless!

Uh? Alright, well
what's your request
then?

187
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:47,180
Since you asked... I
wanted to have you design
the dress for my future wedding.
For free.

188
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:53,219
Ah! You think
I'm shameless now,
don't you?!

189
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,188
Oh! Well, maybe
just a little.

You "just like
them', huh?

Is something wrong,

I guess you
could say that.

How did I let this happen?!

227
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:36,202
I've just been mindlessly
working! And because of that, I
let myself lose sight of loving
what I do!

228
00:14:36,537 --> 00:14:39,205
It's not wonder
my designs were
garbage.

Thank you!

231
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:45,879
Because of you, I
was able to find my
passion for designing
again!

232
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:46,547
Yeah?

233

to extend the offer
to design your wedding
dress.

what's going on,
but I accept!

for?!

Yoshiki Usui would
design a wedding
dress for you.

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,349
Then why don't you go ask him if
you think I'm lying! He said
that I could visit his studio
whenever...
