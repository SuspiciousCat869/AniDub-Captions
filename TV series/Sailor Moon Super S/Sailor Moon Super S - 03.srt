46
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,814
You probably don't know this,
but spoiling and pampering a
child too much can put a real
strain on your marriage!

47
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:49,415
I read about it in a magazine!

48
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:51,384
Don't lie to me, Usagi! You
never read!

49
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,790
I knew it. It's obvious
Chibi‐Usa's more important to
you than I am. Why don't you
just admit it?

50
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,967
It's just a piece of pie! Will
you please stop making such a
big deal about it!

do with her...

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,851
You said it.

56

<i>(Minako) You're running away</i>
<i>from home because of that?</i>

57
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:26,660
It figures it had to be a fight
over food. That's so you, Usagi.
You're always losing it‐

58
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:31,665
It's not about food! Before the
pie, there was the time she ate
my wasabi rice crackers, the
ones that I'd been saving,...

59
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,869
...and my fudge pebble ice
cream,...and my seaweed‐flavored
potato chips,...and‐

60
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,470
So it is about food.

61
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,005
If I was your mom, I'd disown
you.

62
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,442
Whatever the reason, it's not
worth holding a grudge over.

63
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:49,650
You guys just don't get it. Mom
always takes her side, in
everything!

64
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,021
Chibi‐Usa is just clearly more
important to her than I
am!...[crying]

65
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,523
Oksy, it's okay...

66
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,026
No mother ever thinks that one
child is more important than the
other.

67
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:03,870
Yeah, and remember, right now,
Chibi‐Usa's living far away from
her real parents.

68
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,377
She's at an age when she needs a
lot of attention. Maybe what you
need to do is try to be a little
more patient with her.

should tell her you're sorry.

I hope you all like it.

298
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,225
Thank you!

299
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,868
Wait, your piece is bigger.
Let's switch. Okay?

300
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:05,338
No!...What're you talking about?
Why do we have to switch?

301
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:07,574
'Cuz I'm in the middle of a
growth spurt!

302
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:09,943
By that do you mean you're
growing wider?

303
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:13,547
[growl] Listen, you! You better
watch it. I'm bigger than
you!...

304
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:14,214
[grunting]

305
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,350
Yeah, you're a bigger idiot who
totally failer her math test!

306
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:21,387
Hey, there's so many of us, some
pieces are bound to be bigger
than others...

307
00:21:21,555 --> 00:21:23,790
Yeah, it's hard to cut ten equal
slices.

308
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:28,962
Well, the pie is 360 degrees, so
actually, if you cut each slice
at an angle of 36 degrees, then‐

309
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:31,898
Oh, please, Ami, stop it. No
math while I'm eating.

310
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:36,870
No really, it's a very simple
concept. 360 divided by ten is
36, so if you‐

311
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,470
Quiet!

312
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:39,540
[gasps]

313
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:42,408
Now...Everyone eat the pie!

314
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:45,045
[chewing]

315
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:47,247
...It's de‐li‐cious!

316
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:50,050
You bet it is...[stifled
laughter]

317
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,384
[snickering]

318
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:56,256
...So, Chibi‐Usa, who
do you love more? Your future
mommy or Mommy Ikuko?

319
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:59,960
Oh, that's easy...I love them
both. [chomp]

320
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:03,336
Can I have another piece,
please?

321
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:06,573
No way. What about Dad and
Shingo? Don't you think they'll
want some?

322
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,842
I'll just tell them you are
theirs...[laugh]

323
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:14,948
[laughs]

326
