What's the matter?
Is your chest hurting
again?

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,136
I've been getting

Is it a solar

Can't be... The

the people of Earth.

Pegasus...

Elysion kept the Dead

The Golden Crystal?

55
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:06,607
This horn of mine is
the Golden Crystal.
It gives off sacred

56
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,977
energy... It is the
one thing that can
seal the Dead Moon

57
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,079
back into the
darkness again.

58
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:18,151
<i>The Golden Crystal is</i>

<i>and planets.</i>

60
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:27,127
So that's it. That
explains why the Dead
Moon has been

61
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,962
relentlessly
searching for you.

62
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,632
Yeah, it's because
they want to get
their hands on your

63
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:32,799
Golden Crystal,
right?

64
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,969
The answer's
simple, then! All you
have to do is use

65
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,772
that Golden Crystal
thingie on your head
to beat the Dead Moon!

66
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,541
That's not how it
works...

[lightly gasping]

68
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,645
See, Pegasus isn't
able to activate
the Golden Crystal

69
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:49,215
himself... He needs
to find the person who
can release its energy.

70
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,720
Chibi Moon, how
did you‐‐

71
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:54,888
‐‐know all this?

72
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,491
Pegasus has been
searching for that
person all this time.

73
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:02,869
But whoever it is,
he hasn't been able
to find them anywhere.

74
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:06,573
So you knew all
along? Chibi Moon,
why didn't you tell

75
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,141
us about any
of this sooner?!

76
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:12,979
I asked her not to.
Knowledge of the
Golden Crystal is

77
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:16,049
something that is
passed on only to the
priest of Elysion...

78
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:20,854
However, I defied
this code and
revealed its power

79
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:22,689

[gasping]

81
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:27,661
That's because I
believed that you
were the one who

82
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:30,163
could activate the
Golden Crystal.

Even in his pathetic
condition, he mocks me.

98

the power of this

[struggling]

104
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:18,685
As strange as it all
sounds, Pegasus is
telling the truth,

105
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:19,820
I know it.

106
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:21,121
How, Mamo?

107
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:24,691
The voice of Pegasus,
I've heard it, too.

108
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,059
What did he say?

109
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:30,964
Prince Endymion...
your body has become
attuned to Earth,

110
00:08:30,997 --> 00:08:32,833
your Guardian Planet.

00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:41,174
also eating
away at my body.

114
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:44,711
If only I was the
person who was able
to release the power

115
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:47,013
of the Golden
Crystal...

116
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,915
It isn't your
fault.

117
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:52,218
Diana's right. So what
if we don't have the
Golden Crystal?

118
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:54,420
Yeah, as long as
we put our powers
together,

119
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:56,322
we can totally
handle anything.

120
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,992
Don't worry, we

that when I was a

thought I saw a white
horse with wings,
too.

You too, Mercury?

I did, too.

those feelings were
like...

Years later I
convinced myself that

Pegasus was
just a fairy tale.

255

I guess I decided to
bury those feelings

own dreams.

the feelings you have
now and hang on tight

315
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:40,406
<i>I know the truth.</i>
<i>That Pegasus is just</i>
<i>an illusion. The real</i>

316
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:44,410
<i>Pegasus can survive</i>
<i>in the human world</i>
<i>only by residing in</i>

317
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,479
<i>someone's beautiful</i>
<i>dream.</i>

318
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,983
That being so, we
simply need to
capture his host.

319
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,355
Huh?

320
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,391
[screaming]

321
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:02,569
Ahhh!

322
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:05,706
Chibi Moon‐‐!!

323
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:08,709
[screaming]

324
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:14,515
[horse whinnying]

325
00:21:20,754 --> 00:21:25,726
Ah...At last I've
found you...
Pegasus' host.

326
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,027
[gasping]

327
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:31,031
So that's the
Golden Mirror..!

328
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:32,132
Cool!

329
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:33,967
N‐‐ No!

330
00:21:36,903 --> 00:21:37,738
Now!

331
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,073
[gasping]

332
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:43,109
Chibi Moon!

333
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:47,548
[grunting]

334
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:49,082
Mamoru! What's
wrong?

335
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:51,952
[grunting]
<i>Chibi‐Usa!</i>

336
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:56,089
Oh, no! Chibi Moon!
Chibi Moon!!

337
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,568
Behold, my queen, it
is done, just as you
commanded. I have

338
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:05,171
finally found the one
who possesses the
Golden Mirror.

339
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:10,777
Now Pegasus and the
Golden Crystal are
ours at last!

340
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:14,447
[laughing]

341
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:55,055
<i>Let Chibi Moon go!</i>

342
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:57,958
[chuckling]
At last, I will have
revenge for the years

343
00:23:58,024 --> 00:23:59,359
of suffering
I've endured.

344
00:23:59,392 --> 00:24:01,868
Feel the terror
of true darkness!

345
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:04,905
<i>No matter how</i>
<i>powerful you are, we</i>
<i>will protect Chibi</i>

346
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:07,207
<i>Moon, Mamo, and</i>
<i>this planet!</i>

347
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:10,243
<i>Hm! What can you</i>
<i>do to stop me?</i>

348
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:13,880
<i>Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Moon SuperS,</i>
<i>"Labyrinth of</i>

349
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:15,982
<i>Mirrors: Chibi Moon</i>
<i>Captured."</i>

350
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:18,284
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
