You all must be Ami's friends.

him about us, Ami?

[gasp] No! Nothing bad!

Hey, guys...
Huh??

169
00:11:22,355 --> 00:11:25,325
I know it's a little late, but
would you like to visit my
studio?

170
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:26,359
I want to introduce
you to my partner.

Okay, Ms. Kyoko.

I'll see you next week!

Be careful on your
way home, okay?

Hi, Mr. Nishino.
Nice to see you.

Likewise, nice to see you too.

Everyone, this is my songwriting
partner who shares the studio
with me... Kyoko.

182
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:11,845
Kyoko this is Ami. You know, the
one from the music forum.

183
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:13,747
Oh sure! Hi, how do you do?

184
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:15,749
Uh‐uh, nice to meet you.

You can ignore her. She's
fine. It's nothing!

It must feel great to meet the
person you've been wondering
about this whole time.

I have a feeling fate
is at work here!

Hey, come on.
Don't tease me.

192
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,736
So do you give
piano lessons, too?

193
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:38,204
Composing songs is a hard
way to make a living.

194
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:42,442
The two of us teach piano and
perform at nightclubs around
town to make ends meet.

195
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,511
That sounds like a
difficult lifestyle.

196
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:48,414
I guess so, but it's worth it
when you have a dream like we
do.

197
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:49,950
A dream?

198
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:55,288
Yes! Our dream is to become
composers whose music is
played around the world.

199
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:59,059
It's quite a goal... maybe we
should be more realistic?

200
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:01,234
There isn't any harm
in us dreaming big.

201
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:04,070

knows no boundaries!
