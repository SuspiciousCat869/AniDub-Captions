<i>Prince Charming.</i>

00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:34,100
<i>But that also means that the</i>
<i>days of being a helpless damsel</i>
<i>in distress are over.</i>

3
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:38,839
<i>So you better think twice before</i>
<i>messing with my friends! Or</i>

Oh, yeah! I guess that's true.

be in alignment, with the moon
between us and the sun.

31
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:04,871
So for a few moments today, the
sun will be completely hidden
behind the moon. And that's
called a total eclipse.

32
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:06,006
Right!

33
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:09,676
All of a sudden, the sky goes
dark and the world gets
spooky...

34
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,912
Weird and terrible things begin
to happen...

35

The dead rise from their graves
and werewolves search for human

Stop trying to scare her with
that bogus nonsense.

It's okay. Don't worry. Half the
time I don't even listen to her
bogus nonsense.

39
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:34,601
Whatta you mean? It's not bogus,
it's totally tru‐‐...Huh?

40
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:36,870
Wait, I'm thinking of the full
moon!

41
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:41,775
<i>(Rei) Huh? Are you serious,</i>
<i>Usagi?! I don't think you're</i>

Ooh!

49

your mom and dad wouldn't
approve of.

50
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,951
Huh?

00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:19,485
Oh, look who's talking.

52
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:20,954
What do you mean?

53
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,825
What's been keeping you at work
so darn late? Mom's beginning to
worry.

54
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:27,628
Whaa‐‐?! I don't know what
you're talking about!

55
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,163
Oooh...!

56
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,165
Hey, guys, it's about to start.

57
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,542
<i>...Wow!...Whoa!</i>

58
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:11,812
<i>(Usagi) So this is how dark the</i>
<i>night would be without any</i>
<i>lights.</i>

59
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:54,487
<i>(Usagi) That's weird...Is that a</i>
<i>circus tent? I don't remember</i>
<i>that being there before.</i>

60
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:58,725
<i>(Rei) Hey, c'mon, Usagi! What</i>
<i>are you doing? We're leaving</i>
<i>without you!</i>

61
00:08:58,825 --> 00:08:59,993
Wait, I'm coming, I'm coming!

62
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:22,188
[laughing]

63
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:26,627
No one even noticed! Will you
look at that, no one even
noticed!

64
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,730
By the way, did I mention that
no one even noticed?

65
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:32,065
These humans are dogs and don't
even know it.

66
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:35,636
And they're raising their
children to be monkeys; they
don't even know that, either.

67
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:38,705
This whole place is nothing but
dogs and monkeys...

68
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:40,741
[cackling]

69
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:42,776
A circus tent suddenly
appears...

70
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:45,145
...Right, smack, in the middle
of their city...

71
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:49,750
...And, still, no one even bats
an eye. Hmm, why is that?

72
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:50,751
Yeah, why?

73
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:51,217
Why?

74
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:51,885
Why?

75
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:52,485
Why?

76
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:52,953
Why?

77
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:53,954
Why?

78
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:56,657
Why is that?

79
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,935
They're creatures who don't care
what happens beyond the walls of
their own little rooms.

80
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:02,869
And that's why...

81
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,206
...Even if giant rats chewed a
hole right through their
planet...

82
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,610
...Or, even if a giant circus
tent appears out of nowhere...

83
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,079
...No one in this city will ever
even notice!

84
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:26,760
[whooping]

85
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,462
<i>(Zirconia) All right, quiet</i>
<i>down!...Quiet!</i>

86
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:49,249
All right, hold on‐‐ Hold on‐‐
Ah! [popping] ...There we go.

87
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:54,588
Now,...

88
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,726
...the time has come at last for
us to establish our dominion
over this world.

89
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,503
Amazon Trio, are you present?

90
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,240
Tiger's Eye, present.

91
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:15,148
Fish's eye, present.

92
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:17,017
Hawk's eye present.

93
00:11:18,018 --> 00:11:20,521
You summoned us, Madame
Zirconia?

94
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:21,655
I did.

95
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:27,628
Why?...Because I am quite
certain that the one we've been
seeking fled to this world.

96
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:33,199
Capturing him is the first step
to world domination, so,
obviously, he must be found.

97
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:40,774
<i>(Zirconia) That is your task.</i>
<i>And you will begin by searching</i>
<i>for those humans possessing</i>
<i>particularly beautiful dreams.</i>

98
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:41,207
Huh?

99
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,210
Um...Beautiful what? Did you say
"dreams", madam?

100
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,478
That's right.

101
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:51,818
You see, unlike you, the one we
seek is unable to maintain his
physical form for very long in
this world.

102
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:57,824
His existence is unsustainable
in the confines of the real
world and he would quickly lose
energy and die.

103
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:03,637
<i>(Zirconia) However, there is one</i>
<i>way, and only one, that would</i>
<i>allow him to remain in this</i>
<i>world.</i>

104
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,838
What's that?

105
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:05,839
It's this.

106
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,243
He could survive indefinetely by
hiding in someone's beautiful
dream.

107
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:11,578
Now I get it.

108
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:17,250
So what you're saying is that
we'll find him hiding in the
beautiful dreams of one of the
humans living on this world.

109
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,521
<i>(Zirconia) Obviously that's what</i>
<i>I'm saying because that's what I</i>
<i>just said!</i>

110
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:26,059
Now, there are many humans,
almost as many as there are
stars...

111
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:33,066
That being said, there can only
be a handful of them who are
capable of dreaming truly
beautiful dreams.

112
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:37,771
So, the one we seek can surely
be found...Now go out and find
him!

113
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:09,409
<i>(Hawk's Eye) Hey. How 'bout this</i>
<i>one?</i>

114
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:10,476
<i>(Tiger's Eye) No, not my type</i>

115
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:10,811
<i>(Tiger's Eye) No, not my type</i>

116
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:16,282
<i>(Hawk's Eye) [sigh] It's not</i>
<i>easy. Even limiting our search</i>
<i>to the handful who have</i>
<i>beautiful dreams,</i>

117
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:18,318
there are still so many...

118
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:21,487
Look at all these cuties. It's
just so hard to choose.

119
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:25,659
Yeah, well, this isn't about
your personal taste. The job
comes first.

120
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,493
None of them seem that special
to me.

121
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:31,464
Seriously, Tiger's Eye, you find
these girls appealing?

122
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:35,168
Well, we're not all as uber
particular as you are, Fish's
Eye.

123
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:39,172
Oh, this one's super‐cute. Wow,
I'll go with her.

124
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:41,441
Oh, glad you're keeping your
personal taste out of it.

125
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:45,679
I don't know, she's got that
wholesome look. That type is
really hard to get.

126
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:50,517
Oh, yes. I know. But even they
can be gotten if you make it
seem like fate threw you
together.

127
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,485
[chuckle]

128
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,459
There you go.

129
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,203
Okay. So what's the dirt?

130
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:03,870
What do you mean?

131
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,674
What's the story with you and
this boyfriend that your brother
was talking about?

132
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:08,208
Oh!

133
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,443
<i>(Unazuki) Hey. Not in front of a</i>
<i>kid.</i>

134
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:14,280
Ohhh. It's at a point where you
can't talk about it in front of
a kid, huh?

135
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,448
<i>(Unazuki) Usagi, cut it out!</i>

136
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:18,952
Hey, is this your boyfriend's
picture in this pendant?

137
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:20,854
Eahh! Let go of that! [grunting]

138
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:23,389
Chibi‐Usa! Stop that!

139
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:27,861
Oww...

140
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:28,729
Anyway,...

141
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,297
...he isn't my boyfriend.

142
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:31,832
Hm?

143
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,303
There weere a couple of times
when it got really close, but he
still hasn't asked me out, not
officially.

144
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:41,141
So, I gues, maybe we just
weren't meant to be...

145
00:14:41,508 --> 00:14:46,179
You know, a girl doesn't
just have to sit around waiting

Hm?

147
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:51,918
Sometimes you just have to hop
on your white horse and go out
there and find Prince Charming
yourself.

148
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,422
After that, whether you have a
fateful encounter or not is up
to you.

Wow, Chibi‐Usa...

Hey. You've been peeking at
Mom's women's magazines again,
haven't you?

152
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,956

Perhaps it's fate.
