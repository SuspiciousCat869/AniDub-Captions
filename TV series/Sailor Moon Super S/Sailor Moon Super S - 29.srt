You could be right about that.

153
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:19,026
Or is the face in the
mirror not true at all?

154
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:22,960
Could it be that the person I
see is not the real me?

155
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:24,893
No, that's the real you.

156
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,460
Like I said, Mirrors
reflect the truth.

157
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:32,560
It's people's hearts that
distort the images ‐ to match
the beauty or ugliness they see
in themselves

158
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:34,193
Hm...

159
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,793
(Rei)
Wow! He's really good.

160
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:41,526
This captures the
real you, Usagi.

161
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,860
I don't know...

162
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:46,860
Look. Don't you think my big
eyes are cuter than that?

163
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:49,493
Is he always at the park?

164
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:50,860
I think so.

165
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:52,860
This is cool. I want
him to paint me.

166
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:57,293
I have a lot of photos of
myself. But having a portrait
painted would be special.

167
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,860
Mhm!

168
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:01,233
...And look at my nose. Don't
you think it's a bit cuter
than in the picture?

169
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:04,466
Hey, guys, let's get
him to paint each of us!

170
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,300
(All)
Yeah!

171
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,666
Oh, and look at my coloring.
I think my skin tone is a
little more fair.

How do you do?

175
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,433
You must be Kamoi Tanaka. I've
heard so much about you...

176
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:56,833
...and I was eager to come meet
you face to face.

177
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,640
You have a reputation as a
skilled artist&

178
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,106
& so I've come today with a
very tempting proposition.

179
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,340
Listen close&

180
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:11,740
I have decided that I will pose
for you and you shall have the
honor of painting my portrait.

181
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:17,406
[haughty laugh] Now please stay
calm. There's no need to get
so excited!

182
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,140
Excuse me! I haven't
finished my proposal!

183
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,140
This isn't the right setting,
so I want you to paint me in
my mansion .

184
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,940
[groan]

185
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:29,806
I'll buy you any art supplies
you desire. Money is no object!

186
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:31,140
I hear you&

187
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,473
And...?

188
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:38,140
I get the sense you've inherited
great wealth. But it's rude to
flaunt what you have, when you
didn't earn it yourself.

189
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,406
[gulp]

190
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,306
I'm sorry. You'll have to hire
someone else to paint you.

191
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,940

<i>...In that case...</i>

194
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Forgive me. I got carried away.

195
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:57,240
The truth is, last year
I lost my father.

196
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:59,240
He was a devoted
art dealer.

197
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:04,446
It was my father's desire to
help struggling, talented
artists like yourself.

198
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,980
He believed in dreams.
I want to carry on his
mission...

199
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,280
His passionate
vision is now mine.

200
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:16,080
It would fulfill my dream if
you'd come to my home and paint
to your heart's content.

201
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:18,513

artist friend work?

204

206
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,246
[gasp] He's gone!

207
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:34,413
That's strange,
where did he go?

208
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:37,646
Maybe he decided to call
it a day, and go home.

209
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,813
Too bad...

210

my portrait done! Now you're
saying he just disappeared?

212
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,580
Come on, Usagi!
What's going on here?!

213
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:49,613
I'm telling you he
was here yesterday!

214

Oh really? Isn't it convenient
that only you got a portrait
done!

215
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:55,313
You don't have to get
so worked up about it.

216
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:56,680
Yeah, that's right.

217

up and look for him!

222
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:16,853
Uh, yeah, sure.

223
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:22,453
This is ridiculous. We don't
have any idea where to start
looking.

224
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:25,953
How are we ever gonna find him?

225
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:28,120
Our only clue is this
painting...

226
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:31,820
but it's not like he wrote his
address on it, or anything else
helpful.

[sigh] Hey! Stop slacking!

Hold on, what is this?

It's a letter...

231
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:43,020
What?

232
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:46,653
“Dear Miss Usagi, Thank you
for your hospitality...

233
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:51,320
I've passed out from hunger
before, but that was the first
time someone took me to their
home.

234
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,086
<i>& You made me feel welcome, and</i>
<i>cooked a hearty meal for me.</i>
<i>For that I'm eternally grateful.</i>

235
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,353
<i>I was too embarrassed, and too</i>
<i>hungry, to say all of this to</i>
<i>you.</i>

236
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,693
<i>But I'll never forget the taste</i>
<i>of that fried rice for as long</i>
<i>as I live. Thank you."</i>

237
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,293
That's so sweet. I really wish
I could see him again.

238
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:12,660
Me too.

239
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:16,593
I still need to thank him for
the painting, so, what do you
say we keep looking?

00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:17,260
Mhm!

What are you doing all
the way out here?

emanating from this place.

Can I see it, please?

250
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,160
Yeah okay...

251
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:03,333
You know, I gotta say, I'm proud
of it. I think it captures you
well.

252
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,333
Oh my, is that
supposed to be me?

253
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,633
It doesn't look
anything like me.

254
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,033
Huh?

255
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,700
Look at my eyes. They're much
prettier than how you painted
them.

256
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:15,166
You'll have to start all over.

257
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,633
I don't think
there's anything to fix.

258
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,366
What did you say?

259
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:21,833
I cannot paint lies.

260
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,833
It appears you still
don't get it, do you?

261
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:27,033
[gasp]

262
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,666
If painting is your passion, and
you want to do it to your
heart's content, you need a top
class environment.

263
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,300
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

264
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,600
I have the wealth to get you
everything you need&

265
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,633
So, let me ask you
one more time:

266
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,700
My eyes are prettier than
that, aren't they?

267
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:50,133
Sorry, but I didn't
agree to come here&
to paint lies for you.

268
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:54,500
Ah, Then I guess you'll go back
to the life of a starving
artist.

269
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:57,766
Your decision makes no
difference to me.

270
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,173
Whether you realize your life's
dream or throw it away is
entirely up to you...

271
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:04,173
Dream?

272
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:10,006
If your life is filled with
constant hunger and
disappointment& You'll never
succeed as an artist.

273
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,173
[sigh]

274
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:15,040
So! What will it be?

275
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:20,173
I understand. I'll do the
painting the way you want.

276
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:28,706
Luna. I know you suspect
something, but we'll get in hot
water for coming in here without
permission!

277
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:32,173
Which is why I told you I can
handle this alone.

278
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:34,706
I'm just a cat, wandering
around.

283
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,173
I don't feel well. Excuse me, I
think I need a little rest.

284
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:51,206
Hold on, you can't go.

285
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:55,840
See, We're not done here.
There's one more important thing
I still need from you.

Mr. Kamoi!
