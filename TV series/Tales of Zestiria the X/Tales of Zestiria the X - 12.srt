[SOLDIER U screams]

2
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,000
[ROSE]
You bastards.

3
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,458
She's your princess,
and you're going to kill her?

4
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,333
[LANDON]
Stand up, you weaklings!

5
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,666
Get over there and seize her!

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,916
Live.

7
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,375
Now listen up.

8
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,500
I suggest you drop
your weapons,

9
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,666
or your general here
is a dead man.

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,458
Don't think I won't do it.
He's already on my bad side.

11
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,500
Maybe I need to speak louder.

12
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,625
Drop your weapons now!

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,916
[SOLDIER A]
Urgent message! Urgent message!

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,291
Cease fire!

15
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,958
[SYMONNE laughs]

16
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,625
[SYMONNE]
Aww, is it over already?

17
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,666
How unfortunate.

18
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,833
I was so enjoying
all the slaughter,

19
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:46,000
all the destruction,
all the pain.

20
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,583
Well, we can always make more.

21
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,375
[chuckles]

22
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,125
What's going on?

23
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,000
This place is toxic.

24
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,166
Worse than any
we've seen before.

25
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,958
And that malevolence.

26
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,750
There's something
different about it.

27
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,583
Is it possible?

28
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,166
This isn't good.

29
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,291
The malevolence of this
domain is extraordinary.

30
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,208
It could only belong
to a single hellion.

31
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,791
[SOREY] So that's him:
The Lord of Calamity.

32
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,291
[SOREY]
He's... a human hellion.

33
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,208
[MIKLEO]
There's no way!

34
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,833
[SOREY] Except I can't
see the human form.

35
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,000
What does that mean?

36
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,125
Wait for me!

37
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,791
Come, Edna. He needs us.

38
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,458
I'd rather not, but I suppose
we can't just let Sorey die.

39
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,000
[LAILAH]
We must go.

40
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,500
[MIKLEO] Is it even possible
to purify this hellion?

41
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,791
Come on. Let's find out!

42
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:15,833
[MIKLEO]
Hey!

43
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,916
As this world's Shepard,
I'll purify you!

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,750
Lord of Calamity!

45
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,875
The Shepard?

46
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,041
Watch your tongue.

47
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,750
You'll speak to my
lord with respect.

48
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,083
[HELDALF chuckles]

49
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:38,541
You may be worthy.
I'm curious to see if it's so.

50
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,333
[yells]

51
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,833
You hope to purify the
greatest of all hellions?

52
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,791
Insolent brat.

53
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,166
[MIKLEO]
Sorey!

54
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:09,000
I wasn't even aware that another
Shepherd had been chosen.

55
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,041
Are you afraid yet?

56
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:15,708
You soon will be.
Your death awaits you.

57
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,666
[SOREY]
Lailah. Fethmus Mioma!

58
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,291
[HELDALF]
You are blind.

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,625
[gasps]

60
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,333
[HELDALF] Now do you see
what it is you face?

61
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,541
Malevolence made manifest.

62
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:04,958
An endless army of hellions
you cannot hope to slay.

63
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,875
That doesn't mean I won't try.

64
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:08,958
[LAILAH]
Please, stop!

65
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,083
We're not ready to
face him. Not yet!

66
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,125
[HELDALF laughs]

67
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:19,125
Nor will you be. My legion
of hellions, come forth!

68
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,666
[SOREY]
The malevolence.

69
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,875
[MIKLEO]
It's coalescing.

70
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,916
[LAILAH]
I don't understand.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,541
Even with his strength,
this shouldn't be possible.

72
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,500
[HELDALF]
Observe, Shepherd.

73
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,083
To approach me,

74
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:39,083
first you'll have to brave the
malevolence of my dark servants.

75
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,708
Now!

76
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,041
You will fall, Shepard.

77
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,958
This malevolence was born of
mankind. Born of their hate.

78
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,416
[yells]

79
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,708
[HELDALF] Your sacred mission
is to purify humanity,

80
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,041
yet here you are,

81
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,625
assailed by the very ones
you struggle to save.

82
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,916
Sseems terribly unfair.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,916
But I so enjoy the show.

84
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,250
[SOREY]
I'm not giving up.

85
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,125
I swear it.

86
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,708
One day I will
purify this world!

87
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,375
Why make a vow you
cannot hope to keep it?

88
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,125
As humans live,
so shall malevolence.

89
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,833
The two are bound up together.

90
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,166
I will find a way.

91
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,166
I believe that the world
can change, that someday,

92
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,500
humans and Seraphim will
live side by side again.

93
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,416
[SOREY screams]

94
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,250
[MALTRAN]
Alisha!

95
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,833
Hold on!

96
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,125
Please stay with us,
Your Highness!

97
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,958
I can't stop the bleeding.

98
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,500
Where are the damn medics?!

99
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,083
They should be on
their way, Master.

100
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,750
I'll go look for them.

101
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,125
[MALTRAN]
Alisha!

102
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,708
[IAN]
Can you hear us?

103
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,166
I... feel so weak.

104
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,708
The medics will be here soon.

105
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:33,083
[ALISHA] Master...
Has the fighting stopped?

106
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,041
Is the war over?

107
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,125
[MALTRAN] Yes, it's over.
It'll be okay now.

108
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,000
[MALTRAN gasps]

109
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,416
[IAN]
Your Highness!

110
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,250
[ROSE]
Don't die... Don't you die!

111
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:58,791
[ROSE]
Hang in there. I'll bring Sorey.

112
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,208
He's the Shepherd.
Surely he can help.

113
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,750
[ROSE]
Please, Princess, hang in there!

114
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,083
[groaning]

115
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,625
[LUNARRE] Well, look at that,
they're all still alive.

116
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,791
I hope the princess
lives through this too,

117
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,875
or else I'll have to find
something new to toy with.

118
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,458
I don't know the last time I've
seen malevolence like this.

119
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,666
It's too thick even for me.

120
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:03,958
They're still alive? Impossible.

121
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,583
What in the world
happened here?

122
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,500
Bring as many medics
as you can find. Now!

123
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,833
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

124
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:19,208
[SERGEI] The world grows darker
and more uncertain by the day.

125
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,375
To think you believed you could
actually defeat my master.

126
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,041
You aren't even capable of
defeating his servants.

127
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,250
Poor, pathetic Shepherd.

128
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,750
Are you beginning to
understand the dark strength

129
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,708
that lives within all humans?

130
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,958
Their sin is limitless,
and so is my power.

131
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,958
Come, Symonne. We're leaving.

132
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,583
We aren't going to
finish him, my lord?

133
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:52,208
[HELDALF] It is by my grace
that you survive, Shepherd.

134
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,416
I will wait until you shine
as a beacon of hope

135
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,541
then I will crush you.

136
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,083
That is what will create
a terrible despair.

137
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,708
I shall allow them to hope,
and then rip it from them.

138
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,208
You can't do this alone.
Let me help you, Sorey.

139
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,666
We don't have your power.

140
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,500
Seraphim can't purify
human hellions.

141
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,250
Maybe not, but we
can disperse them.

142
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,500
Good timing!

143
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,791
Thanks!

144
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,458
Stay strong!
This fight's not over!

145
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,125
[DEZEL]
Do you know where you're going?

146
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,791
[gasps]

147
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,458
Could you leave me alone?
I'm kinda busy.

148
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,666
[DEZEL]
You should head further south.

149
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,583
You wanna find the Shepherd,
that Sorey guy, right?

150
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,208
I don't need your help.

151
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,500
You want your friend
to die? Fine by me.

152
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,916
It's none of my business.

153
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,541
Which way?

154
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,541
You see that cliff over there?
Follow it to the south.

155
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,625
[ROSE]
Got it!

156
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,750
Can almost taste it.

157
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,875
What's goin' on here?

158
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,875
It's as if all the
malevolence in the world

159
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,958
is gathering in one place.

160
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,041
Disgusting.

161
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,458
[ROSE]
Yes, it is.

162
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,708
[yells]

163
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,708
I think it's finally over.

164
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,958
We did it.

165
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,500
There he is!

166
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,041
[gasps]

167
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,041
[DEZEL] I hope you don't
mind a little assistance.

168
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,833
I can't let you die yet.

169
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,291
There's still too much
I need you to do.

170
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,000
It's Alisha.

171
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,083
[ALISHA]
I've been thinking back.

172
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,666
[ALISHA] The first time we met,
when I woke in the ruins,

173
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,458
I asked you if you
were the Shepherd.

174
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,208
[ALISHA]
Then when we parted ways,

175
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,208
I returned the
Shepherd's glove to you,

176
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,041
thinking you might need it.

177
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,875
[ALISHA] And at the festival,
you drew the sword,

178
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,291
and took on the
Shepherd's mantle.

179
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,958
[ALISHA]
I've done a lot of thinking

180
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,958
about our time together.

181
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,875
[ALISHA] So much has happened
and I remember it all vividly.

182
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,166
[ALISHA]
You told me that your dream

183
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,041
was to see humans and Seraphim
living side by side again.

184
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,416
I think that's when I knew.

185
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,416
That you would be the one.

186
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,375
[ALISHA] We don't know
much about the Shepherds

187
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,250
who came before,

188
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,041
but when I look at you,

189
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,708
I know that you
belong among them.

190
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,250
[ALISHA]
I'm glad it was you.

191
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,708
Thank you.

192
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,333
[SOREY] I'm glad I found
you in those ruins,

193
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,625
and that I followed
you afterwards.

194
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,750
I'm lucky that you were
the first human I ever met.

195
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,833
You might be the reason
I was able to keep believing

196
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,250
in my dream.

197
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:25,041
After this, I plan to
return to Ladylake.

198
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,166
The fighting that happens on
the battlefield is important,

199
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,750
but my role is in the
field of politics.

200
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,041
That's where I can
wield the most power.

201
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,500
Where I can stop wars
before they start.

202
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,750
Where hopefully, I can prevent
more blood from being shed.

203
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,541
[SOREY] Alisha, I want you
to become my Squire.

204
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,458
You do?

205
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,708
[SOREY]
Yeah,

206
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,791
I think it may help you
in your quest for peace.

207
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,541
Sorey, isn't taking a
Squire a burden on you?

208
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,958
Well, I'll just have to
become stronger, then.

209
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,416
Are you sure?

210
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,833
Yes, I can see that you are.

211
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:14,000
So in that case, it would
truly be an honor.

212
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,416
[SOREY]
Now we can always be together.

213
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,000
Lailah, please.

214
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,333
[LAILAH]
Yes.

215
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,625
[LAILAH] Sorey, after I
speak the incantation,

216
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,916
it is your task to give Alisha a
true name in the ancient tongue.

217
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,583
[LAILAH] A new bud forms
on the holy branch,

218
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,916
promising a brighter future.

219
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Its flowers bring fruit.
Its fruit begets seeds.

220
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,500
The circle of destiny
turns once more.

221
00:15:56,291 --> 00:16:00,041
[LAILAH] Thus, give life unto
the will of the Shepherd,

222
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,000
and let it be proof
of their bond.

223
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,583
And now, you shall
receive your true name.

224
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,208
I name you Melphis Amekia.

225
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:30,250
If you're wondering, it
means "The Smiling Alisha."

226
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,291
[ALISHA]
Thank you. I love it.

227
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,625
[laughs]

228
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,458
[SOREY]
Someday soon, right?

229
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:21,125
Yes, we'll meet again.

230
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:25,041
[ROSE] Look at you two, with
the big eyes and clasped hands!

231
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,041
This a private party,
or can I join?

232
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,708
We're just saying goodbye.

233
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,000
[ROSE] You're not gonna see
me for a while, either.

234
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,541
We'll get a goodbye too, right?

235
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,916
Oh. Sure we will.

236
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,583
Well, not if you're
gonna say it like that.

237
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,875
[ALISHA, ROSE laugh]

238
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,916
They sure are chummy.

239
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,500
So joyful in the
throes of youth.

240
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,083
I don't know about that.

241
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,458
[ROSE] Well, Sorey,
do I get a handshake?

242
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,916
[chuckles]

243
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,333
[MIKLEO]
Sorey!

244
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,958
How dare you!

245
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,500
Leading Hyland to victory over
Rolance would've made my career!

246
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,833
I'll make you pay!

247
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,791
Landon? What's happened to you?

248
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,083
I'm going to finish the job
that my men failed to do.

249
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,875
We'll see how well you
serve your kingdom

250
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,875
after I've relieved you of
your pretty little head.

251
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,416
Is he...?

252
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,916
That's right. You're seeing
him for what he truly is.

253
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,500
A hellion.

254
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,666
It's him, the general!
The one who hurt Alisha!

255
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,875
That was you? Coward!

256
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:28,916
[LANDON]
You are nothing more

257
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,333
than an idealistic
fool, Princess.

258
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,166
Hyland will be better
off without you.

259
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,458
Any last words before I kill
you and your pet Shepherd?

260
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,375
No.

261
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,583
[SOREY]
Filthy traitor.

262
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,833
You tried to have her killed.

263
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,958
You must try to calm yourself!

264
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,291
Don't let the anger
control you.

265
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,708
[SOREY]
You disgust me.

266
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,083
People like you are
destroying this world.

267
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,750
You deserve to die.

268
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,958
[LAILAH]
Don't do this!

269
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,458
Stop! Please, no!

270
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,125
[SOREY]
You drown in malevolence!

271
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,666
Stop! This isn't you!

272
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,083
The malevolence
could swallow him!

273
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,125
[yells]

274
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,333
Oh, thank goodness!

275
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,875
Well done, Shepherd.

276
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,250
Sorey.

277
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,666
[ALISHA]
I will take him back to Ladylake

278
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,291
where he will be judged
for his crimes.

279
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,166
I will see that he has a trial

280
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,708
and that he receives
proper justice.

281
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,416
Will that do?

282
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,750
[SOREY]
Yes.

283
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,916
[MIKLEO]
Hey.

284
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,791
You remained yourself.
I'm proud.

285
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,791
[ROSE]
Shepherd Sorey.

286
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,541
You're being awfully formal.

287
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,416
Do you remember that
little favor you owe me?

288
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,083
I'm telling you right now,
that girl's up to no good.

289
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,791
No good at all.

290
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,125
There's something I could
use your help with.

291
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,208
I knew it.

292
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,666
What kind of help?

293
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,208
[ROSE]
No need to get jumpy.

294
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,708
I'm not gonna force you to take
sides in a war or something.

295
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,333
You should tell her no, Sorey.

296
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,833
Immediately.

297
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,000
Thing is, there's this deal
I have to do in Rolance.

298
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,583
I thought you could
accompany me.

299
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,791
The person I'm dealing with
can be a bit difficult.

300
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,000
The way I figure it, having
the Shepherd on my side

301
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,916
might smooth
negotiations a bit.

302
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,041
Is that all?

303
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,041
[ROSE]
That's all.

304
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,916
What do you think?

305
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,083
I guess it's fine.

306
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,666
Yeah, we were going to Rolance
anyway, so why not, right?

307
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,583
We'll leave that
decision entirely up to you.

308
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,083
[SOREY] All right, sounds
like a plan. To Rolance!

309
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,250
Okay! After this, we'll be even.

310
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,583
By the way, is that
guy still around?

311
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,916
Uh, what guy?

312
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,375
You know, the one with the hat.

313
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,083
Ooh. Yeah, he's on
top of the wagon.

314
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,291
[ROSE]
Seriously?

315
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,583
[DEZEL]
Hmph.

316
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:42,583
[ROSE yelps]

317
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,416
Hey!

318
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,000
[chuckles]

319
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,666
I think having him around
