1
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:19,041
[ALISHA] Tell me!
Please, are you a Shepherd?

2
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,791
[gasps]

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,250
[SOREY]
Nope. Just a regular human.

4
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,791
[ALISHA]
Oh, I thought maybe...

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:26,625
Well...

6
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,875
[SOREY]
Sorry.

7
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,750
You're human too, right?

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,041
This is the first time
I've ever seen

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,833
another of our kind up here.

10
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,791
[gasps]

11
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,291
This place--

12
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,125
Do you know if it was once
called the Capital of Seraphim?

13
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,000
I think so.

14
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,500
Well, if that's the case,

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,375
there should be a Shephard here!

16
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,333
[SOREY]
Mm-mm.

17
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,250
There's nobody else.

18
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,166
I did find a mural, though.

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,583
Of the Shephard
raising the holy blade.

20
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,416
[ALISHA]
Nothing but a mural?

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,458
Then I guess it really was
just a fairy tale after all.

22
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,416
The world can't be saved.

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,166
The darkness wins.

24
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,416
Bad idea.

25
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,666
You'll get in trouble
for letting a human in.

26
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,208
She needs help.

27
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,041
What do you expect me to do,
just ignore someone in danger?

28
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,291
Be reasonable.

29
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,208
She won't even
tell you her name.

30
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,125
Don't you think
there's something

31
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,458
a little bit strange about that?

32
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,541
She must have her reasons.

33
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,958
She seems like a
nice enough person.

34
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,791
Thank you for helping me.

35
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,666
Oh, no! Don't worry
about it, really!

36
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,041
I just hope you're ready.

37
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,791
Gramps is not gonna be happy.

38
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,916
Ah...

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,666
[ALISHA]
Is something wrong?

40
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,875
Uh-- No, not at all.

41
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,791
Come on, let's go.

42
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,125
Even when she's
looking right at me,

43
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,750
she doesn't see anything.

44
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,750
It's exactly like
Gramps said, then.

45
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,041
What an incredibly
beautiful place!

46
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,625
Is this truly the
home of the Seraphim?

47
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:42,000
So you really do call
them Seraphim, then?

48
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,041
Why, is there something
wrong with that name?

49
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,750
[SOREY]
Mm-mm.

50
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,916
Gods? Spirits? Monsters?

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,291
What are these shapeless
supernatural beings?

52
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:57,041
Out of reverence and fear,
humans dubbed them the Seraphim.

53
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,583
I read that somewhere.

54
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,250
[ALISHA]
In the <i>Celestial Record</i> !

55
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,708
You've read it, too?

56
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,958
You mean...

57
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,500
You've heard about it?

58
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,083
I have. I've read it many times.

59
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,708
Sorey, if you don't
mind me asking,

60
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,708
where exactly are you taking me?

61
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,791
My village. Elysia.

62
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,458
[ALISHA]
Elysia...

63
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,625
I'm gonna go report to Gramps.

64
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,083
I guess we can't just keep
this between us, can we?

65
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,250
[MIKLEO]
I'll see you later, Sorey.

66
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,625
[SOREY sighs]

67
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:43,833
Huh?

68
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,291
[laughs]

69
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,500
Everyone, let me introduce...

70
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,125
...a new friend.

71
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,625
Seraphim, please!

72
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,250
I can't see you,
but if you are here,

73
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,625
I ask that you heed my words!

74
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,250
As prophesized, the world
has been enshrouded by darkness.

75
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,416
Chaos and disaster reign
throughout the land.

76
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,208
We humans are trying,
but we can't do this alone.

77
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,583
If we're going
to save the world,

78
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,750
we need the help
of your kind as well.

79
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,500
Please give me whatever
aid is in your power.

80
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,208
Without you, the world
will be lost!

81
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,666
I beg you! Please, seraphim!

82
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,208
Please won't you answer me?

83
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,375
Sorey.

84
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,958
Send her back where she belongs.

85
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,250
She'll only bring trouble.

86
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,833
[GRAMPS]
You reckless idiot!

87
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,041
What were you thinking,

88
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,291
bringing a human into
our lands like that?

89
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,708
But, Gramps...

90
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,416
You did promise that
you'd here him out.

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,166
At least a little.

92
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,583
Very well.

93
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,708
Sorey, would you care
to explain to me why

94
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,500
you so egregiously
broke the rules?

95
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,458
[SOREY] I'm sorry. But I
couldn't just leave her.

96
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,666
[GRAMPS sighs]
You know you cannot undo

97
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,875
what has already been done.

98
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,875
However, you must send her back

99
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,541
to the realm below at once,
do you understand me?

100
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,166
For the good of
all who live here,

101
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,041
she cannot be allowed to stay.

102
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:18,250
Humans bring only disaster
to our lands--you know that.

103
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,333
Yeah, but... I'm human, too.

104
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,708
However, you've lived
among us for a long time

105
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,666
and acquired the ability
to see us and speak to us.

106
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,541
That isn't something any
ordinary human can do.

107
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,125
This girl that you've brought
to our village isn't like you.

108
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,625
She doesn't belong here,
and if you just think about it

109
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,916
for a bit, you'll
realize I'm right.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,208
[SOREY]
I don't understand!

111
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,875
If that's how you really
feel, then why did you

112
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,000
give me the <i>Celestial</i>
<i>Record</i> to read?

113
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,833
Sorey...

114
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,500
It talks about a better past.
Things weren't always like this.

115
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,166
Humans and Seraphim used
to live happily together!

116
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,250
Why can't we go back to that?

117
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,541
[GRAMPS]
Because the past is the past.

118
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,750
Still, she believes in Seraphim,
and she asked for help.

119
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,208
[GRAMPS sighs]

120
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:12,500
I'm sorry about my
outburst earlier today.

121
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,500
Talking at thin air

122
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,500
like the Seraphim
actually exist.

123
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,625
You must have
thought I was crazy.

124
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,375
Mm, no.

125
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,458
[SOREY] Tell me about you.
Where do you live?

126
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,500
[ALISHA]
The capital.

127
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,458
Capital?

128
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,833
The capital city of Hyland.
Called Ladylake.

129
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,708
That sounds familiar somehow.

130
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,041
Ah! Of course! The legend
of the sacred blade!

131
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,041
The blade is protected
by the Lady of the Lake,

132
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,208
and whoever pulls it out
becomes the Shepherd!

133
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,500
Yes.

134
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,000
Except the legend's never
actually come true.

135
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,125
No one has pulled
the blade free.

136
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:07,333
[SOREY] What are you doing?
Lurking around out here?

137
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,583
[MIKLEO]
Gramps sent me with a message.

138
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,291
He says there's no knowing when
the human will cause a disaster.

139
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,541
However,

140
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,250
chasing her out could
cause trouble as well.

141
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,875
Human beings are unpredictable
and can be very dangerous

142
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,500
when they're provoked.

143
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,833
Therefore, he says
that she can stay

144
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,458
until she's ready to leave.

145
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,958
Happy now?

146
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:32,125
[SOREY] Ha! Awesome!
Tell Gramps I said thanks.

147
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,291
And you, too. Thanks a lot!

148
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,833
I know why he helped
the girl, Mikleo.

149
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:49,083
Sorey's a kind and honest
boy, with a good heart.

150
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,666
That's what worries me.

151
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,208
Too much kindness
can lead to trouble.

152
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,750
[SOREY]
Steady.

153
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,333
[SOREY]
Got it!

154
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,083
It certainly is pretty here.

155
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,083
Have you lived in this
village for your entire life?

156
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,541
[SOREY]
Mm-hm! That's right.

157
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,458
This place is the only
home I've ever known.

158
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,875
[ALISHA]
Really?

159
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,541
It must be difficult,
living on your own like this.

160
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,416
[gasps]

161
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,416
[SOREY]
What's wrong?

162
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,208

Although I still have
a hard time believing

everything that happened.

193
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,583
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,041
A large number of people died,

anything to help them.

Several of my friends
were among the dead.

the Shepherd will appear
to restore the light.

So that means you're here
hoping to find the Shepherd?

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,583
I am. The legends were the
only hope that I had left.

without knowing who I am
or even asking my name.

cowardly to tell you.

As a knight, that
was shameful of me.

your forgiveness.

there is one more thing
I would like to admit.

00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,541
I believe there are
Seraphim here in Elysia.

Sorey, stand back!

[SOREY]
Gramps?

338
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,958
Be gone.

339
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,791
Leave from here, evil one.

340
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,250
Huh?

341
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,666
[LUNARRE]
Heh. Well,

342
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,458
I've already wasted
enough time here,

343
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,166
and I wouldn't want the
main course to get away.

344
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,833
[SOREY]
Gramps... I'm sorry.

345
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,333
I brought that
human into Elysia,

346
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,000
and then that thing came, too.

347
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,833
This was all my fault.

348
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,000
No, it isn't.

349
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,458
That Hellion is not
your responsibility.

350
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,041
Nor was it hers,
for that matter.

351
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,416
Mikleo is right in this, Sorey.

352
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,750
He is?

353
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,875
[GRAMPS] Keeping the
human out of our lands

354
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,666
might have prevented the
evil one from entering.

355
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,958
But that must not be
our sole consideration.

356
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,083
It is a selfish impulse

357
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,375
to believe that only
our own safety matters.

358
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,208
For good or ill,
peace in this realm

359
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,291
is connected to
the outside world.

360
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,625
We must not allow
ourselves to forget that.

361
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,083
That thing...

362
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,541
I've already wasted
enough time here,

363
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,250
and I wouldn't want the
main course to get away.

364
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,750
[gasps]

365
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,958
What he said about
someone getting away--

366
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:07,083
that must be the reason why
he was here in the first place.

367
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,375
Because he's after Alisha.

368
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,875
[SOREY] They'll probably
be mad at me for leaving

369
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,708
without saying anything...

370
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,958
[SOREY]
I'm sorry, everyone!

371
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,500
Okay!

372
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,291
[MIKLEO]
Going somewhere?

373
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,666
[gasps]

374
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,041
How did you know I was leaving?

375
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,458
Maybe because I'm not an idiot.

376
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,541
Give me some credit.

377
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,916
Why're you here?

378
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,500
Because of what
that Hellion said.

379
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,708
It seems pretty clear that
he's hunting after Alisha.

380
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,666
[SOREY]
So you picked up on that, too.

381
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,458
[MIKLEO]
Of course. Look at this.

382
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,208
What is it?

383
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,416
Gramps sent me
back to the ruins.

384
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,166
He wanted me to look around
for any clues about Alisha.

385
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,958
That's the symbol of
the royal family of Hyland.

386
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:02,125
This Alisha Diphda--
she's no ordinary knight.

387
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,541
Having this should help.

388
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,041
We can use it to
find her in Ladylake.

389
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,166
Something tells me
you hadn't thought--

390
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,166
[SOREY]
You're coming, too?!

391
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,958
I'm so glad I'm gonna
have you with me.

392
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,250
I couldn't let you go
out in the world alone.

393
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,375
It's too dangerous out there
for someone as naive as you.

394
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,750
[SOREY] I bet Gramps is
pretty mad, though, huh?

395
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,833
[MIKLEO]
Actually, he sent a message.

396
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,291
"Walk the path you believe in

397
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,208
and live your life
to the fullest.

398
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,583
Do these things, and I know
you will not go astray."

399
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,791
[gasps, laughs]

400
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,875
[SOREY]
The world's waiting. Lets go!

401
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,291
Wow, the capital,
home of the legendary

402
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,458
Lady of the Lake! Amazing!

403
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:02,666
Look at all the people!

404
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,750
Indeed, it's very impressive.

405
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,666
According to legend,
someone's going to pull out

406
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,458
the Sacred Blade and
become the Shepherd.

407
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,041
I wonder what they'll be like.

408
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,416
Probably a wise man like Gramps.

409
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,291
Someone serious and dignified.

410
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,458
Or, it could be
a girl, like Alisha.

411
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,833
She's pretty amazing.
No one would see that coming.

412
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,500
[MIKLEO]
Hmm. I don't know.

413
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,166
Whoever it is will
have to be strong,

414
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,208
not to mention courageous
if they're gonna be fighting

415
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,291
all those Hellions.

416
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,416
I guess so.

417
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,416
So... I'd say that
rules you out, then.

418
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,333
What do you mean?

419
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,458
It could totally be me!

420
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,208
Not a chance.

421
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,291
That's just mean!

422
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,291
If it is me, how
will you apologize?

423
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,791
Well, let me think...

424
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,541
How 'bout I make you a whole
bunch of vanilla ice cream?

425
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,083
Nope.

426
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,333
It'll take a lot more than that
to forget your cruel insult.

427
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,541
Fine, then what do you want?

428
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,958
You have to deliver
all the Previews

429
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,000
with a funny face.

430
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,000
Huh?

431
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,916
Next time:
"Mikleo's Funny Face."

432
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,916
Look forward to it!

433
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,791
No! That's not the title!
