1
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,083
[SOREY]
So how do you feel?

2
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,916
Do you think this
is going to work?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,041
Well having been tainted before,

4
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,666
I am nervous, but I will try.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,750
I promise I'll do my best
to protect Marlind.

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,291
If this young pup of a Shepherd

7
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,500
is trying to save the whole
world, it's the least I can do.

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,083
Think of it this way,

9
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,583
because you have
felt malevolence,

10
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,666
you know your own limits and
can guard against peril.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,541
Or maybe you'll just make the
same mistakes all over again.

12
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,833
Hey.

13
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,041
And besides, with
a Normin on my side,

14
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,583
I can't possibly fail.

15
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,041
[ATAKK sighs]

16
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,500
Golly! It sounds like you're
really counting on me.

17
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,500
Guess I'll have to stay.

18
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,416
[EDNA] What happens
once can happen again.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,958
Calamity is never very far away.

20
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,708
[MIKLEO]
Seriously? You're not helping!

21
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,875
[EDNA]
Just keeping him on his toes.

22
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,250
[horse whinies]

23
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,125
If you're ready, Sorey,

24
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,583
let's go.

25
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,041
[ALISHA] We're heading
for Glaivend Basin,

26
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,666
which is on the border
between Hyland and Rolance.

27
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,625
The army that Chancellor
Bartlow mobilized

28
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,125
must be using that area as
their base of operations

29
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,875
for the coming
invasion of Rolance.

30
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,500
It's possible they have mustered
as many as 21,000 soldiers,

31
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,333
and we can't expect Rolance's
army to be sitting idly by.

32
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,000
We must use the 1,200 men
we brought from Marlind

33
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,250
to come between them
and stop this war.

34
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,958
[MALTRAN] Let's not forget
that this is Bartlow

35
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,333
we're talking about.

36
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,291
He won't have sent
the whole army.

37
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,916
He'll be using at least
some of the troops

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,416
to guard the road to Ladylake.

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,833
You're probably right.

40
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,791
So there will be fewer
Hyland soldiers.

41
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:28,375
Let's assume it'll
be around 18,000.

42
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,291
Bartlow doesn't skimp when
it comes to protecting

43
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,875
his own hide, but even so,

44
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,333
you're still going to be
outnumbered 15-to-1.

45
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,541
I understand that, Master.

46
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,125
So it's a good thing that
I'm not riding to war.

47
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,250
Always the optimist, aren't you?

48
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,416
Believe what you will,
but the fact remains,

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,041
we may be fighting our
own before this is done.

50
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,708
No, they will understand.

51
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,625
I have faith in my people.

52
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,833
[IAN]
Your Highness!

53
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,083
Hello, Ian.

54
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,500
Hi. It's good to
see you, Highness.

55
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,416
Doing well?

56
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,583
Yeah, thanks.
How about you?

57
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,458
You look more like a girl than
the last time I saw you.

58
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,041
That was ten days ago.

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,166
[chuckle]

60
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,250
Be careful, Ian.

61
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,458
If your chest gets any bigger,

62
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,250
you won't be able to
fit in your armor.

63
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,916
You know,

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,041
I think I can actually feel it
getting tighter right now!

65
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,166
I was just joking.

66
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,541
Sure you were.

67
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,375
How long have you two
been friends, again?

68
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,583
Forever. We're like sisters.

69
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,541
We actually fell for
the same boy once.

70
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,000
His name was Robert,

71
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,833
and he was the second son of
the lord of a nearby town.

72
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,041
He had a very handsome face.
He was so sweet and thoughtful.

73
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,000
Ian.

74
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,583
Yes?

75
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,500
I don't know if now is really
the best time for this story.

76
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,041
Of course! I'm sorry!

77
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,250
I'm so glad recent events

78
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,791
haven't changed you,
Your Highness.

79
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,166
You're just as I remember:

80
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,916
As beautiful as a flower
and as noble as a stallion!

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,458
[ALISHA laughs]

82
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,291
I'm glad to see that you haven't
changed at all either, Ian!

83
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,833
Thank you, Highness.

84
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,791
By the way, I killed a
prickleboar on the way here.

85
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,333
It should make a nice
change from road rations.

86
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,958
Prickleboar? That's impressive.

87
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,000
You took it down in
one shot, I'm sure.

88
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,791
Of course I did!

89
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,375
Is that who I think it is?

90
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,083
The Shepherd.

91
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,875
[IAN]
Lord Shepherd!

92
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,791
It's a real honor.

93
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,333
Uh, is something wrong?

94
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,125
No, you just look different
than I expected from the rumors.

95
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,666
Rumors?

96
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,083
[IAN] They're saying
you slew the dragon

97
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,291
that appeared in Ladylake
with a single blow,

98
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,500
then roasted it and ate
it whole, bones and all!

99
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,666
[SOREY]
Uh.

100
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,916
[chuckles nervously]

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,583
I didn't know you were
a dragon-eater, Sorey.

102
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,750
Anyway, I was expecting you

103
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,166
to look a little on
the rougher side.

104
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,375
Lord Shepherd, if you don't
mind, can I touch your hand?

105
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,208
Okay, I guess.

106
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,791
Ahh!

107
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,166
I've been blessed!

108
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,625
I can feel the good fortune
coursing through me!

109
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,000
Lord Shepherd, I vow I will
never wash this hand!

110
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,208
My, she is an energetic one.

111
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,541
Why does that rider believe

112
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,250
that the Shepherd is some
kind of good luck charm?

113
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,958
[chuckles nervously]

114
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,333
[ALISHA] I'm glad that
you've returned safely, Ian.

115
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,875
Will you give us your
report now, please?

116
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,125
Yes.

117
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,958
As requested, I scouted
the force leaving Hyland

118
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,625
to determine their number.

119
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,708
And?

120
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,041
The chancellor is a coward.

121
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,750
He'd never risk leaving
himself unprotected.

122
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,208
I knew he wouldn't.

123
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,833
He sent 20,000.

124
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,041
What's wrong, Your Highness?

125
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,333
[ALISHA]
I was expecting 18,000.

126
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,875
If Bartlow is leaving only
a skeleton force behind,

127
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:32,250
I may have underestimated
his commitment to this war.

128
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,291
[AIGUILLE] Leader,
are you certain about this?

129
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,541
Should the Scattered Bones
truly be getting involved

130
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,958
in this conflict?

131
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,416
I made a promise.

132
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,125
I can't go back on my word.

133
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,333
Nothing to do now
but see it through.

134
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,708
Besides, this princess
has piqued my curiosity.

135
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,833
What's so fascinating about her?

136
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,583
Well, she wants to
prevent this war

137
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,041
and she's willing to
risk her life to do it.

138
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,541
Now I understand.
A noble sentiment, yes,

139
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,958
but a rather reckless
one, as well.

140
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,166
Sounds like a fool to me.

141
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,541
[ROSE]
She may well be one.

142
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,250
[LANDON] This mist offers
us the perfect chance

143
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,958
to conceal our troops.

144
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,875
A clear sign that the heavens
themselves want us to prevail.

145
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,416
Bartlow will be greatly pleased
with our victory.

146
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,208
When the second wave
of troops arrives,

147
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,583
we will launch a surprise
assault on Rolance.

148
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,875
If we strike quickly enough,

149
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,166
the fools won't even
see us coming.

150
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,000
[SOREY]
Alisha.

151
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,041
Where you off to?

152
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,500
Just getting some water.

153
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,541
[SOREY]
Ha. In the middle of the night?

154
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,708
I couldn't fall asleep.

155
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,250
Me either.

156
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,583
We're not far from
Glaivend Basin now.

157
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,166
Pretty soon I'll get my first
look at a battlefield.

158
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,708
Yes.

159
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,541
[SOREY] People killing each
other right out in the open...

160
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,083
I have a hard time imagining it.

161
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,791
I know what you mean.

162
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,958
I have seen battles before,
but they were much smaller.

163
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,958
Nothing anywhere
close to this scale.

164
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,750
I hope we get there in time.

165
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,500
If we arrive before
the war begins,

166
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,375
I'll do my best to help
you prevent it.

167
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,958
But, well, if it's
already started...

168
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,958
I'm sorry for putting
you in this position.

169
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,375
You're so kind.
Always looking out for me.

170
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,750
I'm always happy to help you.

171
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,541
Still, I have to remain neutral.

172
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,291
If there is war, I can't
side with Hyland.

173
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,375
Of course, I can't side
with Rolance, either.

174
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,500
As the Shepherd,
you can't choose sides.

175
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,375
I respect your role.

176
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,500
If the war hasn't started,

177
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,333
I'll prevent it somehow.

178
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,375
And if it has begun, I'll
find a way of stopping it.

179
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:56,250
That's my duty. I just wanted
you to know before we arrived.

180
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you.

181
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,458
I understand completely.

182
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,375
[MIKLEO]
Hey, Sorey.

183
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,250
[SOREY]
Hm?

184
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,541
[MIKLEO]
I was thinking.

185
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,250
We're about to get involved
in a war somewhere

186
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,833
we didn't know existed
a few months ago.

187
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,125
[SOREY] You mean, we're about
to go and stop a war.

188
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,041
[MIKLEO]
Of course. That's what I meant.

189
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,583
Stopping the war.

190
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,416
My point is, this
feels so unreal.

191
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,000
It wasn't long ago that we were
exploring ruins in Elysium.

192
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,750
[SOREY]
I'm surprised.

193
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,666
I mean, you're not
usually so sentimental.

194
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,416
[MIKLEO] After everything
that's happened,

195
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,458
don't you feel sentimental, too?

196
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,500
[SOREY]
Kinda.

197
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,666
[MIKLEO]
I thought so.

198
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,500
How do you think
Gramps is doing?

199
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,625
Gramps is always doing fine.

200
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,333
You're right. Stupid question.

201
00:09:56,416 --> 00:10:00,208
[BOTH chuckle]

202
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,041
[MIKLEO]
You know what?

203
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,916
Once we've stopped the
war and this is all over...

204
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,625
...let's find some
ruins to explore.

205
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,375
[SOREY]
That sounds perfect!

206
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,666
Even the Shepherd deserves
a break sometimes, right?

207
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,625
Yeah, absolutely!

208
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,791
It's a promise.

209
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,000
Promise.

210
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,291
[LAILAH] I'm worried
about what's to come.

211
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,583
Sorey is about to be tested,
and it will not be easy.

212
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,416
But as the Shepherd, it's
a challenge he must face.

213
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,083
[EDNA]
Are you sure about this?

214
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,375
I thought you said it
was too soon for him.

215
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,625
[LAILAH] I was hoping he
would be more experienced.

216
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:44,958
Actually, I was hoping we
might avoid war altogether,

217
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,166
but that seems impossible now.

218
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,000
[EDNA] The humans go out of
their way to start these things.

219
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,500
I don't understand it.

220
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,708
I mean, really,
how stupid are they?

221
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,833
[SOLDIERS yelling]

222
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,041
[MESSENGER A]
General Landon!

223
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,958
Rolance has attacked
from our rear!

224
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,208
It's an ambush!
What should we do?

225
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,916
[LANDON]
An attack from behind?

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's our territory!

227
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,916
[SERGEI] What were you thinking
crossing the border?

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,041
It's a violation of the treaty!

229
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,375
I don't see the
problem, Lord Sergei.

230
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,916
After all, what matters
most in war is who wins.

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,375
But victory ought to be
achieved with honor.

232
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,916
Instead, we will be the villains
when this tale is told.

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,291
No, I doubt that.
We just have to win.

234
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,291
Then we can sit back and let the
politicians work their magic.

235
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,791
At any rate,
the feint is working.

236
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,083
We should mobilize
our main forces.

237
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,708
Where you going? Come back.

238
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,958
[SERGEI]
My men will not fight.

239
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,291
We didn't make it here in time.

240
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,000
I can feel the malevolence
all the way out here.

241
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,583
It will do no good
if we try to ride

242
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,666
between the armies
at this point.

243
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,250
All we'll do is get
ourselves killed.

244
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,958
What now, Alisha?

245
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,166
I'll have to speak
to General Landon,

246
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,041
ask him to stand down.

247
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,041
What if he doesn't
listen to you?

248
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll give him no choice.

249
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,166
Sorey.

250
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,458
I'll leave you to it. Good luck.

251
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,958
[SOREY]
I'll do the best I can, Alisha.

252
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:19,000
[SOLDIERS yelling]

253
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,541
[LIEUTENANT A]
Push through!

254
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,458
[MIKLEO]
This malevolence!

255
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:52,125
The hatred, the anger, the pain,

256
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,416
many hellions are born
in the carnage of war.

257
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,958
Let's end this. Come on.

258
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,958
Look out!

259
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,166
What are Rolance troops
doing across the border?

260
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,250
Alisha, you go around the side.

261
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,708
Yeah, we'll hold them here.

262
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,333
[ALISHA]
I can't leave.

263
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,666
Yes, you can.

264
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,666
Peace was your dream.
Now go make it a reality.

265
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,833
Right!

266
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,291
Rose, are you coming with me?

267
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,083
What did I tell you?
Yes, I'm in.

268
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,416
[ALISHA] I am Alisha Diphda.
Let me through!

269
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,291
General Landon!

270
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,541
I demand to speak
with General Landon.

271
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:25,000
[SOLDIER E] We're in the middle
of a battle! Can't this wait?

272
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,333
[LANDON]
Princess Alisha, here?

273
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,916
Don't be stupid.

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,916
What would a little girl like
her be doing on the front lines?

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,291
Looking for you, General.

276
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:38,125
[LANDON] Oh, Princess Alisha!
Hello. Welcome to our camp.

277
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,708
To what do we owe this honor?

278
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,250
[ALISHA] You will send an envoy
to the Rolance camp immediately

279
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,458
and petition for a truce.

280
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,166
That is a direct order.

281
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,750
[LANDON]
An order? Is that so?

282
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,791
Regrettably, I cannot obey.

283
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,125
What?

284
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,750
Seize the princess.

285
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,791
[ALISHA] You have no
right to detain me!

286
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,333
[LANDON]
Matter of fact, I do.

287
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,333
Lord Bartlow has given
me full authority

288
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,500
in matters regarding this war.

289
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,041
If she doesn't come willingly,
feel free to use force,

290
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,583
but try not to
injure her too badly.

291
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,416
Well, Highness. What's the plan?

292
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,291
[MIKLEO]
Sorey!

293
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,666
[LAILAH]
Are you all right?

294
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,833
All this malevolence.
This hate. Stop this.

295
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,083
[MIKLEO]Can you keep going?

296
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,250
Yeah!

297
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,750
Forgive me.

298
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,541
[LANDON]
What are you fools waiting for?

299
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,125
Don't just stand there,
capture her!

300
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,208
[ROSE]
You are her soldiers.

301
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,958
Would you assault
your own princess?

302
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:15,000
[LANDON] This has nothing to
do with you. Go now or die.

303
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,541
[SOREY, LAILAH]
Ready, Calamity Flare!

304
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,625
[SOLDIER E] We have friendlies
in the area of effect!

305
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,958
[LEADER A]
I don't care. Fire!

306
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,250
I can't believe all
of you together

307
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,333
can't take down two girls!

308
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,791
It's time for lethal force.
These guys are serious.

309
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:38,916
[ALISHA]
No, Rose!

310
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,958
[ROSE]
Why not?

311
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,291
I get that they're
your soldiers,

312
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,791
but your life is in danger.

313
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,250
This is a matter of
self-defense now.

314
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,458
If we don't kill them,
they'll kill us.

315
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,875
No, we can't do it.
We just can't.

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,791
Take them down!

00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,416
[ROSE] This has gone too far.
It's time to fight for real.

318
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,166
What? No!

319
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,416
Move!

320
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,666
We cannot destroy ourselves!

321
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,625
I won't let it happen.

322
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,291
You're a stubborn
little fool, Princess.

[ROSE]
Alisha!

325
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,500
[SOREY]
Almost finished.

326
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:48,583
Let's go, Mikleo! Luzrov Rulay!

327
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,250
[SOREY, MIKLEO]
Arrow Squall!

328
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,125
[MIKLEO]
Sorey! We did it! We did it!

329
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,291
[MIKLEO]
We purified them all!

330
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,791
It's over now.

331
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,708
Can you believe it?
We stopped the war!

332
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,416
[SOREY]
It can't be.

333
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,833
[MIKLEO]
Hey, wait!

334
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:45,708
[yelling]

335
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,333
No.

336
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,375
Good work, soldier!

337
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,750
[ROSE]
How could you?

338
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,833
Do you understand
what you've done?

339
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,375
I'll be okay.
It's not that bad.

340
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,875
Save your breath.

341
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,875
Soldier. You should
clean that blade.

342
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,125
You don't want it to rust.

343
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,375
[SOLDIER U screams]

344
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,916
[ROSE]
You bastards.

345
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,625
She's your princess, and
you're going to kill her?

346
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,833
[yells]

347
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,958
[ROSE]
Again?

348
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,208
What's happening to me?
I don't understand!

349
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,208
I've felt this before.

350
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,291
[gasps]

351
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,791
[ALISHA]
Seraphim!

352
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,375
What is that?

353
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,291
This place is toxic.

354
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,416
Worse than any
we've seen before.

355
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,208
And that malevolence.

356
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,958
There's something
different about it.

357
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,333
Is it possible?

358
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,000
[SOREY]
That's... a human hellion.

359
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,875
[MIKLEO]
There's no way.

360
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,125
[SOREY] Except, I can't
see the human form.

361
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,791
What does that mean?

362
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:22,041
[SOREY] So that's him:
The Lord of Calamity.

363
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,125
You know, Luzrov Rulay is
very difficult to pronounce.


364
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,208
Why don't you shorten
it to Zroe, instead?


365
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,666
Not happening.


366
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,125
Honestly, I almost bite
my tongue when I say it.


367
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,666
Sorey!


368
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,875
Imagine real quick we're in
the middle of an epic battle.


369
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,375
"Mikleo, let's armatize!


370
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,666
Luzrov Rure-- Ow!
I bit my tongue!"


371
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,458
Do you realize how completely
ridiculous I'd look?


372
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:20,625
Or maybe you could try adding
some syllables in, Rulalalay!


373
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,583
I totally love it!
What do you say, Mikleo?


374
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,583
No chance!


375
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,125
I know, how 'bout Shiv?


376
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:28,708
Shiv and Zroe? Those aren't even
anything like the original.


377
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:29,958
They're new names.


378
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,250
That's our time. Bye now!
See you all later!


379
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,583
Stop shortening things already!


380
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,208
Next time. "Lord of Calamity."


381
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,583
Why are you alll only
picking on my name anyhow?


382
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,708
It's our way of showing
how much we love you.


383
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:42,541
Sorey.


384
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,791
Rulalalay!


385
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,500
I knew it, you are
making fun of me!


386
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,958
[ALL]
Rulalalay!


387
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,416
Cut it out!
