1
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,833
Can you hear me?

2
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,000
Sorey.

3
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,541
Alisha?

4
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,291
[ALISHA]
Can you hear my voice?

5
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,541
[SOREY]
Yes. I hear you.

6
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,500
Ladylake is in trouble,
and I can't handle it alone.

7
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,458
I need your help, Sorey.

8
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,166
Can you come immediately?

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,750
It's bad. There's
another tornado!

10
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,375
[SOREY]
A tornado? Alisha?

11
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:49,833
Sorey?

12
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,166
Lost him.

13
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,541
[ALISHA] Are there any houses
in the tornado's path?

14
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,416
[SHILLER] There are a few
in and around Sithole.

15
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,916
[ALISHA]
They'll be destroyed!

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,208
Princess!

17
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,166
We may be in luck.

18
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,875
It's dissipating.

19
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,916
What? It's just gone?

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,166
But how?

21
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,333
[SHILLER]
That was the third one so far.

22
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,458
We're lucky they haven't
caused much damage yet,

23
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,666
but each one seems to be
getting stronger than the last.

24
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,208
You're right, and
they're not showing

25
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,916
any sign of stopping.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,166
If an even stronger one
reaches the city...

27
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,625
Our priority is now Sithole.

28
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,958
We need to evacuate
the whole area.

29
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,000
[SHILLER] But, Princess,
is that a good idea?

30
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,833
[ALISHA]
What do you mean?

31
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,625
[SHILLER] Bartlow will likely
anticipate that move

32
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,458
and send men there
to intercept you.

33
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,375
You may be playing
right into his hands.

34
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,916
[ALISHA]
Honestly, I don't care.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,750
Bartlow can do
whatever he wants.

36
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,875
But those are my people,
and I'm going to help them.

37
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,916
Right.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,375
[IAN laughs] That sounds like
the princess we know and love!

39
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,375
No matter what happens, you
always stay true to yourself.

40
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,916
After you.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,958
You lead and we'll
follow, Princess.

42
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,375
Thank you.

43
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,083
[KING] Have you been able to
get in touch with Alisha yet?

44
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,708
[BARTLOW]
No, sir.

45
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,541
We've made many attempts
to communicate with her

46
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,625
but haven't succeeded.

47
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,333
We implored her to see reason,
to return to her rightful place

48
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,666
and serve Hyland, but so far,
she has ignored our pleas.

49
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,166
[BARTLOW]
I regret to tell you this,

50
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,666
but the most recent message
I sent was met with violence.

51
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,666
The princess and her
people took up swords

52
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,750
against my messengers.

53
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,291
After the battle, she
gathered her force and fled.

54
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,791
I have men out
searching for her,

55
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,750
but she has yet to be found.

56
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,000
That is hard to hear.

57
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,041
[KING]
Whatever she may have done,

58
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,083
I want you to try to
bring her back alive.

59
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,916
I am an old man, and not
as strong as I once was.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,791
I would like to see
her one last time.

61
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,583
[BARTLOW]
I understand.

62
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,291
I will let my men know

63
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,875
that she is to be brought
in alive, if possible.

64
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,083
I was already very old
when Alisha was born.

65
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,458
Her mother was a commoner,
but I loved her.

66
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,250
I made her one of my wives
and did what I could but,

67
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,500
ultimately, I wasn't able
to give her the life

68
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,625
or the attention she deserved.

69
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:16,125
[coughs, wheezes]

70
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,791
Quickly! Bring the physician.

71
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,083
The king needs his medicine!

72
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,666
Good evening.

73
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,583
Has your stay helped here
you to see the error

74
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,666
of your rebellious ways or
will you remain intractable?

75
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,333
Admit to your crimes
and repent them.

76
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,625
Do that, and I may be able
to lighten your punishment.

77
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,375
[BARTLOW] You still have
nothing to say to me?

78
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,375
We'll see how long you can
remain silent and stoic.

79
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,291
Princess Alisha and
her band of traitors

80
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,458
are still hiding in the
outskirts of Ladylake,

81
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,416
but not for much longer.

82
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,750
We'll capture her soon enough,
and this will all be over.

83
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,750
[BARTLOW] Without her master
there to guide her,

84
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:25,500
I doubt she'll put up
much of a fight.

85
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,416
That's where you're
wrong, old man.

86
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,000
Alisha and her soldiers are
brave, with or without me.

87
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,750
If you think they'll surrender
to you, you're a fool.

88
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,708
That could be problematic.

89
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,875
I can't promise her
safety if she resists.

90
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:45,125
In fact, the princess may
not survive the skurmish.

91
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,458
The king has accepted

92
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,958
the tragic truth
of his daughter.

93
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,916
He has left her punishment
entirely in my hands.

94
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,458
[BARTLOW]
If she behaves herself,

95
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,625
perhaps she'll be joining
you down here in that cell,

96
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,208
but I wouldn't
get your hopes up.

97
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,708
[MALTRAN]
Fight, Alisha.

98
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,666
[ALISHA]
Here, I brought you some water.

99
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,458
Try to rest.

100
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,000
[GIRL 20A]
Thanks.

101
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,541
[SHILLER]
I finished scouting.

102
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,625
No sign of any further damage
on toward the mountains.

103
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,166
Excellent. Thank you
for checking.

104
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,666
If you're not too tired,

105
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,125
can you please help
with the injured?

106
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,750
Absolutely.

107
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,291
[gasps]

108
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,333
[BARTLOW SOLDIER 20A]
There she is!

109
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,875
That's the princess!

110
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,666
Well, that didn't take long.

111
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,875
We don't wish to
fight our countrymen,

112
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,791
but we will if you
give us no choice.

113
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,583
We survived Glaivend Basin.

114
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,208
We won't fall to you.

115
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,916
Consider that a warning!

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,250
[BARTLOW SOLDIER 20A]
You don't frighten us.

117
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,416
Charge!

You traitors!

00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,500
This is how you
serve the kingdom?

121
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,458
By attacking your own princess?

122
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,333
And you call yourselves
knights of Hyland.

123
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,375
[ALISHA]
I don't want any of them killed.

[SHILLER, IAN]
Got it!

you can see my kind?

Yes.

149
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,625
I've been able to since
becoming Sorey's Squire.

[ZAVEID]
That's you, huh?

00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,500
Well.

152
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,250
You seem like a good fit
for our soft Shepherd.

153
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,833
Are you a friend
of Sorey's as well?

154
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,000
I wouldn't go that far.

155
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,416
I heard a dragon had shown up,

156
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,291
so I figured I'd
come check it out.

would see Ladylake

doing to this world?

Oh, well, if worse

a very special object

It's the only weapon

[ALISHA] It seems like the

191

The heavens are retaliating,

humans for our sins.

193
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,625
Not only have we
refused to give up war,

194
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:47,083
we've begun fighting
our own countrymen.

195
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,541
If only we could find a way
to end this civil war.

Maybe that would put
a stop to these tornadoes.

197

But, even if I believe that,

I don't know how to say this.

It's about Lady Maltran.

214
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,958
She's in the fountain
plaza in Ladylake.

215
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,500
They've crucified her!

216

You can't be serious!

217
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,833
They've strung her up
in front of everyone,

218
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,458
and she's to be kept there like
that till you turn yourself in.

219
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,291
Bartlow's behind this.

220
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,333
I'm so sorry, Master.

221
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,125
We have to think this
through carefully.

222
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,291
Lady Maltran's
crucifixion is a trap.

223
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,875
That's obvious.

224
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,541
Our first instinct is
to ride to her rescue,

225
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,833
but that just gives
them what they want.

226
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,541
What do you suggest we do, then?

227
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,208
How long will she last
if we abandon her?

228
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,750
We just need a plan.

229
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,083
I'd say we have three days, max.

230
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,041
Beyond that, she won't survive.

00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,083
But, you know they
won't let her go easily.

232
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,333
If we want to save her, we'll
have to face Bartlow's troops.

00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,791
We'll be fighting our own again.

What I don't know is
what to do about it.

at Glaivend Basin,

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,875
Ready?

320
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,625
[SOREY]
We're coming!

321
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,291
Has there been any sign
of Princess Alisha yet?

322
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,041
[BARTLOW SOLDIER 20A]
No, sir, I'm sorry.

323
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,208
It won't be long.

324
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,125
When she hears how I've
tormented her beloved master,

325
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,833
she'll come running
to the rescue.

326
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:17,625
[LUNARRE cackles]

327
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,541
How fun.

328
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,041
[cackles]

329
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,708
Yes. Fun!

330
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,000
[IAN]
Take my hand.

331
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,583
I've got it, thanks.

332
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,291
We have until sunrise
to execute our plan.

333
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,541
If everything goes
the way it should,

334
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,666
Ladylake will be ours again.

335
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,250
We'll do this without
killing anyone.

336
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,750
Understood?

337
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,375
I really appreciate
the help earlier.


338
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,166
How can I pay you back?


339
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,166
It's no problem.
Don't worry about it.


340
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,458
I didn't see anyone with you.


341
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,833
Do you always travel alone
like this, Zaveid?


342
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,708
Yeah. I go where
the wind takes me.


343
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:21,916
I'm bound by nobody.


344
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,041
I live as I please
and journey freely.


345
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,708
Traveling alone is my style.


346
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:26,875
I'm sorry.


347
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,708
That must be extremely
difficult for you.


348
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:29,791
I don't think you get it.


349
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,125
I enjoy being on my own.


350
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,458
It's okay, you don't
have to hide from me.


351
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,875
Really, I can tell
just by looking at you.


352
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:36,541
Huh?


353
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,583
What can you tell?


354
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,333
Just that... you've
had a hard time.


355
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,750
Bad enough to travel alone


356
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,750
and then to have somebody
steal all your clothes?


357
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,958
Wait a sec! No one robbed me.


358
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:46,833
This is how I dress!


359
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,333
Please just give me a moment.


360
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,791
I will go and find
a shirt for you to wear.


361
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,875
Alisha! Get back here!


362
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,333
Sorry, I forgot.


363
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:58,333
Next time: "Purification."
Look forward to it!


364
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,416
No, hold on. That's
not what I meant.


365
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,666
This is a fashion
statement, okay?


366
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,541
I don't need a shirt!
