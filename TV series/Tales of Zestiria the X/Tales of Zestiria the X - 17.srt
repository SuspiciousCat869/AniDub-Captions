[yells]

3
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,583
Die!

4
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:29,375
[panting, grunting]

5
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:13,000
[grunting]

6
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,083
[SOREY]
Something's off.

7
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,166
He's become a hellion!

8
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,250
[yelling]

9
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,041
[grunts]

10
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:49,958
[SOREY]
Rose!

11
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,916
You need to get away from him!

12
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,958
[yells]

13
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,208
This is the end for you.

14
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,208
Whatever it costs,
you die tonight.

15
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,208
Rose, please!

16
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,875
You okay?

17
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,041
Where is he?

18
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,708
Gone. Probably dead.

19
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,958
[ROSE]
Then where's his body?

20
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,125
[SOREY]
In the lake somewhere.

21
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,833
[ROSE]
I have to go.

22
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,500
[SOREY] Rose, what are
you talking about?

23
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,791
I need to find him.

24
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,083
There's no way he survived that.

25
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,500
I need to see for myself.

26
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,208
[LAILAH]
Rose, you don't understand.

27
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,291
Becoming a hellion doesn't
make a somebody immortal.

28
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,833
The body can still die.

29
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,875
There is a numbness
that takes hold of them,

30
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,833
so they may not feel pain
the way other people do,

31
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,875
but their bodies
can still be wounded.

32
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,916
And I assure you,
his wounds were fatal.

33
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,750
[ROSE]
After all this time...

34
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,333
I was so close to
finally getting closure.

35
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,125
That's all this is? Closure?

36
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,666
Somebody like you
shouldn't be an assassin.

37
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,958
I don't like it.

38
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,458
You don't like it?
What's it to you?

39
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,041
If you don't like what
I am, leave me alone.

40
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,875
I can't leave you alone
after all that's happened.

41
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,916
[ROSE]
What do you want from me?

42
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,250
A promise I'll change
my evil ways?

43
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,208
What would be the point of that?

44
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,666
Do you know how many lives
I've already taken?

45
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,541
It's no small number.

46
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,125
I'm sure it's not.

47
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,250
Do you do this because you think
it's right to take a life?

48
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,916
[ROSE]
What?

49
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,583
Answer me, Rose.

50
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:33,416
[ROSE] Whether it's right
or not, somebody has to do it.

51
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,291
The world isn't a nice place.

52
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,958
It's full of people
who need killing.

53
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,125
That may be ugly, but it's true.

54
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,958
[pants]

55
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,125
I'm sorry, I should've noticed.

56
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,666
Let me find something
to keep you warm.

57
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,375
[pants]

58
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,500
[SOREY]
Here, take this.

59
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,750
You don't wanna catch cold.

60
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,875
All the disasters
across the world,

61
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,333
the chaos we face.
It's because humans have

62
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,333
turned their backs on Seraphim,

63
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,791
losing faith and
embracing violence.

64
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,166
At least, that's
what Gramps told me.

65
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,666
[ROSE]
Hmph. Yeah, sure, whatever.

66
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,750
I didn't believe him when
he first said it, either.

67
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,000
How could something like
this never-ending rain

68
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,583
be caused by what people feel?

69
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,750
It was unimaginable.

70
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,708
But I believe it now.

71
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,500
[SOREY]
Hard as it is to accept,

72
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,958
just because you
can't see something

73
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:45,416
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
Surely you realize that?

74
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,041
You can't see Dezel's face,
but you can hear his voice.

75
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,333
Malevolence can seep into
anything, infecting it.

76
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:58,208
The earth, the water, the sky,
all forms of life. Us, too.

77
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,625
People and Seraphim
are no exception.

78
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,083
Like in Marlind,

79
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,083
the Seraph that was supposed
to protect the city

80
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,000
became the drake that
nearly destroyed it.

81
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,541
Well, I must be a giant
mess of malevolence then.

82
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,416
But you aren't, though.

83
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,791
I don't need you to comfort me.

84
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,375
I'm not just saying that.

85
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,833
You are far from
a hellion, Rose.

86
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:34,166
[SOREY] The thing is,
there's malevolence in everyone.

87
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,958
The amount may vary,
but all of us carry it.

88
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,250
Good and bad alike.

89
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,666
It took a while, but I can
finally see the truth.

90
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,291
So, enlighten me.

91
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:51,041
Our negative emotions,
like jealousy and hate--

92
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,458
they're dangerous, and they
can create malevolence.

93
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,750
But we can't
deny their existence.

94
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,333
That would be
denying our humanity.

95
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,208
Most people,
they live their lives

96
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,875
trying to hide
their inner darkness.

97
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,416
But you're different because
you face your darkness head-on.

98
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,708
You believe all you're
doing helps people.

99
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,916
So you fight.
It's all you can do.

100
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,541
It's never easy.

101
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,416
Where are we?
I lost track hours ago.

102
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,916
[LAILAH] The storm makes
everything out here

103
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
look the same. All one,
big, dreary landscape.

104
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,416
[EDNA]
And the weather is depressing.

105
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,750
The rain seems to be
getting stronger

106
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,833
the farther we travel.

107
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,166
I guess that means we're
getting closer to Pendrago?

108
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,541
Yeah, we're not far away.

109
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,166
Won't be much longer.

110
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,541
How do you know that?

111
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,958
[DEZEL]
Hmph.

112
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,666
Talk to us, Dezel.
Who is Rose to you?

113
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,125
What is it that you
actually want from her?

114
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,375
I can see it.

115
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,958
How she's completely
opened up to you

116
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,791
and become your vessel.

117
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,416
So, you have possessed her body.

118
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,708
I get the feeling she has
no idea about that, does she?

119
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,458
Which is just wrong.

120
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,750
[DEZEL] Have you ever
wanted something so badly

121
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,458
that you were willing
to sacrifice anything?

122
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,750
When you hunger for
something that desperately,

123
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,708
nothing can stand in your way.

124
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,833
I did what I needed to do,
and I'm not sorry for it.

125
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,125
So I sure hope
you weren't planning

126
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,708
to wait around for an apology.

127
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,166
An apology?

128
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,083
Tell me, how long have
you been using Rose's body

129
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,000
without her knowledge?

130
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,958
And how much of who she's
become is the result

131
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,916
of what you've done to her?

132
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,250
I've gotten my revenge.

133
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,416
Now I'll pick up
where Brad left off,

134
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,958
making the world a safer
place for the weak.

135
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:20,333
That's why I'm here.
Why Rose is here.

136
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,583
[gasps]

137
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,750
[DEZEL] Brad was the man
I vowed to follow and Rose

138
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,666
is his adopted daughter
and successor.

139
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,458
Her goals are mine,
and mine are hers.

140
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,833
You asked me what
I want with Rose.

141
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:41,291
What I want is to see
Brad's dreams realized.

142
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,208
Whatever it takes.

143
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,958
She's nothing to you?
Just a tool?

144
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,375
We're stopping? What's going on?

145
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,208
[PLATINUM KNIGHT 18A]
A moment please.

146
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,708
Is the Shepherd
traveling with you?

147
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,500
Why would you want to know that?

148
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,916
[SOREY] Is there something
I can help you with?

149
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,166
[PLATINUM KNIGHT 18A]
Are you the Shepherd?

150
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,625
[SOREY]
Mm-hm.

151
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,375
[PLATINUM KNIGHT 18A]
Please excuse me.

152
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,291
We're men of the
Platinum Knights.

153
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,208
Sir Sergei commanded
us to locate you

154
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,125
and provide you with an escort.

155
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,208
The Blue Storm Knights

156
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,166
have established
a checkpoint up ahead.

157
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,166
We can help you evade it.

158
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,750
Why should we trust you?

159
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,750
It's not as if you've
given us any reason to.

160
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,333
I assure you, we don't
intend you any harm.

161
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,666
Sir Sergei believes that
the battle at Glaivend Basin

162
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,708
was a terrible mistake.

163
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,000
He is thankful to the Shepherd

164
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,833
for putting a stop
to the fighting.

165
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,000
As his soldiers,
we share that gratitude.

166
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,791
[SOREY]
It's all right, Rose.

167
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,083
If you say so.

168
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,333
[PLATINUM KNIGHT 18A]
The Blue Storm Knights

169
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,291
are watching all of
the roads into Pendrago,

170
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,333
so we'll have to take
a different route.

171
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:11,041
Unfortunately, our only option
is to cut through the forest.

172
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,083
You're welcome to our
horses if you need them.

173
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,291
We'll look after your wagon

174
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,666
and see that it's
returned to you later.

175
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,541
All right, then. Thanks.

You, okay?

177
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,125
[ROSE]
Leave me alone.

179
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,833
[ROSE]
What's wrong?

180
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,666
[MIKLEO] The whole forest
is saturated with malevolence.

181
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,958
[LAILAH] The tainted rain
falls and the malevolence

182
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,416
seeps into the earth,
poisons the forest.

183
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,041
We have to do something.

184
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,166
[EDNA] If it spreads,
all of Rolance will be doomed.

185
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,000
[LAILAH] Just purifying
this area won't be enough.

186
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,500
[MIKLEO] She's right.
We should push forward.

00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,000
Let's go.

188
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,750
[ROSE]
What's out there?

189
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,791
Dezel, what do you see?

190
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,083
[DEZEL] Malevolence.
Hellions by the thousands.

191
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,208
Pouring down with the rain,
oozing out of the earth,

192
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,541
swirling through the air.

[gasps]

195
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,208
[DEZEL]
That was malevolence.

196
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,958
To humans it feels
like an icy wind,

197
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,666
but it's something
a great deal darker.

198
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,625
There's so much
I can't perceive.

199
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,333
[ROSE] Like a whole other
world that's invisible.

200
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,166
Let's hurry.

201
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,166
We ride straight on through.

202
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,625
[ROSE] Sorey, do you
know what scares me?

203
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,041
The idea that
everything I've done

204
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,375
has been nothing more
than a waste of time.

205
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,625
I've spent my life
fighting for justice.

206
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,833
Or what I thought was justice.

207
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,916
The weak deserve
a place in this world,

208
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,833
even if it's only a small one.

209
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,416
So I kill the people who
would deny them that,

210
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,083
but is it working?

211
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,500
Sometimes I don't know.

212
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,416
Sometimes what I do
feels meaningless,

213
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,166
hollow, and empty.

214
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,291
[SOREY] I can't tell you
whether or not there's meaning

215
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,333
in the way you live your life.

216
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,500
But, Rose, there is one
thing I can tell you.

217
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,000
Killing is wrong,
no matter what the reason.

218
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,083
[SOREY] Still, regardless
of what you've done,

219
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,083
I don't hate you for it.

220
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,041
We really need to hurry.

221
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,416
The malevolence is
only getting worse.

222
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,791
I was wrong.

223
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,625
I thought I was
strong and righteous.

224
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,791
The truth is, I'm completely
powerless, aren't I?

225
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,916
You are a strong person, Rose.

226
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,958
Nobody can deny you that.

But the world is in chaos.

228
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,416
It needs less darkness
in it, not more,

229
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,291
and that requires a
different kind of power.

I'm helpless.

I can't do anything
to heal this world.

So, there's my answer.
It was all a waste.

The misery in this world

can take a lot from a person.

But don't let it
take your intellect.

Yep.

I wanna help people and
make them happy, like you do.

That's not a bad goal.

But ya gotta remember this:

first and foremost,
we are friends of the weak.

You can't help them if
you're all talk and no action.

We have to start
somewhere and that means

putting immediate justice
over unreachable ideals.

How do you know that?

Maybe he just smelled it
like the rest of us.

Don't listen to her.
It's not the smell.

It's the whisper of the wind.

The wind knows more
than you realize.


282
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,458
Like the fact that dessert
tonight is strawberry shortcake.

Hey, Mibo, what's for dessert?

Some strawberry shortcake.

Huh? I thought she was
over with you guys.

She probably wants
to be alone right now.

Give her space
until she's ready.

Wow, that's very insightful.


295
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,958
The wind has more to talk about
than just the dinner menu.

Clearly.

"Negotiation." Got it? Good.

Who knows.

its own winds.
