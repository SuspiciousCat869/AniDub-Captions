1
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,750
[ROSE]
All right. Let's go.

2
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:28,250
He's gone. And it's my fault.

3
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,583
I'm sorry. If I hadn't
been so stubborn...

4
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,125
[slap]

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,541
[ROSE]
Dezel chose his path.

6
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,416
He didn't want you to
think of him as a sacrifice.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,083
If you do that, you dishonor
the choice he made.

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,541
[ROSE] You did what
you knew to be right.

9
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,458
And so did he.

10
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:59,625
What we need to do is make sure
his death wasn't in vain.

11
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,833
Think we can do that?

12
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,250
Absolutely.

13
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,750
He was lucky to have you, Rose.

14
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,333
The Lord of Calamity awaits.

15
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,333
Come on, it's time.

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,166
[ROSE]
I promise you, Dezel.

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,666
I'll see our dream realized.

18
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,708
Something's coming
from underground.

19
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,875
Power spilling out
into the world.

20
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,500
It's so strong, overwhelming.

21
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,708
Lailah, do you think it might
have something to do

22
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,166
with the Earthpulse?

23
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,833
I can't be certain.

24
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,875
There is power there, but it's
more than malevolence alone.

25
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,083
He's waiting for us.

26
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,125
He wants us to come to him.

27
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,083
The Lord of Calamity.

28
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,000
[rumbling]

29
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,083
[gasps]

30
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,041
Thank you for shielding us.

31
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,291
Yeah, 'preciate it.

32
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,791
[chuckles]

33
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,083
This isn't a small quake.
It's a major tectonic shift.

34
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,166
The kind said to accompany
the awakening of an Empyrean.

35
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,166
Earthquakes do happen
so that seems like

36
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,125
a pretty big assumption to make.

37
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,083
[LAILAH] Maybe so, but given
the timing and the size,

38
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,916
I'd be surprised if it
was a coincidence.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,916
[ZAVEID] The main thing we
need to be concerned about

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,375
is whether the Lord of Calamity

41
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,500
put the malevolence
under his control

42
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,958
or if he was consumed
inside of it.

43
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,208
One thing's for sure,

44
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,208
whatever we're about to
face is very powerful.

45
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,541
[ZAVEID]
Yeah, you got that right.

46
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,625
Maybe we should
hurry it up a little.

47
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,791
Yeah. Right.

48
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:43,041
Your weak attempts at
dominance grow rather tiresome.

49
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,666
[HELDALF] I know not what
you hope to accomplish.

50
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,000
You should have stayed asleep.

51
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,875
[MAOTELUS] You have given
into malevolence, Heldalf.

52
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,541
You've let it consume you.

53
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,166
[HELDALF]
What right do you have to judge

54
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,083
when you, too, have
fallen into malevolence?

55
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,333
[MAOTELUS]
Unlike you, I seek to resist it!

56
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,666
[HELDALF]
You've outlived your usefulness.

57
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,166
This world no longer
needs Empyreans.

58
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,250
[HELDALF roars]

59
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,833
[HELDALF] Not even your kind
are immune to malevolence.

60
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,875
Bow before fate.

61
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,666
[MAOTELUS]
You've grown strong,

62
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,416
stronger than you
were ever meant to be.

63
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,375
You were to be
bound in solitude.

64
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,875
The curse Michael cast
was meant for you alone.

65
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,666
Did it fail?

66
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,583
But all is not
yet lost, Heldalf.

67
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,000
[HELDALF]
Give up your pathetic attempts.

68
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:06,166
I am beyond purification,
beyond death.

69
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,833
[MAOTELUS] How could you allow
solitude and malevolence

70
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,166
to devour you so completely?

71
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,541
[HELDALF] All time has built
towards this moment.

72
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,750
A battle to decide
the fate of the world.

73
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,250
This shall be
humanity's last day.

74
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:25,041
This struggle must fall to
those who were once human.

75
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,625
Your place is not to engage
in this battle, Empyrean.

76
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,000
Yours is to watch
and nothing more.

77
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,833
[SOREY]
Turn and face me!

78
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,750
[HELDALF]
You have come, Shepherd.

79
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,916
[gasps]

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,458
[SOREY]
A dragon!

81
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,833
[HELDALF]
Indeed.

82
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:45,375
Allow me introduce
Maotelus, the Empyrean.

83
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,750
[SOREY] Maotelus?
The leader of the Empyreans?

84
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,000
But why is he in the
form of a dragon?

85
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,333
[gasps]

86
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:58,958
[HELDALF] This world is full
of contradictions, is it not?

87
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,791
But strength can shatter
those contradictions.

88
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:08,791
Power is everything. Without it,
you are helpless. Alone.

89
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,541
And thus, our battle
shall determine

90
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,708
where the true power lies.

91
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,750
[SOREY]
So, this is the answer

92
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,958
that the Lord of
Calamity has chosen.

93
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,041
[LAILAH]
Yes.

94
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,291
[SOREY]
All right then. Fethmus Mioma!

95
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,625
Come and face me!
I will purify you!

96
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:31,958

[yells]

99
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:47,125
Foolish boy, you would
dare pry into my mind?

100
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:51,083
[yells]

101
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,625
[gasps]

102
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,583
It can't be.

103
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,916
[LAILAH]
Michael.

104
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,500
[LAILAH]
This is Camlann.

105
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:29,000
Camlann? That's the
Origin Village.

106
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,708
So that's him. That's Michael.

107
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,125
[LAILAH]
Yes, your predecessor.

108
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,875
But he cannot see us.

109
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,625
Somehow we're inside the
Lord of Calamity's memories.

110
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,875
[MICHAEL] Heldalf, I thank
you for your friendship.

111
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,916
As do I, Shepherd.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,625
[MICHAEL] Please,
I retired a long time ago.

113
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,750
I am no longer a Shepherd.

114
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,041
[SOREY]
That's him.

115
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,791
That's what the Lord
of Calamity looked like

116
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,625
before the malevolence
got a hold of him.

117
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,791
[HELDALF]
Look at all the people!

118
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,500
So many followed their beloved
Shepherd to this village.

119
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,541
[MICHAEL] I want to nurture it,
to see it prosper.

120
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,000
This village is my
hope for the future.

121
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,500
[MIN]
Michael, over here!

122
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,125
If you're hungry later,
I picked a ton of fruit!

123
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:19,958

Thank you.

[LINDA]
No fair!

See, Michael, I picked
as much as she did!

126
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,083
You should try some.

127
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,208
The harvest is coming
along really well.

128
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,750
Yes, I can see that.
I'll have some later.

129
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,541
[MUSE]
Hey, Michael!

130
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,333
Hi, Muse, where's
the little one?

131
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,833
The baby is with the
priest, sleeping soundly.

Hello again, Heldalf.
It's good to see you.

Well, take care.
I should be going.

Bye.

135
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,208
I'm hopeful.

136
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,375
I think this can be a place

137
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,041
where humans and
Seraphim coexist.

138
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,875
Humans and Seraphim.

[HELDALF]
Michael, what is this place?

140
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,041
[MICHAEL] There is a Seraph
who I want you to meet.

141
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,875
A Seraph?

[MICHAEL]
Maotelus,

the Empyrean who is the
foundation of this world.

144
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,458
I need help.

145
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,125
It's dangerous for us
here on the border

146

between Hyland and Rolance.

147
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,708
We don't want to fight.

148
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:31,000
In Camlann, our greatest desire
is to bring peace to the world.

00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,666
Lend us your strength, please.

150
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,541
Certainly.

You've done well.

The pope is pleased with
the results he's seen so far.

[HELDALF]
The war is not yet over.

With the advantage we hold,
it's a forgone conclusion.

There's no chance of us losing.

It's safe to say if
you return to Rolance,

any reward you desire
will be yours.

[HELDALF] My duty is to win
this war against Hyland.

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,375
Fulfilling that mission
is my only desire.

162
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,375
Victory is its own reward.

163
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,250
[GENERAL A] It seems
you're a man of few wants.

164
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,000
[MICHAEL]
Heldalf!

165
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,541
What did you do? You swore!

166
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,666
Please, help me
save the villagers!

167
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,750
[SOREY] I don't understand.
What happened?

168
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,375
[LAILAH]
A betrayal.

169
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,625
Heldalf was in a position
of power in Rolance's army.

170
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,500
He promised to protect
Camlann from Hyland.

171
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,541
Instead, he used the
village as a lure

172
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,875
to attract Hyland soldiers
and slaughtered them.

173
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,791
How could he?

174
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,500
All Michael asked for was peace.

175
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,375
[gasps]

176
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,041
[MICHAEL]
Maotelus.

177
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,208
No, not you too.

178
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:18,083
[MAOTELUS] Yes, I have taken
on malevolence as well.

179
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,750
Darkness born of
human hatred and fear.

180
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,375
So heavy. So
difficult to resist.

181
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:29,500
[MICHAEL]
I'm sorry. So sorry.

182
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,041
[MAOTELUS]
As am I.

183
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,666
However, I will not
give up on purification.

184
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,583
I still have hope.

185
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,250
One day the Lady of the Lake

186
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,500
will oversee the birth
of a new Shepherd.

187
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,333
I will give the Lady of the
Lake my powers of purification.

188
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,791
In exchange, I will require
that she make a vow

189
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,916
never to speak of what
has happened here.

190
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,375
[MUSE]
No!

191
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,791
Muse!

192
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,583
Michael, the baby!
He's in there!

193
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:06,250
[MUSE crying]

194
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,125
[MICHAEL]
I won't let anybody else die.

195
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,708
No! Brother!

196
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,000
[MICHAEL]
Heldalf.

197
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:35,416
For what you have done,
you will suffer.

198
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,958
I sacrifice myself
and my sister's child

199
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,666
and put this curse upon you.

200
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,916
You shall live in
solitude, forever!

201
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,041
[SOREY screaming]

202
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,083
I need to know. Did he die?

203
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,125
[LAILAH]
He did.

204
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,750
But this is the first
time I saw how.

205
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:02,208
It was a horrible
thing to watch.

206
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,916
Horrible.

207
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,666
Originally, Michael's curse
was intended for Heldalf alone.

208
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,666
[LAILAH]
It began as a small malevolence,

209
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,250
but during his long years
of solitude, it grew.

210
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,166
As the decades passed,
it became stronger,

211
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,083
until it was large enough to
enshroud the entire world.

212
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,541
[MAOTELUS]
One day,

213
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,875
a new Shepherd will come
to purify the world.

214
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,625
I must hold to that belief.

215
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,916
[SOREY yells]

216
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,500
[HELDALF]
And now you've seen the truth.

217
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,833
That's why you kept
thing from us, Lailah.

218
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,041
You swore to stay silent.

219
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,333
All of this began
with a curse and fire.

220
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,791
[HELDALF]
You cannot fathom true solitude.

221
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,666
It is to descend into shadow.

222
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,083
Darkness layered
upon endless darkness.

223
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:14,458
[SOREY] I shall purify you
and lift the darkness.

224
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,666
What insolence!

225
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,166
[gasps]

226
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,666
[yells]

227
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,208
[yells]

228
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,583
Think, Heldalf! Try to
remember your humanity.

229
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,250
You're lost, drowning
in a sea of malevolence.

230
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,291
Let me save you
before the entire world

231
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,166
drowns along with you!

232
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,916
You know nothing of
what I've suffered.

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,416
The hell that is solitude.

234
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,833
[ALISHA]
You're right!

235
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,916
[ALISHA]
That's why we're all here.

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,250
Because nobody can
survive alone.

237
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,666
[ROSE]
We need each other.

238
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,166
We're stronger when
we fight together!

239
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,666
You're strong together,
but alone you are weak!

240
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,041
That's what it means
to be part of humanity.

241
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,791
Die!

242
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,333
[HELDALF] How does it feel
knowing you shall never again

243
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,416
see the light of day?

244
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,916
[SOREY]
You've truly given up hope.

245
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,041
Lailah gave me a task.

246
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,958
I was to travel the world,
learn all I could

247
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,625
so that I could see the
truth with my own eyes

248
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:49,333
and stand against
the Lord of Calamity.

249
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,125
Do you know what I learned?

250
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,000
Humans need each other.

251
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,375
No one deserves
enteral solitude.

252
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:59,708
The curse robbed you of your
humanity, but it's not too late.

253
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,291
I will purify you.

254
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,458
[SOREY gasps]

255
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,041
[SOREY]
Heldalf?

256
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:09,541
Why come here? Why seek out this
deserted corner of the world?

257
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,833
It wasn't for the Earthpulse.

258
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,333
You weren't drawn
by malevolence.

259
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,250
You came here so you
wouldn't hurt others.

260
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:21,083
You came here to
be consumed alone.

261
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,291
That was the real
reason, wasn't it?

262
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,750
Humans are born to feel
compassion, to care,

263
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,958
to wanna make this world better.

264
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,333
Including you, Heldalf!

265
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,000
[roars]

266
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,791
What's happening to him?

267
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,375
[SOREY] I don't understand.
What's going on?

268
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,125
[LAILAH]
The curse is taking him.

269
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,875
He's being bound
further into solitude.

270
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,916
It's claiming him completely.

271
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,125
There's nothing left
but hate anymore.

272
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,166
Too cruel, even for him.

273
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,250
[yells]

274
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,625
He's become completely consumed!

275
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,208
[SOREY coughs]

276
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,458
[MIKLEO]
Sorey!

277
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,916
Are you all right?

278
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,708
[SOREY]
It's impossible.

279
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,458
I won't be able to
purify him like this.

280
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,041
There's an idea
I've had for a while.

281
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:49,000
Earth, water, wind, fire.

282
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,750
You represent the
Seraphic forces

283
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,958
that form the foundation
of the world.

284
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,750
If I can gather your
strengths into one...

285
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,083
What are you saying?

286
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,125
Is it possible? Are you ready?

287
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,625
For that matter, are we?

288
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,875
[SOREY] Zaveid, I don't
have a pact with you yet,

289
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,250
but if you're willing...

290
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,291
Yeah, you can count me in.

291
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,583
I owe it to Dezel to
pick up where he left off

292
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,750
and fulfill his wishes.

293
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:16,916
I owe you.

294
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,083
[ZAVEID]
Don't mention it.

295
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,083
Hold on.

296
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,875
[ZAVEID[
Huh?

297
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,708
Dezel's hat.

298
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,500
If you're taking his part,

299
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,750
it's only right
that you have it.

300
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,208
[ZAVEID]
Heh.

301
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,125
Not sure it'll look
as good on me.

302
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,500
But if I'm wearing this,

303
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,333
it'll almost be like having
him along for the ride.

304
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,666
I'm ready, Sorey.
Let's formalize the pact.

305
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,958
Lailah, will you?

306
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,958
[LAILAH] O ye born of the
sacred currents of peace.

307
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,125
Here let our pact be forged,

308
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,791
that my incandescence may
be as thy purification.

309
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,833
Shouldst thou
accept this burden,

310
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,875
recite aloud your true name.

311
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,250
I am Fylk Zahdeya.

312
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,500
Okay, we know the risks.

313
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,291
If I can't support all of you,

314
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,166
then this armatization
will fail.

315
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,625
But even so, I have to try.

316
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,833
We all know how
stubborn you are.

317
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,958
Do your best.
That's all we can ask.

318
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,333
I have complete faith in you.

Yeah.

We'll hold all the malevolence
you send our way.

322
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,666
I know you can do it, Sorey.

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,000
We can, all of us.

324

[SOREY]
Earth, water, wind, fire.

The decisive battle is here!


331
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,833
Everyone, I wanna thank you
for coming all this way with me.

Don't be ridiculous.

you go without me.

For everything.

00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:18,291
I swear on my spear, I'll
fight with you till the end.


339
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,666
The same goes for me.


340
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,166
I'm not gonna back down now.
I owe this to Dezel.


341
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,458
Remember our deal.

00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,875
Once we're done,


343
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,791
