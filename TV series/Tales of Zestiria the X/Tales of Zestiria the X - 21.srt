1
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,875
[MIKLEO]
All of these people are here

2
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,291
to pray for Alisha's recovery?

3
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,125
They must truly love her.

4
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,666
Really? She's not that cute.

5
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,958
Don't be mean.

6
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,583
[EDNA]
Just a joke.

7
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,083
[LAILAH] Alisha's subjects are
genuinely concerned for her.

8
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,416
That says a great deal
about her as a princess.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,916
She's strong,
but will she recover?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,458
[SOREY]
Of course she will.

11
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,708
[MIKLEO]
Sorey, you should be resting.

12
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,750
No. I definitely shouldn't.

13
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,625
I've been in bed
for five days now.

14
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,166
Any more rest and
I'm gonna go crazy.

15
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,625
What about Rose and Alisha?

16
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,791
How long have those two
been unconscious for?

17
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,500
It's been nine days.

18
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:07,916
I see.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The dragon, it really
took a toll on you.

20
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,291
Yeah.

21
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,125
It's like you're being
invaded by emotions

22
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,708
that don't belong to you.

23
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,625
Then they collide and explode.

24
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,291
Bang!

25
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,916
Kinda like fireworks
in your head.

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,833
After that, they just
need some time

27
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,500
to sort through the
leftover emotions

28
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,500
and let them settle
in the right places.

29
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,791
It'll be best if we wait and
let them wake up on their own.

30
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:39,291
All these people...
Alisha is truly loved.

31
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,875
Without being asked,
they gathered here

32
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,875
not to pray for an escape
from hardship for themselves,

33
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,833
but out of honest concern
for the well-being

34
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,750
of another person.

35
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:52,500
That's good. It gives me
hope for the future.

36
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,625
[gasps]

37
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,958
Good news. They're awake.

38
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,666
[ALISHA]
Good morning.

39
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,583
[ROSE groans]

40
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,166
[ROSE]
Back at ya.

41
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,500
[ALISHA, ROSE]
It wasn't a dream!

42
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,416
It really happened!

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,916
We're alive. We did it, Rose!

44
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,750
[IAN crying]

45
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,250
I'm so glad you're awake!

46
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,250
I don't know what we
would've done without you!

47
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,750
Please don't cry. I'm all right.

48
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,625
I know that I worried a lot
of people. I'm so sorry.

49
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,500
Don't be. We're just glad
to have you back with us.

50
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,916
[MALTRAN] This latest
tornado hit Ladylake hard.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,291
There's a lot of
damage to be repaired.

52
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:19,041
Even so, the people are
still in good spirits.

53
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,416
That's thanks to you.

54
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,125
Your recovery has given them
a renewed sense of hope.

55
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,125
I wish you could've been
in the square to hear them

56
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,416
when news came
that you'd awoken.

57
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,916
It worked.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,625
We purified the dragon like
we wanted, but at what cost?

59
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,875
The Squires took serious damage.

60
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,708
We can't expect to do that
over and over again.

61
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,208
I know what you're thinking,
but please don't worry about me.

62
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,875
[MIKLEO gasps]

63
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,291
[ROSE] I'm not going to pretend
what we did was easy.

64
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,708
It wasn't.

65
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,666
It may've been the most
difficult thing I've ever done,

66
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,916
but still... I did it.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,875
It was a lot to ask of you.

68
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,333
When we started,
it felt like my heart

69
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,416
was being wrenched
out of my body.

70
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,208
I wasn't sure if I
could withstand it,

71
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,875
but then I thought of
all I've been through

72
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,666
and I realized I could.

73
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,500
Yeah, same goes for me.

74
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,041
We can do this.

75
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,416
Thank you. Both of you.

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,666
As different as we are,

77
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,458
I think it's clear we
make a pretty good team.

78
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,541
I help her to loosen
up a little bit

79
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,875
and she helps to
keep me in line.

80
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,458
Where's your shadow?

81
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,166
I didn't think Dezel
ever left your side

82
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,958
for more than a minutes.

83
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,083
If that's the best you can do,
I'm very disappointed.

84
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,083
Can't you be more original?

85
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's have fun.
Here, I'll start.

86
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,958
[DEZEL]
Flashy, but weak.

87
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,500
Considering who your master is,

88
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,041
I would've expected you
to be stronger than this.

89
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,750
That's enough, Dezel!

90
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,458
Don't get involved.

91
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,375
When I'm done with her,
she'll tell us whatever we want.

92
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,541
[SYMONNE chuckles]

93
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,083
[SYMONNE]
What more do you need to know?

94
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,958
My Lord will do as he pleases,
and nobody can stop him.

95
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,916
That can't be true.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,583
You will bear witness
to this calamity, Shepherd.

97
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,291
[SOREY]
What about you?

98
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,208
Could you stop him?

99
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,708
[SYMONNE] Even if I tried, the
Lord no longer has ears to hear.

100
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,416
He is calamity incarnate now,
an immovable force.

101
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,125
It will help if I show you.

102
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,875
[SYMONNE]
This is the northern land.

103
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:00,000
It is a harsh, barren place
where no humans live

104
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,458
and even the strongest of
beasts struggle to survive.

105
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,791
[SYMONNE] Every being
that carries malevolence

106
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,875
gathers to attend him.

107
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,875
They are drawn to
the power of my Lord.

108
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:38,583
[SYMONNE] Soon, this force of
grief and hate will overflow.

109
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,958
Malevolence will crash down
upon this world like the tide.

110
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:53,041
[yells]

111
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,833
[DEZEL]
Curse you.

112
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,416
[SYMONNE]
Painful, was it?

113
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,708
Just imagine how worse
the reality will be.

114
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,375
Do you now see what I mean
when I say the world is ending?

115
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,041
Perhaps you should try
to enjoy your final days.

116
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,541
I don't understand why
you're telling us this.

117
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,458
You serve the Lord of
Calamity. What do you want?

118
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,625
To see the world
destroyed like he does?

119
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,166
What do I want?

120
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,250
Guys. I'm sorry.

121
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,625
I guess it's time to pack
our bags for the north.

122
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,666
This place was
getting dull anyway.

123
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,458
[DEZEL] Yeah, guess I could
do with a trip up north.

124
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:50,333
[MIKLEO] You should know by now,
wherever you go, I go.

125
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,041
Thank you. Truly.

126
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,458
[LAILAH]
Sorey.

127
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,541
Before we go anywhere, there is
something I must give to you.

128
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,958
What is it?

129
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,166
You've accomplished
so much already,

130
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,041
faced every challenge
that we've encountered

131
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,458
head-on and unafraid.

132
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,875
And, Sorey, you did what no
other Shepherd has been able to.

133
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,500
With your Squires,
you purified a dragon.

134
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,000
On top of all that,

135
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,500
you're close to uncovering
the true nature of malevolence.

136
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,041
When you started this journey.

137
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:24,375
it was because you believed in
the certain words of a book.

138
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,500
<i>The Celestial Record</i> .

139
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,333
[LAILAH]
You know its verses well,

140
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,875
but you may be
surprised to learn

141
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,041
it was a Sheperd who wrote them.

142
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,291
Is that true?

143
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,625
Yes. I knew him.

144
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,250
The author of the book
was Shepherd Michael.

145
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,583
[gasps]

146
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,541
And there's more.

147
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,666
He wrote another volume.

148
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,333
Kept inside is all he learned
of the origin of malevolence.

149
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,875
I can't believe it!
Another <i>Celestial Record</i> ?

150
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,416
Amazing!

151
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,083
[SOREY]
Thank you.

152
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,708
[LAILAH] Inside this book are
the secrets Michael uncovered

153
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,291
about the world and how it
came to be the way it is.

154
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,750
[SOREY] "Chapter One:
The Beginning of Calamity."

155
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:24,041
This is it. What Emperor
Doran told us about.

156
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,333
[SOREY] Velvet Crowe. This is
where everything started.

157
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,291
The hatred in her heart
was the beginning of it all.

158

[SOREY]
The savior. Artorius Collbrande.

00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,291
He sacrificed Velvet's
brother in a ritual

160
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,375
that would eliminate
all human emotion

161
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,166
and thus the malevolence
that it created.

162
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,208
[ROSE]
Hmm...

163
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,583
[ROSE]
Hmm.

164
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,541
[ROSE]
Mh-hm...

165
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,125
Mm.... Mh-hm.

166
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,541
Ugh!

167

[SOREY]
It seems okay to me.

168
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,125
You're the Shepherd.

169
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,041
You need to dress appropriately.
People expect it of you.

170
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,291
Next!

171
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,916
[SOREY] Ugh. Pass.
It smells like moth balls.

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,875
Excuse me. Can I have a moment?

173
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,916
Sorry to bother you,

174
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,375
but we heard that you were
intending to head north.

175
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,833
Please let us come.

176
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,875
It can never hurt to have
an extra sword or two along.

177
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,458
What do you think?

178
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,458
[SOREY] It's fine with me, but
the decision is really yours.

179
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,666
If you're all right
with it, then I am too.

180
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,458
We appreciate this,
Sir Shepherd.

181
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,458
Our place is with the princess.

182
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,375
It is.

183
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,166
[SOREY]
Wait, does that mean...

184
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,000
...you're coming
with us, Alisha?

185
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,583
Of course I am.

186
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,125
I'm glad to hear it, but what
about rebuilding the city?

187
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,666
What will happen to Hyland
if the world is destroyed?

188
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,333
You're facing something big.

189
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:01,083
If I can help, then I will be
doing my duty as a princess

190
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,666
and my job as your Squire.

191
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,375
[SOREY]
Thank you.

192
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,166
Oh! Hey, Schiller.

193
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,416
Ask the Shepherd to shake
your hand. It's good luck!

194
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,083
[SOREY]
This again? Aw, come on!

195
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,625
[IAN] Mine, too! I think
my luck's worn off.

196
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,666
Here. Try this one.

197
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,375
Nice. Fits perfectly.

198
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,875
It looks great!

199
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,416
You think so?

200
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,333
[MIKLEO] All these
people are volunteering

201
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,875
to come north with us?

202
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,208
The line just keeps
getting longer.

203
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,500
Word got out that the Shepherd
was going on a journey,

204
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,166
and people started showing up.

205
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,416
Not totally sure what they're
hoping to get out of it, though.

206
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,791
I would like to
join the Shepherd

207
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,875
on his journey to
save the world.

208
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,833
I can fight. I'm considered
a master of the spear.

209
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm not great with a sword
or a bow, but I'm a good cook.

210
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,750
[VOLUNTEER D] I'm happy to
carry out any task you give me.

211
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,000
[MALTRAN]
A lot has changed.

212
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,166
Not long ago, we were
so short on soldiers

213
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,500
that Bartlow wanted to use
the Sacred Blade Festival

214
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,958
as a recruiting fair.

215
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,875
[ALISHA] We aren't having
that problem now.

216
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,708
You have come so far.

217
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,166
I know it wasn't easy,

218
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,791
but you should be proud of
what you've done for Hyland.

219
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,458
That means a lot
coming from you.

220
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,208
But still, the real
battle has just begun.

221
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,875
Yes, it has.

222
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,333
You'll stay here?
Look after the city?

223
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,916
I'd rather come along and stand
beside you when you fight,

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,875
but if you're asking
me to stay behind,

225
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,416
then that's what I'll do.

226
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,083
After all, how could I say no
to the new leader of Hyland?

227
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,791
I appreciate it, Master.

228
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,958
[OFFICIAL A]
Your Highness, it's time.

229
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,708
I should go now.

00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,666
[EDNA]
You're going to come too, right?

231
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,875
[ZAVEID] It sure is nice to
think that we might finally

232
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,750
be coming to the end
of this long road.

233
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:03,583
Yeah, and we might get there
more quickly with your help.

234
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,291
I'm sure Sorey would be more
than happy to have you.

235
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,708
[ZAVEID]
Heh.

236
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,958
And I guess I owe him one

237
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,250
after what happened
on the mountain.

238
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:21,416
[ALISHA] I wish we could've
taken every volunteer with us.

239
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,208
But not everybody can face
what we'll be up against.

240
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,958
So, I chose only
the most capable

241
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,125
to make up the squad
we're bringing.

242
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,500
[SOREY]
Good.

243
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,625
[ALISHA] However, I made
sure everyone understood

244
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,125
that staying behind didn't
mean they couldn't help.

245
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,208
They can do their part by
working to rebuild the city.

246
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,750
Exactly.

247
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,958
And I'll do everything I can

248
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,666
to make sure that
work isn't wasted.

and weaponry we're supplying,

251
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,125
they've run up a pretty
sizable tab already.

252
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,958
Better be able to
pay for it all.

253
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,833
I wouldn't worry too much.

254

Our client's the entire
nation of Hyland,

they're good for it.

256
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,291
It's like the Scattered
Bones has become

257
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,291
a legitimate operation.

258
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,625
Kind of strange, ya know?

259
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,083
We're heading to
a dangerous place

260
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,458
to fight an unstoppable enemy

261
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,166
and yet everybody's
acting like this trip

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,416
is some sort of holiday.

Well, they're idiots.

316
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,583
He isn't the only one
who's gotten stronger.

317
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah.

318
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,625
You've got two Squires, so find
a way to make use of us.

319
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,583
We could always try the armatus.

320
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,041
And that would be?

321
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,541
Don't even ask. Dezel,
you know it's impossible.

322
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,375
It would put too much strain
on the Squires and on us.

323
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,708
[DEZEL] Look, in case
you hadn't noticed,

324
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,750
the Squires want to fight.

325
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,375
So let them try.

326
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,875
Okay, does somebody
wanna clue us in, here?

327
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,625
[LAILAH] Armatization
is the ultimate form

328
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,833
of collaborative combat
among humans and Seraphim.

329
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,208
It is also the Shepherd's
greatest and final weapon.

330
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,791
Trying it with a Squire
is too dangerous.

331
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,166
Think, Dezel!

332
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,666
We risk the life of the
Seraph attempting to merge.

333
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,791
You think they're
still too green.

334
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,958
I can't deny that.

335
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,958
Still, if the Lord of Calamity
is trying to destroy

336
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,166
the entire world, it'd be
foolish not to go after him

337
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,125
with every weapon we've got.

338
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,375
[LAILAH]
Maybe so, but, Dezel...

339
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,958
[DEZEL]
I'll take care of Rose.

340
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:50,666
As for Alisha--

341
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,041
[LAILAH]
I'll do it.

342
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,541
[DEZEL]
It can't be you, Lailah.

343
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,500
If we lost you, the Shepherd
would lose his own powers.

344
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,000
We need someone else.

345
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,208
Someone who won't put too
heavy of a burden on the Squire.

346
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,708
Okay then, it's me. I'll do it.

347
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,833
You'll need a Sub Lord
agreement with Sorey.

348
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:12,791
[DEZEL]
Hmph.

349
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,583
I figured as much.

350
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,166
Hepshin Yulind!

351
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,000
Lukeim Yurlin!

352
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,125
[BOTH yell]

353
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,833
[ALL gasp]

354
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,416
[ALISHA]
How's this ever going to work?

355
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,291
I can't stand up,
let alone fight.

356
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,208
[grunts]

357
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,250
Much harder than I expected.

358
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,125
I can see why you were so
worried about us dying now.

359
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,750
[LAILAH] Armatization
is a kind of merging.

360
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,833
The Seraph's role is to
become a full-body weapon.

361
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:05,625
In turn, the Squire acts as the
platform to support that weapon.

362
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,625
If the fusion is incomplete,

363
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,541
both Seraph and
Squire will fall.

364
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,625
What a miserable showing.

365
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,083
At this rate, the little fools
won't even last long enough

366
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,708
to reach my Lord.

367
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,375
How cool! Looks like we
got everyone here today!


368
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,958
Yeah, and things are
getting a little crowded.


369
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,375
Hey, be nice. Stop pushing me.
I'm barely in the shot!


370
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,958
We should do something special!


371
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,166
Why don't we all sing
a song together?


372
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,333
Make me.


373
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,750
'Kay. Let's play
a word game instead.


374
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,458
Last letter of
the previous word.


375
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,833
All right, why don't we
start with Arrow Squall?


376
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,250
Lukeim Yurlin?


377
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,625
Next time we do this, somebody
better bring me snacks.


378
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,541
"S," huh? Sparrowfeathers!


379
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,583
Scattered Bones!


380
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,791
Soufflé!


381
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,708
I have the perfect "E"! Elysia!


382
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,583
Mm... Master Maltran!


383
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,875
Nu-- Nu-- Uh...


384
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,000
Ha! Next time: "Northern land."


385
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,166
Look forward to it!


386
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,750
Whew, I thought you
were gonna choke!


387
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,666
I didn't know you had
such a unique talent.


388
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,750
Well, if you're so good, you
can handle the rest from here.


389
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,791
Start with "R."


390
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,083
Uh. Rayfalke Spiritcrest.


391
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,416
For "T," Twin Flow.


392
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,833
For "W," Windriders!
Strawberry shortcake! Edna!


393
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,875
Armatization. Normin!


394
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:50,708
What'cha think?


395
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,000
[OTHERS]
Impressive!
