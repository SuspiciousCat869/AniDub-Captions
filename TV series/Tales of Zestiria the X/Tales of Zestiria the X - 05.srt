[VELVET] After the Daemonblight,
the world changed.

9
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,291
It became a hell where
both people and beasts,

10
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:53,041
possessed by demons,
feasted upon human flesh.

11
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,583
Now, despair has locked
my heart in its icy grip.

12
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,083
And it can only be
thawed with blood.

13
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,041
Blood of one man,
whose limbs I would happily

14

tear off and whose flesh
I would gleefully rend.

How long has it been now?

19
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,583
For how long have you
survived in darkness,

20
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,333

[VELVET] You are his Malak,

Where is Artorius?

27
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,291
You must hurry. There is
no time to waste.

28
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,416
I have broken many

Hmph.

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,625
This is the wrong way!

48
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,583
[VELVET]
That's the route you took

49
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,791
by breaking the seals, right?

50
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,625
I'm not that stupid.
We go this way.

51
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,125
[SERES] I'd thought you
possessed only offensive skills

52
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:50,333
with no mind for anything
else. Seems I was wrong.

53
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,541
[VELVET] Because I chose
to hide us in here?

54
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,958
Yes.

55
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,166
[VELVET]
All I care about is Artorius.

56
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,875
I will use any and every skill
at my command to see him dead.

57
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,375
Useless.

58
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,666
This must be a storeroom
where they keep the items

59
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,250
that they confiscated
from the Daemons.

60
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,125
[SERES]
That sword looks like Stormhowl.

61
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,875
But why is it here?

62
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,875
It looks too big for me
to wield effectively.

63
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,291
Well, that's a shame.

64
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,833
Stormhowl <i>is</i> a matchless blade.

65
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,875
[VELVET]
However great it might be,

66
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,666
it's no use to me
if I can't swing it.

67
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,083
You have been
locked in this prison

68
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,083
for three years now,
and much has changed.

69
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,083
The landscape of the world
is quite different

70
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,125
from what you knew.

71
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,166
Wouldn't you like to hear
what happened in your absence?

72
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,833
The number of
exorcists has grown,

73
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,708
their power's consolidated.

74
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,333
They've organized a
resistance against Dae--

75
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,375
[VELVET]
Lovely.

76
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,125
Now tell me, where is Artorius?

77
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,875
He is in the Midgand region.

78
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,791
You can find him in
the capital, Lowgriss.

79
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,166
[SERES] There could be
an army of Exorcists

80
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,708
waiting outside the prison.

81
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,333
After everything,
you must have questions.

82
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,083
Don't you want to know
what you saw that night?

83
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,541
[SERES]
What you witnessed...

84
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,541
...was the completion
of a ritual.

85
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,833
A ritual that would
change everything.

86
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,333
Many other Malakim
came to this world.

87
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,458
The Exorcists put
us to good use.

88
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,333
And in time, they ended
the Daemon invasion.

89
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,416
One man heads the Abbey,

90
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,875
which is the organization
of Exorcists.

91
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,000
For the great deeds he
has done over the years,

92
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,583
he's earned the trust of
the kingdom and its people.

93
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,250
Revered as the shield of
humankind and the sword

94
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,166
that hunts the Daemons,

95
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,833
Artorius Collbrande is
known as the savior.

96
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,708
He gained that power
by sacrificing a child.

97
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,916
You should know.

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,291
He is strong, but incomplete.

99
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,708
The mighty savior can be killed.

100
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,333
I thought you were
<i>his</i> Malak, though.

101
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,500
Right, Seres?

102
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,333
Yes.

103
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,791
[VELVET]
Then why would you help me?

104
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,125
I'll explain.

105
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,875
But not until we've gotten
safely away from here.

breakin' outta here?

116
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,875
So am I.

117
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,875
Which means that I'm not the
one you should be attacking.

118
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,125
Think maybe you
could let me go now?

...getting the hell out of here.

121
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,625
U-Uh... I guess that explains
why there are so many

122
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,041
Exorcists roamin' the hallways.

123
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:04,666

things, didn't you?

124

He isn't human. He's a Daemon!

125
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,375
I suppose.

126
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,125
Though, for what it's worth,
you two don't seem

127
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,083
to be regular people, either.

128
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,833
Well, shall we go?

129
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,333
We don't know how many
Exorcists might be waiting.

130
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,916
I don't think it
should be a problem.

131
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,791
Not as long as I can
find my partner again.

132
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,000
And I won't be
leaving until I do.

133
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,083
That's the whole reason
I came down here.

Stormhowl!

137
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,625
Give it back! That's my partner!

138
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,333
[VELVET]
This sword belongs to you?

139
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,833
Sorry. But, you know,
finders keepers.

140
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,833
Stormhowl's not
somethin' I joke about.

141
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,833
So don't test me.

142
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,166
No? I think maybe I will.

143
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,625
Bad idea.

144
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,625
So, tell me. This sword...

145
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,666
You're capable of wielding it?

146
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,000
Of course. It's mine after all.

147
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,875
You can kill Exorcists with it?

148
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,708
[laughs] Those weaklings?
I wouldn't need a real sword.

149
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,750
I could do that with
just these dull blades.

150
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,375
Very well.

151
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,166
I will return Stormhowl to you.

152
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,875
However... There's a condition.

153
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,500
I'm listening.

154
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,500
Well? How do we escape?

155
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,166
I assume you have
a ship ready, Seres?

156
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,708
So you are aware, then.

157
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,416
That we're on an island.

158
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,958
Yes.

159
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,875
I know it's an island prison
designed for locking up Daemons.

160
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,541
Some of my meals told me as much
while begging for their lives.

161
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,625
There are two ports here,
located on opposite sides.

162
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,250
My ship is anchored
on the far side.

163
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,125
[VELVET] Do you think
there will be Exorcists

164
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,916
lying in wait for us there?

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,916
Given the current situation,
it would be wise to assume so.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,166
They aren't stupid.

167
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,750
Ships are the only
way off the island.

168
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,458
If I were the enemy,
I would send

169
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,500
all of the ships
out of both ports.

170
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,583
Thus trapping us here with
no other means of escape.

171
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,833
[VELVET] I, for one,
don't plan on staying.

172
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,125
First, we whittle
down their Garrison.

173
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,416
That way, it might
be possible to take

174
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,666
one of their
transports by force.

175
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,916
Sounds good to me.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,458
And that would be where
my partner and I come in.

177
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,708
[VELVET] I don't know
much about this prison.

178
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,333
Mainly, I know about
the underground level.

179
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,791
That's the area
where I was housed.

180
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,125
I also know that there
are about 1,000 Daemons

181
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,166
being held on the
level above my own.

182
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,375
[SERES]
How did you learn that?

183
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,791
[VELVET] Would you like
me to tell you about

184
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,125
all the Daemons
I devoured each day?

185
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,250
It's not a pretty story.

186
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,416
[VELVET] Thanks to the
information you two provided,

187
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,333
we know that this floor
is for solitary confinement.

188
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,875
That's useful.

189
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,375
If we release the prisoners
here, there will be utter chaos.

190
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,666
And we can use that
to our advantage.

191
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,791
[SERES]
They won't have the chance

192
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,916
to order the ships out of port.

193
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,250
[VELVET]
You understand?

194
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,583
[SERES]
Yes.

195
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,833
[BEASTS growling]

196
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,875
All right.

197
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,250
Time for you and
that sword of yours

198
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,583
to keep your end of the bargain.

199
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,958
I'm a man of my word.

200
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,208
I suspect creating chaos
comes rather easily.

201
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,625
[ROKUROU]
Hmph.

202
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,208
[BOTH yell]

203
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,541
[VELVET]
Impressive.

204
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,625
Ugh. This thing's seriously
got a nick already?

205
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,250
This steals even wose
quality than I thought.

206
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:04,625
I'm ready when you are,
ladies. Go right ahead.

207
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,125
Free them.

208
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:26,958
[ROKUROU]
You'll wanna take a right

209
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,041
at the end of this corridor.

210
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,250
That's the best way to
get to the upper level.

211
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,958
And thanks for the blade.

212
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:43,625
--[BEASTS growling]

Woo-hoo!

214
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,791
We have to turn back.

215
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,041
[SERES]
As a Therion, you have power.

216
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,666
But it has its limits.

217
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,958
Whatever else that
hand of yours may do,

218
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,625
I doubt it will help
you survive this fall.

219
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,958
[gasps]

220
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,375
They're faster than I thought.

221
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,708
[SERES]
And they are much stronger.

222
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,625
I can't hold them off for long.

223
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,208
It's a long fall, but not
as long as his was.

224
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,416
[VELVET yelling]

[SERES gasps]

229
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,666
[SERES] Incredible.
Will she stop at nothing?

230
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,625
[groans]

231
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,041
You're stronger than I thought.

232
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,541
Almost as if you have an oath

233
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,500
An oath?

234
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,958
[SERES] Not something
to be spoken of lightly.

235
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:40,208
An oath is a ritual that places
certain limitations on a person.

236
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,958
It grants a special power.

237
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,208
The stronger the limitation,
the stronger the power.

238
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,958
It is not always a blessing.

239
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,916
More like a curse.

240
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,625
--[VELVET] Let's go.

[gasps]

243
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,500
[SERES gasps]
That flag...

244
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,500
It's the sign of the
Praetor-class Exorcist.

245
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,583
[SERES]
So, on that ship...

246
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,458
Artorius... Would you
truly go so far?

247
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,416
[SERES]
There is a new player.

248
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,833
The way forward has become
more treacherous for me

249
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,333
as well as you.

250
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,333
The Praetor-class Exorcist
is a great deal more powerful

251
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,833
than the Centurion-class.

252
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,125
Will you still fight, Velvet,

253
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,583
knowing it might be hopeless?

254
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,958
[VELVET]
As long as I draw breath.

255
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,083
[SERES]
You have changed because of him,

256
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,833
because of what he did.

257
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,000
His actions stirred
something within you.

258
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,833
Will that change bring
new hope to the world?

259
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,500
Or will it only
spread malevolence?

260
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:12,250
I don't yet know.
Only time will tell.

261
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,291
No road is long
with good company.

262
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,208
But traveling alone
can be miserable.

263
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,750
How 'bout we make
the best of this?

264
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,500
While we're together, we might
as well try to be buddies.

265
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:15,958
I'm not interested in friends.

266
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,500
You're a cold one, eh?

267
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,833
Once we're off this island,

268
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:21,458
maybe I'll be able to
change your mind about me.

269
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,791
What, nothin'?

270
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,458
We're about to face
a Praetor-class Exorcist.

271
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,041
This is no time to kid around.

272
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,375
Fine, fine.

273
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't care if we're up
against Praetors or worse.

274
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:35,416
Only one thing matters:
slaying Artorius Collbrande.

275
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,125
I swear I'll have my revenge!

276
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,250
That's the spirit!

277
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,833
I can get behind that.

278
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,958
What do ya say,
ladies? Shall we?

279
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:42,500
Yes.

280
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,791
Yes.

281
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:47,041
Next week: "Velvet Crowe."
Look forward to it.

282
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,125
So the entire episode's
just about you?

283
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,083
Fascinating, right?

284
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,291
I'm not so sure.

285
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,666
What about my story?

286
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,958
"The Brave Life
of Rokurou Rangetsu."

287
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,583
Has a nice ring to it.

288
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,041
A tale of triumph!

289
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,833
An epic quest sure
to bring tears

290
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,791
to the eye of every listener!
