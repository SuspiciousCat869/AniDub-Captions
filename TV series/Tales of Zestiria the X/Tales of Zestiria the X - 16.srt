[ROSE]
Yeah? What is it?

3
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,416
Good news.

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,958
We heard from one of our people.

5
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,833
We've got him. We've
located Prince Konan.

6
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,000
It's time for revenge.
Are you ready?

7
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,333
[WINDRIDERS murmuring]

8
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,333
Ta-da!

9
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,416
So, whatcha think?

10
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,375
Do I look like
a princess, or what?

11
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,958
[WINDRIDER 17A]
Are you really Rose?

12
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,958
[WINDRIDER 17B]
There's no way!

13
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,625
I gotta make sure
she's not an imposter.

14
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,250
No touching!

15
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,291
Oh, yeah, that's the
real Rose, all right.

16
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,708
[WINDRIDERS laugh]

17
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,833
Shut up, you jerks!

18
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,375
It's still hard
to believe our Rose

19
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,791
is going to be
marrying a prince.

20
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,375
It's Brad we're talkin' about.

21
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,291
Is there anything he can't do?

22
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,500
If we stick with him, there's
no tellin' how far we can go.

23
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,833
[WINDRIDER 17C]
Yeah!

24
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,083
[WINDRIDER 17D]
Hey boys, Brad's back!

25
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,083
There he is!

26
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,541
Well, it's about time!

27
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,083
[WINDRIDER 17C]
Brad!

28
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,625
[DRUNK WINDRIDER 17A]
How ya been?

29
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:02,166
[laughs] Check it out! Look.

30
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,708
You'll never believe it!

31
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,041
I'm a princess now!

32
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,041
[WINDRIDERS groaning]

33
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,916
[ROSE]
You look lost. Need something?

34
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,125
Yeah, actually.
I'm looking for Dezel.

35
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,125
Have any idea where
I can find him?

36
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,166
He was over there
just a second ago.

37
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,208
Not that I can see him
or anything like you can,

38
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,291
but I do sense when he's around.

39
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,958
What do you want?

40
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,416
I'm not so sure it's a good idea

41
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,208
to leave him on his own
after what happened.

42
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,291
The thing at the church?

43
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,750
I dunno, can you be sure they
didn't get what they deserved?

44
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,541
[SOREY]
What do you mean?

45
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,583
[ROSE]
Who knows.

46
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,583
[SOREY] Hey, I'm making
a trip to Pendrago.

47
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,750
Apparently, they have
non-stop rain there.

48
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,416
I wanna figure out why.

49
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,791
I thought that maybe
you'd come along.

50
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,083
[ROSE]
Oh, did you now?

51
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,125
I don't suppose that's
because if I came along,

52
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,083
then Dezel probably would, too?

53
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,833
[sighs]

54
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,791
Well, count me out.

55
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,166
I've got things to take care of.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,541
So, how'd it go?

57
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,208
[SOREY] It's crazy how
fixated Dezel is on Rose.

58
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,083
I wonder what that's about.

59
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,583
I'd guess it probably
has something to do

60
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,875
with her adoptive father, Brad.

61
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,750
It seemed like Dezel
really cared about him.

62
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,083
Maybe there's more
to her than we know.

63
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,333
The Rose we've seen is the
head of the Sparrowfeathers,

64
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,625
a merchant traveling the world.

65
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,541
Always upbeat
and happy, carefree.

66
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,541
I always thought it was

67
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,291
a lot more like
irresponsibility.

68
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,958
Yeah, I guess you do
kinda have a point.

69
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,708
I shouldn't have said that!

70
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,958
[MIKLEO] The people here
really do seem to trust her.

71
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,833
That was a surprise.

72
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,958
So, that's the Rose we know.

73
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,291
But maybe Dezel knows
a different side of her.

74
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,041
Looks like they're leaving.

75
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,291
Yeah.

76
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,958
What do you say?
Keep to the plan?

77
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,250
I'll follow Rose.

78
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,833
[SOREY]
And I'll go with Groodman.

79
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,583
I did promise to travel
to Pendrago with him.

80
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,125
Thanks for this.

81
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,916
I'm always here for you.

82
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,333
Here we go.

83
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,833
Uh--

84
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,125
I figured you could
use some help with Dezel.

85
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,375
We can't have "poor Mibo"
getting hurt, can we?

86
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,375
You can stop staring at me now.

87
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,666
Thanks, Edna.

88
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,250
Any idea where the
Sparrowfeathers might be headed?

89
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,958
[MIKLEO] Well, the load's light,
so she's probably out to buy.

90
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,125
[EDNA] No, there's
more to it than that.

91
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,791
I can't put my finger on it,
but something's off here.

92
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,958
Yeah. I haven't
seen Dezel either.

93
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,291
[DEZEL]
Sorry. Were you looking for me?

94
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,625
[MIKLEO]
Yeah, actually.

95
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,791
[DEZEL] The Shepherd
didn't come with you?

96
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,250
We're worried about
Pendrago, too,

97
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,125
so that's where he's heading.

98
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,875
[DEZEL] "Too?" meaning
you have other worries.

99
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,458
The biggest being you.

100
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,291
That was some show
the other day.

101
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,750
We can't leave you
alone after that.

102
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,458
Me, huh?

103
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,291
You really don't get it, do you?

104
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,791
What do you mean by that?

105
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,833
[DEZEL]
You'll find out soon enough.

106
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,166
[SOREY]
So, you think war is inevitable?

107
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,041
Just another part
of being human.

108
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,125
It's natural for the
strong to rule the weak,

109
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,750
and war is how we
distinguish between the two.

110
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,041
Will you feel that
way if you lose?

111
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,791
I never lose,
so that's not an issue.

112
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,041
And is that why you have
Sergei under arrest?

113
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,791
'Cause you think he's weak?

114
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,333
No, it's not.
You don't understand.

115
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,750
Sergei, well...

116
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,958
He claims it's his duty
to protect the Shepherd himself.

117
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,041
Since his superior and mine
aren't on the best of terms,

118
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:11,083
it isn't a good idea
to have him here at all.

119
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,875
But I have a soft spot.

120
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,958
I could have ignored him,
but I brought him along instead.

121
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,791
She's here to meet someone.

122
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,416
I wonder who.

123
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,916
Let's go and find out.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,375
Standing here won't
do us any good.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,791
Time for you two to see
what's behind the facade.

126
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,041
The truth.

127
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,125
He's tucked away
in a remote castle.

128
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,291
It's perfect.

129
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,791
[ROSE] And you're
positive that it's him?

130
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,708
Yes, we're absolutely certain.

131
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,333
It's Prince Konan.

132
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,750
You ready?

133
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,666
[ROSE]
Yeah. I am.

134
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's take him out.

135
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,458
What was that?

136
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,750
Tell us what Rose
is trying to do.

137
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,166
[DEZEL] She's trying
to fulfill her mission.

138
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,708
Not as Rose, leader of the
Sparrowfeathers, but as Rose,

139
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,833
leader of the Scattered Bones.

140
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,791
They're planning
an assassination.

141
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,041
Assassination?

142
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,625
She was still a child
when she learned to kill.

143
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,375
But she's a quick study.

144
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,375
She fought to defend the weak,

145
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,083
as a member of the Windriders,

146
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,791
the predecessor to
the Scattered Bones.

147
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,000
[DEZEL] When Rose kills,
it isn't a murder.

148
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,000
It's an execution based on
what Brad would want,

149
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,541
something she sees
as a necessary evil.

150
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,416
Between her work with
the Scattered Bones

151
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,541
and her success with
the Sparrowfeathers,

152
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,833
it's hard not to be impressed.

153
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,833
[ROSE] You ever think
we're going to hell

154
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,625
for the things we do?

155
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,458
[EGUILLE]
Sure, all the time.

156
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,208
Except then I think,
"The people we kill deserve it,

157
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,958
and they're gonna end up
in an even deeper hell

158
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,416
than we are, so it's all right."

159
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,791
I guess that's
one way to look at it.

160
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,416
[DEZEL] We're going after
a very special target.

161
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,333
The man who betrayed Brad,
who murdered him.

162
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,416
More than anybody else,
he must be killed.

163
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,708
[gasps]

164
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,166
"Immediate justice over
unreachable ideals."

165
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,333
That was the motto
that always drove Brad,

166
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,958
why he went after those
who preyed on the weak.

167
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,500
But then someone convinced him
his ideals could be reached.

168
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,708
That person was Prince Konan.

169
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,166
The Windriders
had become a force

170
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,083
great enough to influence
an entire continent.

171
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,625
The prince asked them
to assist him in a war.

172
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,708
He lured them in,
promising, in return,

173
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,541
a swift end to the war.

174
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,500
And that wasn't all.
As a guarantee,

175
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,916
he pledged to marry Rose.

176
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,291
[MIKLEO]
Well? What happened?

177
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,583
It was a great victory,

178
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,791
but one achieved at
the cost of many lives.

179
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,583
And then he betrayed
them, didn't he?

180
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,916
[DEZEL]
That's right.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,666
Once they had served
their purpose,

182
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,333
he was only too happy
to turn on them.

183
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,333
The man is a monster.

184
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,583
There are some people
who deserve to be killed.

185
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,166
Monster or not,
I don't think anyone

186
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,291
deserves to be killed.

187
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,541
Edna?

188
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,500
[EDNA]
I'm going to let Sorey know.

189
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,875
Must the weak always
be helpless and obedient

190
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,416
to those who abuse power?

191
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,041
This way of life is the only
one Rose has ever known,

192
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,875
so what right do you have
to tell her to give it up?

[EDNA]
Mibo?

I'll go tell Sorey

Is something wrong?

00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,583
It's Mikleo. I heard his voice.

[SCATTERED BONE 17A]
We know which room

202
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,125
in the castle is his.

203
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,875
He's guarded at all times
by approximately ten men.

204
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,916
We never kill anybody
other than the target.

That's our vow as
the Scattered Bones.

206
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,166
Then we'll just
have to find a time

when the prince's guard
isn't at his side.

208

We've been waiting years
for this opportunity.

We will take him out.

Yeah, Prince Konan
is going to die.

It's time for my revenge.

Come on. Let's find him.

And what of the shipment

that was intended for Hyland?

[PRIEST 17A] Wrapped and sent

a lot of buyers for this batch.

220
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,333
This is a special formula,

00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,125
one that contains no
additives whatsoever.

222

You'll find no buyer

Unlike the pure stuff,
it's highly addictive.

Supposedly, the formula
is a closely guarded secret,

known only by a small

No matter what he did!

319
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:04,083
[panting, grunting]

320
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,833
[yelps]

321
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,750
[SOREY]
Wait! Stop!

322
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:15,125
Rose, no!

323
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,916
It's Sorey...


324
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,041
...and Mikleo's...


325
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,000
[BOTH]
...one minute cooking show!


326
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,291
Today's dish: a frozen
favorite prepared


327
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,875
by none other
than Master Mikleo!


328
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,250
Hi, I'm Mikleo,
Seraph of water.


329
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,041
Today we will be
making shaved ice.


330
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,250
Since we're not busy
fending off any hellions,


331
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,708
we'll avoid sharp icicle summons
go for a square block instead.


332
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:15,583
Good plan.


333
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,083
We don't wanna poke ourselves.


334
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,250
Do you have any
advice for people


335
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,916
who can't use Seraphic Artes?


336
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,208
Well, you can try making
friends with a water Seraph


337
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,250
or find yourself a nice glacier.


338
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,958
Then either get your
new friend to help


339
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:29,125
or use your weapon of choice
to shatter the ice.


340
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,666
And, if that's too much trouble,


341
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,666
you can always go
to the store instead.


342
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,583
Add a little syrup
and you're done


343
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,750
It's so easy!


344
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,000
Next week:


345
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,625
Miss Edna will teach us
how to make dog food!


346
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,833
Look forward to it!


347
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:40,791
[EDNA] All right, boys,
stop playing around


348
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,750
and do the preview properly.


349
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,916
Next week: "Justice at
Hand rather than Ideal


350
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,041
beyond One's Reach."


351
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,291
Look forward to it.


352
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,291
I don't mind cooking
something, though.


353
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,041
[BOTH] I don't think
I'm gonna be hungry.
