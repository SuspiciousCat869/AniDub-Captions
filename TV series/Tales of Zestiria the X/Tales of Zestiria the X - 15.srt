Is that...?

00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,333
It's Rose!

00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,041
Sorey.

00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,416
Let's go.

her, we should hurry.

Sorry, guys!

No you don't!

[SERGEI]
Put it down, Groodman.

11
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,166
This isn't about
politics right now!

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,791
It's always about politics.

13
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,375
Now move!

14
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,291
Don't do this.

Listen to me. Leave him to us.

16
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,791
If we don't intervene,
Dezel will be consumed.

17
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,750
We have to get to him before
he's swallowed by malevolence.

Trust us, Sorey,
we know what we're doing.

This is the best way.

All right, then.
Be careful, everybody.

It's Dezel.

He's the one responsible
for this, isn't he?

28
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,333
Yeah. It's him.

to stop him now.

30

Tell us why you're doing this.

If we don't understand,
we can't help.

[DEZEL]
I don't have to explain myself.

34
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,333
Don't get in my way.
If you do, you'll regret it.

[ROSE] No, but I can
feel their presence.

39
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,083
Rose, I need you to
tell me what's going on.

40
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,375
If we know why he is doing this

41
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,458
then we might be
able to stop him.

Well, what d'you wanna know?

53
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,458
[SOREY]
Why did you do this?

54
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,333
[DEZEL] What, you mean trying
to destroy the cathedral?

55
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,375
[SOREY]
Yeah.

56
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,958
[DEZEL]
What's that old saying?

57
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,208
"No evil deed goes unpunished."

58
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,833
And doling out
punishment is your job?

59
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,500
[DEZEL]
Heh.

60
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,041
You could say that.

61
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,791
Years ago, I spent some time
with this group of mercenaries.

62
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,541
Men who called themselves
the Wind Riders.

63
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,458
Their leader was a guy
named Brad, and I liked him.

64
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,875
He travelled the continent,

65
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,000
fighting wherever
there was need.

66
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,916
Under his leadership, the group
became something respectable.

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,250
Not that it was easy.

68
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,750
Times were tough and all that.

69
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,833
Theft and murder were
commonplace occurrences.

70
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,375
But Brad did well.
Expanded his business.

71
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,166
He sold everything
from food to weapons,

72
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,000
and fought in wars
all across the world.

73
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,416
A real jack-of-all-trades.

74
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,041
He was a dreamer,

75
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,166
I think that's what
I liked the most.

76
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,458
But even though he always
had an eye on the future,

77
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,000
he never lost sight
of the present.

78
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,708
He believed that
immediate justice

79
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:57,458
took precedence over possibly
unattainable ideals.

80
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,916
Brad was always fighting
for the underdog.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,250
One day, he found a little girl
wandering the battlefield.

82
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,666
Rose was so small.
She was all alone.

83
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,458
He had no wife,
but he took Rose in

84
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,458
and looked after her as his own.

85
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,250
She went everywhere he went,

86
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,250
and he taught her
everything he knew.

87
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:22,750
She inherited his
determination. His will.

88
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,625
And now, that little
girl grew up

89
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,166
to be more than I ever expected.

90
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,708
If she ever needs
something, I'l be there.

91
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,208
I'll do anything that she asks.

92
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,125
[SOREY]
What happened to him?

93
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,708
[DEZEL]
He died.

94
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,083
Dezel, you there?

95
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,083
I feel you more
strongly than before.

96
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,750
How long have you been there?

97
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,916
Forever.

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,333
[ROSE]
Oh.

99
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,333
[laughs]

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,375
[ROSE giggles]

101
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,666
They found us.

102
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,291
[SOREY]
Huh?

103
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,500
[SOREY]
Oh. Looks like they did.

104
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,708
Guess sometimes it's
tough being popular.

105
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,666
What would you like to do?

106
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,916
That's easy.

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,333
We're going to talk and
hope they understand.

108
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,666
I don't wanna betray Sergei.

109
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,791
Still searching for me?

110
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,666
I was.

111
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,083
There's been a lot of commotion,
and I get the feeling

112
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,666
you have something
to do with it, Shepherd.

113
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,750
Honestly, I'm not sure how well
I can explain what happened.

114
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,916
Not everything in this world
is plain to the human eye.

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,166
Any chance that's a
sufficient answer for ya?

116
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,291
Were you flexing your muscles

117
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,583
to give us a show of
your great powers?

118
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,083
[SOREY] Mm-mm. That's
not really what I do.

119
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,125
And the Shepherd isn't
almighty, you know.

120
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,458
What happened to Sergei?

121
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,208
He is under arrest.

122
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,916
What'd he do?

123
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,083
[GROODMAN] Contacted the
Shepherd without authorization.

124
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,416
You had other plans for me?

125
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,041
[GROODMAN] If your powers
are indeed as great

126
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,625
as the legends say,
we would be foolish

127
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,958
not to welcome you to Rolance.

128
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,458
Welcome me?

129
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,833
By getting me to chase out
Sergei and the imperial family?

130
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,166
Or maybe by using me
to start another war.

131
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,791
[GROODMAN]
Are you going to cooperate?

132
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,958
I don't think I will.

133
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,625
Although, I will go to Pendrago.

134
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,500
You can take me if you want.

135
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:26,375
Oh, and if you don't mind,
please let Sergei go.

136
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,583
All right, see you tomorrow!

137
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,125
[GROODMAN]
Come back here!

138
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,833
Honestly, some people
just have no manners.

139
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,125
Seriously, what were
you thinking?

140
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,583
That I was gonna end up
in Pendrago anyway.

141
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, I guess so.

142
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,833
[SOREY]
I think, as Shepherd,

143
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,041
I need to understand people.

144
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,166
You know? To really see
inside their hearts.

145
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,208
[MIKLEO]
Doesn't it matter at all

146
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,333
what kind of people they are?

147
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,083
[SOREY] It's taken a long time,
but I think I'm finally

148
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:05,791
starting to understand
what malevolence is.

149
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,666
[SOREY] But even once I
understand it completely,

150
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,583
what do I do then?

151
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,541
It's something I've been
wondering about for a while now.

152
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,875
What am I supposed
to do as the Shepherd?

153
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,875
Is it all just
purifying hellions?

154
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,333
I understand how important
those things are, I do.

155
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,375
But, still, I'm starting to
think that being Shepherd

156
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,416
means more than just
putting out the same fires

157
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,291
over and over.

158
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,458
That may be so,

159
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,458
but you have to find
your own answers.

160
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:38,000
[SOREY] It seems like everywhere
we go, people are fighting.

161
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,041
First in Hyland, now in Rolance.

162
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,541
There's fighting within
the two kingdoms

163
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,125
as well as between them.

164
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,208
My dream was to see
Seraphim and humans

165
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,791
living together, but right now,
humans can't even

166
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,000
live beside their own kind

167
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,708
without turning to
anger and bloodshed.

168
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,208
Ridding the world
of all fighting

169
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,583
seems like an
insurmountable task.

170
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,625
But you're gonna try?

171
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,541
I need to do it my own
way, just like I always have.

172
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,916
[DEZEL]
I'd kill them for you, Rose.

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,333
If you ask, I'd kill
every person in the world

174
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,458
who has used their power
to hurt somebody else.

[SOREY, LAILAH gasp]

176
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,166
Hello there, Shepherd.

177
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,708
I hope you're well.

178
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,083
[SOREY]
Good to see you.

179
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,166
Are you going somewhere?

180
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,375
[MAVIN]
Always.

181
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,166
It's my job to move
throughout the world,

182
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,375
learning new information
and passing it on

183
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,166
to the people I
meet along the way.

184
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,166
The life of a storyteller.

185
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,416
[MAVIN]
Yes.

186
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,875
Now do me a favor and
listen to the ramblings

187
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,666
of an old man one more time.

188
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,375
Before, I had
mentioned a question

189
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,083
that the previous Shepherd
could never answer.

190
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,583
You remember what that was?

191
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,875
He told you:

192
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,041
"Bad thoughts dwell inside
every person's heart

193
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,916
and if we call those
thoughts malevolence,

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,416
then it exists within me, too.

195
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,250
The concept of malevolence
is so immense,

196
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,958
I don't know how my mind
could comprehend it.

197
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,208
There are many questions,

198
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,708
and the answers are unclear.

199
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,083
For example, if I do
harm to one person

200
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:30,416
in order to save many others,
is that a malevolent act?

201
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,333
Do we all embrace
malevolence the moment

202
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,708
we admit the existence
of a necessary evil?"

203
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,708
[gasps] That's right. You
remember every word exactly.

204
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,708
Of course I remember.
How could I not?

205
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,250
[MAVIN]
The Shepherd was struggling,

206
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,375
as we all do at some point,

207
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,000
searching for a philosophy
to guide him on his path.

208
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,833
I've lived a little bit
of life myself, you see,

209
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,875
and there is something
I've learned.

210
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,958
Life is full of questions, many
of which don't have answers,

211
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,791
but that's okay, because
having all the answers

212
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,291
isn't what's important.

213
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,500
What's important
is to live honestly.

214
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,208
To be honest with yourself.

215
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,416
Accept that what
is right, is right.

216
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,791
And what is wrong, is wrong.

217
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,125
And what's good, is good.

218
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,625
Ya see?

219
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,583
Sounds like a pretty good
principle to live by.

220
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,916
Goodbye, Shepherd.

221
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,291
Thank you, Mavin. Travel safe.

222
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,416
[SOREY] What's important
is living honestly.

223
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,791
[LAILAH] That seems like
good advice for anybody.

224
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,458
Mavin is a wise man.

225
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,791
[EDNA] Maybe, but it
seems kinda obvious.

226
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,208
Let's call it like it is.

227
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,791
Sorey has probably never lied
once in his entire life.

228
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,833
I bet he wouldn't know how.

No matter what happens,
I can honestly say

00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,708
that's how I wanna
live my life.

I have much choice.

agreement, remember?

Oh, and speaking
of agreements.

Let's not forget Alisha!
I wonder how she's doing.

246
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,708
I hope she's okay.

247
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,125
I'm sure she's fine.

248

She's always been strong.

She is a determined one.

250

Even if she's just as
starry-eyed as Sorey.

Can you find her?

You should be able to

even across long distances.

All you need to do
is open your path.

No matter how far she is,

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,791
I thought any action
I took was justified

323
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,833
as long as it preserved them.

324
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,500
And now look.

325
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,250
How many of my people
have I doomed

326
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,625
in the name of those ideals?

327
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,750
I can't keep asking this of you.

328
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,875
You deserve better that
that from your princess.

329
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,041
None of this madness
is your fault!

330
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,958
[SHILLER]
We don't blame you at all.

331
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,208
[ALISHA]
Over time,

332
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:09,166
I've lost many of the
people who followed me.

333
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,958
Each of them was precious.

334
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,875
I should not have
let any of them die.

335
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,208
What now?

336
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,541
How would Sorey deal with this?

337
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,708
I'll just have to
become stronger, then.

338
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,291
[ALISHA]
I must become stronger.

339
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,250
As a squire, and as a princess.

340
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,416
Everyone, listen to me.

341
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,958
My resolve wavered for a moment,
but I won't let doubt defeat me.

342
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,333
In order to honor the
people we have lost,

343
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,583
I must continue to fight.

344
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,000
I am a princess of Hyland.

345
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,833
It is my duty to lead
and protect this country.

346
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,833
So, please, I ask that
you lend me your support.

347
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,791
You've always had mine.

348
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,625
And mine, too.

349
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,333
Thank you all.

350
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:18,166
Before sunrise, we will
depart for Ladylake.

351
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,833
It's time to reclaim Hyland.

352
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,291
Hey, Dezel you there?


353
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,416
Yeah.


354
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,416
How long have you been there?


355
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,916
Forever.


356
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,125
And by forever you mean when?


357
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,125
I mean forever.


358
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,166
'Kay, so how about
when I was 15?


359
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,625
I was there.


360
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:11,708
And when I was ten?


361
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,958
Still there.


362
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,291
All right, prove it.


363
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,958
I cut one of my fingers badly,
which one was it?


364
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,708
Your left index finger
at the second joint.


365
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:20,833
Yep, got that one.


366
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,166
I had a phobia as a kid.


367
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,958
What was it I was
too afraid to touch?


368
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:24,750
Insects.


369
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:25,958
Got that one, too!


370
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,208
Peter Piper picked a peck...


371
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,458
...of pickled peppers.


372
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,625
Well done, Dezel.
Very impressive.


373
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,750
Hmph. I can answer any
question you've got for me.


374
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,041
What's the title
of the next episode?


375
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,500
"Revenge," look forward to it.


376
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,000
Here's one: What's the
first thing I ever cooked?


377
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,333
Some form of dog food.


378
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,250
Take that back! It was curry.


379
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,291
No, that was
definitely dog food.


380
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,583
It was curry!


381
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,833
No, it was dog food.


382
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:49,958
Curry, curry, curry!


383
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,916
Dog food, dog food, dog food!
