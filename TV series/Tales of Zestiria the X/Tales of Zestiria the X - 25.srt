162
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,208
Thank you, everyone.

163
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,416
Lailah, you did so well.

164
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,333
You should be proud
of Shepherd Sorey.

165
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,500
[EDNA]
Mibo.

166
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,916
[MIKLEO]
There's no time for sadness.

167
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,791
Sorey gave us a job to do.

168
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,458
The world is gonna
need our guidance.

169
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,208
Let's do this for him.

[knock]

171
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,083
Hello, Master.

172
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,000
Princess, everything is
ready for your arrival.

173
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,125
She's no longer a Princess,
Shiller. Remember?

174
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,125
Right. I'm sorry.

175
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,500
Don't worry. It's kinda
hard to break the habit.

176
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,208
Queen Alisha.
Are you almost ready?

177
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,916
Yes.

178
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,583
Ready, Master.

179
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
[ALISHA]
Are you sure this is proper?

180
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,291
Making Rolance come to
us for the ceremony?

181
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,416
It'll be fine.

182
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,875
Emperor Doran himself expressed
the wish to visit Ladylake.

183
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,250
He said he looked
forward to seeing

184
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,500
the famed City of Water.

185
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,583
In fact, coming here was
Lord Sergei's recommendation.

186
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,333
I don't think they'll
have any complaints.

[applause]

188
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,875
[ALISHA] I cannot
express how thankful I am

189
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,291
that we are able to
make this day a reality.

190
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,791
We have come a long way,

191
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,250
but there is still
much work to be done.

192
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,125
Remember the legend
of the Shepherd,

193
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,041
and the dedication
of the Seraphim.

194
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:09,083
[applause]

195
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,541
Go forth!

196
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,208
Spread the word as
we work together

197
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:27,458
to build a better life for
everyone in this world.

198
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,375
The Shepherd's will
is in our hearts!

199
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:35,416
[applause, cheering]

200
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,083
[BOTH chuckle]

201
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,875
[LAILAH] This is where
our journey will begin.

202
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,916
In Camlann, the Origin Town.

203
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,083
Ready to go, Shepherd?

204
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,333
[ZAVEID]
You're always eating these days.

205
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,250
With the constant offerings,
what's a girl to do?

206
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,083
You don't have to eat
everything, you know.

207
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,791
People expect a
tangible blessing

208
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,708
when the offerings disappear.

209
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,750
You're setting those
expectations pretty high.

210
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,625
But it's tasty.

211
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,375
[ZAVEID] You never used
to care about food.

212
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,166
Well, what can I say?

213
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,541
That journey to the northern
lands taught me a thing or two.

214
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,791
Yeah, all right.

215
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,708
I guess it's just further
proof that relations

216
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,750
between humans and
Seraphim are improving.

217
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,541
Malevolence levels
are down, too.

218
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,750
And my brother's getting better.

219
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,833
The world's a bit brighter.

220
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,708
Life is almost peaceful.

221
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,833
That's another thing I learned.

222
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,875
[EDNA] What matters most is
having faith in yourself.

223
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,833
Thank you, Sorey.

Careful now! You wouldn't wanna
frighten anyone. Right, Eizen?

226
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,333
Welcome home.

[EGUILLE]
Hm?

Hey, Rose.

234
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,666
How's it looking?

235
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,458
Good.

236
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,708
We've got plenty to sell,

237
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,666
and all of it seems to
be pretty high-quality.

238
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,291
[chuckles]

239
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,833
Wanna bite?

240
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,666
Hey, would you mind if I
took a few of these with me?

241
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,083
A friend and I are
gonna make dinner.

242
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,958
You're terrible at this.

243
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,333
Hey! I'm doing my
best, you know.

244
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,250
It's not pretty,
but it'll taste good.

245
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,125
[ROSE] Yeah, well, that's
only because I know

246
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,000
where to buy the
best ingredients.

247
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,125
[ALISHA] You know,
it's not like your dish

248
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,958
is some kind of work of art.

249
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,791
At least I did better than you.

250
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,291
If you believe that,
you're crazy.

251
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,916
[EGUILLE] I don't think
this is an argument

252
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,333
either of you can win.

253
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,750
From the looks of what you've
put there on the table,

254
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,625
you both might want to take
some cooking classes.

Did you hear the latest news?

00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,250
Ian got dumped again!

Shut up, Shiller!

259
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,291
Apparently he couldn't
handle being with a girl

260
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,291
who's stronger than he is.

261
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,000
If he's that insecure,
I don't want him anyway!

262
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,791
Well, honestly, I'd
run away from a girl

263
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,000
wielding a chicken
like that, too.

[EGUILLE sighs]

265
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:38,125
All right, Shiller!
You asked for it!

[BOTH chuckle]

267
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,333
[ALISHA] Oh, hey,
I meant to tell you.

268
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,208
I saw Mikleo the other day.

269
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,916
[ROSE]
Yeah? How was he?

270
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,458
Good.

271
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:53,166
He's been traveling around,
as usual. Exploring the ruins.

272
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,666
He wants to see
as many as possible

273
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,750
so he can brag to Sorey.

274
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,333
Pursuing the past is
still his passion.

275
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,500
[ROSE] I guess some
things never change.

276
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,375
So, I see you're still
carrying that around.

277
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,875
The book.

Yes.

Always.

[ROSE] Are you thinking
about going back out

281
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,958
on another journey?

282
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,916
[ALISHA] When I first met Sorey,
I told him my dream.

283
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,333
That I wanted to travel the
world exploring the ruins.

284
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,708
It's a dream all readers of
<i>The Celestial Record</i> share.

285
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,541
A lot has changed for me,
but that never will.

286
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,083
Good, I'm glad.

00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,458
Queen or not, you'll always
be Princess Alisha to me.

We've been through
a lot together.

290
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,250
That's an understatement.

291
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,666
The book's gotten longer.

292
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,500
Someone must've
added some chapters.

[ROSE chuckles]

00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,916
Well, you gonna let me see?

Sure.

When I grow up,

298
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,791
I wanna be the Shepherd so I
can travel all over the world.

299
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,958
Not me. I wanna
become a Seraph!

300

Don't be dumb. You can't
just "become" a Seraph.

00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,500
You don't know that!
Maybe I can.

Why would you want to?
The Shepherd is stronger.

I wish he was here to see this.

Don't worry about it.

Lord agreement is still valid.

would come! I knew it!

visit a lot. Thanks for that.

00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,958
[MIKLEO]
Sorey!

322
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,208
It's really good to
see you, Mikleo.

323
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,666
You too.

324
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,333
[MIKLEO] If you're here,
then you must've succeeded.

325
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,416
Where's Heldalf?

326
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,833
[SOREY] In a town where
no one knows him.

327
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,625
He said he wanted to
start over from scratch.

328
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,291
[MIKLEO]
So you were able to purify him.

329
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,958
What are you gonna do now?

330
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,291
[SOREY] I was thinking
about going back to Elysium.

331
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,291
[MIKLEO]
Yeah?

332
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,791
I wonder if Gramps
is doin' okay.

333
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,875
Gramps is a tough old guy.

334
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,291
Good point.

335
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,958
Hey, do you think we could
make a detour on our way?

336
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,125
There's an interesting ruin
around here I wanna check out.

337
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,000
So? Race ya?

338
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,541
Only if you're ready for
me to beat you there.

339
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,916
[SOREY]
Not a chance!

340
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm totally gonna
win this time!

341
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,666
[MIKLEO laughs]

342
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,666
[SOREY laughs]

343
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,625
Or better yet,
let's go together.

344
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,000
Sounds good.

345
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,000
Luzrov Rulay!

346
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,166
[SOREY]
Here we go!

347
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,416
You're a lot stronger
than I remember, Mikleo.

348
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,291
[MIKLEO]
So are you, Sorey.

349
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,583
Good to be back.

350
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,708
I'm really here!

351
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,250
At last!
