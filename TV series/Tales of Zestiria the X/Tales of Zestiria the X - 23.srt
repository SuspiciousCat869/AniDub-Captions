1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,208
That bastard.

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,333
You allowed her to
become a dragon?

3
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,583
Symonne put her trust in you!

4
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,750
You truly are a monster!

5
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,458
It is done.

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,958
I make my way to the
center of the world

7
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,791
to begin the end of all things.

8
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,541
Well? How is she?

9
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,625
[DEZEL]
Unconscious, but alive.

10
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,750
[SOREY]
Thank goodness.

11
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,000
All right, everyone!
Let's head down the mountain.

12
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,833
We're going after
the Lord of Calamity!

13
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,083
Is she doing any
better than before?

14
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,583
[DEZEL]
Not really.

15
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,500
She still has tremors
all over her body.

16
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,000
[ZAVEID]
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,250
I assumed she must've improved
since you'd left her side.

18
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,833
[DEZEL] Just for a moment. Sorey
is giving her his blessing now.

19
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,166
I came to ask a favor of you.

20
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,083
A favor?

21
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,541
Your gun.

22
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,666
I need to take it off your
hands and slay some dragons.

23
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,250
The next battle we face
may well be our last,

24
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:07,041
but we can't hope to purify
every one of those monsters

25
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,416
and still have the strength
to reach the Lord of Calamity.

26
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,041
We only able purify
the dragon at Ladylake

27
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,750
by the skin of our teeth.

28
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,375
It took everything we had.

29
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,166
I understand what you're
saying, but look--

30
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,750
[DEZEL]
Sorey is strong.

31
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,333
In time he may even
be strong enough

32
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,583
to purify that many
dragons, but he isn't yet,

33
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,666
and we don't have the
luxury of waiting.

34
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,666
We must face them now.

35
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,833
If we lose to the
Lord of Calamity,

36
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,416
he will consume
the entire world.

37
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,916
[DEZEL grunts]

38
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,000
[ZAVEID] Rose isn't the only
one who needs to recover.

39
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,375
You should get some rest, too.

40
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,958
[DEZEL]
I'm fine. I don't matter.

41
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,500
Don't say that.

42
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,750
Zaveid, please. I need that gun.

43
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,208
[DEZEL]
It's something Rose said.

44
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,541
Given the amount of
malevolence gathered here,

45
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,708
winning this battle could change
the course of the entire world.

46
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:06,416
How can we pass up
a chance like that?

47
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,791
More than anything,

48
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,875
I want her ideal world
to become a reality.

49
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,833
This isn't something
you're doing for yourself.

50
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,083
[DEZEL]
No.

51
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,333
[ZAVEID]
Take it.

52
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,791
Why are you stopping?

53
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:27,958
Wait.

54
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,958
[IAN]
He's dead.

55
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,250
[SHILLER]
What is he doing out here?

56
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,916
[IAN]
I don't know, but he's smiling.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,125
[SHILLER]
What should we do?

58
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,916
[IAN]
We can't just leave him.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,958
Let's see that he gets
a proper burial.

60
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,208
[SHILLER]
Agreed.

61
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:55,041
I didn't expect to see this.
A town so far north?

62
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,416
Melshio.

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,750
According to the <i>Record</i> ,
that was its name.

64
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,583
Beyond here is the
Kiraraus volcano

65
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,375
and that's where the
Earthpulse nexus is,

66
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,958
and where we'll find
the Lord of Calamity.

67
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,583
Apparently it used
to be a vibrant city,

68
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,125
but obviously no more.

69
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,625
[MIKLEO]
Now it's just ruins.

70
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:17,791
[GRIMOIRE]
No, not just ruins.

71
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,541
Though all of the humans have
been gone for some time.

72
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,416
[SOREY]
Who are you?

73
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,083
Grimoire, one of the Normin
Seraphim, Sir Shepherd.

74
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,250
[SOREY] How did you know
I was the Shepherd?

75
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,208
Don't look so surprised.

76
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,750
One doesn't get to be my age

77
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,000
without picking up
a thing or two.

78
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,708
And I know you've come here
to find the Lord of Calamity.

79
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,041
We did.

80
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,000
[GRIMOIRE] A blizzard really
isn't the best place

81
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,208
for a civilized conversation.

82
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,291
Why don't we go inside?

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,208
[ATAKK] I didn't think we'd find
you here after all this time,

84
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,250
Grimm, but I'm
sure glad we did!

85
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,291
It's like a miracle!

86
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,875
I'm relieved to see that all
of you survived, as well.

87
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,833
It must've been tough.

88
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,208
Can I ask you something?

89
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,666
[LAILAH]
Of course.

90
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,791
You've read this book of
Shepherd Michael's, haven't you?

91
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,166
I have.

92
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,333
What he describes about
the structure of the world,

93
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:16,083
about Seraphim, is all
of that really true?

94
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,416
[LAILAH]
To be specific,

95
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,375
you're asking about Innominat
and the Empyreans?

96
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,875
Right.

97
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,833
[LAILAH] Yes, as far as I know,
every word of it is true.

98
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,833
Michael certainly believed so.

99
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,708
Innominat and the Empyreans.

100
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,500
They are the highest
ranking of all Seraphim.

101
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,875
Once they were
worshiped by mankind.

102
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,041
Their temples lay at
the Earthpulse's nexus.

103
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,333
[SOREY] Somehow, I don't
think it's a coincidence

104
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,666
that's where the Lord
of Calamity's heading.

105
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,958
This book has me so confused.

106
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,833
I mean, it was Velvet's hatred

107
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,291
that started us on
this path, right?

108
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:54,333
Without her hate, this age of
chaos may never have begun.

109
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,625
In which case,
Artorius is to blame

110
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,291
for having attempted
to save the world

111
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,083
by sacrificing Velvet's brother.

112
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,208
Of course she would
hate him for that.

113
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,625
Except, as horrible
as what he did was,

114
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,583
he believed he was
saving thousands of lives

115
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,208
by taking one.

116
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,708
So in the end, which
of them was right?

117
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,000
Which of them was wrong?

118
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,958
A hard question.
What do you believe?

119
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,458
I don't know.

120
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,375
Just that if only they had
understood each other better,

121
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,125
things could've been different.

122
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,416
I don't wanna repeat
what came before,

123
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,208
but I'm not sure I know
yet how to avoid it.

124
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,791
You have come a long way,
and you've learned a great deal.

125
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,208
You don't know everything,

126
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,250
but your eyes and
heart are open.

127
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,208
Maybe that is enough.

128
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,125
I hope so.

129
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,500
[MIKLEO]
Hey, I bet you're pretty hungry.

130
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,833
Now that you mention it...

131
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:48,833
[MIKLEO]
How does soup sound?

132
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,208
It sounds great. Let's eat.

133
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,583
[ATAKK] So, even after
everything that's happened,

134
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,833
you still think there's
a future for us Normin?

135
00:07:56,916 --> 00:08:00,083
As long as we stick by
this Shepherd, yes, I do.

136
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,291
Well of course
we'll stick by him!

137
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,375
[chuckles]

138
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,250
[chuckles]

139
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,791
[SERGEI]
And that's what malevolence is.

140
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,375
So, what do you
make of all of it?

141
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,833
To be honest, it's a
bit hard to swallow.

142
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,541
Would you like some tea?

143
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,708
[SERGEI]
I would, thank you.

144
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,333
[GROODMAN]
Come, Sergei.

145
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,416
Is that any way for a
brave knight of Rolance

146
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,083
to drink his tea?

147
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,125
Let me show you.

148
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,250
[GROODMAN, BLACK NORMIN cough]

149
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:33,916
[OTHERS laughing]

150
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,708
That you, Alisha?

151
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,166
Yes. How are you?

152
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,666
I've been better.

153
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,291
Did the armatization
knock me out again?

154
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,666
[ALISHA]
That's right.

155
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,000
You spent a much longer time
fighting in armatus form

156
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,125
than I did.

157
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,916
It was impressive.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,750
Are you hungry?
We have some soup.

159
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,750
Not now, thanks.

160
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,666
[DEZEL] So tell me, you ever
asked yourself why we're here

161
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,708
or why Seraphim
should even exist?

162
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,250
[ZAVEID]
Sure, who hasn't?

163
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,708
I think the question first
crossed my mind 500 years ago.

164
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,875
[DEZEL] Of course it did.
With age comes wisdom.

165
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,541
Well, you manage to come
up with any answers yet?

166
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,416
Only more questions.

167
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,458
The humans used to pray to us.

168
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,833
We would bless them,

169
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,916
thus maintaining the
balance in the world.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,375
But is that truly
all there is to it?

171
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,166
We were born solely to
receive humans' prayers?

172
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,750
[EDNA] Idiot. Why even bother
thinking about that?

173
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,708
Comes from watching Rose.

174
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,791
She makes me wonder about it.

175
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,166
About what it means
to feel alive.

176
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,625
I'll don't know what
I'll do if she dies.

177
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,083
[SOREY]
Based on what it says here,

178
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,916
Velvet and her companions left
this place a thousand years ago.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,583
That's pretty incredible, huh?

180
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,666
Almost hard to believe.

181
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,208
Sorey,

182
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,875
do you really think you're
gonna be able to purify him?

183
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,250
I don't know.

184
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,208
I wish I could say, "Yes, I do."

185
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,833
The malevolence
was unbelievable.

186
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,791
I can't imagine how powerful
he is. It's kind of terrifying.

187
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,833
[SOREY]
Yeah.

188
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,125
So what happened to
Velvet after that?

189
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,625
Where'd she go?

190
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,750
No idea. The book
doesn't really say.

191
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,625
That's the last time
it mentions her.

192
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,916
Oh.

193
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,625
[DEZEL]
The way things are going,

194
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,916
she may not be able
to fight at all.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,041
[gasps]

196
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,375
With how slow her recovery is,

197
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,000
it may be best to
leave her here.

198
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,666
That might be a good idea.

199
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,500
[ROSE]
Over my dead body!

200
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,208
Rose, I--

201
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,375
Princess. Hand over that soup!

202
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,416
[ROSE growls]

203
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
[grunts]

204
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,166
[ROSE]
I might not be in great shape,

205
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,541
but don't even think
about abandoning me here!

206
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,625
I'm still gonna armatize, too!

207
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:07,083
We're going together, and
that's final. Understood?

208
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,208
[DEZEL laughs]

209
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,583
Fascinating!

210
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,041
I didn't think you were
capable of actual laughter.

211
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,208
[DEZEL]
I leave it to you, Rose.

212
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,333
All right, we stay together.

213
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,791
[ZAVEID]
Dezel, what are you planning?

214
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,208
[VELVET] Have you ever
wondered why birds fly?

215
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:56,958
It's simple, really. They fly
because they want to.

216
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,541
They need no other reason.

217
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:03,125
They remain among the
clouds until the day they die,

218
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,000
because it's where they belong.

219
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,208
Birds fly for themselves,

220
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,583
not because it's what somebody
else expects of them.

221
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,458
Follow your own path
and no one else's.

222
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,625
[gasps]

223
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,041
Was that...?

224
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,625
[ALISHA]
I don't understand.

225
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,833
Did you know him, Princess?

226
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,625
Yes. I'm shocked to see him.

227
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,083
Sorey.

228
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,708
Yeah.

229
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,625
[SOREY] From this point forward,
we will travel alone!

230
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,041
[ALISHA] Thank you all
for coming this far.

231
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,833
[ROSE]
We'll take it from here.

232
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,916
Good luck! You got this!

233
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,666
Stay sharp, now.

234
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,375
We're going to hold our own.

235
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,416
I know you all can't see them,

236
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,916
but we have five great
Seraphim friends at our side.

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,916
I could never have
done this without you.

238
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It was a long journey,
but we made it together.

239
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,875
You proved humans and
Seraphim can coexist.

240
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,583
For that... I am far more
grateful than I could ever say.

241
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,333
Thank you.

242
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,125
Now, let's go.

243
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,458
We'll purify the
Lord of Calamity

244
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,166
and rid the world
of his darkness.

245
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,625
[ROSE]
What is that?

246
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,416
[DEZEL] It's like a
path of malevolence.

247
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,083
I guess they're sending
us an invitation.

248
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,291
[gasps]

249
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,958
[ALISHA]
Dragons!

250
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,666
We're surrounded!

251
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,083
All right. Everyone ready?

252
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,458
Do you really have to ask?

253
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,791
[DRAGON roars]

254
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,500
Where did that one come from?

255
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,708
[DEZEL]
That one there, it's Symonne.

256
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,375
Just wait. It won't be long now.

257
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,458
I'm going to end this.

258
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,625
Listen, if you try to
purify all these dragons,

259
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,666
you won't have anything left
for the Lord of Calamity.

260
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,916
I know that.

261
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,166
Still, we have to get
past them to reach him,

262
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,000
so what choice do we have?

263
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,375
[DEZEL]
Well, about that...

264
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,833
...I have an idea.

265
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,583
Wait, that gun!

266
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,583
[EDNA gasps]

267
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,125
You gave him Sigfried?

268
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,500
Yeah. I asked him to
let me borrow it.

269
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,666
I can use this to finish
off the dragons.

270
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,083
[SOREY]
No!

271
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,375
[DEZEL] All that matters is
purifying the Lord of Calamity.

272
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,666
That's what will
save this world.

273
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,750
Think, Dezel!

274
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,208
All those dragons
used to be Seraphim.

275
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,791
It's too late.
There are too many.

276
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,166
There's still a chance
for us to purify them.

277
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,041
[DEZEL]
It won't work.

278
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,875
How do we know unless we try?!

279
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,958
[MIKLEO]
Hey, we got this.

280
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,583
We follow your lead, Sorey.

281
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,083
I've got you covered
on defense this time.

282
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,208
And I will handle
the malevolence.

283
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,958
[ROSE] Well, sounds like
they've made up their minds.

284
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,375
I'm with them on this.

285
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,875
Damn.

286
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,875
You're all a bunch of push-overs
when it comes to this guy.

287
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,500
Still, I was kinda expecting
something like this to happen.

288
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,375
[SOREY]
Dezel?

289
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,458
It won't matter what I say.

290
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,750
Nothing's going to convince
you to kill them, huh?

291
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:13,708
[SOREY]
No.

292
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,583
[DEZEL]
Tch.

293
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,875
All right then. I won't, either.

294
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,875
You have my word.

295
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,333
Hey, Zaveid!

296
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,500
Thanks anyhow.

297
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,750
[ZAVEID]
Don't mention it.

298
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,958
Well, Shepherd.
We'll do this your way.

299
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,000
None of the dragons will die.

300
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,708
I'll use my winds to blow
them out of the way.

301
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:42,166
The rest of you, just do
your best to stay clear.

302
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,708
Take care of Rose, okay?

303
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,500
Give her the world she deserves.

304
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,333
Hey, Rose? Ready to armatize?

305
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,333
You know it.

306
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,208
[DEZEL]
Heh.

307
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,250
[ROSE]
Lukeim Yurlin!

308
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,375
[DEZEL] Listen carefully.
We've only got one shot at this.

309
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,416
I want you to fly us into
the center of the dragons.

310
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,916
After that, just support me.

311
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,375
[ROSE]
The center, got it.

312
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,833
[DEZEL]
Now don't screw this up.

313
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,833
[ROSE] Who do you think
you're talking to?

314
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,916
Now, go!

315
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,375

Rose! Are you all right?

00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,875
[ROSE]
I can do this. I can!

320
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,875
There we go. The center!

321
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,166
This good enough?

322
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,708
[DEZEL]
It'll have to be.

323
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,708
This is quite a view.

324
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:11,000
[DEZEL]
Yeah, no kidding.

325
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,791
Listen.

326
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,958
It's my time to become the wind,

327
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,541
to release all the
power I have left.

328
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,583
Rose, thank you for everything.

329
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,208
[ROSE gasps]

330
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:28,000
What's wrong? No one
ever thanked you before?

331
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,500
Why are you thanking me?

332
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,166
And why now?

333
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,375
Something's wrong. Talk to me!

334
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,541
[DEZEL]
Look out!

335
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,833
[ROSE]
Damn it!

336
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,750
[DEZEL]
Do it!

337
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,791
[yells]

338
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:48,708
[yelling]

339
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,708
[ZAVEID]
Dezel.

340
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,791
[ROSE]
Dezel?

341
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,166
Dezel.

342
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,500
[DEZEL]
Rose.

343
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,958
Are those tears?

344
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,208
[ROSE]
No, of course not!

345
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,541
Heh.

346
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,000
Well, don't cry, okay?
Not on my account anyway.

347
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,625
You've only known me
for a few months.

348
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,333
But it feels longer.

349
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,166
[DEZEL]
For me it has been.

350
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,500
I've known you since you were
a scrawny thing only this tall.

351
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:56,166
So then... maybe... maybe
it's okay if I cry a little.

352
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,958
Do me a favor.

353
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,250
Make sure Sorey knows
it's not his fault I died.

354
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,958
That's important.

355
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:08,083
I was the one who chose
this path of my own will.

356
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,166
He shouldn't think
of me as a sacrifice.

357
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,333
Besides, I feel good right now.

358
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,916
All right.

359
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,416
[DEZEL] I'm leaving this
world soon, but before I do,

360
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,791
I need to confess
something to you.

361
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,083
The thing is, when
I possessed you...

362
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,791
...I forced Brad's
ideals on you.

363
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,250
I made you chase after
someone else's dream

364
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,416
and it led to a lot of
pain you didn't deserve.

365
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,458
What's worse is...
I used you... to kill.

366
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,208
[ROSE]
You've got it wrong.

367
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:43,000
However it may have started,
this is my dream now.

368
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,458
If you're the one who gave me
the opportunity to chase it,

369
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,291
well then, thank you.

370
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,791
You and Brad fought so long
and hard for this dream.

371
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,791
I couldn't be more proud
of everything you've done.

372
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:59,750
Dezel. I won't stop fighting
till our dream is realized.

373
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,041
I promise. Okay?

374
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,000
I know. You don't
know how to give up.

375
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,166
So thank you, Rose.

376
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,125
Yeah!

377
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,041
[chuckles]

378
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,500
[DEZEL]
Good luck out there.

379
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,833
Right.

380
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,750
And keep on keepin' on.

381
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,166
I will!

382
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,125
Dezel.

383
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:50,166
[ROSE crying]

384
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,166
How awful.


385
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,583
Poor Rose. Will she be okay?


386
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,041
Of course. You know
how strong Rose is.


387
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,458
She is going to
get through this.


388
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,583
Hm? Oh, Rose.


389
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,833
Sorey. I want to thank you.


390
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,458
Huh?


391
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,833
Thank you for agreeing
to make me your Squire.


392
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,000
Because if you hadn't,


393
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,666
I never would've been
able to see Dezel.


394
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,291
Of course.


395
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:28,666
I know it'll be like a
part of myself is missing,


396
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,750
but still, it feels like he's
looking out for me, ya know?


397
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:36,625
[wind blowing]


398
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,041
There, see?


399
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,958
It's like he's telling us all
to keep on keepin' on.


400
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,125
I can still hear the
sound of his voice.


401
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,416
He'll always be
with us, in the wind.


402
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,125
Please, Dezel, watch over us.


403
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,333
Now then.


404
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,625
Next time: "The Chosen Answer."
