1
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,916
Even colder here
than we expected.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
Yes, it is.

3
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,375
Everybody holding up all right?

4
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:30,458
The winter clothing Rose got us
is keeping us nice and warm.

5
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,833
Oh, yeah. They're
even kinda cute.

6
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,083
[ALISHA chuckles]

7
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,458
Please promise me
you'll never change, Ian.

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,583
[SOREY laughs]

9
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,750
Whether it's herbs,
weapons, or clothing,

10
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,666
the Sparrowfeathers
always manage to deliver.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,208
The gloves are lightweight
considering how warm they are,

12
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,166
but the stitching around the
seams does look a little sloppy.

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,541
We can make a list
of improvements

14
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:51,958
to give to the supplier.

15
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,291
This trip's a good chance
to test out new wares.

16
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,041
Maybe we can expand.

17
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,750
There's an idea!

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,625
So let's talk.

19
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:09,000
Are you planning to betray
the Lord of Calamity?

20
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,083
Not exactly.

21
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,833
If you were hoping to make
an ally of me, don't bother.

22
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,291
It would be a waste of time.

23
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,875
[DEZEL] You never told us
what we should call you.

24
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,166
I'm Symonne.

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,416
[DEZEL]
All right.

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,125
Then tell me, Symonne,

27
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:28,125
why are you accompanying us
on our trek to the north?

28
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:32,166
I just don't see it.
What's in it for you?

29
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,250
I would expect you
to understand.

30
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,500
I'd have to be
blind not to see

31
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,000
how attached you are
to that Rose girl.

32
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,250
You're barely separate
people anymore.

33
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,041
Are you trying to completely
erase her free will?

34
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,583
[grunts]

35
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,875
Leave it alone.

36
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,750
[chuckles]

37
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:53,833
Look. Beyond the mountain
lies the hell you seek.

38
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,666
It won't be long now.

39
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,291
Are you ready to begin?

40
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,500
I am, any time.

41
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,708
You're pretty quiet.
What're you doing in there?

42
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,208
[ROSE] Trying to concentrate
and you're not helping!

43
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,583
You have to project farther
outside of your body!

44
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,458
No! Not like that!

45
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,541
I don't understand what
I'm supposed to do!

46
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,625
I heard them call it something
like "visualization training."

47
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,916
Sounds like a lot of fun.

48
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,583
[DEZEL]
Good. That's it.

49
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,875
Keep expanding your
consciousness outward like that.

50
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,958
Remember that once I armatize,

51
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,208
I must concentrate
on being a weapon.

52
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:17,708
At that point, it's your job
to support and unleash me.

53
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,833
[ROSE]
I don't know if I can do this.

54
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,083
[DEZEL]
Keep the balance!

55
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,916
[ROSE]
I can't! I can't!

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,833
[DEZEL] Right and left.
Focus on both sides!

57
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,583
[screams]

58
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,791
[AYN FELICE]
Hm?

59
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,583
[DEZEL]
Maybe armatization is too tough.

60
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,083
Do you wanna give up trying?

61
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,416
I have to learn how to do this.

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,000
Unless I get stronger,

63
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:54,625
I won't be able to support Sorey
and then what good would I be?

64
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,791
I'll get it. We just
need to keep working.

65
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,750
[SHILLER]
Here ya go. Eat up.

66
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,166
Thanks a lot.

67
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,041
No problem. It's about all
we're good for right now.

68
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,541
Not true! You do a lot.

69
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,916
I've been thinking.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,666
Maybe I just don't have the
talent for armatization.

71
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,291
Trust me, I've been
thinking the same thing.

72
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,958
[ALISHA]
You're doing better than I am.

73
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,000
Do you know how long it takes me
to even move after training?

74
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,708
You get right up.

75
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,875
Don't compare yourself to Rose.

76
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,291
Dezel has lived inside
her body for a long time.

77
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,541
Merging isn't something
they have to think about.

78
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,583
It just comes naturally to them.

79
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,375
But you and I don't
have that history.

80
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,458
Does that mean
we'll never succeed?

81
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,416
That's not what
I'm trying to say.

82
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,375
Just why it'll be
a tougher road.

83
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,708
I don't know.

84
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,750
Armatization's starting
to scare me.

85
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,958
I feel so unsure
and off-balance.

86
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,333
Like I'm walking on a tightrope
carrying a giant prickleboar.

87
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:58,625
Exactly! Oh, yeah,
you put it perfectly!

88
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,666
Really?

89
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,583
[ROSE]
Mh-hm.

90
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,541
I'm starved. Let's eat.

91
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,666
[ALISHA]
Sounds good!

92
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,791
Humans are so high maintenance.

93
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,541
All this stopping and eating
throughout the day

94
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,541
takes too long.

95
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,125
All right, everyone,

96
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,500
since we're getting ready to
stave off the end of the world,

97
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,750
we made something special.

98
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,333
I sure hope you all
saved room for dessert!

99
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,666
Thanks, but... what is it?

100
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,000
[IAN]
It's pumpkin mousse.

101
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,791
Nice, warm flavors to
help take the chill off.

102
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,875
All right.

103
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,625
Delicious!

104
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,416
[laughs]

105
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,750
Try some. Open wide!

106
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,583
[gasps]

107
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,333
[MIKLEO] Incredible! I've
never had anything like this!

108
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,875
I know!

109
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,125
Melts in your mouth!

110
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,250
It's so good. I gotta
have another bite!

111
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,000
They made a ton. Why don't
you just go get your own dish?

112
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,750
How do I ask for
something from a person

113
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,416
who can neither see nor hear me?

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,750
[SOREY laughs]

115
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,708
How are you such
an enormous jerk?!

116
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,125
I mean, we're not perfect.

117
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,000
I wasn't expecting mousse
in the middle of nowhere!

118
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,916
Give my compliments to the chef.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,125
Do you know how to cook as
well as your soldiers do?

120
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,583
No, unfortunately.

121
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,125
I have training
in a lot of areas,

122
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,125
but I'm afraid that's
not one of them.

123
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,708
When we get back to Ladylake,

124
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,625
let's take cooking
classes together.

125
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,250
That sounds like fun.

126
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,666
[ROSE]
Wanna make it interesting?

127
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,000
[ALISHA]
Is everything a bet with you?

128
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,708
[SOREY] This <i>Celestial Record</i>
mentions some things

129
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,500
the other one leaves out.

130
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,041
There's information in here
about the northern region.

131
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,958
According to this, there
is a force responsible

132
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,125
for bringing structure
to the world,

133
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,458
and apparently, the source
of its power is right here.

134
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,125
There's so much about the
world we don't understand.

135
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,833
It's like the more we
learn, the less we know.

136
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,250
[SOREY]
Yeah.

137
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,541
It seems the source is connected
to the rest of the world

138
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,083
by something known
as the Earthpulse.

139
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,500
[MIKLEO]
The Earthpulse?

140
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,083
[SOREY]
That could be one reason

141
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,791
why the Lord of Calamity went
north, searching for this power.

142
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,875
I actually know a little
bit about the Earthpulse.

143
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,416
Its role is to maintain
the balance of the world.

144
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,375
It is possible that the
loss of that balance

145
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,291
is part of what gave rise
to this era of chaos.

146
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,083
Or so I've heard.

147
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,458
So what?

148
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,250
You think this source,
or the Earthpulse,

149
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,666
is drawing malevolence
to the north?

150
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,875
I'm not so sure about that.
I've been out here.

151
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,083
It is a harsh place, but that
doesn't mean it's evil.

152
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,291
Things are different now, but
it was once home to many people.

153
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,000
And they were no more malevolent
than any others I've met.

154
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,625
They didn't seem tainted
by anything that was here.

155
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,875
[ROSE] If spreading
malevolence is his goal,

156
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,458
wouldn't he be better off
in a big city somewhere?

157
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,833
Ladylake or Pendrago
seem like better targets

158
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,083
than the edge of the world.

159
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,791
I've wondered about that.

160
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,833
Yeah. It's a question
that needs answering.

161
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,250
If we're really
going to face him,

162
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,083
we need to know everything
he might throw at us.

163
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,458
[LAILAH]
Everyone,

164
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,750
we'll be going over the
mountain top tomorrow.

165
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,291
I think we should
call it a night.

166
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,166
Please, my Lord and master,
no matter how fiercely I call,

167
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,083
why do you not answer me?

168
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,458
Have you closed your
heart off completely?

169
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,166
Is it possible that...

170
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,833
...that you've become
malevolence itself?

171
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,625
My Lord!

172
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,625
[SYMONNE] You asked
before why I came to you,

173
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:29,166
why I told you my master's
plan and followed you here.

174
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,333
I'll tell you.

175
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:36,083
My Lord let the Shepherd escape
during that last battle.

176
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,916
I think it was perhaps because
he saw potential in him.

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,208
He looked at the Shepherd

178
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,583
and saw someone who
might be able to kill him.

179
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,041
You think he'd rather
kill rather than purify?

180
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,166
He's soft, but I do not
believe he's that soft.

181
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,791
[DEZEL] Then tell me this,
what is he doing out here?

182
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,125
Why did he come to the north?

183
00:09:56,208 --> 00:10:00,958
And you, Symonne, what do you
feel for the Lord of Calamity?

184
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,625
I don't see any need
for you to know that.

185
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,916
[DEZEL] But you're in
such a talkative mood.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,541
[SYMONNE] Interesting. So this
is what it's like to be soft.

187
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,250
[chuckles]

188
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,875
Goodbye, Dezel.

189
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,625
[DEZEL]
You can't just run away!

190
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,416
[SYMONNE] I hope you're able
to find your closure, too.

191
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,375
[DEZEL]
What do you mean?

192
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,000
[SYMONNE]
Think about it and you'll see.

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,166
[DEZEL]
So it's my fault.

194
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,166
If it wasn't for me,

195
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,916
you wouldn't have to go
through all of this pain.

196
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,541
[ROSE screams]

197
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,750
[SOREY]
Rose!

198
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,125
[ROSE]
What is this?

199
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,583
Malevolence is overflowing
across the mountain.

200
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,791
Ready, Mikleo?

201
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,291
Yeah, let's go.

202
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,625
Normin Power!

203
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,000
That was a nice one, Mikleo.

204
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,375
Everyone! We cross this
mountain right now!

205
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,708
Shiller, Ian,
reorganize the formation.

206
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,041
[SHILLER, IAN]
Right.

207
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,291
[DEZEL]
Damn it. I can't sense anything.

208
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,375
The fog is almost solid.

209
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,333
[EDNA]
There's nothing we can do.

210
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,458
Listen well. It's important
that you stick together.

211
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,166
If you split up, the
malevolence will take you!

212
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,458
[ALISHA] All squads,
tighten formation!

213
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,791
[NORMINS whimper]

214
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:40,958
[ROSE gasps]

215
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,958
[EDNA]
Human, Seraphim, Shepherd.

216
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,375
Together maybe we can fight
off this malevolence.

217
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,833
[SOREY gasps]

218
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,125
How's that possible?

219
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,833
There's so many.

220
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,416
Brothers. Sisters.

221
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,041
[ROSE]
The sky's full of them.

222
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,333
But dragons are hellionized
Seraphim, aren't they?

223
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,708
That's right.

224
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,875
[ROSE]
For there to be that many...

225
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,708
[EDNA]
Seraphim from all over the world

226
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,916
have become malevolent.

227
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,166
The stakes just got
a lot higher. Dammit.

228
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,291
If we lose this
fight, that's it.

229
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:30,041
[EDNA] If we lose ths fight,
the world is finished.

230
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,000
[sighs]

231
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,625
I don't know what I was
expecting, but not that.

232
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,708
Damn it all. What was I
thinking coming here anyway?

233
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,916
Since when do I have
a dog in this fight?

234
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,583
[SOREY]
They're coming!

235
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,791
What're we gonna do?
We can't purify them all.

236
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,791
Let's go!

237
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:57,750
Ready!

238
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,833
Fethmus Mioma!

239
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,875
[SOREY] Our target is
the Lord of Calamity.

240
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,958
We don't stop until
we reach him.

241
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,666
It shouldn't be long now.

242
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,500
With this many hellions,
he can't be far away.

243
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,750
[ALISHA]
Another attack's coming.

244
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,958
[SOREY]
Mikleo!

245
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,125
Yeah?

246
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,291
Now! Luzrov Rulay!

247
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,833

252
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,500
[ROSE] I can't just sit here.
I want to go in.

253
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,750
[DEZEL]
Armatization?

254
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,958
[ROSE]
Yeah. Sorry if I die.

255
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,208
[DEZEL] You can't apologize
if you're dead.

256
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,958
[ROSE] No kidding. That's why
I'm doing it ahead of time.

257
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,750
Now come on. They need us.

258
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,541
[DEZEL]
Tch. All right then.

259
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,541
Lukeim Yurlin!

260
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,208
[SOREY]
Rose!

261
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,166
[DEZEL]
How're you feelin'? You okay?

262
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,500
Yes!

263
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,666
We should fight, too.
Let's armatize!

264
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,416
Putting our lives on the line?
Such a reckless princess.

265
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,916
Although, to be honest,
I like that about you.

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,500
I'm heading to the front.

267
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,875
With all of us attacking,

268
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,250
hopefully we can
make an opening.

269
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,791
You two look after the squad.

This is the armatus.

Wow. I can feel
the power inside me.

00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,541

Let's show them it's strength.

275
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,750

[LUNARRE laughing]

278
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,041
[LUNARRE]
Why do they try so hard

279
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,291
when they have so little chance?

280
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,125
They really think they
can purify this world?

281
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,750
Why would they risk it all?
What will they gain?

282
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,416
Is it selflessness or
smug self-satsifaction?

283
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,916
Ha, ha.

284
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,166
Whatever it is, I think I'd
like to see how it feels.

[laughing]

286
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,000
I must be as crazy as
those idealistic fools

287
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,541
because I'm gonna clear
a path for them!

00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,541
[ROSE]
You betrayed us?

00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,875
Betrayed you?

And when did I ever
have your trust?

So very pathetic.

My Lord, I beg you.

Answer me please!

Can you truly not hear
my voice, even now?

305
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,583
How can that be possible?

306
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,916
Have you succumbed
to mere malevolence?

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,958
I cannot accept that!

308
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,750
Lord, hear me!

309
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:33,875
[HELDALF] Symonne, why do you
lament when you have succeeded?

310
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,916
You have brought
me the Shepherd.

311

[SYMONNE]
Yes, my lord.

00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,875
The hope of humankind,
the man you will crush,

313
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,416
he is yours for the taking.

314
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,333
Do you wish to see the
world drown in despair?

315
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,708
[SYMONNE]
Yes, Master.

316
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,625
[HELDALF laughing]

317
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:56,583
Can it be that he
exploited me as well?

318
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,625
My master is truly ruthless.

319
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,916
If this is what you
want from me, Master,

320
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,583
my body is yours to use.

321
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,750
Your desires are mine.

322
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:10,083
I willingly give you
whatever you wish to take.

323
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,750
[LUNARRE screaming]

324
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,416
[LUNARRE]
I wanna be something more!

325
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,333
I want my life to matter!

326
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,333
[LUNARRE]
Dammit!

327
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,125
I'm trying, but there's
just no end to them!

328
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,750
[LUNARRE yells]

329
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:39,416
I can't stop now, even
if it is a losing battle!

330
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:51,666
[panting]

331
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,541
If I fight much longer,
I'm gonna burn out and die.

332
00:18:55,625 --> 00:19:02,833
[laughing]

333
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,083
That won't be such
a bad thing, really.

334
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,875
[screaming]

335
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,458
[yells]

336
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,416
[laughing]

337
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,458
[chukling]

338
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,000
[screams]

339
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:38,625
[laughing]

340
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:57,958
[LUNARRE] I wonder...
if I was some use in the end.

341
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,375
Hang in there for me. Don't die.

342
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,625
I wasn't planning on it.

343
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,333
Maybe not, but that
was a close call.

344
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,916
Seriously,
armatization is tough.

345
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,208
[DEZEL]
We can't go any further.

346
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:20,333
[ROSE]
Yes, we can. We have to.

347
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,875
Uh.

348
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:27,166
There's an incredible amount of
malevolence concentrated here.

349
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,625
Think of what it will mean
if we win this battle.

350
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,500
It could change the course
of the entire world forever.

351
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,416
How amazing would that be?

352
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,583
Instead of "immediate justice
over unreachable ideals,"

353
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:44,166
it would be, "Immediate justice
gives rise to an ideal world."

354
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,000
You know?

355
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,541
I have to do this.

356
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,583
[DEZEL]
Rose, are you sure?

357
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,000
How is Rose? All right?

358
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,541
[DEZEL]
She's fine.

359
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,166
He's right there!

360
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,333
Is that him?

361
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,375
[SOREY]
The Lord of Calamity!

362
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,875
[gasps]

363
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,791
It's her.

364
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:21,000
[DEZEL]
That dragon... is Symonne.

365
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,916
[MIKLEO grunts]


366
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,625
You're looking a bit pensive.


367
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,708
I was just thinkin'
a bit about Sorey.


368
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,250
He's grown up a lot
since we left Elysia.


369
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:08,041
Has he? Hmph.
You two are close, huh?


370
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,458
You've watched over
Sorey for a long time.


371
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,833
What about you?


372
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,958
You've been with Rose
for awhile time, too.


373
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,625
Suppose so.


374
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,875
He has come a long way,
but as much as he's matured,


375
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,583
I still think I need
to keep an eye on him.


376
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,916
Heh. I'm with you there.


377
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,125
[SOREY]
Hey, you two.


378
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,500
What have you been
chatting about?


379
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,500
Nothin' special.


380
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:27,583
[SOREY grunts]


381
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:30,750
You're a bad liar.
Come on, tell me!


382
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,666
Hey, I'm bored! Let's
practice armatization.


383
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,583
Don't you think you should
rest up a little bit more?


384
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,041
Nah, I'm fine!


385
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,500
I need to toughen up for the
battle that's ahead of us.


386
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:43,208
Now, let's wrap this preview up.
It's time to practice!


387
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,416
I suppose.


388
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,208
Next time: "Be like the wind."


389
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,791
Look forward to it.
