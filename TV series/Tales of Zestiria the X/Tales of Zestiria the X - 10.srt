1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,416
I knew you'd show up
right when I needed you.

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,333
Of course I did. I know
you're helpless without me.

3
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,708
Admit it, you're a wreck
when I'm not around.

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,166
Don't be silly.

5
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,541
You've gotten stronger. Good.

6
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,708
Found yourself a
hardworking Shepherd, huh?

7
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,041
Purifying the water
supply is important.

8
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,000
Ultimately, it's going to be
the key to rebuilding Marlind.

9
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,958
I'm surprised water boy
was so willing to tag along.

10
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,708
Of course, those two
are practically inseparable.

11
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,416
The air feels worse
the deeper we go.

12
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,583
[MIKLEO]
This is the place.

13
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,833
[SOREY]
Yeah. Let's get started.

14
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,166
Well? How's it feel?

15
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,750
Good enough to me.

16
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,125
If you're ready,
let's release it.

17
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,833
We call upon you now.

18
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,041
O great water,
mother to us all,

19
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,791
grant us the power
of purification.

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
[EDNA yelps]

21
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,791
[BOTH sigh]

22
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,125
[SOREY] This is starting to feel
like a never-ending chore.

23
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,541
There's always more
water to be purified.

24
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,500
[MIKLEO] No one ever said
being Shepherd would be fun.

25
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,083
[SOREY] Heh. Yeah,
you're right about that.

26
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,208
All right, how long
have we been

27
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,416
trudging around
these sewers for?

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,583
Three days.

29
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,375
Good thing you're
a seraph of water

30
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,625
or it would be a lot
longer than that.

31
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,000
If I was doing this job alone,

32
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,708
it would've taken more than
a month to get this far.

33
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,750
[MIKLEO]
Ha. Flattery?

34
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,000
That's not like you.
Feeling okay?

35
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,541
[SOREY]
Heh. You're right, I'll stop.

36
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,375
Well, let's get going.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,875
[LAILAH] You are growing into
a wonderful Shepherd, Sorey.

38
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,541
Your diligence and dedication
are the sign of a good leader.

39
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,083
Isn't that right, Edna?

40
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,458
Eh, wouldn't go that far.

41
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,416
Sorey, a leader?
That isn't what I'd call him.

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,333
Well, what then?

43
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,125
[VILLAGER A]
Sir Shepherd!

44
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:33,166
[VILLAGERS cattering]

45
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,333
[EDNA sighs]

46
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,583
I'm exhausted.

47
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,708
How are you tired when
you didn't do anything?

48
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,958
I spent most of the day in
your company. That's real work.

49
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,625
You're such a brat!

50
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,875
That's quite enough, little boy.

51
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,000
Now, you two, try not
to bicker so much.

52
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:59,166
Alisha found us a place
to relax, so let's enjoy it.

53
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,916
[SOREY] What about you, Rohan?
How're you doing?

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Much better than
I've been in some time.

55
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,708
For which I have you to thank.

56
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,583
[SOREY sighs]

57
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,416
[SOREY]
I'm glad to hear it.

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,291
I failed in my sacred duty.

59
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,541
As a Seraph, I should've
protected Marlind

60
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,041
from the chaos.

61
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,791
[ROHAN]
Instead, I allowed myself

62
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,375
to be consumed by malevolence.

63
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,583
You must not blame yourself.

64
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,583
The world is unsettled.

65
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,083
Every Seraph faces corruption.

66
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,875
And it's worse for
those near humans.

67
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:36,875
[SOREY]
Can you tell us more

68
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,000
about how the city
became consumed?

69
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,000
What fed the malevolence?

70
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,583
I only wish I could tell you.

71
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,708
But I'm afraid I don't
remember that much.

72
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,208
I do believe it started
as something small though.

73
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,458
Someone borrowing a book maybe,
without asking for permission?

74
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,916
That sort of thing.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,666
I know what you're sayin'.

76
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,875
I've seen it before.
Whole villages up and vanish.

77
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,916
Small ones, it's
true, but still.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,875
And it always seems to start
out as such a small thing.

79
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,833
Then suddenly, boom!

80
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,083
Darkness is everywhere!

81
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,791
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
a Normin Seraph was among us.

82
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,958
[ATAKK]
Well howdy!

83
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,708
I remember now that
Normin Seraphim

84
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,625
used to live
throughout the city.

85
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,666
We worked together to
maintain harmony here.

86
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,000
It has been a long time,

87
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,333
but I still can't believe
I'd forgotten that.

88
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,541
Those were the good old days
with a Seraph for each city

89
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,291
and a Normin for each village.

90
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,791
We may not be much
in terms of size,

91
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,666
but we sure got the numbers!

92
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,500
Seraphim and Normin sort
of balance each other.

93
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,291
That's fascinating.

94
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,875
[ATAKK]
There used to be so many of us,

95
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,791
all working for the same thing,

96
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,875
but now we're scattered
all over the world.

97
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,583
[ALISHA] Sorey. I brought
you something to eat.

98
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,625
[SOREY]
Thank you.

99
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,958
If you don't mind me
eating with you,

100
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,750
I could use the company.

101
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,125
Of course.

102
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,291
Once again, thank you.

103
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,958
The water seems
much cleaner now.

104
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,541
That's the key,
according to Lailah.

105
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,000
When rainwater filters
through trees and soil,

106
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,791
it absorbs the
land's malevolence,

107
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,041
thus becoming toxic.

108
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,583
It may take a year
to truly purify.

109
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,916
I see.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,791
It must be very difficult
to keep all the elements

111
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,208
balanced and in harmony.

112
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:18,083
I humbly thank you, Seraphim.
You have my deepest gratitude.

113
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,958
The citizens know what you did.

114
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,041
They welcome you with open arms.

115
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,833
I'm sure they would be happy
to live alongside you,

116
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,916
as we all did long ago.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,041
I pray you will continue
to lend us your aid.

118
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,958
How goes the city's repairs?

119
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,125
It's too early to know

120
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,083
if we can restore it
to its former glory,

121
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,541
but I do think there's
reason to hope.

122
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,583
And to me, hope can make
all the difference.

123
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,333
If there's anything else
I can help with, just ask.

124
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,000
[ALISHA] Are you sure?
You look a bit tired.

125
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,791
[SOREY] Well, you look like you
could use a break yourself.

126
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,291
At the very least,
he is a hard worker.

127
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,375
I'd say the same goes
for Princess Alisha.

128
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:00,083
That is one of Sorey's
finest qualities. Although...

129
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,333
[EDNA]
Although?

130
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,958
[LAILAH] Nothing.
Sorry, I'm just babbling.

131
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,291
It burns!

132
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,500
All right then.

133
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,875
We're beginning to
receive supplies

134
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,250
for the reconstruction
of the city,

135
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,916
and there's a lot of
organizing we need to do.

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,375
Do you think you could
help us out with that?

137
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,166
Sure.

138
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,500
Here.

139
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay, that should
be the last one.

140
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,291
[sighs]

141
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,500
[ALISHA] We are distributing
emergency provisions evenly

142
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,791
amongst all the city's people.

143
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,375
There is to be no hoarding
and no stealing.

144
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,583
Any who do so will be
severely punished.

145
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,541
All right, let's get to work.

146
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,291
Alisha really doesn't
get tired, does she?

147
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,916
You know, the princess
could delegate

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,750
instead of doing
all this herself.

149
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,083
Well, that's just the kind
of person that Alisha is.

150
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,833
Oh, you know her well, do you?

151
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't make it sound weird.

152
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:51,875
Huh?

153
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,708
She looks familiar.

154
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,958
[ROSE]
Hey, think you can help us?

155
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,416
We're the Sparrowfeathers,
come from Ladylake.

156
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
We've got a wagon packed full
of food and supplies

157
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,125
for the people of Marlind.

158
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,166
Can you tell us
where to put it all?

159
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,791
[ALISHA]
You're a welcome sight.

160
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,208
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,000
I didn't realize I was talking
to a Hyland princess!

162
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,083
Out here, I'm just
another knight.

163
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,041
I have heard good things
about the Sparrowfeathers.

164
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,208
I've heard some things about
you too, Princess Alisha.

165
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,458
Pleasure doing
business with you.

166
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,291
[SOREY]
Hello again!

167
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,875
Hey there! Long time no see.

168
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,458
Oh, Sorey, you two
know each other?

169
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,208
Yeah, we met at Ladylake.

170
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,458
This is, uh...

171
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,833
The name's Rose.

172
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,166
And it looks like you are
the Lord Shepherd now.

173
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,541
When we parted ways,
you agreed you owe me one.

174
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,333
Do you remember?

175
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,541
Uhh...

176
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,458
[ROSE] How are you going
to settle our debt?

177
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,541
You have moved up a lot
in the world, after all.

178
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,125
Well, being the Shepherd isn't
exactly a paying gig, you know.

179
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,833
Hey, if you're not good for it,
I completely understand.

180
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,375
Fortunately, you have friends!

181
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,250
Oh, unclench. I'm just kidding!

182
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,416
[SOREY sighs]

183
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,958
So the wagon. We've got
a lotta food here.

184
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:09,833
Where would you like it?

185
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,291
Right, just over there, please.

186
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,333
[ROSE]
Got it.

187
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,583
[MALTRAN]
Alisha!

188
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,583
[ALISHA] What is it, Master?
Is something wrong?

189
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,583
[MALTRAN]
Shiller has a report for you.

190
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,000
Go ahead. It sounds urgent.

191
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,375
Yes, but, Master.

192
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,625
[ALISHA] He can hear whatever
it is that you have to say.

193
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,625
This is Sorey, the Shepherd.

194
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,583
I'm a personal rider
to the princess.

195
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,916
My name is Shiller.

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,208
Your Highness, Chancellor
Bartlow has ordered our troops

197
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,208
to march to Glaivend Basin.

198
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,291
Are you certain about this?

199
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,333
Glaivend Basin acts
as the buffer zone

200
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:56,125
between Hyland and Rolance.

201
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,000
When we left on our journey,

202
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,833
I sent Shiller and others
to be my eyes and ears,

203
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,250
but I didn't think Bartlow
would go this far.

204
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,333
[SHILLER] Rumor has it that
the high-ranking officers

205
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,958
have been told to
prepare for war.

206
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,791
All-out war?

207
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,458
First, he chased you out,

208
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:18,541
and then Bartlow got exactly
what he wanted all along.

209
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,541
That snake. Why is
he striking now?

210
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,333
[MALTRAN] He had a convenient
excuse to send you away,

211
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:28,208
and Hyland's resources
likely need replenishing.

212
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,583
A good motive.

213
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:34,916
What better way to resupply
than by raiding the enemy.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,916
I wonder what will happen
after he takes all he can get.

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,041
[SHILLER]
The second wave of troops

216
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,708
is leaving Ladylake as we speak.

217
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,916
We can never make it.

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,250
I must. I'll stop them somehow.

219
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,875
Don't be reckless.

220
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,000
[SOREY]
I'm going with you.

221
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,708
[LAILAH]
I advise against that.

222
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:59,166
[SOREY]
Lailah! I don't understand!

223
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,208
You were the one who said
I had to travel around

224
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,000
and see things for myself!

225
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,583
[LAILAH] Sorey, you don't know
what it's like for a human

226
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,500
to be truly consumed
by malevolence!

227
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,833
Things are different
on a battlefield!

228
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,666
I feel it too.
There's a hellion.

229
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,416
It's different.

230
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,291
Yeah, it is.

231
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:35,875
That's because, this is... It's
malevolence born of a human.

232
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,375
It's heavy. Intangible,
but oppressive.

233
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,166
[SOREY]
In here.

234
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,166
[thud]

235
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,666
It's a human? That thing?

236
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,041
Yes, or it was.

237
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:16,041
To a normal person he would
still appear human.

238
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,958
You should be able
to see it too, Sorey.

239
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:23,083
Look closely, and you'll
see his original human form.

240
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,375
He looks scared.

241
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,333
Now use your power.
Purify him, Shepherd.

242
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,791
[VOICES screaming]

243
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,625
Are you okay?

244
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:46,208
Quick! You can't let
that hellion escape!

245
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,666
[SOREY] I won't let him
spread more malevolence!

246
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,166
You all right? Can you stand?

247
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,000
It was so much harder than
anything I've done before.

248
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,375
I didn't know it
could be like that.

249
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,625
Yes. Purifying a human
is quite different.

250
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,958
In order to do so,

251
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,583
the Shepherd accepts the
malevolence into himself.

252
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,791
[EDNA]
You are the only one

253
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,333
who can internalize
malevolence that way.

254
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,833
Even the Seraphim can do
nothing to ease your burden.

255
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,000
As the Shepherd,
you stand alone.

256
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,666
[MIKLEO]
Sorey.

257
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,208
This... isn't over.

258
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,375
[SOLDIER A]
We need more horses!

259
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,666
[SOLDIER B]
Round up as many as you can!

260
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,458
[ALISHA]
Is the rescue squad ready?

261
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,833
We're awaiting confirmation.

262
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:53,875
Medical team?

263
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,250
Yes, soon.

264
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,166
Make it sooner.

265
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,666
Yes, Your Highness.

266
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,625
My squad is waiting
for me to join them.

267
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,250
They're stationed here.

268
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,833
Are they carrying any
additional supplies?

269
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,250
Hiding it from Chancellor
Bartlow wasn't very easy,

270
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,791
but we managed.

271
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,500
Thank you, Shiller.

272
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,333
This is the only way to get
to Glaivend from Ladylake.

273
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,791
There is no other route
for them to follow.

274
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,125
To decrease our travel time,

275
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,750
we'll cut through
these mountains here.

276
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,250
[SOLDIER D]
I have a report, ma'am.

277
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,583
How is it going?

278
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,541
[SOLDIER D] We were able
to acquire 13 more horses.

279
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,791
Good.

280
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,458
I want to take every soldier.
Keep looking.

281
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,791
[SOLDIER D]
Yes, ma'am!

282
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,666
I wish there was another way.

283
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,916
We were just
starting to rebuild,

284
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,833
but I need to take a
sizable force with me.

285
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,541
We have no time to spare.

286
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,208
I want us ready to
march by morning.

287
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,875
Let's get back to work.

288
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,416
[ALISHA]
Master!

289
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,458
Yes, Alisha?

290
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,500
What is that?

291
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,916
Ah.

292
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,541
A spear given to me by a
citizen grateful for our aid.

293
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,708
It's quite a spectacular weapon,
don't you think?

294
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,875
It'll help me protect
you on the battlefield.

295
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,666
Thank you, Master.

296
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,916
We'll speak more soon, but
for now, I must keep working.

297
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,125
[MALTRAN]
Yes.

298
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,708
[MIKLEO]
Why are we here?

299
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,291
[EDNA]
A cemetery at dusk?

300
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,541
Searching for ghosts
or something?

301
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,458
Does the scary
cemetery frighten you?

302
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,625
I can hold your
hand if you want.

303
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,041
Tough talk from a little boy.

304
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,583
Let's see... Mikleo-boy.

305
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,875
Or maybe we could call
you "Mibo" for short.

306
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:46,791
How 'bout neither?

307
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,416
Mibo has a nice ring to it.

308
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,583
[MIKLEO]
Uh...

309
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,708
Please, Sorey,

310
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,125
tell us why you've
brought us to this place.

311
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,041
The hellion from before.

312
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,000
This is the grave of the
person he murdered.

313
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,833
[SOREY] I, Sorey the Shepard,
purify this sorrowful spirit,

314
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,916
that he may know rest.

315
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,333
[SOREY] It all started out
as a simple argument.

316
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,416
Then one of them
picked up a weapon

317
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,125
and the other tried
to defend himself.

318
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:43,458
In the end, the second man
emerged as the victor

319
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,708
and his attacker lay dead.

320
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,541
They both had their reasons

321
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,291
and neither one of them
set out this morning

322
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,000
hoping they would
end another's life.

323
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,333
But still...

324
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,083
That's strange. Where have
all the guards gone?

325
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,541
I don't have much time,
so can we make this quick?

326
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,125
[SOREY]
Sorrow doesn't discriminate.

327
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,166
It doesn't matter
who started it.

328
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,416
It doesn't matter
who's responsible.

329
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,500
When a loved one dies,
there is always grief.

330
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,666
[SOREY]
In time, grief becomes hatred,

331
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,958
which seeps into the land.

332
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,458
[LAILAH]
It's true.

333
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,750
You're beginning to understand
the root of malevolence.

334
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,500
[MASKED FIGURE] Not so much
as a hint of fear.

335
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:09,375
Impressive. You're no ordinary
princess, are you?

336
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:13,791
I only wish that I could
be an ordinary princess,

337
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,583
but I have seen far too much.

338
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,833
We are in an age of calamity.

339
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,833
Can we just skip past the tests?

340
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,875
[MASKED FIGURE]
You can't blame me, can you?

341
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,333
I like to know what
I'm up against.

342
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,291
Stop wasting time and fight.

343
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,083
There are things
that I need to do.

344
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,833
[MASKED FIGURE] And what
exactly are these "things"?

345
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,916
I have a war to stop.

346
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,333
[MASKED FIGURE]
And you think you can do that?

347
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,250
[ALISHA] If something needs
to be done, I do it.

348
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,791
[MASKED FIGURE]
Is that so?

349
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,541
Let's say your men are
toe-to-toe with the enemy,

350
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,916
you would want them to put away
their arms and stand down?

351
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,041
Those are the orders
you would give?

352
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,083
If necessary.

353
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,333
[MASKED FIGURE]
So it's true.

354
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,208
You want Hyland to fight
only on the defensive.

355
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,666
[ALISHA]
Yes.

356
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,333
[MASKED FIGURE]
You realize that people will die

357
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,250
as a result of your decision.

358
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,791
And that first death?
That's all it takes.

359
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,083
[MASKED FIGURE]
I won't allow you to sacrifice

360
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,875
the people of Hyland
for your ideals.

361
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,416
So that's the reason
you're after me, is it?

362
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,791
[MASKED FIGURE] The Scattered
Bones have a purpose.

363
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,583
One death is all it
takes to breed hatred.

364
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,625
So we will do what
we must to stop it.

365
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,416
[ALISHA] All right, but what
if I promise you this?

366
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,250
I will die first!

367
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,958
[MASKED FIGURE] You aren't
bluffing. You really mean that.

368
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,416
Yes, I do.

369
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,708
Stop there.

370
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,250
You assaulted a
princess of the realm.

371
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,958
Do you truly expect
to walk away?

372
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,208
There will be consequences.

373
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,416
[MASKED FIGURE] Oh? Do you plan
to capture us all and hang us?

374
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,666
You will follow me
into the battlefield,

375
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,708
and there, witness my
actions for yourself.

376
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,458
You'll see more clearly
without the mask!

377
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,666
My troops need supplies

378
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,750
and I have a feeling that you
can provide them for us.

379
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,291
If you're willing.

380
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,250
[MASKED FIGURE]
I knew you were brave,

381
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,583
but I admit you're more
intelligent than I had realized.

382
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,375
All right, Princess,

383
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:22,208
I accept your request on behalf
of the Sparrowfeathers.

384
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,416
[ALISHA]
One more thing.

385
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,541
If I die on the battlefield...

386
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,375
Yes. Then what?

387
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,708
...let there be no retaliation.

388
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,500
Everything must be forgiven,
and that also includes my death.

389
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,333
There shall be no revenge sought
in the name of Alisha Diphda.

390
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,791
I want you to make that known.

391
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,958
[ROSE]
Very well.

392
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,583
If you should die,
Alisha Diphda,

393
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:59,125
then I vow that I will make
your wishes known to all.

394
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,041
Good.

395
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,291
Now see to your people.
Prepare them.

396
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,000
We leave for Glaivend
Basin in the morning.

397
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,625
[LAILAH] You still intend
to go to the battlefield,

398
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,583
knowing you will have
to purify humans?

399
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,541
[SOREY]
That is why I must go.

400
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,583
I am the Shepherd.

401
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,000
For ten gald, I've got a lotion


402
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,125
that'll make your
skin silky-smooth!


403
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,041
Silky-smooth? I'll take it!


404
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:06,166
And a great freckle-removing
cream for only 100 gald!


405
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,041
Is that all? I'll take it!


406
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:11,541
Special weight-loss water,
only a thousand gald a bottle.


407
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,666
Weight-loss water? I'll take it!


408
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,250
Stop this, Your Highness.


409
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,333
You really shouldn't
be so trusting.


410
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,375
[ALISHA] But why not, Rose?
You're so trustworthy!


411
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,208
Ugh! I can't take this anymore!


412
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,041
One hundred gald for all of it!


413
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,375
Such a discount?


414
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:29,000
I can't possibly accept it.
I would feel bad.


415
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,458
Eh, it's okay!
I got it all for free.


416
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,041
Well, if you're sure.


417
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,291
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.


418
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,541
No...


419
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,000
Gah! I give! Just take
it already, will you?


420
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,166
A present for me?


421
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,125
So now it's suddenly okay?


422
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,583
Thank you, Rose.
Next time. "The War."


423
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:49,125
I have to say, you've got
some serious haggling skills.
