1
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,916
We have until sunrise
to execute our plan.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,125
If everything goes
the way it should,

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,250
Ladylake will be ours again.

4
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:30,416
We'll do this without
killing anyone. Understood?

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
[bell ringing]

6
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,000
[BARTLOW SOLDIER A]
She's here!

7
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,208
The princess is
inside the walls.

8
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,166
[SHILLER]
They'll have us surrounded soon.

9
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,458
Maybe not.

10
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,625
If I remember correctly,

11
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,791
there's a hidden
passage... right here.

12
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:09,750
Ian!

13
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,125
[IAN]
Yeah, I'm on it.

14
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,750
[IAN]
Shiller, watch your back!

15
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,250
[yells]

16
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,458
[IAN]
Got 'em!

17
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,791
Come on, we've got work to do.

18
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,208
[BARTLOW SOLDIER A]
Chancellor Bartlow.

19
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,041
[BARTLOW] I take it the
princess and her rebels

20
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,833
have breached the walls.

21
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,125
[BARTLOW SOLDIER A]
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,541
We've deployed our troops
throughout the city

23
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,791
as instructed.

24
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,333
Very well then.

25
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:23,125
Let's begin. Make ready
to light up the square.

26
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,750
[laughing]

27
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,791
[LUNARRE]
It's almost too much fun!

28
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,916
[laughs]

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,458
The stage is set, and
the players are ready.

30
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,416
Time to draw the curtain up.

31
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,375
I'm going to enjoy
this so very much!

32
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,250
[chuckles]

33
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,541
No use. We can't catch it!

34
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,958
[MIKLEO] The tornado seems
to be gaining momentum.

35
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,625
[LAILAH]
It's almost as if something

36
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,250
is pulling it toward Ladylake.

37
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,375
[EDNA]
Something's very wrong.

38
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,166
[LUNARRE grunts]

39
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,083
[LUNARRE]
There are too many.

40
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,750
She won't even be able
to approach the capitve.

41
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,208
Maybe I need to go and stir
things up a bit down there.

42
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,375
You haven't died
already, have you?

43
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,041
[LUNARRE laughs]

44
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,625
I thought you would
like to know

45
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,208
that your dear pupil Princess
Alisha is coming to rescue you.

46
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,791
What do you want? Who are you?

47
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,291
[LUNARRE]
Who am I, you ask?

48
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,291
Well, now there's an interesting
question. Let me think...

49
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,750
I am many things.

50
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,958
But for tonight, let's say
that I'm a supporter

51
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,166
of the sweet princess.

52
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,166
For the most part.

53
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,000
I admit I'm disappointed
that she's willing

54
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,708
to sacrifice her
soldiers to save you.

55
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,666
That's exactly the kind
of short-sightedness

56
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,666
her opponents accuse her of.

57
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,416
I've come to expect better of
her during our time together.

58
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,833
[MALTRAN]
Hmph.

59
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,125
If you think that, then
you're no supporter of hers.

60
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,750
Oh, yeah?

61
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,041
[MALTRAN] Anybody who really
knows Alisha and her methods

62
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,916
would realize
where she's headed.

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,291
She wouldn't enter this
city without a solid plan.

64
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,375
[LUNARRE grunts]

65
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,125
You really don't see it?

66
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,166
She's not coming for me.

67
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,625
[growls]

68
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,416
[LUNARRE yells]

69
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,083
You are her beloved teacher.

70
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,500
If she's not coming
to your rescue,

71
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,625
then what is she doing here?

72
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,416
Being a leader in
a kingdom like ours

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,375
comes with certain
responsibilities.

74
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,208
It means not acting
on personal emotion.

75
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,875
We owe that to our people.

76
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,375
With the world in
its current state,

77
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,166
we can't let selfish
desires drive us.

78
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,125
Alisha has always known that.

79
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,333
It wasn't something
I needed to teach her.

80
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,958
In her heart,
she is a true leader,

81
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,291
rightful Princess of Hyland.

82
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,375
[BARTLOW]
What is taking so long?

83
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,750
The outer wall isn't far.

84
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,708
She should've reached
the square by now.

85
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,000
[BARTLOW] Unless she has
a different destination.

86
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,750
Prepare my carriage!

87
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,750
[MIKLEO]
We've got no choice

88
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,541
but to continue
chasing the tornado.

89
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,500
Though, honestly, I have no idea
what to do when we catch it.

90
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,916
[EDNA]
I'm with Mibo on this one.

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,083
[SOREY]
It'll be okay.

92
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,375
[MIKLEO]
Huh?

93
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,750
[SOREY]
It has to be.

94
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,458
[MIKLEO] What are you thinking?
You have a way to stop it?

95
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,166
[SOREY]
Not stop, exactly.

96
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,625
We're going to purify
the malevolence

97
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,958
the tornado is carrying.

98
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:02,833
Like I've said before, we've
all got malevolence inside us.

99
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,958
Most of us spend
our lives fighting it,

100
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,541
trying to deny the darkness
and do what we believe is right.

101
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:12,416
The struggle may not always be
obvious, but it's always there.

102
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,833
Always.

103
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,666
[MIKLEO] And if someone
starts to lose that battle...

104
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,666
[SOREY] ...that's when the
hellions begin to appear.

105
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,416
Malevolence manifests
differently in everyone.

106
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,125
There's no telling how
much someone can handle

107
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,833
before they're consumed.

108
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,208
One person may burn out with
only a few small mistakes.

109
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:33,416
Other can endeavor,
try to fight against it.

110
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,541
[EDNA]
And as the Shepherd,

111
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,000
you can gauge the
size of malevolence.

112
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,625
[SOREY]
I can.

113
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,250
[MIKLEO]
And what about the tornado?

114
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,958
[SOREY]
I can see inside it.

115
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,583
I know what's hiding in there.
What's driving it.

116
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,333
[EDNA]
So?

117
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,500
[SOREY]
Dragons cannot be purified.

118
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,875
That's what you've all told me,
but if that's not true?

119
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,458
What if no dragon
has been purified

120
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,625
because there's never been
a Shepherd who could?

121
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:02,708
Just because it hasn't been done
doesn't mean that it can't be.

122
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,250
[LAILAH]
That is possible.

123
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,583
[MIKLEO]
It's a big risk.

124
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,541
Do you really think
you're ready for it?

125
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,666
[SOREY]
I won't know until I try,

126
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,666
but it's a risk I have to take.

127
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,291
[MIKLEO] Sorey, what happens
if you can't carry it all?

128
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:22,291
[SOREY]
Then... I'll probably die.

129
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:26,041
It'll be okay. I have
all of you beside me.

130
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,750
Let's go!

131
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,708
[ALISHA]
Hello, Father.

132
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,750
[KING]
Is that you, Alisha?

133
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:31,208
Yes.

134
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,333
It has been a long time.

135
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,083
[KING]
Indeed it has.

136
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,375
[ALISHA]
Father. No, King Hyland.

137
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,375
I've come here to
make a request.

138
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:46,083
I ask you to please hear me out.

139
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,250
The danger our kingdom
faces now is greater

140
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,166
than any we've known before.

141
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,750
Hyland is drowning.

142
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,041
Our land is overrun with anger,
jealousy, and hatred.

143
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,750
Those emotions are
what has given rise

144
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,708
to this era of
chaos and calamity.

145
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,958
Our people deserve
peace and stability.

146
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,458
We must put a stop to all the
fighting. It's the only way.

147
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,583
If we can realize that goal,
the chaos may finally end.

148
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,916
Come, Alisha, move closer.

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,083
It's been too long
since I've seen you.

150
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,500
[ALISHA]
Of course.

151
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:35,166
I didn't realize how much you've
come to resemble your mother.

152
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,166
What-What happened to you?

153
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,916
[ALISHA]
Father.

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,708
It can't be.

155
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,541
[door opens]

156
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,166
[BARTLOW]
There you are.

157
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,416
I hadn't expected you to come
after the King directly.

158
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,208
I should have, of course.

159
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:05,125
Taking out the enemy leader
first is a sound strategy.

160
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,250
I let the fact that he's your
father cloud my judgment.

161
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,875
I didn't think you
capable of such a thing.

162
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,333
Clearly I underestimated
your ruthlessness.

163
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,458
You were right the first time.

164
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,541
I'm not here to kill my father.

165
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,083
I just came to talk to him.

166
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,125
[BARTLOW] You came here
in the middle of the night

167
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,083
with a battalion because
you wanted to talk?

168
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,916
Nonsense.

169
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,750
[ALISHA]
Put the sword down, Chancellor.

170
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,125
I have no intention
of fighting you.

171
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,916
[BARTLOW]
Alisha Diphda.

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,416
You are guilty of treason

173
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,416
and the attempted assassination
of your father, the King.

174
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,750
It's time for you
to pay for your crimes.

175
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,208
Stop this!

176
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,083
Fairwell.

177
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,833
[thud]

178
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,375
[KING groaning]

179
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,083
Please forgive me, Alisha.

180
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,291
[ALISHA] Wake up, Father!
Don't leave me!

181
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,291
[BARTLOW]
You and I aren't finished yet.

182
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,708
Now, pick up your weapon.

183
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,083
Better you die on your feet.

184
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:28,166
[ALISHA] If we fought, I would
win, but I refuse to kill you.

185
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,166
Death won't be your punishment.

186
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,541
You'll spend your life
in a cell for regicide.

187
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,833
[BARTLOW]
Who will the people believe

188
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,791
when they hear of
the King's death?

189
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,250
The treasoness princess
or the trusted Chancellor,

190
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,375
who guided the kingdom
through this bloody war?

191
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,000
So you intend to
spread falsehoods

192
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,166
in a desperate attempt to
hold on to your power.

193
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,458
[BARTLOW] Why not? It's been
a good strategy so far.

194
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,583
All right, everyone.
You can come in now.

195
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,625
[gasps]

196
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,375
[ALISHA]
Your men heard everything.

197
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,666
[BARTLOW SOLDIER A]
How could you do this?

198
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,416
I don't understand. We thought
we were protecting our country.

199
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,333
We fought our own men because
you said it was the only way.

200
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,041
[BARTLOW]
Don't let her decieve you.

201
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,583
She's a traitor, arrest her!

202
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,541
[ALISHA]
Put the sword down. It's over.

203
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,833
Remember what you said, Alisha.

204
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:46,083
That my punishment wouldn't be
death, but a lifetime in a cell.

205
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,083
There's still a way for
me to win, after all.

206
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,916
[gasps]

207
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,125
God, we'll never survive that.

208
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,208
[ALL gasp]

209
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,625
[MALTRAN] Get out of here!
Retreat to the castle!

210
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,583
This is no ordinary storm.

211
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,333
Ladylake will be a pile
of rubble before long.

212
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,750
It grows stronger
the closer it gets.

213
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,166
[roars]

214
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,000
[gasps]

215
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,875
[SOREY] Alisha!
Alisha, can you hear me?

216
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,291
Yes, I can.

217
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,875
[SOREY]
I'm going to need your help.

218
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,666
I'm calling on you,
as my Squire.

219
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,125
[ALISHA]
Of course!

220
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,958
[SOREY]
We're coming in fast!

221
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,500
[ALISHA]
I'm on my way!

222
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,458
[SOREY]
Mikleo!

223
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,625
[MIKLEO]
Right!

224
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,541
[SOREY]
Luzrov Rulay!

225
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,750
Lailah, can Sorey really
purify the dragon?

226
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,250
Yes, I believe he can.

227
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,041
He's ready to meet
this challenge.

228
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,916
We'll see.

229
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,375
It's not impossible.

230
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:07,291
Just because it hasn't been done
doesn't mean it can't be.

231
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,541
And today, we're
going to prove that!

232
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,458
[SOREY]
Azure Assault

233
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,291
Let's give this everything
that we've got!

234
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,416
[SOREY]
You're up, Rose. You ready?

235
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,750
[ROSE]
Yeah. Let's do it.

236
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,083
Now.

237
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,916
[SOREY]
Hear me, malevolent one.

238
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,666
The Sheperd has come
to purify your soul!

239
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,250
[grunting]

240
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:05,000
[ROSE screaming]

241
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,791
Hold on tight

242
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,708
[SOREY]
Rose!

243
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,875
[ROSE]
Keep going.

244
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,708
I... can do this!

245
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,125
I wouldn't doubt it.
You never quit.

246
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,541
Of course I don't.

247
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,791
I'm the leader of the Scattered
Bones. I fight to win.

248
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,125
[DRAGON roars]

249
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,708
[ROSE screaming]

250
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,708
Here, let me help you.

251
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,125
[SOREY]
You made it!

252
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,750
Took ya long enough, but thanks.

253
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,583
Hurry. Send me some
of the malevolence now.

254
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,333
All right. Get ready!

255
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,958
We can do this. Hold tight!

256
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,916
Don't worry about us.

257
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, just keep going!

258
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,416
[SOREY yells]

259
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,208
[yells]

260
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,500
Don't worry. They're okay.
Just unconscious.

261
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,500
It was a close call, but they
stood firm the whole time.

262
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,208
Got ya.

263
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,875
[ZAVEID] I can't believe
he purified a dragon.

264
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,166
He really did it.

265
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,250
[SOREY] You know what
this means, right?

266
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,791
Edna, we should be able to
purify your brother now.

267
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,500
[EDNA]
Look at you. You're a mess.

268
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,166
Thank you, Sorey.

269
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,833
[SYMONNE] If this is your
grand plan to save the world,

270
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,875
you'll be sorely disappointed.

271
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,458
[SOREY]
It's you.

272
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,541
Nomatter what tricks
you have up your sleeve,

273
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,750
you cannot stop my master.

274
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,875
His goal is to shroud the
entire world in malevolence,

275
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,541
and I promise you,
he will succeed.

276
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,875
The end isn't far away now.

277
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,416
I don't know why
I didn't see it,


278
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,625
but Alisha and Rose
are pretty similar.


279
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,333
They're both extremely
reliable and responsible.


280
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,833
What else is there?


281
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,750
They're both respected
by their subordinates.


282
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,666
Oh, I've got one. They're
both excellent fighters.


283
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,500
I have Master Maltran to thank.


284
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,125
She taught me everything
I know about fighting.


285
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,791
When she was a knight, she was
known as the Blue Valkyrie,


286
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,250
and everybody feared her.


287
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,416
[ROSE]
Hm.


288
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,416
It was my foster father
Brad who taught me


289
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,958
how to handle myself in a fight.


290
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,000
He was the leader
of the Windriders,


291
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,666
and people all
across the continent


292
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,250
knew how strong he was.


293
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,791
Oh?


294
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,000
However strong he was, I'm sure
Master Maltran is stronger.


295
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:32,916
No, Brad is!


296
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,208
Master Maltran is!


297
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,000
Nope, it's Brad!


298
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,416
No, it's Master Maltran!


299
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,083
No, Brad!


300
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,541
No, Master Maltran!


301
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,083
Hey, guys, we're, uh, kinda
runnin' out of time here.


302
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,416
[ALISHA, ROSE] All right!
Then look forward to next time.


303
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,833
"The ideal world."


304
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,708
That's another one.
They both hate to lose.
