1
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,500
[MIKLEO]
About time you woke up.

2
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:27,875
We've been worried!

3
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,708
So, how are you feeling?

4
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,416
What's going on? What happened?

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,166
You've been unconscious
with a high fever

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,541
for three days.

7
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:36,750
Seriously?

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,416
When you became my vessel,

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,083
I think your body must
have gone into shock.

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,916
We're just lucky
Alisha saved you.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,291
It could have been much worse.

12
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,083
She saved me?

13
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,625
Ah-- What happened to
her after the trial?

14
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,541
You're awake!

15
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,166
Alisha, you're safe!

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm glad you're better.

17
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,000
We've all been so worried.

18
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,166
[SOREY]
Wow, that was a feast!

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,958
[ALISHA] I'd say you're
past the worst of it.

20
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,125
You can't be feeling too
poorly if you ate that much.

21
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,625
Plus, everything was delicious!

22
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,583
Thanks for taking care
of me these past few days

23
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,500
while I've been sick.
I owe you one!

24
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,166
No, I'm the one who
should be thanking you.

25
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,416
You pulled out the sacred blade,

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,166
just like the legend said.

27
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,166
I'm still not entirely
sure what you did next,

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,416
but I do know that
you saved us all.

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,583
It was the most incredible
thing I've ever seen.

30
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,625
It felt like

31
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,125
everything was going
to be all right.

32
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,375
Because you were there.

33
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,375
Does that sound silly?

34
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,875
Nah.

35
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,125
[ALISHA chuckles]

36
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,833
Anyway, there's something
I wanna give you.

37
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,708
As a token of gratitude
for everything you've done.

38
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,000
[door clicks]

39
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,583
It's perfect!

40
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,958
[laughs]

41
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,333
[ALISHA] The Shepherd's outfit
looks even better on you

42
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,791
than I thought it would.

43
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,041
I agree! You look
positively heroic, Sorey!

44
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,833
Oh, look, the pig's
wearing lipstick!

45
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,583
Just admit it: you're jealous
of how dashing I look.

46
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,083
I am nothing of
the sort, thank you.

47
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,291
[laughs]

48
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,666
[ALISHA]
Who are you talking to?

49
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,291
Are there Seraphim there?

50
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,666
Oh. Sure are.
This one here is Mikleo.

51
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,500
[MIKLEO grunts]
Hey! Uh--

52
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,500
Ah! Sorey!

53
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,083
[SOREY]
And this is Lailah.

54
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,250
The one everyone calls
the Lady of the Lake.

55
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,375
She's much better
looking than Mikleo.

56
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,125
I felt it when I met you.

57
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,666
Part of me knew you were
going to become the Shepherd.

58
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,041
Now here you are.

59
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,708
You can wield the sacred
blade and see the Seraphim.

60
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,416
but I feel powerless to help.

61
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,541
[LAILAH] But, Alisha,
you aren't powerless!

62
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,500
She can't hear us, you know.

63
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,083
[LAILAH growls]

64
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,500
Let's try something.

65
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,000
I want you to go over there
and hold Alisha's hand.

66
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,208
[SOREY]
Uh...

67
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,750
You're going to be a conduit.

68
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,250
A channel for our voices.

69
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,958
I'll send them to
Alisha through you.

70
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,583
Ah!

71
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,791
Alisha!

72
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,083
Do you think holding
your hand will help?

73
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,375
[SOREY]
Mm!

74
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,666
Hello, Alisha.

75
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,791
Can you hear me? I am Lailah.

76
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,958
[MIKLEO]
Doesn't seem to be working.

77
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,500
She can't hear a thing.

78
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,208
[LAILAH]
Hm...

79
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,583
Ah! All right, let's try
this. Close your eyes.

80
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,666
[SOREY]
Okay.

81
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,458
Uh... Hi, Alisha.
Can you hear my voice?

82
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,375
Still no luck.

83
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,083
[MIKLEO] Maybe Sorey isn't
concentrating hard enough.

84
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,083
How is this my fault?

85
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,916
Focus, Sorey! Keep your
eyes closed tight.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,791
I think you may also
need to pinch your nose

87
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,708
and hold your breath.

88
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,333
[SOREY]
What?!

89
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,458
What's wrong?

90
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,708
Sorry. This might
look a little weird.

91
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,541
[inhales]

92
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,958
Hello, Alisha!

93
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:38,291
[gasps] I heard it!
That was a girl's voice!

94
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,750
You heard her?

95
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,041
And that sounded like a boy.

96
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,500
Was it Mikleo?

97
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,291
Uh. Y-Yeah, it is.

98
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,791
[ALISHA]
Greetings, Seraph Mikleo!

99
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,666
I humbly beg you to
forgive my rudeness.

100
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,375
[MIKLEO]
Uh-- Y-You've never struck me

101
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,041
as being particularly rude.

102
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,250
Please remember, most
humans can not see us.

103
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,291
But we Seraphim can
see into your hearts.

104
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,291
It is vital that your kind
not forget the Seraphim.

105
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,916
As we are forgotten, the
malevolence strengthens,

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,708
and with that,
calamity shall rise.

107
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,250
I heard you in Elysia.

108
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,125
I know that you haven't
forgotten about us, Alisha.

109
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:15,666
[SOREY] Seriously, there has
got to be a better way!

110
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,375
[gasps, inhales]

111
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,958
[SOREY pants]

112
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,500
Can we please try it
one more time?

113
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,708
[SOREY laughs nervously]

114
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,250
Seriously! There has
got to be a better way!

115
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,541
It'll get easier.

116
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,041
Blocking your senses
helps you concentrate.

117
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,291
As you gain more experience,

118
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,125
you may find it
becomes unnecessary.

119
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,416
Are you serious?

120
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,125
You mean that one day
I could actually deliver

121
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,625
the voice of the
Seraphim to everyone?

122
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,291
To the entire world?

123
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,250
No, Alisha's special.

124
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,583
She was born with talents that
most humans don't possess.

125
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:51,750
Oh, I see. Sorry, I guess
it isn't that simple.

126
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,708
Still. I was able to
talk to the Seraphim.

127
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,500
To hear their voices at last.

128
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,708
I can't tell you how
much that means to me.

129
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,166
It's like a dream.

130
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,916
All of your doubts are gone?

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,083
Yes!

132
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,291
[knocking, door clicks]

133
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,500
[MAID 5A]
Pardon me.

134
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,208
Forgive the intrusion,
Your Highness, but it's time.

135
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,875
I'll leave shortly. Thank you.

136
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,083
Well, I have to be on my way.

137
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,541
I'm sorry, but I'm
expected at the castle.

138
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,875
It's okay.

139
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,375
Why don't we go, too?

140
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,291
I think it would do you good
to explore the town a bit.

141
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,875
Huh?

142
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,458
[SOREY]
What's all this?

143
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,875
Word has spread quickly
about the arrival

144
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,750
of the Shepherd.
The flags started going up.

145
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,833
No one ordered it done.
In their hearts,

146
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,791
the people have been
waiting for the Shepherd.

147
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,750
They were just
too afraid to hope.

148
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,500
[ALISHA]
What is it? Is something wrong?

149
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,125
[SOREY gasps]
Well, uh...

150
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,958
Honestly, when you talk
about it like that,

151
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,833
it kinda starts
to make me nervous.

152
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,333
[MIKLEO]
Really?

153
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,083
I didn't think you were even
capable of getting nervous.

154
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,625
I am.

155
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,750
[SOREY]
Thanks for the ride.

156
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,458
That would've been a long walk.

157
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,291
It was no trouble at all.

158
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,791
I'll see you soon.

159
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,583
Let's have a look around.

160
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,833
[groans]

161
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,500
Are you okay?

162
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,291
Sorry, I just... felt kinda
sick all of a sudden.

163
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,083
But I'm sure it'll go away soon.

164
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,958
Earlier you said you
were feeling much better.

165
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,250
Were you just pretending?

166
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,458
I swear. I was doing
fine this morning.

167
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,791
But... it got worse
as we came into town.

168
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,458
[LAILAH]
It's the malevolence.

169
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,333
Your body is reacting to it.

170
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,875
Malevolence? Like home...

171
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,625
I think... it's a
separate malevolence.

172
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,375
From another source.

173
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,500
[LAILAH]
Where is the source?

174
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,166
I wish I could tell you,
but I don't know.

175
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,625
You are the Shepherd now.

176
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,875
You can do this. Try to feel it.

177
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,166
Close your eyes and concentrate.

178
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,791
[SOREY]
It's down there.

179
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,791
If you're up to it,

180
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,708
I think we should
go take a look.

181
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,500
Don't worry, I'll be okay.

182
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,666
I mean, I don't feel great,

183
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,916
but not nearly
as bad as before.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,833
I want answers, too.

185
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,583
Why are these ruins so
full of malevolence?

186
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,416
[BARTLOW]
Your Highness.

187
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,833
We understand you
have been sheltering

188
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,333
the so-called Shepherd
at your private estate.

189
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,250
We ask you to hand him over.

190
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,125
Hand him over to you?

191
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,666
What does that mean?

192
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,416
[BARTLOW]
He has immense power.

193
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,250
It would be best if
he were kept someplace

194
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,166
where we can easily control him.

195
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,458
Surely you see that.

196
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm afraid not.

197
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,458
You're willing to
defy the collective

198
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,625
will of the council?

199
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,041
Yes, if I must.

200
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,666
I will not put the
Shepherd into your hands.

201
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:19,041
[knocking]

202
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,333
--[hollow knocking]
--[gasps]

203
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,666
There's definitely a door here.

204
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,000
I agree.

205
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,541
But there's no sign of a
handle or a lock anywhere.

206
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,416
Can only mean one thing.

207
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,166
[SOREY] It means that we've
found a sealed door.

208
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,250
A sealed door? What do you mean?

209
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,541
Like a hidden passage.

210
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,291
I'd say there's something
behind this wall

211
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,875
that somebody doesn't
want people to know about.

212
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,416
If it is a kind of
seal, there should

213
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,166
be some key or trigger
nearby that'll open it.

214
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,833
How 'bout this?

215
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,083
Ha, ha!

216
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,458
Well, I'm impressed!

217
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,583
How did you even know
what to look for?

218
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,583
[SOREY] When you spend as
much time exploring ruins

219
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,250
as we have, you pick
up some stuff.

220
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,666
Look at this!

221
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,458
[SOREY] The crest of
Hyland's royal family.

222
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,166
[gasps]

223
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,625
Ah! Is something wrong?

224
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,041
I completely forgot to
give this back to Alisha.

225
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:20,583
[gasps] Wait, this might just
be what we need to open it.

226
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,333
Pretty lucky for us you're
such a scatterbrain.

227
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,166
[SOREY]
Let's go!

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,416
This is quite a place.

229
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,625
[SOREY]
Yeah.

230
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:03,041
Feel the malevolence?
It's so strong here.

231
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,208
[gasps]

232
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,708
A dragon statue?

233
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,791
Certainly wasn't expecting that.

234
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,833
Mm.

235
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,958
Aren't they supposed
to be bad luck?

236
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,708
They're far worse than bad luck.

237
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:20,250
They bring evil. Harbingers
of death and destruction.

238
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,666
You don't put up a statue
like that by accident.

239
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,583
There is definitely something
wrong with these ruins.

240
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,375
[SOREY] The malevolence
is a lot thicker here, too.

241
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,250
Is it the statue? Is that
where it's coming from?

242
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,833
[LAILAH]
No.

243
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,583
The statue's not the source.

244
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,375
It's coming from something else.

245
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,000
Something nearby.

246
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,375
It feels like... a Hellion.

247

--[bats squeaking]
--[wings flapping]

248
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,166
There!

249
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,208
[gasps] What is that?

250
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,708
[SOREY]
Bats?

251
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,750
[grunts]

252
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,583
[SOREY]
So many!

253
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,875
[MIKLEO]
A whole colony, and they've been

254
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,708
turned into Hellions.

255
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:09,875
Quick, Sorey!

256
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,125
I got it!

257
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,875
[SOREY grunting]

258
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,833
Hah! I got 'em!

259
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,791
[MIKLEO grunts]

260
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,708
Help Mikleo!

261
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,750
[SOREY grunts]

262
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,291
[SOREY]
You okay back there?

263
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,791
Yeah.

264
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,708
It's no good.
There are too many.

265
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,958
I have an idea.

266
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,333
Run toward the Hellions
and disperse them again.

267
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,958
Then I'll try to purify
them all using my fire.

268
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,250
Let's do this!

269
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:51,625
[SOREY yells]

270
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,708
Lailah!

271
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,625
Dance for me, bright flames,

272
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,375
in a crimson storm.
Flare Vortex!

273
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,291
That was awesome, Lailah!

274
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,500
Thank you.

275
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,541
Are you holding up all right?

276
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,791
Yeah. Not a scratch on me.

277
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,791
Maybe not, but I'm
sure you're tired.

278
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,250
It makes sense.

279
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,750
Being bonded to me must be
a drain on your own energy.

280
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,875
[SOREY]
Mm.

281
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,333
[LAILAH]
I can make it easier on you.

282
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,083
If you find yourself
getting tired,

283
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,166
simply ask me to go inside.

284
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,083
What's that mean?

285
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,458

Whoa!

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,208
[LAILAH]
Does it make sense now?

288
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,708
You can carry me inside
yourself, like this.

289
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,708
[SOREY]
Okay. I get it!

290
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,625
It's freaky, but I get it!

291
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,083
[SOREY pants]

292
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,875
[SOREY]
You coulda warned me first.

293
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,250
Also,

294
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,791
there may be times when you
will need to form a pact

295
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,291
with other Seraphim.

296
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,083
Such pacts will grant you
great power, as ours does.

297
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,583
But you must remember that
there will always be a cost.

298
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,791
Don't worry.

299
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,083
There's much to learn,
but you'll learn it.

300
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,125
[SOREY]
Thanks.

301
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,333
It does feel
overwhelming sometimes.

302
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,166
Sorey.

303
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,458
I feel it, too.

304
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,125
We may have got the bats,
but the malevolence

305
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,666
isn't gone yet.

306
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,041
Let's keep going.

307
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,708
Whatever the source is.
It's deeper inside.

308
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,541
It's so dark here.

309
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,166
[gasps]

310
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:46,083
What is this place? It's awful!

311
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,000
[LAILAH]
Now you see.

312
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,666
This is why the ruins
have been kept sealed.

313
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,416
I don't understand.

314
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
What happened?

315
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,208
You know, don't you?

316
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,041
These people were killed.

317
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,458
They rebelled against
their rulers,

318
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,416
and as punishment, they
were secretly slaughtered.

319
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,333
They left darkness
in their wake.

320
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:15,875
Desires, fierce, hate, all of
that has become the malevolence.

321
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,666
All of that has
spawned the Hellions.

322
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,500
But why here? Why weren't
they buried properly?

323
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,166
[gasps]

324
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,583
As I said, their deaths

There are things rulers

What about Alisha?

Does she know?

329

You knew this. You must have.

330
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,458
You brought me into
town to show me.

331
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,583
The Shepherd has
one ultimate goal,

332
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:54,958
and that is to purify the
source of all malevolence.

333
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,875
The Lord of Calamity.

00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,375
I've never heard
that name before.

335
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,208
[LAILAH] The Lord of Calamity
is no ordinary person.

336
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,791
He is more dangerous
than you can imagine.

337
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,625
The amount of malevolence
he releases is great enough

338
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,291
that it can alter the very
workings of the world.

339
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,791
So defeating him
is my true goal.

00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,750
Just tell me how and
I'll do anything I can.

[LAILAH] There is still
so much you do not know.

342
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,666
If you were to encounter
the Lord of Calamity now,

343
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,791
you would simply be engulfed
by the malevolence.

344
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,291
I'm sorry.

345

I can help by guiding you,
but I can't tell you what to do.

That's an answer you're going
to have to find for yourself.

00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,125
And how do I do that?

[LAILAH]
Travel the world.

349
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,000
Learn about it and yourself.
Seek knowledge.

When the time comes,

when you have discovered
your own answer,

352
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:49,125
then you will be ready
to shatter malevolence.

353
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:56,166
Should be simple enough as long
as you don't overthink it.

354
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,000
You just go around the
world learning about stuff.

Is the malevolence causing

Yes! But it's strong.
