1
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,000
[SERGEI]
Welcome, Sorey.

2
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,250
[SOREY]
Sergei, hey.

3
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,083
I'm glad to see
that you're safe.

4
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,875
Your disappearance
was so sudden.

5
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,791
I was worried about you.

6
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,541
I'm happy to see
that you're free.

7
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,416
Pleasant though Groodman's
hospitality may be,

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,333
I grew a bit tired of it.

9
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,666
Looks big.

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,791
Yes, a fitting home for
Emperor Doran of Rolance.

11
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,791
[SOREY] So, this is where
the emperor lives?

12
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,666
Indeed, and as such, this
estate is beyond the reach

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,583
of Groodman and his
Blue Storm Knights.

14
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,125
Your majesty.

15
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,875
[DORAN]
You must be the Shepherd.

16
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:03,791
[SOREY]
I am.

17
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,291
It's an honor to meet you.

18
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,458
The honor is mine.

19
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,083
Thank you for travelling
so far to aid us.

20
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,375
You're welcome in Rolance,
as are your friends.

21
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,416
Please, your majesty.
There was no need

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,916
for you to come out in
the rain at this hour.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,291
Shall we go inside?

24
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,625
[DORAN]
Don't concern yourself, Sergei.

25
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,625
I invited the Shepherd
here, after all.

26
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,916
Greeting him is the
least I could do.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,875
Please, Shepherd, follow me.

28
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,166
[EGUILLE] Well, here we are,
honored guests of the emperor,

29
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,000
ruler of Rolance, and Prince
Konan's father. What now?

30
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,375
Nothing. Konan's dead.

31
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,958
We have our revenge.

32
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,916
I don't care about
what happens next.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,666
[EGUILLE]
How can you say that?

34
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,333
What's happened to you?

35
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,875
They've taken the
Shepherd to another room.

36
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,583
I wonder what the emperor
wants to talk about.

37
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,416
[door opens]

38
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,916
Much nicer in here, yes?

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,666
Yes, thank you.

40
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,541
Sir Shepherd, I have a question.

41
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,458
Looking at Rolance
from your persepctive,

42
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,625
how does it appear to be doing?

43
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,625
To be honest, sir,
not very well.

44
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,458
[DORAN] You haven't been
here long. Are you certain?

45
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,666
Yes.

46
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,916
[DORAN] And is malevolence
to blame for it?

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,916
[gasps]

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,333
[SOREY]
Hold on, Your Majesty.

49
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,500
Are you saying you
can see malevolence?

50
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,416
[DORAN]
No, it is invisible to my eyes.

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,958
[SOREY] Then how could
you have known to ask?

52
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,500
The night is still young.

53
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,000
Perhaps we can chat a while.

54
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,166
The imperial family
of Rolance has worked

55
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,083
tirelessly over the generations

56
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,958
to ensure that our lineage
would remain unbroken.

57
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,625
We fight to remain in power
not out of ambition and avarice,

58
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,333
but a sense of duty
to preserve the empire

59
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,416
we were destined to lead.

60
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,833
There's a legend regarding
the history of the world

61
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,416
known only to the
imperial family.

62
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,000
We must protect that
secret and pass it on.

63
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,333
It's not a task we take lightly.

64
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,250
From the legend,
we've learned a great deal.

65
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,958
It taught us of malevolence.

66
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,000
Though, like most, we cannot
see it with our own eyes.

67
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,416
Where did you first
hear it--this legend?

68
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,041
[DORAN]
How we came to learn it

69
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,125
is its own tale.

70
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,541
Tell me, Shepherd.

71
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,750
On your travels, have you
heard of the Storyteller?

72
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,916
[gasps] Yeah, Mavin!

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,750
[DORAN]
Indeed.

74
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,541
Mavin is actually a title
given to the Storytellers

75
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,208
that have existed
since ancient times.

76
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,083
Years ago, they broke an oath
when they revealed a secret

77
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,166
to my family, one that told much

78
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,166
about how the world came
to be what it is now.

79
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,041
The legend you mentioned before.

80
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,166
The Storytellers' secret

81
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,250
had something to do
with malevolence?

82
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,583
[DORAN]
Yes.

83
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,583
It's a tale that goes back
several thousand years.

84
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,416
[DORAN]
According to the Storytellers,

85
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,875
someone attempted to rid
the world of malevolence

86
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,291
by stripping the emotions
from all of humanity.

87
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,541
As we know,

88
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,583
though malevolence is
born of human emotions,

89
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,250
it is invisible to
the human eye, and so,

90
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,625
all those years ago,

91
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,583
it had spread through
the world quickly,

92
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,083
unnoticed by the very people

93
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,875
whose hearts had
given rise to it.

94
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,083
But then, something happened

95
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,750
that would change the
course of the world.

96
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,166
[DORAN] To combat the plague
that had infected the world,

97
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,708
a figure who is known now only
in legend performed a ritual.

98
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,500
The ritual was designed
to steal all human emotion

99
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,666
in hopes of
eliminating malevolence.

100
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,875
But one person
remained untouched.

101
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,541
According to the legend,
that person's name

102
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,458
was Velvet Crowe.

103
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,583
Please, Your Majesty, go on.

104
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,208
Crowe hated the one who
had performed the ritual.

105
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,583
That hatred became
an all-consuming fire.

106
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,083
So it began.

107
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:22,125
Crowe's rage gave rise to
this era, one rife with chaos.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,166
Hey, Dezel, you there?

109
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,666
Right here.

110
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,625
I don't like it,
being blind to so much.

111
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,583
Is there some way I can
learn to see malevolence?

112
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,958
[DEZEL]
Why would you wanna do that?

113
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,708
All I've ever wanted
is to help the weak.

114
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,125
I still do.

115
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,666
If you're serious,
there is a way.

116
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,625
At ease, soldier.

117
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm Groodman, captain of
the Blue Storm Knights.

118
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,125
I request an audience
with the emperor.

119
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,500
In truth, what I seek
is an end to the conflict.

120
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,291
Doesn't matter how
many wars you win,

121
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,375
another one always
seems to follow.

122
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:18,416
I want what is best for my
empire, and that means peace.

123
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,250
We've received word of a
growing conflict in Hyland,

124
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,750
where civil war has
apparently broken out.

125
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,125
From the reports,
it seems Princess Alisha

126
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,000
has been arrested for treason.

127
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,250
How can that be?

128
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,708
[knocking]

129
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,916
Enter.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,166
[SERGEI]
Pardon me.

131
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,583
Sire. Captain Groodman
of the Blue Storm Knights

132
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,625
is here requesting
an audience with you.

133
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,625
[DORAN]
I'm rather popular tonight...

134
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,416
All right. What's the plan?

135
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,291
Back to Hyland?

136
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,916
[whispering] First we have
to see to Pendrago.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,083
Believe me, I'm
worried about Alisha,

138
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,083
but I can't leave Rolance
when it's in this much danger.

139
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,458
Your Majesty.

140
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,916
Are you leaving us?

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,708
Yes. Thank you for everything.

142
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,875
I must hurry.

143
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,500
We need to cleanse
Pendrago of malevolence

144
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,916
as quickly as we can.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,166
[DORAN]
In that case,

146
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,416
I hope you will
allow me to escort you.

147
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,416
Uh...

148
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,833
You see.

149
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,750
I've heard that the cathedral's
doors have been barred.

150
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,000
Why would that be?

151
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,416
Unless the church
has something to hide.

152
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,833
If you wish to begin
your investigation there,

153
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,125
I suspect that my presence
may be of some use to you.

154
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,166
Sergei, speak with Groodman.

155
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,916
Let's allow him and
his Blue Storm Knights

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,333
to witness what happens.

157
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,958
Sire!

158
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,375
So, is that acceptable to you?

159
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,708
[gasps]

160
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,875
What is it?

161
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,291
[ROSE]
Sorey.

162
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,125
We need to talk.

163
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,750
[ROSE]
All right, listen.

164
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,250
I want to negotiate
a deal with you.

165
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,500
[SOREY]
A deal?

166
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,916
[ROSE]
Mm-hm.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,416
There is something I want
that only you can give me.

168
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,625
In return, of course, I mean
to offer you something, as well.

169
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,458
It would be a fair deal.

170
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,875
[SOREY]
Hm.

171
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,250
You know what I do now.

172
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,041
I kill people--those who
spread evil. All this time,

173
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,250
I believed what I was
doing was righteous.

174
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,708
Thought I was making
the world a better place.

175
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,291
But...

176
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,291
I'm beginning to see that some
things can't be fixed that way.

177
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,625
Malevolence--

178
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,083
that's what's tearing
the world apart right now.

179
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,541
But, how am I supposed
to fight something

180
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,625
if I can't even see
it with my own eyes?

181
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,666
Turns out there's a way.

182
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,916
If I want to continue to change
the world for the better,

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,666
I must become your Squire.

184
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,208
I know the Shepherd
is the ultimate savior,

185
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,458
but still, no matter how
great your powers may be,

186
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,958
you're just one person.

187
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,541
Even you must need
help sometimes.

188
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,416
A Squire? You sure?

189
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,666
It makes sense.

190
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,625
I would get to continue
my fight, and in return,

191
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,666
you would have my support.

192
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,041
Tell me all there is to know
about becoming a Squire.

193
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,208
All the benefits and hardships.

194
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,291
[LAILAH] Actually, it might be
better for me to answer that.

195
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,708
Lailah.

196
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,750
[gasps] You're sitting
right there, aren't you?

197
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,583
[LAILAH]
Listen carefully.

198
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,750
You say that what you want is to
fight the darkness in the world

199
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,291
and if you choose to
become Sorey's Squire,

200
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,041
you would be abe to do
all that and more.

201
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,750
[ROSE] Mm-hm. I got
that part on my own.

202
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,708
What else?

203
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,208
Power has it's cost.

204
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,833
The task is to aid Sorey.

205
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,541
As his Squire, you'd
help purify malevolence.

206
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,083
But even with help,
he may yet fail.

207
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,958
He could die before
reaching his goal.

208
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,833
And if Sorey's life were
lost, yours would be, too.

209
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,041
That's the cost.

210
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,083
[LAILAH]
Yes.

211
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,208
With the pact comes great power,

212
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,833
but the price you pay
is your life.

213
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,875
I didn't know about that!

214
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,125
It's a greater price than
I would ask anyone to pay.

215
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,458
Alisha... She should've
known the risks.

216
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,750
But she did.

217
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,375
Alisha knew exactly
what she was getting into.

218
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,166
She knew it might cost her life.

219
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,583
But even with all these
dangers, she still insisted.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,375
All right, is there
anything else?

221
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,791
There is more.

222
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,958
You might see the power you'll
be granted as a benefit.

223
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,458
That's not always the case.

224
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,875
Sometimes, you'll find it
more of a burden.

225
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,875
Get to the point already.

226
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,166
Among the Squire's
powers is the ability

227
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,375
to take some of the malevolence
that the Shepard accepts.

228
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,791
But there's no guarantee

229
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,166
that it won't be far more
than you can handle.

230
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,666
How does it work?

231
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,583
During purification,
the Shepherd becomes a vessel.

232
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,458
He accepts malevolence inside
him, and if he has a Squire,

233
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,958
they can assume
a portion of this

234
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,666
after it has passed through him.

235
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,166
I gotta say, you're
not makin' the job

236
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,375
sound terribly attractive.

237
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,416
Anything else I should know?

238
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,416
No. That's more
than enough for now.

239
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,458
All right.

240
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,208
It sounds like
a fair arrangement.

241
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,541
What do ya say, Sorey? You in?

242
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,458
There is one more thing
you should know, though.

243
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,291
With each additional Squire,
the burden on you will increase.

244
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,833
Though, given your
current powers,

245
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't think you'll
experience major difficulties.

246
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,083
[SOREY]
Tell me, Rose.

247
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,583
When you look out at the city,
what does it make you feel?

248
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,916
I don't really know.

249
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,333
I guess it's pretty
gloomy out there.

250
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:41,791
Right now, my chest feels tight
and my every sense is on fire.

251
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,583
My insides are all twisted up.

252
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,333
This isn't something
I wanna force on anyone,

253
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,500
and if I'd understood before,
I wouldn't have.

254
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,833
I should bear this
pain on my own.

255
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,583
[ROSE]
Should you?

256
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,625
See, when I know there's
a threat out there,

257
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,708
I always prefer
to face it head-on.

258
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,166
I'm not the only one.

259
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,791
I'd bet our princess friend
would say the same thing.

260
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,375
[grunts]

261
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,208
[LAILAH]
The emperor was right.

262
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,125
It's coming from the cathedral.

263
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,458
[SOREY]
Yeah.

264
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,250
It's thick. Practically solid.

265
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,958
So, is this malevolence?

266
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,708
You can feel it now, right?

267
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:43,041
I don't know how to explain,
something just seems wrong.

268
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,083
She feels it. She can
sense the malevolence.

269
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,708
It resonates within her.

270
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,875
Consider it, Sorey.

271
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,000
If she becomes your Squire,

272
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,458
she could greatly
enhance your powers.

273
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,583
[SOREY]
Lailah.

274
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes?

275
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,625
I didn't understand the price
she would have to pay.

276
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,125
There's no way I can
ask this of her.

277
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,625
But...

278
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,583
If she believes this is the
way to fulfill her purpose,

279
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,666
so be it.

280
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,125
Good.

281
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,541
Well, Shepherd?

282
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,000
[SOREY]
Your Majesty.

283
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,291
Is this the place
you're looking for?

284
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,625
Yes. This is it.

285
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,625
There's darkness within.

286
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,500
[MASEDRA]
Your Majesty. I beg your pardon.

287
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:28,666
It has been so long.
How may I serve you today?

288
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,458
Hello, Masedra.

289
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,958
To start, drop the
pretense of respect.

290
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,583
It doesn't suit you.

291
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,333
I'm here accompanying
the Shepherd,

292
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,333
who has graciously traveled
to our land to lend us his aid.

293
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,458
[MASEDRA] What an honor
to meet you, Shepherd.

294
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,500
Welcome to the
capital of Rolance

295
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,458
and to Pendrago's
great cathedral.

296
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,750
I am its leader, Masedra.

297
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,250
Something's wrong here.

298
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,500
Please hurry. There's no time.

299
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,750
Right.

300
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,833
We'd like to see inside
the cathedral, please.

301
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,208
Unfortunately, the interior
is off-limits at the moment.

302
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,041
Perhaps I can offer you
a tour of the grounds

303
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,500
or the perimeter
buildings instead?

304
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,958
[DORAN]
Masedra!

305
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,458
This is not a request.

306
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,416
I'm sorry. I can't...

307
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,208
Enough already!

308
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,375
[MASEDRA yelps]

309
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,833
[SOREY]
Let's go!

310
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,583
Stop!

311
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,208
It's coming from over there.

312
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,125
[SOREY]
This is it.

313
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,208
[gasps]

314
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,708
[ROSE gasps]

315
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,666
[ROSE]
What is that?

316
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,833
It was a dragon.

317
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,416
It's gone now. There's
no more life in it.

318
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,083
[LAILAH]
The malevolence is astounding.

319
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,166
Even though it has
passed into death,

320
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,833
it still pours from the dragon.

321
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,458
There's so much pain here.

322
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,541
Even death and time
couldn't erase it.

323
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,333
Too strong.

324
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,208
Sorey, what are you
going to do with it?

325
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,875
Purify it.

326
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,458
I don't know if it'll
work, but I have to try.

327
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,666
Not alone.

328
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,500
If you and Rose work
together, perhaps then.

329
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,000
Not happening.

330
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,250
[LAILAH] If she became your
Squire, she could help you.

331
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,833
That's a separate
discussion entirely.

332
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,833
I'll do this on my own.

333
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,166
What do you see here?

334
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,333
What does this place look
like through your eyes?

335
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,541
It's a fog.

336
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,208
A fiery mist
surrounding everything.

337
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,875
Malevolence.

338
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,000
[ROSE]
Hearing you describe it,

339
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,791
it sounds pretty
terrifying, actually,

340
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,458
but no matter how
frightening it may be,

341
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,333
I still wanna see it.

342
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,583
You're sure?

343
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,583
Basically, my job would
be to help you out

344
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,500
and keep you from dying.

345
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,458
Oh, and, if there's
too much of it,

346
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,125
take some of the excess
malevolence off your hands.

347
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,458
Does that about cover it?

348
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,625
I agree to the terms.

349
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,375
So, we have ourselves a deal.

350
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,958
Do I get one of those
true names now?

351
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,750
How do you know about the--

352
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,708
All right, then.

353
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,666
But, you can still take
some time to think it over.

354
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,375
I don't need to.

355
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,708
It won't be easy.

356
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,625
I don't expect it
to be. It's okay.

357
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,166
'Cause the most important
things in life never are.

358

Ready, Lailah?

359
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,458
Yes.

360
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:47,250
Now, please grant
Rose a true name.

You are Wilkis Wilk.

[ROSE gasps]
This is what you were seeing?

363
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,666
To get rid of it,
I must purify the dragon.

364
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,250
Will you carry the
malevolence with me?

365
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,166
Yes, I will. Go.

366
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,791
Hear me, lost soul.

367
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,916
The Shepherd has come

Sorey!

Grab hold.

I need to send some of
the malevolence your way.

Yeah, got it.

Just stay focused.

We'll hold the others off.

How long is this
going to take, anyway?

Ha! Thanks a lot, guys!
Rose, let's go!

[DEZEL]
Rose!

389
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,750
We should never have
asked her to try

390
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,500
against so much malevolence.

391
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,625
Dragons are fierce
even in death.

No! She can't die!

Come on.

You guys really think
it's that easy to kill me?

No way!

You're safe.

Jeez, I'm sore all over.

00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,250
That was tough.

401
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,291
And you usually handle
this type of thing alone?

402
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,333
You deserve a
medal or something.

You, too.

Yes. I hear you.

Is something wrong?
I'm listening.

Yes. Loud and clear.

I'm glad I found you.

I'm with allies on the
outskirts of Ladylake.

I heard a rumor that
you'd been arrested.

I'm free for now.

[ALISHA] However, Bartlow has
charged me with treason.

My friends and I are fugitives.

More importantly,
Ladylake is in trouble.

I need your help, Sorey.

Can you come immediately?

It's bad. There's

Right. Let's go.

We ride for Hyland.

So, Mikleo, can you make
soft-serve ice cream?

Sure can.

Cool!

00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,875
Let's open an ice cream shop

Yeah, maybe no.

[EDNA]
Excuse me, as Mibo's manager,


435
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,750
all business deals need
to be approved by me.


436
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,166
I did not hire you
as my manager.

It'll be 10,000 gald a month.


438
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,625
Mibo is basically an
ice cream machine on two legs.


439
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,875
I would call that a fair price.

Why aren't you listening to me?


441

That's a ridiculous price.

Nine thousand.

Seven thousand.

Eight thousand.

That's my final offer.
Take it or leave it.


447

I suppose I could
go as high as 7,500,
