1
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,041
The bridge.

2
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,541
There is no way that we
can get to Marlind now.

3
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,708
We have to!
They need this medicine.

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,250
[MALTRAN]
Look at these rapids.

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,541
No boat is going to make the
crossing until they die down.

6
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,208
[MALTRAN]
Alisha!

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,208
[ALISHA]
With a river this long,

8
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,250
there must be
another way across.

9
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,333
Right there!

10
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,916
[ALISHA] Marlind needs us.
I just hope we're not too late!

11
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,333
Will you be all right?

12
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:59,250
I'll be fine. Let's go.

13
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:06,500
You are going to find a way help
my brother, like you promised?

14
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:07,833
Sure am!

15
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,375
Sorey.

16
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,375
[EDNA]
Some random book is the reason

17
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,291
you want to go to Rolance?

18
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,625
[SOREY]
Not random.

19
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,625
Even so. I mean, how can
you be sure it's reliable?

20
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,125
[LAILAH]
It's a sacred text.

21
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,083
He takes <i>The Celestial</i>
<i>Record</i> very seriously.

22
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,375
Apparently, there are ruins in
Rolance that pertain to dragons,

23
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,833
some where they were
even enshrined as gods.

24
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,125
You got all this from that book?

25
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,416
[SOREY]
Mm.

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,875
That's right. So I say
we head for Rolance.

27
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,291
Are you with me?

28
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,166
I don't know for sure if we'll
find what we need there,

29
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,416
but it seems like a
good place to begin.

30
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,666
Okay. Gotta start somewhere.

31
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,916
Um, Sorey?

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,708
Since drawing the Sacred Blade,

33
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,416
you have purified creatures
that were turned into hellions

34
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,375
and dispelled malevolence that
was clinging to the earth.

35
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,458
So I have a question.

36
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,166
Think before you answer.

37
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,500
What is purification to you?

38
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,750
I don't really know.

39
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,791
I haven't thought about it in
those kind of terms before.

40
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,875
Seems like the kind of thing

41
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,875
a Shepherd oughta
think about to me.

42
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,041
[LAILAH]
While you travel the world,

43
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,041
you will fight many hellions.

44
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,791
They vary widely
in form and strength.

45
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,583
I don't doubt you have
the courage to face them.

46
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,041
I've seen it in you.

47
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,125
I know that you are brave
and true, Sorey.

48
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,208
But bravery is not enough.

49
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,458
Facing hellion after hellion
can wear away at you.

50
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,291
One day the malevolence
may take you as well.

51
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,750
One day, but then,
what should I do?

52
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,958
You learn to fight with your
mind as well as your sword.

53
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,166
[SOREY]
What's that mean?

54
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,666
Well...

55
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,000
[gasps]

56
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,791
I want you to think of
the fire as a hellion

57
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,791
and try purifying it.

58
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:45,166
[LAILAH] You must find a way
to understand the malevolence.

59
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,541
It's not an answer
I can give you,

60
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,541
but one you must
discover on your own.

61
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,291
[gasps]

62
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,541
Got a ways to go.

63
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,000
Whew, that'll really
wear a guy out.

64
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,833
This is only the beginning.

65
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,666
You've never purified a
hellionized person before.

66
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,416
We must ensure you're ready
when the time comes.

67
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,750
[LAILAH]
As I thought.

68
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,875
Sorey has the potential to
be a truly great Shepherd.

69
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,375
Still, as well
intentioned as it is,

70
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,916
his desire to help people
may get him into trouble

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,125
he can't get out of alone.

72
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,458
Mikleo. I hope your journey
has been a success.

73
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,416
I fear that we will be
needing you very soon.

74
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,958
[screaming]

75
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,541
Just leave me alone!

76
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,208
Go away, go away!

77
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,750
[screams]

78
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,875
I don't have the
power to purify.

79
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,791
Normin Power! Go!

80
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,125
That power was you?

81
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:34,166
Sure was. I am pooped!

82
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,583
[laughing]

83
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,583
That really hits the spot!

84
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:47,375
Alrighty. You said your
name was Mikleo, huh?

85
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,500
Thanks a lot for your help
with that hellion back there.

86
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,583
[MIKLEO]
Yeah, sure.

87
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,291
So tell me, are you
a Normin Seraph?

88
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,708
Yep, I sure am.

89
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,041
Normin Seraph extraordinaire,
Atakk, at your service!

90
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,625
Nice to meet 'cha.

91
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,291
I'm actually pretty surprised
you've even heard of us before,

92
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,000
considering you're
a youngin' and all.

93
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,208
[MIKLEO] My foster father
told me about you.

94
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,500
He said that humans and Seraphim
used to get along better

95
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:15,041
in part because members of
your kind were everywhere.

96
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,458
But that was a long
time ago now.

97
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,666
You know it!

98
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,541
We Normin Seraphim may be small,

99
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,458
and on our own we're
not the strongest,

100
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,500
but we've got the ability
to boost the power

101
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,458
of other Seraphim, and that
makes us handy to have.

102
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,500
Yeah, that was
something back there.

103
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,375
Unfortunately, it didn't
purify the hellion.

104
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,958
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,416
If this forest is your home,

106
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,375
you may need to
leave for a while.

107
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,583
Yeah, you're probably
right. It's not safe.

108
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,000
But if you're just
passin' through,

109
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,916
where are you headed
off to, Mikleo?

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,791
[MIKLEO] Me? Well,
you see that dark cloud?

111
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,916
That's where I'm going.

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,291
It's no normal cloud.

113
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,250
I can sense a tide
of malevolence,

114
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,458
heavy enough to drown the world.

115
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,791
Oh, that?

116
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,333
Yeah, it's been hanging
around for a few days now.

117
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,291
But if trouble's a brewin',
why would you wanna go there?

118
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,250
To find a friend who
may need my help.

119
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,041
For a friend?

120
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,750
How 'bout this?

121
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,916
I don't have any place
to go right now,

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,375
so I'll come along with you!

123
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,833
We made a good team against
that hellion back there.

124
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:25,041
If we stick together, I bet
we can fight off anything!

125
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,041
What do you say? Huh?

126
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,833
Sure, that sounds great.

127
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,791
Glad to have you along, Atakk.

128
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,083
What the--?

[SOLDIER A]
Sir Shepherd!

We have a message
from Princess Alisha.

136
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,625
[ALISHA]
It stopped?

137
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,625
That was so sudden.

138
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,833
Whatever this is,
it's no normal storm.

139
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,666
Listen, let's take advantage
of the break while it lasts.

stake and they need our help.

Our first priority

is getting the
medicine to Marlind.

145
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,375
We can ferry the rest
of the squad over there

146
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,333
once the river has calmed down.

147

Hopefully, that won't be--

148
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,125

It is a powerful hellion.

likely its doing.

00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,000
[SOREY]
Got it!

163
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,541
Edna!

164
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,541
Well, it's about time I got to
show off my Sub Lord powers.

165
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,333
Right. Hephsin Yulind!

166
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,291
[yells]

167
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,583
[EDNA] I suppose we make
an acceptable team.

168
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,541
Yeah! Let's end this
fight right now.

169
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,958
[SOREY]
What is that?

170
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,250
Another dragon?

171
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,166
[EDNA]
No, not a dragon, a drake.

172
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,625
Which is?

173
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,166
[EDNA] It's younger, not yet
swallowed by malevolence.

174
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,791
A drake! Then it can be
purified. Quick, Sorey!

175
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,583
[yells]

176
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,625
[EDNA]
If you want to purify it,

177
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,750
we're gonna have
to get to it first.

178
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,833
[SOREY]
Damn!

179
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,375
[MALTRAN] We have you to thank
once again, Shepherd.

180
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,333
[SOREY] No thanks needed.
Where's Alisha?

181
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,583
[MALTRAN]
She's not with us.

182
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,250
She and some of the troops
headed to Marlind

183
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,916
on a different route.

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,875
I hope she's safe.

185
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,291
She may not be.

186
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,583
Marlind is in the same direction
that the drake flew off.

187
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,375
[SOREY] Hey, Edna. Can you
do anything to help us out?

188
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,500
Haven't I done enough?
Seraphs get tired too, you know.

189
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,541
That said, once the
river dies down,

190
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,708
I can probably do something.

191
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,666
[ATAKK] Well, what a coinkydink!
You know Lailah, too? Ha!

192
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,500
I tell ya, it sure is a small
world we live in, ain't it?

193
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,041
How do you know Lailah?

194
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,583
I guess you could say,
the pretty lady and I,

195
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,666
we've got a bit of
a history, you see.

196
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,541
[MIKLEO]
Meaning?

197
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,708
[ATAKK]
Sorry.

198
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:27,958
I really shouldn't
say any more than that.

199
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,958
It's kind of a bit
of a delicate subject,

200
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,291
if you get what I mean. Heh.

201
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,000
Kind of a man-woman thing,
you might say.

202
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,333
Oh, a man-woman thing, huh?

203
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,833
[ATAKK]
Wow!

204
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,250
Would ya look how
huge that river is?!

205
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,750
No way we're getting across
there without a boat.

206
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:48,791
Hey, Mikleo. What do ya
think's going on down there?

207
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,583
What's this?

208
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,333
Yes, ma'am. It's like
they came outta nowhere.

209
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,500
Huge rocks suddenly appearing?

210
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,000
I would be willing
to bet good money

211
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,250
that the Shepherd had
something to do with this.

212
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,583
The Shepherd?

213
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,250
[SOLDIER D]
He put them there?

214
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,666
Do you have another explanation?

215
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,416
They didn't simply
fall from the sky.

216
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,166
Darn tootin'. That definitely
wasn't made by a human.

217
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,500
[MIKLEO] I can't believe it.
He's become so strong.

218
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,416
Well, we goin'?

219
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,375
Your buddy's waitin' on
the other side, ain't he?

220
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,625
Yeah.

221
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,791
[SOREY] Marlind, the second
biggest city in the kingdom.

222
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,250
This is it?

223
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,208
There's darkness here.

224
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,791
The town is drowning
in malevolence,

225
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,250
almost worse brother's domain.

226
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,416
[LAILAH]
Sorey?

227
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,250
[SOREY] This plague
is no regular illness.

228
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,250
That drake must be causing it.

229
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,125
[BOY A groaning]

230
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,458
It'll be all right.

231
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,416
The medicine just takes
a while to start working.

232
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,708
[SOREY]
Alisha!

233
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,583
[chuckles]

234
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,666
Sorey. I'm so glad to see you!

235
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,416
Oh. So this is Alisha.

236
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,291
[ALISHA]
Who just said that?

237
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,875
Sorry. That was Edna.

238
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,791
She's a new friend we met in--

239
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,750
Wait. Could you
hear her talking?

240
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,833
But I wasn't even
holding your hand.

241
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,791
You're right, you weren't.

242
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:50,416
[LAILAH] Excellent! That means
Sorey's Resonance is improving.

243
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,291
If you can hear the Seraphim
just by standing near him,

244
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,500
then he must be
gaining strength.

245
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,166
[ALISHA]
Lady Lailah!

246
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,458
[LAILAH]
That's right!

247
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,291
I'm glad to see you made
it here safely, Alisha.

248
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,625
[SOREY]
Mm.

249
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, same here. I was
really worried about you.

250
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,458
I--

251
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,708
I'm so lost.

252
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,875
[SOREY]
Alisha.

253
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,958
[ALISHA]
I can't take this anymore.

254
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,250
We've given them medicine,
but nothing works.

255
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,000
[ALISHA]
Nobody is getting any better.

256
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:29,541
At this rate, I'm afraid
they're all going to die.

257
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,000
Forget medicine.

258
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,958
We have to go to the source.

259
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,708
[roars]

260
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,125
There he is!

261
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,958
A hellion? In Marlind?

262
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:57,208
Yes. Can you tell me what's
over in that direction?

263
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,250
There's a good-sized hill.

264
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,541
With a great holy tree
at top of it.

265
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,000
You think the hellion is...?

266
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,125
[EDNA] He's there.
Probably trying to build a nest.

267
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,625
All right.

268
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,041
Edna, is there
anything you can do

269
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,375
to keep that beast from
flying away again?

270
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,791
I can try.

271
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,375
All right!

272
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,541
No!

273
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,791
[EDNA] He's more powerful
than the last time.

274
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,541
On the verge of
becoming a full dragon!

275
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,583
[LAILAH] That would mean
the end of Marlind.

276
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,333
I won't let it fall!

277
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,375
It's here. Malevolence rising.

A drake! It's a
whopper of a drake!

281
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,250
[MIKLEO] Sorey must be
fighting it right now.

00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:14,500

[BOTH yelp]

If only Mikleo were here.

289
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,708
What?

290
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,708
[LAILAH] He went to retrieve
a divine artifact, a bow.

291
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,750
We could use that right now.

He'll be here soon.

but I know he's nearby.

I can just feel it.

is hold out a while longer.

No beast can stand against us!

322
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,208
[MIKLEO, SOREY]
Pierce all!

323
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,791
Let fly the Azure Assault!

324
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,208
[chuckles]

325
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,958
Are you hurt? That was
quite the battle.


326
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,458
Nope, I'm fine.


327
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,416
Looks like you have a scratch
on your hand though.


328
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,541
No big deal. I'm all right.


329
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,291
I bet you missed me
a lot while I was gone.


330
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,208
Not as much as you
missed me, I bet.


331
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,541
I didn't miss you at all.


332
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,333
You are a terrible liar,
you know that, don't you?


333
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,416
[EDNA] What are you two making
so much noise about?


334
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,875
Oh, sorry.


335
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:18,041
Mikleo, this is my friend
Edna. She's an earth Seraph.


336
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,333
Hello, Edna.


337
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,833
I'm Mikleo, a water Seraph.
Nice to meet you.


338
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,000
Hello there.
What a cute little boy.


339
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,166
That's kinda rude,
considering we just met.


340
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,958
Aw, big, tough talk
from a cute little boy.


341
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,750
I'll call you Mikleo-boy
or perhaps, Mibo.


342
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,166
No way! You can't just
give me a nickname!


343
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,333
Now, everybody,
let's settle down.


344
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,875
We're all new friends here,


345
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,416
so let's do our very best to
get along together, all right?


346
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,291
Now, Sorey, what's the
title of the next episode?


347
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,875
Next time. It's "Alisha Diphda."


348
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,458
[ALISHA]
Sorey, did you call me?
