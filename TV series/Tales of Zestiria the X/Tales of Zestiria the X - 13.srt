Thank you very much.

162
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,500
Lastonbell is such
a vibrant city.

163
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,250
Like Ladylake, but different.

164
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,750
[SHOPKEEPER 14A] Mm-hm.
We're located on the border, so,

165
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,708
trade is very important here.

166
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,458
Lastonbell is one
of the largest centers

167
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,583
of commerce in Rolance.

168
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,500
They're prosperous here.

169
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,416
I can understand why
Bartlow wanted Rolance.

170
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,958
So, this is your hideout, huh?

171
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,666
[ROSE]
Do you have to call it that?

172
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,958
It's our warehouse and office.

173
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,208
[SPARROWFEATHER 14A]
Rose! It's good to see you!

174
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,833
Good to see you, too!

175
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,208
Think you can go help out
with the unloading?

176
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,166
[SPARROWFEATHER 14A]
Sure thing!

177
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,458
Oh. One sec.

178
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,958
Is Glenn around somewhere?

179
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,583
[SPARROWFEATHER 14A]
No, he's not here yet.

180
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:41,625
Huh, that's a little
weird for him.

181
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,708
Woah.

182
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,291
In order to run
a business like ours,

183
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,083
you need bases like these
all over the world.

184
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,833
We use them to safeguard
goods, store supplies,

185
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,541
and even sometimes
to make sales.

186
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,083
[SOREY]
Pretty impressive.

187
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,666
[ROSE]
I know, right?

188
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,916
[MAVIN]
Rose?

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,958
Uh-- Hey, Mavin!

190
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:04,208
[BOTH grunting]

191
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,625
What a nice surprise!

192
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,750
I heard you were going
to be in Lastonbell.

193
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,791
Got here soon as I could.

194
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,458
We just got in, too.

195
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,333
There's something
I wanted to show you.

196
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,541
Guchaga twins.

197
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,250
We found 'em in
the Krishana ruins,

198
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,791
200 meters below ground.

199
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,583
When I saw them, I thought
for sure you'd be interested.

200
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,666
You said you'd like to focus
more on antiquities, right?

201
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,416
Oh, well, um, yeah.

202
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,000
[MAVIN] You don't know
what they are, do you?

203
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,666
Wow, these are a good find.

204
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,291
He found these in
the Krishana ruins?

205
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,291
I've never seen
the style before.

206
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,291
Who's he?

207
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,208
Ah. Sorey, the Shepherd.

208
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,750
[MAVIN]
No kidding!

209
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,791
I heard you roasted a dragon
and ate it whole, bones and all!

210
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,916
I'm Mavin.

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,291
Nice to meet you,
Shepherd Sorey.

212
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,166
Mavin here is an explorer.

213
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,166
Not to mention a storyteller.

214
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,791
A storyteller?

215
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,791
Kind of like a teacher,
spreading knowledge

216
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,375
of history and mythology.

217
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,416
Woah, you must
know a whole lot.

[ROSE]
He better!

Mavin is over 100
years old, you know.

220
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,041
[SOREY]
Really?

221
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,625
That's right, shepherd.

222
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:15,125
There are things outside of the
ruins that are spectacular, too.

[VILLAGERS chattering]

you been? We missed you!

You've been gone too long.

We were so worried about you!

Wait till you try
this dried fish!

This radish crop
is my best one yet!

Check out the wheat.

We had an especially
good harvest this year.

She's talking to me first.

[FARMER 14A] I don't
think so! You can all wait.

business to discuss

We're gonna do this
one at a time.

She's popular. Everyone
seems loves Rose.

Rock-paper-scissors,
people. Ready?

00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,875
Now watch the master at work.

249
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,500
She goes the extra
step and makes sure

250
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,375
she knows the value of
whatever she's selling.

251

Good or bad,

252
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,208
she's always honest about it,

253
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,416
so everybody knows
they can trust her.

254
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,416
A regrettably rare
quality in a merchant.

255
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,458
Oh, hey, has anyone
seen Glenn around?

256

What? He hasn't shown yet?

257
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,916
But he's the one who told me
you were coming today.

I figured he would've
beat me here.

That is just so unlike him.

260
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,791
Glenn is a very stubborn man.

261
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,208
He names his own prices
and won't budge a bit,

262
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,333
no matter the market value.

263
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,166
That said, you can always trust
the quality of his goods,

264
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,833
so they're usually worth it.

265

So this Glenn--he's the guy
you wanted to introduce me to?

He sure is.

00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,541
Glenn knows a lot about
the legend of the Shepherd.

00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,375
I was hoping,
if I introduced you,

269
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,250
he might be willing
to negotiate his prices

a little bit, y'know?

to meet someone out of legend

[SERGEI]
Indeed, I am.

Please, Shepherd Sorey,
come quietly.

I'm required to detain you.

288

Care to explain why?

289

[SERGEI]
I was at Glaivend Basin.

00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,750
I saw your power and now know
what you are capable of.

291
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,958
[SOREY] I didn't come here
intending to do harm to Rolance.

292
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,000
Even so, anybody with
the type of power you have

293
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,666
is a potential threat.

294
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,458
I can't sit idly by
while you are here.

You know. I don't buy it.

If you were at the
battle of Glaivend Basin,

297
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,375
then surely you know that
Sorey didn't kill anybody.

Sorry, who are you?

I'm the person in charge
of the building in which

you're currently trespassing.

301

I get that Rolance
is a military nation,

302
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,625
but it still has laws.

303

So how can you come
here and arrest Sorey

when he hasn't done
anything wrong?

to be left on his own.

you're being ridiculous.

Sorey stopped a war
without killing anyone

00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,791
So many people gathered
to welcome Rose back,

319
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,541
it's like a party. Why ruin
such a nice occasion?

320
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,416
Rose, what d'you say
we all have a drink?

321
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Okay.

322
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,958
[MAVIN]
You heard her!

323
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,416
[RANCHER 14A]
Don't have to tell me twice!

324
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,583
[GRAIN FARMER 14A]
Rose, you're the best!

325
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,583
[BREWER 14A]
Don't mind if I do!

326
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,666
[ROSE]
I never said it was free!

327
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,500
[ROSE] I have to make
a living, you know!

328
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,583
Get out of my stores! I mean it!

329
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,416
Put those bottles down!

330
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Come on, you big
moochers! Shoo, shoo!

331
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,250
Ugh, do you know
how much that one cost?

332
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,916
[MAVIN] There's a story
behind the Guchaga Twins.

333
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,250
Care to hear it?

334
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,708
[SOREY]
Of course.

335
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,416
They say you should
turn 'em to face each other.

336
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,833
then put 'em at opposite
ends of a room.

337
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:34,500
Supposedly all fighting
in between them stops.

338
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,750
Nice, eh? What do
you think, Shepherd?

339
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,541
Like the sound of that idea?

340
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,916
I love things like this.

341
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,708
I've explored ruins
ever since I was a kid.

342
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,000
This seems pretty heavy
for its size, though.

343
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:47,875
Oh, yeah?

344
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,291
Interesting.

345
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,250
I wonder if it's a statue
from Asgardian times.

346
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,916
It might have a great
technology embedded in it.

347
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,541
Something that's been long
hidden just waiting to be found.

348
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:04,416
But then how would
we unlock it. Uh...

349
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,166
[laughs] I kinda like you, kid.

350
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,875
You're fun to have around.

351
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,875
Too bad you're so busy being
a Shepherd and everything.

352
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,166
[SOREY]
You must know a lot of things,

353
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,583
for as much as you've travelled

354
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,250
Yeah. I'd say so.

355
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,500
Have you ever
heard anything about

356
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,250
how to purify a dragon?

357
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,125
A dragon, is it?

358
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,791
I've been lucky enough
in my long life

359
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,750
never to encounter
one of their kind before.

360
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,916
I hear there have been
sightings recently.

361
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,041
First in Ladylake
and then in Marlind.

362
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,041
[SOREY]
Yes, and Rayfalke Spiritcrest.

363
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,458
[MAVIN]
I see.

364
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,791
That's something
that hasn't happened

365
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,958
in the last hundred years.

366
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,166
They say we're in
an era of chaos,

367
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,000
the world plagued
with natural disasters

368
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,708
and unnatural darkness.

369
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,250
It's easy, these days,
to believe

370
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,750
we might truly
be facing an end.

371
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,375
[SOREY] If you have
even the smallest hint,

372
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,875
anything at all...

373
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,583
No, sorry.

374
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,416
[SOREY]
Oh.

375
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,750
However, I do know a story.

376
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,333
A long time ago, I met a man
who was called a Shepherd.

377
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,416
[gasps] Really?

378
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,583
[MAVIN]
I don't know if it'll help,

379
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,333
but I'll tell you
what he told me.

380
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,666
"Bad thoughts dwell inside
every person's heart.

381
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,291
If we call those
thoughts malevolence...

382
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,250
[MICHAEL] ...then it
exists within me, too."

383
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,750
The concept of malevolence
is so immense,

384
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,375
I don't know how my mind
could comprehend it.

385
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,875
There are many questions,

386
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,083
and the answers are unclear.

387
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,041
For example, if I do
harm to one person

388
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:34,583
in order to save many others,
is that a malevolent act?

389
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,375
Do we all embrace malevolence
the moment we admit

390
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:41,458
the existence of
a necessary evil?

391
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,041
Impossible question.
I could never answer it.

392
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,750
[SERGEI]
Exactly!

393
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,958
[SERGEI] It's unfair to ask
that kind of question.

394
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,625
There's just no way that
anybody could answer it!

395
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,875
What do they want?

396
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,666
We're imperfect people
doing the best we can

397
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,125
in a difficult time!

398
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,375
Oh?

399
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,083
I figured a knight like
you would see the world

400
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,625
in black and white,
not shades of gray.

401
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,541
You figured wrong.
I've sacrificed.

402
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,625
There are things
I've had to give up

403
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,416
in order to protect the things
I can never give up.

404
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,000
[SOREY]
Uh...

405
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,708
[SERGEI]
Ah!

406
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,541
What I'm trying to say is
that getting the job done

407
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,333
is about a lot more
than being tough.

408
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:31,833
[MAVIN laughs]

Hey! Where are you goin'?

Sorry, but I've got training,
and I can't skip it.

I'm not running off.

412
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,208
Hey, you--

413
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,333
Whoa, a little wobbly there.

414
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,708
You're a real lightweight,
aren't ya? Another?

Sorry I'm late.

Rose?

417
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,625
[SOREY] Dezel. Where is
she heading off to?

418
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,791
[DEZEL] Somewhere our innocent
and pure Shepherd

doesn't need to know about.

420
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,291
I'll be protecting Rose tonight.

421
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,666
What did he mean by that?

422
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,875
[ROSE] Tonight, in the name
of the Scattered Bones.

423
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,500
We will confront the
Bishop Gasparo Leno.

424
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,583
We must put a stop
to the evil deeds

425
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,375
he has committed out
of a twisted sense

426
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,666
of self-importance.

427

[TEMPLE KNIGHTS
grunting, groaning]

429
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,833
Who are you?

430
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,250
[AIGUILLE]
Greetings, Bishop.

431
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,416
We are the Scattered Bones.

432
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,750
You will answer our
questions. Are you ready?

433
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,958
Your questions? What is this?

434
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,583
[AIGUILLE] Are you saying
you are unwilling to answer?

435
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,625
No, I will. Go ahead.

436
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,083
[AIGUILLE]
You'll tell the truth?

437
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,625
Yes. I swear.

438
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,333
[AIGUILLE]
I have three questions for you.

439
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:54,500
First, tell me this.
What is the task of a bishop?

440
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,250
That's simple enough.

441
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,250
To guide and to lead, justly.

442
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,666
To ensure the people of this
city have a prosperous future.

443
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,000
I make all decisions
regarding my flock.

444
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,000
[AIGUILLE]
Second question.

445
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,041
You have amassed
a significant fortune

446
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,833
that you keep hidden.
Where did it come from?

447
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,250
What are you talking about?

448
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,666
I have no "hidden fortune!"

449
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,166
[AIGUILLE]
Is that so?

450
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,875
Then what is stashed
under this cathedral?

451
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,250
Shall we go look at it?

452
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,500
[GASPARO]
There's no need.

453
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm afraid you have the
wrong idea, young man.

454
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,583
The age of chaos is upon us,
so I'm merely managing

455
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,125
the fortunes of Lastonbell's
citizens in preparation.

456
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,875
[AIGUILLE] Now we come
to our final question.

457
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,208
Deeper underground,
we found dozens of bodies.

458
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,000
Would you like to explain
what they are doing there?

459
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,708
If you're simply making
an emergency stockpile,

460
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,416
why silence the witnesses?

461
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,500
No, it wasn't me. I did
not kill those people!

462
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,125
[AIGUILLE] As you said,
it's your job to lead.

463
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,250
You are the one who makes
the final decisions.

It's great, such a
vibrant and exciting city.


469
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,583
There are a lot of things
I've never seen before.

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,791
Sure.


474
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,208
It's a <i>mabo</i> curry bun!


475
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,875
Great, I'll give it a try.


476
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,416
How about a bite for me?


477
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,958
So, what do ya think?


478
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,125
I feel like it's missing
a little something.


479
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,083
Delicious!


480
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,333
Such a pleasant aftertaste.


481
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,041
[EDNA]
Hmph. Not bad at all.


482
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,791
Eh. Maybe you could add
another spice in there.


483
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,583
Something like turmeric or
nutmeg to accent the flavor.


484
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,750
Sorey!


485
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,541
Oh, don't mind me,
just my opinion.


486
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,541
That's a brilliant idea!


487
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:33,750
Thanks for your input!


488
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,708
I'll try it now. Bye!


489
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,708
[ROSE]
Actually, there's one more thing


490
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:39,958
I need you to try for me.


491
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,833
I'll be right back with it.
You wait here.


492
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:42,958
Okay, sure.


493
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,125
Great!


494
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,375
That's Rose for you.


495
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,208
Always passionate
about business.


496
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,541
No kidding.


497
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:52,000
Next: "Wind Seraph, Dezel."
Look forward to it!
