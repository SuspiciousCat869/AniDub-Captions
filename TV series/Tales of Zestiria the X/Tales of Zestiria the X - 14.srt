1
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,708
[AIGUILLE] That one?
Let's put it over here.

2
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:07,708
[SOREY grunts]

3
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,333
[ROSE]
Good morning.

4
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,166
[SOREY]
Morning!

5
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,750
I've just gotta make
sure that these goods

6
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,000
get on their way,
then we'll have breakfast!

7
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,500
Sure.

8
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,333
[SOREY]
Your days start early, huh?

9
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,583
[ROSE]
Life of a merchant.

10
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,291
We have to be up
before the market opens.

11
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,125
Well, time to eat.

12
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:33,041
Don't know about you,
but I'm starving. Dig in!

13
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,375
[ROSE]
Did you sleep well?

14
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,583
Yeah.

15
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,708
Hey, Sorey, are those
Seraphim folks

16
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,333
still hanging around somewhere?

17
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,458
They're sitting on that bench,

18
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,166
but I can call them
over. Want me to?

19
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,958
No!

20
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,458
Hey, Rose, were you ever
able to get in touch

21
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,083
with that Glenn guy?

22
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,416
[ROSE]
No.

23
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,250
I'm starting to get
a little worried about him,

24
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,416
so I think I'll drop buy his
house today to check on things.

25
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,791
[SOREY]
Good idea.

26
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,833
[ROSE] Don't worry.
You're off the hook.

27
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,583
Uh...

28
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,958
I mean it.

29
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,708
You held up your end of
the bargain by coming here.

30
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:18,250
So we're even. You don't
owe me anymore.

31
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,500
Now, will you eat something?

32
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,208
It's quite a spread.

33
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,958
This is delicious!

34
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,291
Isn't it though?

35
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,541
That's why I insist on
the highest quality goods!

36
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,125
What's with her?

37
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,458
She clearly wants
nothing to do with us.

38
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,875
Because she didn't
want us over there?

39
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,708
Does it matter? It's not
like she could talk to us.

40
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,208
That's the problem.
We make her uneasy.

41
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,916
I'm guessing Rose
is the type of person

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,125
who doesn't like
what she can't see.

43
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,458
That describes most humans.

44
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:01,083
[laughs] Oh, look.
We have company.

45
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,291
[footsteps]

46
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,166
I hope you'll excuse
my behavior last night.

47
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,000
I was foolish. I came
here to apologize.

48
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,166
[ROSE]
This early in the morning?

49
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,666
[SERGEI]
Mm!

50
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,375
Well, thanks, but it's
really not a big deal.

51
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,000
Drinking does that to people.
You're not alone there.

52
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,041
But I'm the commander
of the Platinum Knights.

53
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,500
My actions should always
be beyond reproach.

54
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:36,375
You need to lighten up.
Oh, are those for me?

55
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,708
Did you come here to
confess your undying love?

56
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,625
U-Uh, of course not.

57
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,875
I heard women like flowers,

58
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,791
so I brought them
as a peace offering.

59
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,041
Aw, are you sure?

60
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,166
It's not a gift
to prove your love?

61
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,333
No! It's just a bouquet.

62
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,416
Calm down. I know.

63
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,708
You're just so fun
to tease, that's all.

64
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,791
Perhaps flowers
were not appropriate.

65
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,333
I brought something else, but I
don't know if it's any better.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,333
[ROSE laughs] Thanks.
This, I like. It's perfect.

67
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,666
Have you had breakfast yet?

68
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,166
[SERGEI]
Uh, no, I haven't.

69
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,000
You can join us
if you want. Come on.

70
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,083
[SERGEI] Interesting,
you're travelling the world

71
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,875
with these "Seraphim,"
and our country

72
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,375
was your first destination?

73
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,791
[SOREY]
Mm-hm.

74
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,708
I know that Rolance has
a lot of dragon-related lore.

75
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,166
Seemed a good place to start.

76
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,916
All these things you speak of.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,791
The Seraphim and the
hellions, malevolence...

78
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,541
It's hard to believe.

79
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,583
[SOREY] So, where are the rest
of the Platinum Knights?

80
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,333
[SERGEI] My men are responding
to an incident in town.

81
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,250
There was a death
last night, a Bishop.

82
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,916
[SOREY]
A bishop?

83
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,666
That sounds important.
Shouldn't you be there?

84
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,250
Someone must keep
an eye on the Shepherd,

85
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,833
so that's what I'm doing.

86
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,500
[SOREY]
Oh. Um...

87
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,041
No, not like that.

88
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,166
Of course, now I understand
that you didn't come

89
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,916
intending to bring
the war to Rolance.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,458
Truly, I do.

91
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,333
I only wish to extend to you
the curtesies of our nation.

92
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,041
[SOREY]
All right, then.

93
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:12,916
[horse whinnies]

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,375
[SOLDIER 15A]
Sir Sergei!

95
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,666
[SERGEI]
What news?

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,541
An explosion near the cathedral.

97
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,416
[gasps] Explosion?

98
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,000
[SOLDIER 15A] We don't know
what caused it yet,

99
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,916
but the ground has collapsed
and water is coming out.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,250
Right.

101
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,500
[MIKLEO]
Sorey.

102
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,166
[SOREY]
Sergei.

103
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,166
[SERGEI]
Hm?

104
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,541
It's possible malevolence
is the cause.

105
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,833
Malevolence.

106
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,791
Then I'll have to ask
you to accompany me.

107
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,041
Of course

108
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,875
I'm sorry, sir.
There's one more thing.

109
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,083
Tell me.

110
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,291
[SOLDIER 15A]
It's about the bishop's death.

111
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,083
Do we know what
illness killed him?

112
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,458
[SOLDIER 15A] No, and this
is still speculation, but...

113
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,458
Understood. Now, tell me.

114
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,583
[SOLDIER 15A] Last night,
it appears that somebody

115
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,000
may have attacked the cathedral.

116
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,083
According to the rumors,
the Blue Storm Knights

117
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,583
who were on guard duty
engaged in combat.

118
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,833
The outcome?

119
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,333
[SOLDIER 15A]
None of the knights were killed,

120
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,541
but five of them were
quite badly injured.

121
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,500
The only death was the bishop's.

122
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,833
Under mysterious circumstances.

123
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,625
As I said, we don't
know for certain, but...

124
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,875
Assassination?

125
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,833
[SOLDIER 15A]
It seems a likely explanation.

126
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,791
We'll have to investigate
further to be sure.

127
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,458
[SOLDIER 15B]
Good to see you, sir.

128
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,083
Your report?

129
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,416
[SOLDIER 15B] The water
has mostly settled down.

130
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,375
Do you feel it?

131
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,708
[SOREY] No doubt about it.
Malevolence, for sure.

132
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,375
[MIKLEO]
Yeah.

133
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:08,583
[SERGEI] Sheperd Sorey.
Anything to share?

134
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,166
To find out the cause,
I'll need a closer look.

135
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,666
I'm coming, too.

136
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,958
Excuse me, ma'am.

137
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,875
I'm Rose of the Sparrowfeathers.
May I come in?

138
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,708
Preparations for cremation
are progressing?

139
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,458
[SOLDIER 15C]
Yes, sir.

140
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,666
[GROODMAN]
Make them hurry.

141
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,000
There are certain
things that we don't

142
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,208
want the public to know about.

143
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,333
Lailah, can you
give us some light?

144
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,750
Of course.

145
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,958
[yelps] What is that?

146
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,291
It's the power of
the seraph of fire.

147
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,083
You wanna stay inside, Lailah?

148
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,291
Sure.

149
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,083
I think I'll come, too.

150
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,458
[SOREY]
Mikleo, you ready?

151
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,083
We're gonna head
further in. Follow me.

152
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,708
Uh. Sure. Right behind you.

153
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,583
[SOREY] The malevolence
isn't too bad yet.

154
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:13,208
Hey, Sorey, does it feel
like we're always underground?

155
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,708
Heh, I guess that's
part of being a Shepherd.

156
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,000
So basically you're
saying it's your fault.

157
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,416
[SOREY] I don't think
I would put it that way.

158
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,541
[MIKLEO]
Really? I would.

159
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,125
[SOREY laughs]
Well, that's just rude.

160
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,416
[GLENN'S WIFE] You came
all this way for nothing.

161
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,875
I'm sorry about that.

162
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,041
Don't be.

163
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,708
It's our fault for
dropping in unannounced.

164
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,250
My husband talks
about you a lot,

165
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,208
so it's nice to
finally meet you.

166
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,541
He says that you're a
very promising young lady.

167
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:42,791
Oh, really? How sweet.

168
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,833
Anyway, ma'am.

169
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,791
Would you mind me asking how
long Glenn has been gone?

170
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,041
Oh, no, please don't
call me "ma'am."

171
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,791
It makes me feel
about 20 years older.

172
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,000
But to answer your question,
he left three days ago

173
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,416
to make a delivery
to the cathedral.

174
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,791
The cathedral.

175
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,250
He was looking forward
to the delivery

176
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,500
because he'd made
an amazing shelf.

177
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,208
Glenn doesn't show excitement
like that very often.

178
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,583
[ROSE] Well, he is really
good at what he does.

179
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,041
So, after he didn't come back,

180
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,166
did you visit the
cathedral yourself?

181
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,500
Yes.

182
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,583
I did, but he'd
already gone home.

183
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,458
That's what the knights
there told me, anyway.

184
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,916
I-I'm worried because
I haven't heard

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,875
anything from him. I don't
know what I'm going to do.

186
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,291
The tea is getting cold.

187
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,625
I'll just brew us a fresh pot.

188
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,125
The malevolence gets stronger
the further we go.

189
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,375
Yeah. They're starting
to get noisy.

190
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,583
There are soon-to-be hellions
all over the place down here.

191
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,625
There's something
moving in the water!

192
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,041
Don't touch it, Sergei!

193
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,500
The creatures here
have already turned.

194
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,875
What do you think?

195
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,041
Yeah.

196
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,458
Let's go ahead and
perform the ritual here.

197
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,666
Stand back, okay?

198
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,708
We'll purify this area.
It won't take long.

199
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,250
Very well.

200
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,541
[SOREY]
Let's begin.

201
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,375
[MIKLEO]
Water, our mother, bring forth

202
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,708
the power of purification.

203
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,916
Purify.

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,958
Now.

205
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:04,166
[SOREY pants]
I'd say that's a job well done.

206
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,375
[SERGEI] So that's the
ritual of purification.

207
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,458
They're all gone.

208
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,458
The water creatures
and the insects.

209
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,625
Whatever you did
got rid of them.

210
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,875
[SOREY]
They're not gone, actually.

211
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,000
We didn't kill them, just
calmed them down a little bit.

212
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,458
I'm starting to
believe more and more

213
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,625
of what you've told me,
and if it is true,

214
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,250
then Lastonbell's tainted
with malevolence.

215
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,541
I wish I could give
you better news.

216
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,083
What's more,

217
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:35,125
I feel a strong malevolence
coming from up ahead.

218
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,541
[SERGEI]
The power of the Shepherd.

219
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,791
I wonder what else he can do.

220
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,166
Will he be the one
to save the world?

221
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,333
Will he bring an end
to this era of chaos?

222
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,541
Sorey, is there really
a seraph here with us?

223
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,541
Yes. Mikleo.

224
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,708
He's a seraph of the water
and my oldest friend.

225
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,166
Hello, Sergei.

226
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,916
[SOREY] I know you can't
hear it, but he says hello.

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,958
[SERGEI] Oh, I am pleased
to make your acquaintance,

228
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,083
master seraph.

229
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,791
Sorry, I guess I'm still
finding this all a bit strange.

230
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,958
[SOREY]
Don't worry about it.

231
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,916
[SERGEI] Thank you.
It's a lot to take in.

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,166
Hey, tell me something.

233
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,958
Is there some sort of
large building nearby,

234
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,833
like a cathedral or a castle?

235
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:18,916
[SERGEI]
There is.

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,708
If I'm remembering correctly,

237
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,250
this waterway should lead
straight to the cathedral.

238
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,500
Sounds a little too
much like Ladylake.

239
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,541
What do you mean by that?

240
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,541
It's sort of the equivalent of
sweeping things under the rug.

241
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,291
Things are hidden,
emotions buried underground.

242
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,333
So, the malevolence piles up.

243
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,166
[gasps]

244
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,166
[SERGEI]
It's gotten bigger.

245
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,291
We should go. Come on.

246
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,541
[SERGEI]
Right.

247
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,416
[gasps] Looks like a dead end.

248
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,958
This shouldn't be here.

249
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:55,958
[BLUE STORM KNIGHT 15A]
Halt!

250
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,666
This area is
strictly off-limits.

251
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,250
[BLUE STORM KNIGHT 15B]
Where's that fire coming from?

252
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,791
What do you mean
by "off-limits"?

253
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,000
Who's in command?

254
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,291
That's Sir Sergei,
of the Platinum Knights.

255
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,083
[SERGEI]
Are you Knights of Blue Storm?

256
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,458
[BLUE STORM KNIGHT 15A]
We are, sir!

257
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,708
[SERGEI] I need to get
through here. Open the gate.

258
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,833
[BLUE STORM KNIGHT 15A]
We can't do that.

259
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,166
You're going to refuse
knowing who I am?

260
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,958
Perhaps you should reconsider.

261
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,625
[BLUE STORM KNIGHT 15A]
You have my apologies,

262
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,166
but it's out of our hands.

263
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,541
Our leader has given explicit
orders to let no one pass.

264
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,166
What's Groodman up to?

265
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,083
Understood. I don't fault
you for doing your duty.

266
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,416
I won't ask again.

267
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,416
Shall we?

268
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,875
Yeah.

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,916
[SERGEI] I'm not sure how you
knew it, but you were right.

270
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,750
It seems there's something
under the cathedral

271
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,708
that someone wants
to keep hidden.

272
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,791
[AIGUILLE]
Rose. Rose!

273
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,125
You can't go running
off like this!

274
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,500
[AIGUILLE]
Stop!

275
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,541
What good do you
think this will do?

276
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,166
The whole area
around the cathedral

277
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,208
will be swarming with knights.

278
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,083
We need to stay away
from there right now.

279
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,708
I know that!

280
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,833
Don't lie to yourself.

281
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,125
You've realized by now
that Glenn is dead.

282
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,000
Murdered by the bishop
and his gang of thugs.

283
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,416
That kind of violence
was the reason

284
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,333
we took him out, remember?

285
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,333
How many lives do you think
we saved by killing him?

286
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,458
It's okay, Rose.

287
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,750
We did the right thing.

288
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,208
Did we?

289
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,291
[SERGEI]
As much as I hate to admit it,

290
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,458
Rolance is far from perfect.

291
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,583
We have our share of problems.

292
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,791
Officially, we are
an absolute monarchy

293
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,000
ruled by the imperial family.

294
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,541
But the church has become an
increasingly dominant force

295
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,041
in our political system.

296
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,000
The men back there,
they're Blue Storm Knights,

297
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,500
an arm of the church
that has gained

298
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,166
significant influence recently.

299
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,500
As you know, I lead
the Platinum Knights.

300
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,875
We report directly
to the imperial family.

301
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,416
Things are strained
between the knighthoods.

302
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,208
We no longer seem
to be working toward

303
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:16,333
the same goal, that became
more apparent at Glaivend Basin.

304
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,666
[SOREY] So it isn't just the
malevolence that's similar.

305
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,583
The political situation here
is a lot like Ladylake's.

306
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,750
Still, one thing worries me.

307
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:29,208
So far, no dragon has
appeared in Rolance.

308
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,541
Yeah, that's true.

309
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,875
But, it doesn't seem
that the malevolence

310
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,916
here in Rolance is
less than in Hyland.

311
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,958
There's something else
different. What is it?

312
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,291
Hey, Sergei.

313
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,083
How have things been in Rolance?

314
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,583
Anything weird like
natural disasters lately?

315
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,083
Natural disasters?

316
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,333
Not exactly--nothing
like the tornadoes

317
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,083
and floods I've heard about.

318
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,875
Although, in Pendrago, there's
been a near ceaseless rain.

319
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,041
It'll stop for a short time but
then start again right away.

320
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,541
[BOTH]
That's it.

321
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,666
Really? You think
that could be related?

322
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,041
[gasps]

323
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,125
Who are you?

324
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,916
[GROODMAN] Well, if it
isn't the esteemed leader

325
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,791
of the Platinum Knights.

326
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,916
I'm very curious to know what
you're doing here, Sir Sergei.

327
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,625
Care to enlighten me?

328
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,166
Hello, Groodman.

329
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,000
[AIGUILLE]
What are you saying?

330
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,916
This isn't like you.

331
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,458
I thought you swore, Rose,

332
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:39,416
to protect the people,
no matter your own sacrifice.

333
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,166
You said you could silence
your emotions to do this.

334
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,166
Stop, will you?
I know what I said.

335
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,458
Then what's gotten into you?

336
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,750
[DEZEL]
Need my help? Just say so.

337
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,875
[gasps]

338
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,500
If you seriously wanna
do this, then tell me.

339
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,833
Ask for my help.
I'll handle it for you.

340
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,000
You again.

341
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,041
Who are you talking to?

342
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,333
They deserve punishment.

343
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,625
People like them are disgusting.

344
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,333
They're nothing but frauds.

345
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,166
Trading on religion to
steal from the innocent.

346
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,416
They should be taught
a lesson, don't you think?

347
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,875
[ROSE] If I hadn't met Sorey,
I would never have believed it.

348
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,458
I always thought I had an
over-developed sixth sense,

349
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,500
but this is crazy.

350
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,958
He was right.

351
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,250
To think that the
Seraphim actually exist.

352
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,916
What's going on?

353
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,125
Rose, is something the matter?

354
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,791
[DEZEL] Like he said, what
you've been doing is right.

355
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,291
Whether you know it or not.

356
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,708
So, I'll help if you need it.

357
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,458
Maybe. Tell me who you are.

358
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,958
I'm Dezel.

359
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,291
[ROSE]
I'm Rose.

360
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,208
I know.

361
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,208
See ya.

362
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,250
Hey! Come back here!

363
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,208
That's odd.

364
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,333
Where are you going?

365
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,708
[GROODMAN]
Are you the Shepherd?

366
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,333
I guess appearances
can be deceiving.

367
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,583
Who's this guy?

368
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,708
He is the leader of
the Blue Storm Knights,

369
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,333
Sir Groodman.

370
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,083
I remember you mentioned
his name earlier.

371
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,416
Now, tell me.

372
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,083
What business do you have
beneath the cathedral?

373
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:32,833
Nothing that could
possibly concern you.

374
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,708
You realize I'm not going
to let you walk away.

375
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,250
[explosion, rumbling]

376
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,875
[SOREY]
Is that...

377
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,916
It's Rose!

378
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,166
[EDNA] If we're going
after her, we should hurry.

379
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,666
Are we?

380
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,000
Let's go.

381
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,791
[DEZEL grunts]

382
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,500
Okay, purification complete!


383
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,000
Purifying all that
malevolence is no easy task.


384
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,291
[LAILAH] Good work,
you two. I'm impressed!


385
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,416
This country's choc full
of sacred relics.


386
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,583
I'm surprised you haven't
gone spelunking yet.


387
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,000
We thought we'd
save the fun stuff


388
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,791
until the malevolence
was purified.


389
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,041
It must be rough,
having such a tedious hobby.


390
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,708
What do you like to
do for fun, Edna?


391
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,666
It's not really a hobby,
but I like combining words.


392
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,625
Like Mibo.


393
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:19,583
Any other?


394
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,458
Eaprin.


395
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,333
What's that?


396
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,000
The title of the next episode.


397
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,500
That doesn't make any sense.


398
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,166
And there's another thing
I don't get. Why "Mibo"?


399
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,416
Is that really just
short for "Mikleo Boy"?


400
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,208
Because that seems
a little ridiculous.


401
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,333
I don't know why you're
always so mean to me.


402
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,166
Edna, I'm really sorry.


403
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,458
I accept apologies
in the form of snacks.


404
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,166
and you'd better make
sure they're tasty.


405
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,125
[MIKLEO growls]
Okay, fine. You win.


406
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,250
Next week: "Each One's
Principles," or, if you prefer,


407
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,583
"Eaprin" for short.


408
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,333
"Mikleo is a gullible
dumbo." "Mibo" for short.


409
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,583
Ha, ha, she made a joke!
