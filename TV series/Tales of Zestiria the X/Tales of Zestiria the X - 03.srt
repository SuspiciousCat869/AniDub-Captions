00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,000
[SOREY]
I think we're here!

2
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,750
Ah!

3
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:41,041
[SOREY] There it is! We've
finally made it to Ladylake!

4
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,916
[SOREY]
There are people everywhere!

5
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,833
This is amazing!

6
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,125
Wow. So many humans
all in one place.

7
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,083
[ROSE]
It's a security checkpoint.

8
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,166
[ROSE]
Oh. A tourist, huh?

9
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,875
The Sacred Blade
Festival always brings

10
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,125
a lotta newcomers to the city.

11
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,833
I'd hurry if I were you.

12
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,500
They're closing general
admissions soon,

13
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,541
but your pass should
still get you in.

14
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,625
[SOREY] And, where would
I get one of those passes?

15
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,333
You don't have one already?

16
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,875
[SOREY]
Well... No.

17
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,666
You really are new.

18
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,875
You can probably still
get in without a pass,

19
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,458
but it could take a while.

20
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,583
[SOREY]
Oh, really?

21
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,000
[ROSE]
Hm...

22
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,208
I might be able to help you out!

23
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,083
[ROSE] We're a caravan
of merchants who enjoy

24
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,708
the protection of
a free trade treaty.

25
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,125
The Sparrowfeathers.

26
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,166
[ROSE] Basically, we can
freely enter any city.

27
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,333
[laughs]

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,166
Well, you're in.

29
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,750
You can wander around
the city all you want.

30
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,416
So?

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What?

32
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,333
It's time to settle up.

33
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,958
That'll be 500 gald.
I would say that's fair.

34
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,083
You don't get anything
free, ya know.

35
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,791
Gramps says human transactions
usually require money.

36
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,500
[gasps]

37
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,041
Jeez, are you broke, too?

38
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,791
What about that
pack you're carrying?

39
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,875
You've gotta have something
to trade in here.

40
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,083
Hey-- Uh-- Excuse me.

41
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,041
[ROSE] There! I'll take
this and call it even.

42
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,916
You can't have that.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,625
I need to return it to someone.

44
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,083
[ROSE]
All right, I won't keep it then.

45
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,541
This seems like fate, somehow.

46
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,583
So let's just say you owe me
one and leave it at that.

47
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,208
You got lucky this time.

48
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,000
Great. Thanks a lot!

49
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:28,250
Well? Is Ladylake all
you thought it would be?

50
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,291
[SOREY] I'd heard that
it was an incredible city,

51
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,583
but I never imagined this!

52
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,958
It's pretty impressive, huh?

53
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,083
Yeah.

54
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,208
There are a lot more
people than usual.

55
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,666
What with the Sacred
Blade Festival, and all.

56
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,541
[ROSE]
Oh. Whoops!

57
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,375
Nice as this has been,
I've gotta get going.

58
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,458
Big city festivals can
bring in a lot of money

59
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,833
for merchants like us.

60
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,541
Which means I need
to get to work!

61
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,041
Have fun. This is
Ladylake at its best.

62
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,625
Thanks. I definitely owe you.

63
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,833
Sorey.

64
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,125
Now that we're here, we should
start looking for Alisha--

65
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,250
[groans]

66
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,250
You all right?

67
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,916
Something isn't right.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,583
It's the malevolence.
Ladylake is thick with it.

69
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,708
[SOREY]
You feeling any better?

70
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:31,208
[MIKLEO]
Yeah. I think I'm all right now.

71
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,541
I'm glad.

72
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,750
[SOREY]
Down there! That Hellion!

73
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,041
[VILLAGERS yelping]

74
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,750

[LUNARRE yelling, laughing]

76
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,083
Huh?

77
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,000
Sorey!

78
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,166
What do you want with Alisha?

79
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,375
[LUNARRE grunts]

80
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,291
[SOREY] Isn't that why
you came to Elysia?

81
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,000
To get to Alisha?

82
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,208
Tch. Is that why
you're worked up?

83
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,500
Well, then you can calm down,

84
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,041
because I won't be
targeting her any longer.

85
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,083
Then what are you
even doing here?

86
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,250
I kinda like the
little princess.

87
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,166
She's a feisty one, for sure.

88
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,666
A good fighter, too.

89
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,416
Hanging around her should
prove to be very entertaining.

90
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,666
[laughs]

91
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,166
[LUNARRE]
In fact, being a spectator

92
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,000
could be even more fun.

93
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,500
It's true that <i>I've</i> decided
to stop hunting her,

94
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,875
but you're a fool if you
think that nobody else is.

95
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,250
There's a price on
the princess's head.

96
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,083
As long as the contract
is still active,

97
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,541
she is very much in danger.

98
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,208
And the one who has
taken this contract...

99
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:58,583
...always delivers.
The only question is: when?

100
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,291
[cackles]

101
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,458
[ALISHA] Master, has anyone
been back to Griel?

102
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,208
[MALTRAN] Yes, and sadly,
no survivors were to be found.

103
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,833
[ALISHA sighs]

104
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,541
I must admit I'm
having a hard time

105
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,583
believing your story.

106
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,750
It's true, all of it.

107
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,833
[MALTRAN]
Is that why you oppose

108
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,833
Chancellor Bartlow
so forcefully?

109
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,375
Because of what
happened in Griel?

110
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,958
You're sure it isn't
because you and he had

111
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,458
a prior disagreement about
conscripting young people

112
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,333
who had come to the city
for the festival?

113
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,458
[ALISHA]
Yes.

114
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm quite sure, Master Maltran.

115
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,375
We must not fight.

116
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,333
There's already enough
darkness in the world.

117
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,000
It doesn't matter
which side you are on,

118
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,958
the victorious or the defeated.

119
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,291
Either way, the main
product of war is hate.

120
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,500
We must avoid it at all cost.

121
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,625
I mean it.

122
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,500
Unless our opponent
strikes us first.

123
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,250
We'll make no move to attack.

124
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,583
Perhaps.

125
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,166
But you know as well as I do
that the upper brass

126
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,000
will never accept that.

127
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,041
[MALTRAN] I'd advise you to
think carefully before you act.

128
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,250
[EGUILE]
That does sound extreme.

129
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,000
[BARTLOW] I didn't expect the
princess to be this foolish.

130
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,875
To say we must allow
the enemy to strike

131
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,208
before making any
move of our own

132
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,833
is ludicrous and irresponsible.

133
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,958
[EGUILE]
Well. What action did you take?

134
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,333
[BARTLOW]
Obviously, I argued against her.

135
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,750
But she's always
been headstrong,

136
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,208
so she didn't listen.

137
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,458
What's more, rumors
have recently surfaced

138
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:28,250
suggesting that Princess Alisha
has secret ties to Rolance.

139
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,916
[EGUILE] So you're implying
that she might have

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,416
a personal motive for wishing
to forestall an attack.

141
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,125
[ROSE] We came here
so we could determine

142
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,583
whether or not the assassination

143
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,458
of Princess Alisha
is justifiable.

144
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,458
We arrive at that
decision by considering

145
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,375
how many innocent lives
might be spared

146
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,583
if hers were to be taken.

147
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,041
For the Scattered Bones,
it is a question of honor.

148
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,708
If that's the case,

149
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,500
I can assure you that
her actions are dangerous.

150
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,208
If she prevails,
many people will die

151
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,666
who would otherwise have lived.

152
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,125
She is advocating an
exclusively defensive policy.

153
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,208
In other words, she would
sacrifice the common folk

154
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,041
for her ideals.

155
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,208
[ROSE]
So soft.

156
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,750
Chancellor Bartlow.

157
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,750
You request the assassination
of Princess Alisha.

158
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,666
We accept the contract.

159
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,833
Hm...

160
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,375
Oh, dear.

of the Sacred Blade Festival.

We will now begin the
Rite of the Warrior.

Mikleo.

167
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,666
I see her, too. There's
a Seraphim down there.

168
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,458
[SOREY]
You know what that means?

169
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,666
She must be the
Lady of the Lake!

170
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,500
The legends really are true!

171
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:12,500
[KNIGHT 4A grunting]

172
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,125
[LAILAH]
The malevolence is so strong.

173
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,833
Darkness is rising.

174
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:32,500
[CROWD cheers]

[applause]

176
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,875
Fellow citizens!
As you're all aware,

177
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,000
we have refrained from
holding our beloved festival

178
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,375
for several years.

179
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,416
Because these times are
so dangerous and uncertain.

180
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,791
But this year,
the Sacred Blade Festival

181
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,708
was held once more, thanks
to the grace and wisdom

182
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,208
of our Princess Alisha.

183
00:10:54,291 --> 00:11:00,458
[applause]

184
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,958
This just gets more
entertaining by the second.

185
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,041
So that's truly the
secret blade of legend?

186
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,625
[MIKLEO] My guess is
that when you touch it,

187
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,333
the Lady of the Lake judges you.

188
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,708
And if she thinks you're
worthy of being the Shepherd,

189
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,875
you're able to take
it from the stone.

190
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,541
Worthy, huh?

191
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,916
[KNIGHT 4B grunting]

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,625
I think this is
the last of them.

193
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,333
I wonder how the princess
intends to bring

194
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,083
a graceful end to this farce.

195
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,541
[applause]

196
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,416
[gasps] There's Alisha.

197
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,125
What do you think
she's gonna do?

198
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,166
[ALISHA]
In closing,

199
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,916
I would like to say a few words.

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,250
But first I ask that we
take a moment to recognize

201
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,583
those who participated
in the Rite.

202
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,208
[applause]

203
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,291
[ALISHA] Unfortunately,
there was no Shepherd

204
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,500
chosen during this year's
Sacred Blade Festival.

205
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,125
We all know the legend:

206
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,625
that the Shepherd will arrive
in the world's darkest hour

207
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,708
to cleanse it of malevolence
with the help of the Seraphim.

208
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:05,166
However, blind belief in these
tales is not the reason

209
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,500
I wished to revive the
tradition this year.

210
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,833
Rather,

211
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,625
I'd hoped this parable
might teach us something.

212
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,250
Give us the strength we need.

213
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,125
There are some who believe
that this festival

214
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,291
was created to boost
morale before a war.

215
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,833
But I disagree with that.

216
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,250
In the legend, it was
only by working together

217
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,291
that humans and Seraphim
were able to hold

218
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,958
those dark forces at bay.

219
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,250
I believe the lesson we
should learn from the story

220
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,291
is that we are stronger when
we work with our neighbors.

221
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,333
Rather than fighting them.

222

[MIKLEO grunts]

[ALISHA]
We must be strong.

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,125
With chaos and despair
taking over the world,

226
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,958
we need to band together.

227
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,916
I know this is hard to hear,

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,125
but even if Rolance
does invade Hyland,

229
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,666
we cannot strike first.

230
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,375
We must wait until
they attack us.

231

It's getting worse.

disappointment and despir.

Their disillusionment...

Wait, before you
touch the blade...

299
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,083
Clearly, you have a
connection to the Seraphim.

300

Otherwise, you wouldn't
be able to see me.

It's even possible that
you're able to draw the sword.

But first,

303
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,250
there is something
I must ask, Sorey.

304
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,000
Why do you want
to be a Shepherd?

305
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,083
Before I answer, may I
ask for your name?

306

Ah. Of course.

307
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,041
I am Lailah.

308
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,125
Lailah, my goal is
to travel the world

309
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,708
investigating ancient ruins.

310
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,250
And I truly believe

311
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,125
the artifacts of
the past hold clues

312
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,041
about how humans and Seraphim
can live in harmony.

313
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,833
That's what I dream of.

314
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:56,166
A world where our races can
come to know each other again.

315

Purifying the Hellions
will help to defend

humans and the Seraphim.

317
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,583
And I've got a feeling
that it's connected

318
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,416
to the dream that I'm chasing.

319
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:10,583
[SOREY] So there you
have it. That's why.

320

[LAILAH]
You must not go into this blind.

321
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,250
To become my sword
is to serve as a vessel

322
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,125
for me to dwell in and to
assume the Shepherd's burden.

323

the power of purification

325
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,791
But you will also be cursed
with despair, hardship,

326
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,708
and the scorn of others.

327
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,458
Some of the decisions
you are forced

328
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,583
to make will be agonizing.

329
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,125
Your battle will be lonelier
and more difficult

330
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,791
than you can imagine.

331
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,166
[SOREY] To be the Shepherd
is a heavy burden.

332
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,541
[LAILAH]
Yes.

333
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,291
I'll carry it.

334
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,458
If being your sword means
I can save these people,

335
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,833
then count me in.

336
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,250
If it brings me one step closer

337
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,125
to realizing my dream,
it's worth the price.

338
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,833
I'll do it.

339
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,541
I'll be the Shepherd!

340
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,916
[HELLION roars]

341
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,125
[gasps]

342
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
[gasps]

343
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,250
[SOREY grunting]

344
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,541
[SOREY]
"Fethmus Mioma." Is that you?

345
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,333
[LAILAH]
Yes. That is my true name.

346
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,791
[HELLION roars]

347
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,916
[LAILAH]
All right. This is it.

348
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,458
Harness the energy
flowing within you.

349
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,125
Unleash the power
of the Shepherd!

350
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,208
[LAILAH]
Now!

351
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,208
[SOREY yells]

352
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,208
He's the Shepherd...

353
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,250
No! Impossible!

354
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,041
[groans]

355
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,250
[gasps]

356
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,125
[MIKLEO]
Sorey!

357
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,625
I'm excited. This will be fun.

358
00:22:58,708 --> 00:22:59,666
Don't you think so?

359
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,166
The three of us
traveling together.

360
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,666
Yeah, we're glad
to have you along!

361
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,875
[MIKLEO growls]

362
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,500
Hey, Mikleo, why aren't
you saying anything?

363
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,416
And what's with that
face you're making?

364
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,833
You said I had to
make funny faces

365
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:10,958
if you became the Shepherd!

366
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,833
Oh... Did I say that?

367
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:13,916
Guess I forgot.

368
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,583
Seriously. Well, it's
nice to meet ya.

369
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,625
t's nice to meet
you, too, Mikleo.

370
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,791
Why don't you tell us
somethin' about yourself?

371
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,416
Sure. I'd be happy to.

372
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,625
Any hobbies?

373
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,083
[LAILAH] I enjoy making
origami and sending

374
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,541
letters to my friends.

375
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,250
Do you have any
favorite snack foods?

376
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,916
Well, since I am
a Seraphim of fire,

377
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,333
I like making baked goods.

378
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:32,916
It utilizes my talents.

379
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,166
Can you tell us what
Fethmus Mioma means?

380
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,500
That's an excellent question!

381
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,958
It means "Lailah the Pure."

382
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,000
What's your weight?

383
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,333
That's a secret.

384
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,333
Your age?

385
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,583
That's a secret.

386
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,041
The title of the next episode?

387
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,375
That's a secret.

388
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,958
That's not the kind of
thing you can keep secret!

389
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,750
Next time: "Destiny
of the Shepard."

390
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,375
Look forward to it!
