1
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,625
The malevolence
is getting thicker.

2
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,458
We need to be
very careful now.

3
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,375
[rumbling]

4
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,541
[BOTH gasp]

5
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,500
That's weird.

6
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,375
[yelping]

7
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,083
So...

8
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:20,000
...were you planning to
hold me like this forever?

9
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,208
[LAILAH]
Edna!

10
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,416
[EDNA] Hello, Lailah.
It's been awhile.

11
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,000
You should move.
Or else you'll probably die.

12
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,583
A hellion!

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,291
[EDNA]
This is unfortunate.

14
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,625
I felt something here so
I came to check it out.

15
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't expect a fight today.

16
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,708
So, uh, thanks for that.

17
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,041
[EDNA]
Hold on.

18
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,000
Lailah, cover me!

19
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,750
So he really is the Shepherd.

20
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,541
Fall back!

21
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,541
[SOREY]
What? Nothing happened?

22
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,208
[LAILAH]
It isn't your fault, Sorey.

23
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,791
The malevolence is
simply too strong.

24
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,500
Is it purified?

25
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,541
[ZAVEID] I gotta say, that's
a pretty sorry showing. Kid.

26
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,750
So it's you, Zaveid.

27
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,750
Who is that guy?

28
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,166
[ZAVEID]
Hm.

29
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,833
So this kid is the
new Shepherd, huh?

30
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,083
Not much too look at.

31
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,333
[SOREY] How did you
defeat that thing so fast?

32
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,458
You know how they say that
everybody's gotta have a hobby?

33
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,916
Well, killing hellions is mine.

34
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,125
See what he carries?

35
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,375
It's a special tool
that can kill hellions.

36
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,916
He wields it quite ferociously.

37
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,500
[ZAVEID]
This baby here is one of a kind.

38
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,916
My dear partner and I have done
a lot of killing together.

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,958
I'm not crazy about
your idea of a hobby.

40
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,833
We could have purified it
instead of killing.

41
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,250
[laughs]

42
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,416
Admirable.

43
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Sir Shepherd here
is the very picture

44
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,333
of morality and valor, isn't he?

45
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,625
But you know something,
Sir Shepherd?

46
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:12,166
Death can be salvation rather
than punishment. Truly.

47
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,125
What do you mean by that?

48
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,291
So, uh. Anyway. Uh...

49
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,916
Zaveid. I told you to
stay away from this place.

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,708
And you remember
what I told you, Edna?

51
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,958
Whether you like it or not,

52
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,125
I'm not going to stop
coming until I kill him.

53
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,416
[EDNA]
Why can't you leave us alone?

54
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,458
Just go.

55
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,583
What's going on? A domain?

56
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,708
A domain? This full
of malevolence?

57
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,375
He's here now.

58
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:22,416
[DRAGON roaring]

59
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,958
Hello, Brother.

60
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:31,791
[LAILAH gasps]

61
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,708
No!

62
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,375
[ZAVEID]
That's right.

63
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,333
The dragon you see is
Edna's older brother.

64
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,208
Once called Eizen.

65
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:50,250
Go on. Get outta here unless
you wanna be dragon food.

66
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,791
[SOREY]
Lailah! We have to armatize.

67
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,250
If he used to be a Seraph,
we can purify him!

68
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,166
We can't, Sorey! Get back!

69
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,416
[ZAVEID]
Idiot!

70
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,625
Don't you know anything?

71
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,625
A fully manifested dragon
can't be purified!

72
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,875
Huh? So he's just
gonna stay like that?

73
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,916
That's right. For all time.

74
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,416
No way. Surely we
can do something.

75
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,083
[EDNA]
You can't.

76
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,000
I've looked for a way
to bring him back,

77
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,666
but as far as I can
tell, none exists.

78
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,291
[ZAVEID]
Sad but true.

79
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,333
So I'm here to take care of him.

80
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,750
I'll send him to hell
with my own hands.

81
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,416
[SOREY grunts]

82
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,375
Stop! No!

83
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,708
Edna!

84
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,666
[EDNA] I told you.
Leave my brother alone!

85
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,208
[LAILAH] We have to go!
It's too dangerous here!

86
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,625
But the dragon.

87
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,625
[ZAVEID] Take Edna and
get out of here already!

88
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,208
[DRAGON roars]

89
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,875
Right, let's go.

90
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,291
[roars]

91
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,583
Just like last time.

92
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,041
More hellions, huh?

93
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,208
[MIKLEO] It's no use. I need
the power of purification.

94
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,333
Ugh. Damn it. I can't give up.

95
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,833
If I fail, I'll be
useless to him.

96
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:31,208
I think he flew off.
We should be safe now.

97
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,666
So maybe it's time for
you to let go of me.

98
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,541
Uh. Sorry!

99
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,541
[sighs]

100
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,166
Well, what brings you to
the mountain, Shepherd?

101
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,833
We don't get many
visitors up here.

102
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,125
Well... it's mentioned in
the dragon legends, so...

103
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,666
"So," what?

104
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,125
Thought you'd make a name for
yourself as a dragonslayer?

105
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,250
I swear he's not like that.

106
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,083
We came here because a dragon

107
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,041
recently appeared in the
skies above Ladylake.

108
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,500
[EDNA]
Oh, did it?

109
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,833
I can tell you right now,
that wasn't my brother.

110
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,916
Yeah, we know that.

111
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,916
[EDNA]
Then what are you doing here?

112
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,000
[SOREY]
Looking for answers.

113
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,791
People are saying that the world
has entered an age of chaos.

114
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,083
I figured if dragons
represent that chaos,

115
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,458
maybe tracking one down

116
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:27,000
would help me find out more
about what's going on.

117
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,500
I may have taken up
the Shepherd's mantle

118
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,833
but still, I have
so much to learn.

119
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,833
Very well then.

120
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,291
You saw what you came to see.

121
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,166
A real dragon, in the flesh.

122
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,166
I hope it was
educational. Now leave.

123
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,625
[SOREY] Yeah. I've learned
a lot about dragons, sure.

124
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,708
But now it's got me thinking.

125
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,458
Is there a way?

126
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,333
There must be
something we can do!

127
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,541
There must be some
way to save him.

128
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,500
Lailah. Is he an idiot?

129
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,791
[LAILAH]
I prefer to say optimistic,

130
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,250
if a bit too eager at times.

131
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,916
It's sweet.

132
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,083
[EDNA sighs]

133
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,875
[EDNA] Perfect.
I'm surrounded by idiots.

134
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,791
[SOREY] So, Edna, how'd Eizen
become a dragon, anyway?

135
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,958
[EDNA] I don't know.
He just left one day.

136
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,916
And the next time I saw him,
he had already turned.

137
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,250
He always did spend too much
time around humans.

138
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,625
I think that might've had
something to do with it.

139
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,833
[EDNA] It's not as though
I didn't search for a way

140
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,500
to bring him back.

141
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:49,541
I looked and I looked,
but found nothing.

142
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:55,458
There is no way to purify
a dragon. It can't be done.

143
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,958
I hate it.

144
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,458
But Zaveid is right.

145
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,083
Eizen must die.

146
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,333
Why?

147
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,625
You talk about killing
him like it's nothing,

148
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,625
but I know that's
not what you want.

149
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,000
You defended him.

150
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,041
You wouldn't let Zaveid get
anywhere near him.

151
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,166
[EDNA]
I shouldn't have.

152
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,583
[SOREY]
I thought Shepherds and dragons

153
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:19,791
were nothing but legends
until recently.

154
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,166
Don't you get it?

155
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,625
Just because you
haven't seen something

156
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,083
doesn't mean it's not real.

157
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:29,083
There must be some way to
purify a dragon. I'll find it.

158
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,541
[DRAGON roaring]

159
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,500

00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,208
[SOREY] Zaveid's trying
to kill him again.

163
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,625
Brother, why?

164
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,208
[SOREY]
Zaveid!

165
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,708
[ZAVEID groans]

166
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,083
Great, them again.

167
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:28,375
Don't be stupid! Get away
from here while you can!

168
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,875
This creature is
no longer Eizen.

169
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,416
He doesn't know who
you and I are anymore.

170
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,750
Don't you get it, Edna?
He's forgotten everything.

171
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,000
He doesn't remember
the times we fought.

172
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,083
Or the times we had
each other's backs.

173
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,875
Or the times we got so
drunk we couldn't stand.

174
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,333
He's gone now! Gone!

175
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,583
Edna, let me end it!

176
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,125
Please, Eizen, stop!

177
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,333
Lailah. I'm gonna need
you at my side for this.

178
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,583
[LAILAH gasps]

179
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,708
[LAILAH]
We can't purify a dragon.

180
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,833
[SOREY]
I know that.

181
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,541
But even so, I can't
just stand here.

182
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,250
[SOREY]
I have to try.

183
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,208
I am the Shepherd of this world!

184
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,041
[DRAGON roars]

185
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,416
[DRAGON roars]

186
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,708
[EDNA]
Brother...

187
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,083
[yells]

188
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,583
[gasps]

189
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,583
[roars]

190
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,791
[LAILAH]
You have to stop this!

191
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,625
Not yet! No!

192
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,041
[ZAVEID]
You fool.

193
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,750
[EDNA]
Brother, listen to me!

194
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,291
You have to stop
hurting people, okay?

195
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,291
[ZAVEID]
Edna! Get away from there!

196
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,291
[EDNA]
Brother... please.

197
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:47,041
Edna! No!

198
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,708
Was that you... Eizen?

199
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,291
Fly free.

200
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,791
[SOREY]
Zaveid.

201
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,916
[SOREY]
You saw didn't you?

202
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:56,000
[ZAVEID] Yeah. I saw. A glimmer
of something, at least.

203
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,666
Maybe it's not time
to kill him yet.

204
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,041
[SOREY sighs]

205
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,916
I'm glad to hear you say that.

206
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,291
[ZAVEID]
Know this, kid.

207
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,666
I've been travelling across
this world for a long time.

208
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,333
And if a way to purify
a dragon does exist,

209
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,625
I sure as hell haven't
heard of it.

210
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:19,833
[ZAVEID] But, hey, the world
is a big place, so who knows.

211
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,000
Yep. Maybe it's out there.

212
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,083
Can't hurt to keep looking.

213
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,500
Yeah!

214
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,958
[ZAVEID]
Hey, Edna!

215
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,791
When you're ready to give up
on him, just let me know.

216
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,375
I'll take care of it.

217
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,958
If you need me,
I'll be right there.

218
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,958
I can do that much
for him at least.

219
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,041
[EDNA] Finally, one less
idiot to deal with.

220
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,625
[SOREY]
So what now?

221
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,916
[EDNA] Lailah, I'll need a
Sub Lord contract, please.

222
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,458
[gasps] Are you certain?

223
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,791
Uhh, you lost me.

224
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,750
[EDNA]
It's an ancient binding.

225
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,000
A type of pact that will
allow me to assist you.

226
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,916
You said you're going to
find a way to help Eizen.

227
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,875
If you're going to help him,
I want to help you.

228
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,708
Are you actually going to do it?

229
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,916
Will you save my brother?

230
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,583
Yes! I'll save him. I swear it.

231
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:43,083
I'm with you. Shall we?

232
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,750
[SOREY]
Yeah. Lead the way!

233
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,291
I found it, Sorey. Hold on.

234
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:30,375
This wind. What in
the world is happening?

235
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,916
[SOLDIER A]
I don't believe it!

236
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,250
Griflet Bridge has washed away.

237
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,666
Hey, Edna! Are you gonna
help me with the preview?


238
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,833
Of course I am.


239
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,583
After eight long episodes
of other people,


240
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:04,125
the fans finally get
the chance to see me.


241
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,375
I need as much screen
time as possible.


242
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,791
So what do you think?


243
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,666
Should I start by telling
people a bit about myself?


244
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,041
Yeah, totally!


245
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,958
Everybody's dying to
get to know you better.


246
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,833
Ask away. What would
you like to know?


247
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,375
What's with the little
Normin mascot


248
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,708
hanging from your parasol?


249
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,958
We don't have time to get
into that now, so pass.


250
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,916
Okay, what food are
you best at making?


251
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,291
Huh?


252
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,958
Why make food when I can
get others to do it for me?


253
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:28,083
Will you at least tell everyone
what Hepshin Yulind means?


254
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,125
[EDNA]
She who is darling as a daisy,


255
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,041
lovely as a lily,
and pretty as a peony.


256
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,333
Edna, the most beautiful
woman in the world!


257
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,750
[LAILAH]
Stop that, Edna.


258
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,000
You know you shouldn't lie.


259
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,708
Yeah, there's no way two
words can mean all that.


260
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,875
Well, anyway. Next time.


261
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,458
Look forward to it.


262
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,583
Come on, what does
Hepshin Yulind really mean?


263
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,958
Not telling!


264
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,875
Are you killing me?!
I'm gonna lose sleep over this!
