So it's you. Seres.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,666
I can't believe they
sent one of their best

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,166
Praetor-class Exorcists.

6
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,916
Is one island really
worthy of your attention?

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,416
[OSCAR]
When that island houses a prison

8
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,208
full of dangerous creatures,
then, yes, absolutely.

9
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:14,208
What I cannot believe is that
a Malak such as yourself

10
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:18,666
would betray Lord Artorius.
It's almost unthinkable.

11
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,208
And you must be
the Daemoneater.

12
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,041
Is that right?

13
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,625
[VELVET]
Thanks for the ship.

14
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,250
I'll use it to
strike down Artorius.

15
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,500
You deserve to die
for saying that.

16
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,333
[OSCAR]
This is a blade of exorcism,

17
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,958
granted me by
Lord Artorius himself.

18
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,291
Can you stand against it?

19
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,583
You're a Tharyan,
but still a woman.

20
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,250
I'll see that
you're treated gentl--

21
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,416
Clearly, you will force me
to be less gentle.

22
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,958
[OSCAR] I am a Praetor-class

My name is Oscar Dragonia.

24
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,083
By the order of Lord Artorius.
I place you under arrest.

Impressive, but still,
you've no chance.

33
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,875
Your savagery almost made
me forget why I'm here.

34
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,125
I didn't come all the way to the
end of the world to kill you,

35
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,458
as tempting as that may be.

36
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,541
You will be allowed to
keep your miserable life.

37
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,833
Return to the prison,

38
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:58,791
and continue to devour
Daemons, filthy beast.

39
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,458
I live for one thing,

40
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,958
and that is to hunt down
Artorius and see him dead.

41
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:08,041
I ate Daemons every day
because I had no choice.

42
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,208
Nor did I choose to
become what I am now.

43
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,458
[OSCAR] Hate us, if you wish,
but there is nothing to be done.

44
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,916
This is the role
you have been given.

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,666
The part you play in
maintaining our world.

46
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:24,625
And the part my innocent brother
had to play was sacrifice?

47
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,125
Exactly.

48
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,083
Everyone who dwells in this
world has their own purpose,

49
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,500
their own task.

50
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,916
We didn't know before,

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,041
but Lord Artorius has
shown us the path.

52
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,708
[VELVET] Yours is a world
that would trade away

53

the life of an innocent boy.

00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,166
And you truly accept that?

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,958
This world was
built on his life.

56
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,041
And now you and your
fellow Exorcists fight

57
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,750
because you want to protect it.

58
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,000
And I...

59
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,750
...will burn it!

be returning to your cell

This is the first time
that I have ever seen one.

00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,250
[SERES]
Terrifying.

68
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,375
A dragon.

69
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,125
I don't understand
what summoned it here.

70
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,375
The Daemoneater.

00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,666

[SERES] You're saying
the dragon is a Daemon?

I don't believe it.

Whether you believe
doesn't matter.

What's true is true.

79
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,458
That creature is what
human malevolence becomes.

80
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,916
We are looking at the reason

81
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,416
that Lord Artorius
reshaped the world.

82
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,166
Was that truly why?

83
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,375

After seeing this monster,
can you still rebel

87
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,583
against Lord Artorius, Seres?

88
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,666
[SERES] As a Malak, I have lived
under somebody else's control,

89
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,375
at the mercy of
his ideals. No more!

90
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,666
Now, I forge my own path.

91
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,208
Don't be absurd.

92
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,750

coming from you, of all people.

96
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,500
[MAGILOU]
What's all the noise about?

97
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:45,291
Who are you people, and why
did you disturb my beauty rest?

98
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,375
What terrible manners.

99
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,625
Not even an apology.

100
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,791
So that's the source
of all this commotion.

101
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,625
There's nothing worse
than being woken up

102
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,875
from a nap by an
irritated dragon.

103

But, honestly!

104
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,250
Does anyone care about
my suffering? No!

I'm tired, and this weather's
positively dreadful!

106
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,000
But the worst part is that I
escaped from that frigid prison

only to find a dragon
and some sunken ships!

it's the last thing I do.

00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:04,625
[SERES] You will stop at
nothing to defeat Artorius.

165
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,500
I can help you.

166
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,250
Eat me, before I die.

167
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,333
What are you talking about?

168
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,500
[SERES]
Listen. There's not much time.

169
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:23,083
I am under an oath that binds
my powers with my own life.

170
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:27,583
If you eat me, you will
be able to take my powers.

171
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,583
They will help you
achieve what you seek.

172
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,750
What could make you go so far?

173
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,041
[gasps]

174
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,750
It lingers in the
shadows of my heart.

175
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,541
As it does in yours.

176
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,375
A blazing fire
I can't extinguish.

177
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,416
This belonged to Lavi.

178
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,416
[SERES]
Please, hurry.

179
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
You must do it
before my life ends.

180
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,000
I offer neither
thanks nor apology.

181
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,666
[SERES]
I ask for neither.

182
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,791
This is all I need.

183
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,083
[yells]

184

[MAGILOU yells]

[ROKUROU yells]

189
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,916
How unfortunate.

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,166
I think we might be
in a bit of trouble.

191
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,958
[ROKUROU grunting]

192
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,041
[OSCAR]
That Arte...

193
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,375
Impossible.

194
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,000
It would mean that...
That Seres is...

195
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,750
[screams]

196
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,833
Whatever my orders were,

197
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,500
I cannot let you loose
on the world.

198
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,583
You've become more
monster than human.

199
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,875
[VELVET]
Velvet Crowe.

200
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,666
That is my name.

201
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,125
Make sure Artorius knows.

202
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,041
Velvet Crowe is coming for him.

203
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,958
I will destroy all Daemons,

204
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:57,583
all Malakim, all Exorcists.
I am a Therion!

205
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:04,041
[OSCAR yelps]

206
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,625
The wind is pickin' up a bit.

207
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,916
Well, ladies,
what's our destination?

208
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,500
One way's as good as any other.

209
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,166
I like to wander here and there,

210
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,208
wherever the wind might
decide to take me.

211
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,583
[ROKUROU]
All right.

212
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,500
Hey, tell me something, Laphi.

213
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,333
Do you know why it is
that birds can fly?

214
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,791
Huh?

215
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,583
[LAPHICET] Well, they fly
around to look for food

216
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,708
and find materials
to build their nests

217
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,041
and escape their enemies.

218
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,875
I guess that's true.

219
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,750
[LAPHICET] And maybe--maybe
they fly because it's fun.

220
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,708
Sometimes I wish I had wings.

221
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,208
Brother?

222
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,791
[VELVET]
What are you saying?

223
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,708
[ARTORIUS] To survive, we must
accept certain realities.

224
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,666
Law and order are paramount.

225
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,833
I, Artorius Collbrande,
will restore them to this world.

226
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,250
Artorius!

227
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,166
[VELVET]
Head for the Midgand Region.

228
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,125
[VELVET]
And let's be quick.

229
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,291
I have business in Lawgress.

230
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,416
I have no idea what
will happen next.

231
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,791
But that's what makes life
interesting, now isn't it?

232
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,416
Why the long face?

233
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,416
We're finally off
that horrible island.

234
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,083
We should be celebrating.

235
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,541
That dragon we faced
was a formidable foe.

236
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,791
Ugh. Yeah. Pretty scary.

237
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,833
Not to mention enormous
and hugely destructive.

238
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,375
Well, let's look
on the bright side!

239
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,041
Now we can go off
and travel the world.

240
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,583
That's the spirit!

241
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,833
Next time:

242
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,416
"Each One's Feelings." So--

243
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,875
Ooh! Rather fitting for
this rag-tag group of ours.

244
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:33,958
I agree.

245
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,708
I mean, Velvet has
her own feelings,

246
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,958
I have my own feelings.

247
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,541
And I have mine, too!

248
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,333
A great many feelings, in fact.

249
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,333
We're embarking on
quite a journey.

250
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,791
All right! I'm
gettin' excited now!

251
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,875
Let's get this party started!

252
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,375
Except, we won't actually

253
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,791
be appearing in
the next episode.

254
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,458
What? No! That isn't fair!

255
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,416
Who is gonna be
on the show, then?

256
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,583
They can't be
cooler than we are!

257
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,125
I don't know.

258
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,708
But whoever they may be,
I am certain that

259
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,958
they have their own
respective feelings, as well.
