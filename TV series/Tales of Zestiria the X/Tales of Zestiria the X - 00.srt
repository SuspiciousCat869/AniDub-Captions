1
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,583
This is all from
the tornado last year?

2
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,291
How awful.

3
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,791
[BOLTA] We found a small
village not too far from here.

4
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:41,916
Yes, Princess.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,416
The accommodations
would be basic,

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,041
but I'm sure they can provide
us shelter for the night.

7
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,083
No.

8
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,500
That won't be necessary.

9
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,541
At least, not on my account.

10
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,416
We'll find somewhere to camp.

11
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,291
[ALISHA] This is as good a place
as any to spend the night.

12
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,541
[gasps]

13
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,750
Find something, Princess?

14
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:26,625
I have.

15
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:29,000
This is ancient artwork.

16
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,458
[BOLTA] Do you think it could
be from Asgardian times?

17
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,625
[ALISHA]
Mm. It's possible.

18
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,500
[GANETTE]
What is this?

19
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,666
[BOLTA]
A Shepherd!

20
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,458
That's what it looks like.

21
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,500
If Clemm were here to see this,

22
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,666
she would be
absolutely ecstatic.

23
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,583
She's obsessed with
this stuff, you know.

24
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,250
She believes every
word that's written

25
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,208
in <i>The Celestial Record</i> .

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,708
I showed her the book,
so I understand her fascination.

27
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,208
I share it.

28
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,875
So, Princess, do you
agree with her

29
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,666
that what's written
in the book is true?

30
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,625
Do you believe in the Shepherds?

31
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,541
[ALISHA] All I know for certain
is that if Shepherds

32
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,500
do exist, I would
like to meet one.

33
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,000
Very much.

34
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,916
[CLEMM]
Attention please!

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,625
Those who wish to attempt
the Rite of the Warrior

36
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,083
during the Sacred Blade
Festival should apply

37
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,208
inside the temple.

38
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,833
[TAO]
Clemm!

39
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,708
The princess is looking for you.

40
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,791
Go, and I'll take
over for you here.

41
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,750
Thank you. I'll go right away.

42
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,500
[TAO] The Rite of the
warrior is approaching!

43
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,458
Is there anybody here
who wishes to attempt it?

44
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,583
[CLEMM]
How may I be of service?

45
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,958
[MALTRAN]
I understand you have an uncle.

46
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,541
And he's a doctor in Griel,
is that correct?

47
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,291
[CLEMM]
Yes. it is indeed, Master.

48
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,333
So, I believe Clemm is
who we want for this task.

49
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,458
What task?

50
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,708
We've had a report.

51
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,166
It comes from Professor
Drake, the astronomer.

52
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,833
He has recently
observed the appearance

53
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,708
of what he describes as
a strange cloud or mist.

54
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,250
According to the professor,

55
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,500
it seems to be unaffected by
wind or rain but remains still,

56
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,458
stubbornly hanging in the sky
regardless of the weather.

57
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,416
[MALTRAN] The location
is where you come in.

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,583
The cloud was
sighted over Griel.

59
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,916
I see why you called me.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,708
[ALISHA]
Hyland has seen many unusual

61
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,750
weather phenomena in
the past few years,

62
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,791
and crops have been seriously
damaged as a result.

63
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,500
I want to know if this has had
any lasting negative effects

64
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,458
on the people there.

65
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,250
[CLEMM]
Yes, ma'am! I'll see to it.

66
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,500
[ALISHA]
Good, thank you.

67
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,041
[CLEMM]
I'll head out at once.

68
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,833
[CLEMM]
Your Highness, before I go.

69
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,500
Thank you so much
of giving me this copy

70
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,000
of <i>The Celestial Record</i> .

71
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,583
I consider it my most
treasured possession.

72
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,916
I'm glad I shared it with you.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,458
That's what it's for.

74
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,750
[laughs]

75
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,083
[ALISHA]
Absolutely not!

76
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,875
These young people
came here to celebrate

77
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,916
the Sacred Blade Festival,
and you want to conscript them?

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,208
That would be a flagrant
abuse of power, Lord Matthia!

79
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,416
Please consider
carefully, Highness.

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,416
We cannot know for
certain what will happen,

81
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,083
but the sickness in
the town of Marlind

82
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,166
could very well
become an epidemic.

83
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,083
If it does, military
intervention may be required.

84
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,583
Perhaps, but deploying the army

85
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,958
and reinforcing its ranks
are two separate discussions.

86
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,333
I'm afraid they are not.

87
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,625
Where will we find the manpower
to send a security force

88
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,458
if we don't begin
looking at once?

89
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,041
You, Your Highness
should be using

90
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,375
your power and influence
to recruit patriots

91
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,750
in the royal family's name.

92
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,000
That is the duty
of your position.

93
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,583
[ALISHA]
I see now.

94
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,416
That's why you agreed to hold
the Festival in the first place.

95
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,041
To boost recruitment numbers.

96
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,416
I say this in the name
of the royal family.

97
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,291
The Sacred Blade Festival

98
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,583
shall not be used to wage war!

99
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,291
[ALISHA] The mist does
seem to be thickening.

100
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,000
But what could it mean?

101
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,416
[DRAKE] I can't say for sure.
But I don't like it.

102
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,291
I feel there's something
sinister about the mist.

103
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,875
And that feeling
only intensifies

104
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,000
as the cloud keeps growing.

105
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,208
Forgive my dramatics,
but it feels like a sign

106
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,208
that something terrible
is about to happen.

107
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,916
[ALISHA] Someone must go
to Griel to find Clemm

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,041
and learn what
she has discovered.

109
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,916
I'd be happy to, Princess.

[ALISHA]
Ganette.

111

How long has it been now
since Clemm left for Griel?

112
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,833
[GANETTE] I believe it was
about two weeks ago.

That's far too long.

If you somebody
needs to check on her,

then I should be the one to go.

As her teacher, that
duty is surely mine.

[ALISHA]
No, Master.

Nothing can stand in the way.

There is an ancient
underground aqueduct in Griel

[BOLTA] Clemm likes
to talk on and on about

00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,916

[TAO] Well, if that's

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,666
[ALISHA] This reminds me of
something Clemm said before.

175
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,000
She compared the green grapes

176
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,083
that grow in this
region to jewels.

[CLEMM]
The professor has a theory.

253
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,750
He says the world is
connected by the Earth pulse.

254
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,916
It's like a pathway
that circulate

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,333
the forces of nature throughout
the world, creating balance.

But that balance is being lost.

mankind did not live alone.

00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,333
We doomed ourselves
through our own arrogance.

263
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,625
We forgot that we were meant
to share this world,

and for that, we are
now paying the price.

That is what I believe,
though I don't know
