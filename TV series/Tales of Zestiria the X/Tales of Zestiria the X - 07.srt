1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,666
Lailah! Inside the tornado!

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,708
Oh no.

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:22,958
Is that...?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,791
It looks like a dragon.

5
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,875
[MIKLEO]
It's moving!

6
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,000
[MALTRAN]
Alisha! Hurry!

7
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,708
Get inside!
It's coming this way!

8
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,583
[ALISHA]
Guards! Where are the guards?

9
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,625
[MIKLEO]
It's heading towards the castle.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,458
Alisha.

11
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,458
Anyone who seeks shelter
inside the castle

12
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,083
will be granted it, understood?

13
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,166
[SOLDIER A]
Yes, ma'am!

14
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,541
He's here.

15
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,875
Sorey!

16
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,958
[LAILAH]
You can't fight that.

17
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,916
She's right. It's too dangerous!

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,416
There's something about it.

19
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,791
I'm not sure what,
just something.

20
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,500
What's that mean?

21
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,291
Is it really gone?

22
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,000
[MIKLEO]
Dragons. Calamity incarnate.

23
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,583
Harbingers of death
and destruction.

24
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,166
That dragon, how was it formed?

25
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,291
Is it a product of malevolence?

26
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,750
Yes. Malevolence.

27
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,250
It's almost too
horrifying to believe.

28
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:22,833
An actual dragon,
right here in Ladylake.

29
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,333
[ALISHA]
Sorey!

30
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,625
[SOREY]
Alisha!

31
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,458
You saved us. We owe you
our lives twice over.

32
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, no, it wasn't actually...

33
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,416
Sorey. Look down there.

34
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,958
[MAN A] Did you see that?
The tornado is gone!

35
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,333
[MAN B] I can't believe it!
He really saved us!

36
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,208
[MAN C]
Shepherd!

37
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,500
[MAN D]
Thank you, Shepherd!

38
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,000
[SOREY]
Wait, hold on!

39
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,666
Uh... You don't understand.
It just went away. I--

40
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,166
[BARTLOW]
Oh, Lord Shepherd!

41
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,041
How can we ever thank you?

42
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,125
That dragon might've killed us
all had you not used your powers

43
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,458
to chase it away from the city.

44
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,541
[SOREY]
I really didn't do anything.

45
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,625
[BARTLOW chuckles]

46
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,500
[BARTLOW]
You're too modest, surely.

47
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,875
Now, Lord Shepherd,

48
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:18,083
if you will permit me,
I have a small request.

49
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,375
I would like to get
to know you better.

50
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,125
Perhaps we could share a meal
together and speak more.

51
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,375
I'd be honored to have you.

52
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,625
What's this about?
What are you up to?

53
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,458
Why, nothing. Such a
strange thing to ask.

54
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,958
The Shepherd is weary.

55
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,125
I am simply offering
my hospitality

56
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,250
so he can rest after the
trials of the past few days.

57
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,625
That's nice of you. I accept.

58
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,000
[BARTLOW chuckles]

59
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,833
[BARTLOW] The Shepherd has
accepted my invitation

60
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,250
to remain in the city!

61
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,333
[VILLAGERS chattering]

62
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,750
Sorey.

63
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,083
How 'bout you?
Can you come along, too?

64
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,166
[SOREY]
Sorry, can we stop the carriage?

65
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:20,791
It's awful.

66
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,041
Yes.

67
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,083
[LAILAH] Ladylake hasn't
been completely consumed

68
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,708
by malevolence yet.

69
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,750
But it's only a matter of time.

70
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,458
The darkness grows.

71
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
[SOREY]
We have to do something.

72
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:51,041
[OFFICER A] Welcome,
Lord Shepherd. It is an honor.

73
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,458
Oh.

74
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,500
If you will remain in the
carriage, Princess Alisha,

75
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,416
it will escort you.

76
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,833
Escort me?

77
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,041
[OFFICER A]
It will take you directly

78
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,250
to the palace, Your Highness.

79
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,000
The king wishes to speak
with you immediately.

80
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,541
--I haven't heard an--
--[OFFICER A] We must hurry.

81
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,958
[OFFICER A] You don't want
to keep the king waiting.

82
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,958
It appears that someone
doesn't want Alisha

83
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,750
to be present for this.

84
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,375
Sorry. I have to go now.

85
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,500
It's all right. I understand.

86
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,041
Please follow me, Sir.

87
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,833
[BARTLOW]
Does the food look satisfactory?

88
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,333
[SOREY]
Yes, thank you.

89
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,291
Forgive an old man
his curiosity,

90
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,541
but what's your connection
to the princess?

91
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,291
I'd say we're friends.

92
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,000
How fortunate.

93
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,916
We haven't known each other
long, but I trust her already.

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm really glad I met Alisha.

95
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:41,875
Yes.

96
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,000
And what about you and I?

97
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,333
Do you think we might
become friends?

98
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,666
So this is all
about friendship?

99
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,666
Yes.

100
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,125
Heh. Not what I was expecting.

101
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,833
Let us toast to friendship.

102
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,166
[MIKLEO]
Sorey.

103
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,333
Be careful of what he gives you.

104
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,375
It's good.

105
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,166
Oh, wow. So good!

106
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,291
It's a specialty here in Hyland.

107
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,500
And one of our chief exports.

108
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,791
Though production has
been severely limited

109
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,416
as recent disasters have
taken a toll on the harvests.

110
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,083
What did you want to talk about?

111
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,125
I was merely wondering
about your future plans.

112
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,208
You've already done
so much for our city,

113
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,791
and we would be overjoyed

114
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,833
if you would consider remaining
in Ladylake to aid us further.

115
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,291
Thanks, but there's
something I must to do.

116
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,791
Oh. Indeed. Perhaps
you could elaborate?

117
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,041
I intend to go after the dragon.

118
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,375
Really? And what will
you do if you find it?

119
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,625
To be honest, I don't really
know the answer to that yet.

120
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,791
They say dragons
represent ill omens.

121
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,375
If I can find it,

122
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,375
maybe that could be the first
step toward healing this world.

123
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,500
[LAILAH]
Sorey.

124
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,208
[SOREY]
Hey!

125
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,250
Could you use another
pair of hands?

126
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:16,333
[ALISHA] The sun is going down.
We should wrap things up here.

127
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,833
Sorey, I am going to be
leaving soon for Marlind.

128
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,958
It is a direct order
from the king.

129
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,500
You're going away?

130
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,000
Was it really the king, or was
that Bartlow guy behind it?

131
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:29,625
[ALISHA] I don't know. But
it doesn't matter either way.

132
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,125
The people of Marlind
are suffering.

133
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,375
I want to help if I can.

134
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,375
[OFFICER A]
Was that a wise idea?

135
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,833
Allowing the Shepherd
to walk away?

136
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,416
If he wishes to leave
Ladylake, let him go.

137
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,583
He'll be out of our hair and
we won't have to shed any blood.

138
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,208
True. And our preparations?

139
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:53,166
For the war?
We must proceed.

140
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,666
Lailah, can I talk to you?

141
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,750
[LAILAH] Is something wrong,
Mikleo? You seem upset.

142
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,583
Well, when I look at Sorey,

143
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,833
I can only think things are
gonna be different now.

144
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,625
He's accepted his
destiny as Shepard

145
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,791
with absolutely no hesitation.

146
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,291
You feel like his new identity

147
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,125
has created a distance
between you?

148
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,041
I don't know. Maybe that's it.

149
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,458
And now,

150
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,375
Sorey has his destiny,
but what is yours going to be?

151
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,833
I wish I knew. I feel lost.

152
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,791
Everything changed the moment
he pulled that sword

153
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,333
from the stone.

154
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,875
Yes.

155
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,750
Sorey is the legendary Shepherd.

156
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,791
I'm happy for him,
but what about my life?

157
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,125
I left home to help him
search for Alisha.

158
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,083
I never expected all this.

159
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,250
Do you wish to
return to Elysium?

160
00:09:56,333 --> 00:10:00,750
[MIKLEO] No. That thought
did cross my mind, but...

161
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,541
Sorey has a mission.

162
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,000
To gain experience
as a Shepherd,

163
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,125
he has to travel the world.

164
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,625
How can I leave him
to do that alone?

165
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,750
He means a lot to you.

166
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,833
Sorey has been your beloved
friend for a long time now.

167
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,916
We were just sort
of stuck together.

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,083
And now you're frustrated

169
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,208
because you aren't
sure you can help him.

170
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,875
But you know, there is a way.

171
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,125
[SOREY] Come on. We have
to go after Mikleo!

172
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,750
What if he should happen
to run into a hellion

173
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,375
and he's all on his own?

174
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,625
What was he thinking?
He should know better!

175
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,541
I can't believe he'd
take off like that!

176
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,916
[SOREY yelps]

177
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,416
[SOREY] I guess he must've
had a good reason.

178
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,083
Mikleo would never
just run away.

179
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,750
So you've decided not
to go after him?

180
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,500
He'll be okay, and I have
a lot of work to do

181
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,500
to become a real Shepherd.

182
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,958
[LAILAH] If you're looking
for a mission of your own,

183
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,666
I can give you one.

184
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,416
Leave the capital and
travel far to the north.

185
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,750
In time, you will come
to a large lake.

186
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,250
There, you will find what is
known as the Galahad Ruins.

187
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,000
Inside the ruins is
an ancient treasure,

188
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,875
a legendary Divine Artifact.

189
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,541
[MIKLEO]
Artifact?

190
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:42,166
Yes. Similar to what the
Sacred Blade is for me.

191
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,500
A relic of great power.

192
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,291
That may be the answer
to what you seek.

193
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,666
So with it, I would be
able to help Sorey?

194
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,416
[LAILAH]
I believe so.

195
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,333
[SOREY]
Ready to head out?

196
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,666
Good, you're here!

197
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,750
I need to get to Marlind.
The plauge's not going to wait.

198
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,083
Before you go, take this.

199
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,208
Is that...?

200
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,541
Mikleo found it in the ruins.

201
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,750
I'm sorry it took me so long

202
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,541
to finally put it back
in your hands.

203
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,875
Thanks so much!

204
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:24,083
I'm glad he found it.
It's very precious to me.

205
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,541
Sorey.

206
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,583
Well, feel free to say no,
but would you ride with us?

207
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,833
Maybe even just partway,
as an extra guard.

208
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,416
I'd love to!

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,791
[ALISHA] Seeing a dragon
for the first time,

210
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,916
the people shrank back in fear.

211
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,083
No longer just a legend,
it had become terrifyingly real.

212
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,291
[SOREY] You think there's
a clue in this story?

213
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:53,625
[ALISHA]
Yes. Rayfalke Spiritcrest.

214
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,958
A precipitous mountain.

215
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,625
It appears numerous times
in dragon legends.

216
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,041
[SOREY]
All right then, I'm going there.

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,708
They are called "trangelongs,"
unique to this forest.

218
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,250
They're watching us.

219
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,625
Don't worry. These are
gentle creatures.

220
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,000
[chuckles]

221
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:27,958
[MIKLEO]
Hm?

222
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,250
[rustling]

223
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,708
Damn. What kinda
hellion is that?

224
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,583
A snake? Lizard?

225
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,250
[MIKLEO screams]

226
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,208
[ALISHA]
How does everything look?

227
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,666
Great, thanks.

228
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,750
And are you sure that Lady
Lailah does not need to eat?

229
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,500
We have more than enough.

230
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,208
[SOREY] She's fine,
but thanks for asking.

231
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,000
[ALISHA]
She should at least try this.

232
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,666
I made it from some fruit
that I found nearby.

233
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,875
I just ground them up and
then steeped them in hot water.

234
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:35,708
[gasps]

235
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,166
Wow, that's sour! And yet--

236
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,083
Tasty?

237
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,416
Yeah! It's really good.

238
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,166
[LAILAH]
Sorey.

239
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,791
[SOREY]
Yeah.

240
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,333
Alisha, please?

241
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,041
Can you hear my voice?

242
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,500
Yes, Lady Lailah.

243
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,791
Thank you for the drink.
It was lovely.

244
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,666
[ALISHA]
Of course!

245
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,791
--[thud]
--[SOLDIER B yelps]

246
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,625
But the trangelongs don't
ever attack humans!

247
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,625
[LAILAH]
Sorey.

248
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,375
Yeah, that creature...

249
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,875
...is a hellion!

250
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,875
[ALISHA] We'll pass two more
villages and cross a wide river,

251
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,416
then we'll be in Marlind.

252
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,541
[SOREY] Tell me about it.
What's it like?

253
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,333
[ALISHA] It has the
second highest population

254
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,208
in the kingdom, after Ladylake.

255
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,208
It's known as a city
of culture and learning,

256
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,625
with the highest literacy
rate in the country.

257
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,833
My father took such pride in it.

258
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,458
[SOREY]
But that was before the plague?

259
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,666
Do you think the city
will be able to recover?

260
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,166
It's hard to know, really.

261
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,125
I'm not sure how much help
these doctors will be.

262
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,625
I'd love to know more about you.

263
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,750
[SOREY]
Like what?

264
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,750
[ALISHA]
Well, you said you've

265
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,041
never left Elysium
before, right?

266
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,416
[SOREY]
Right.

267
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,625
It's been my home for as
long as I can remember.

268
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,375
There was a big fire
when I was just a baby,

269
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,666
and Gramps saved me from it.

270
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,375
I guess you could say Elysium
kind of adopted me.

271
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,916
I didn't have the
chance to talk to him,

272
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,250
but Gramps sounds
like a good person.

273
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,208
[SOREY]
Yeah, he is.

274
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,375
We all knew we were safe

275
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,375
because we lived
under his blessing.

276
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,708
I can see how important
that was now.

277
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,208
How do I put this?

278
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,750
Um, you are human, right?

279
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,125
Of course.

280
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,250
But you see the Seraphim.

281
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,375
Have you always been
able to do that?

282
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,916
I don't know about always,

283
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,958
but for as long
as I can remember.

284
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,875
Actually, according to Gramps,

285
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,041
I learned how to hear and see
them by living among them.

286
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,208
I'd love to learn
about the Seraphim.

287
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,625
Are there some things
you could teach me?

288
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,208
[SOREY]
Hmm.

289
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,916
I wonder where I should begin...

290
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,291
Some stuff you know.

291
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,916
Like how <i>The</i>
<i>Celestial Record</i> says

292
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,125
that humans lived among the
Seraphim and could hear them.

293
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,500
Did you also know
that the Seraphim

294
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,708
used to live all
throughout the world?

295
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,875
They were the living embodiments
of earth, wind, water, and fire.

296
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,583
They used their power to support
and sustain the world itself.

297
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:35,708
[ALISHA]
Earth, wind, water, fire.

298
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,583
[SOREY] Yeah. Seraphim aren't
all-powerful, you know.

299
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,333
They have strengths
and weaknesses.

300
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:44,000
Lailah is a Seraph of fire,
and Mikleo's element is water,

301
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,416
so they have different talents.

302
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,375
[ALISHA]
There's so much I don't know.

303
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,375
Like, why did we stop being
able to see the Seraphim?

304
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,833
What happened?

305
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,750
And when they left, is that
what caused this era of chaos?

306
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,583
[SOREY] Grandpa said people lost
reverence for the Seraphim.

307
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,541
Their doubt and fear turned
to anger and hatred.

308
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,791
They began to fight each other,
and their negative emotions

309
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,541
polluted the world
with darkness.

310
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,375
So you mean, we're
the ones responsible?

311
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,750
The calamities that are tearing
apart the world are our fault?

312
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,291
[SOREY]
I'm not sure.

313
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,708
What I do know is that the world
is full of malevolence now.

314
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,625
The air is thick with it.

315
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,625
And the disasters will only keep
getting worse and more frequent.

316
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,291
Back when we were in Elysium,

317
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,625
you said your dream
was to create

318
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,958
a new world, a better one.

319
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,791
Humans and Seraphim together.

320
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,625
I remember you telling
me that very clearly.

321
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,250
Though, I didn't
understand it at the time.

322
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,041
I didn't know yet that you'd
been raised by Seraphim.

323
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,041
The only human,
but you never felt lonely.

324
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,583
It makes sense that you
became the Shepherd.

325
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,208
[SOREY]
Lonely?

326
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,958
I don't remember ever feeling
lonely growing up in Elysium.

327
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:58,041
Everyone was always
there for me.

328
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,708
Mikleo was always there for me.

329
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,625
If Lailah was right,
the ruins should be near here.

330
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,500
And the divine artifact
should be within.

331
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,166
He's not gonna beat
me to it this time.

332
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,083
Looks like it's
not much farther.

333
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,333
Rayfalke Spiritcrest.

334
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,083
Let's go.

335
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,458
Well, looks like I
beat you to it, Sorey.

336
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,625
I guess I beat you
to it again, Mikleo.

337
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,500
[LAILAH] The moon is
beautiful tonight, isn't it?

338
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,583
It is.

339
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,125
I bet you Mikleo's
looking at it, too.

340
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,541
Yeah.

341
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,458
[gasps]

342
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,458
[SOREY]
What's wrong?


343
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,250
You've got such a serious
look on your face.


344
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,708
Oh, hi, Sorey.


345
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,208
Sorry, I've just been
thinking about purification.


346
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,208
Purification.
That's pretty hard.


347
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,375
Yeah.


348
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,541
'm still inexperienced
as a Shepherd.


349
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,125
Honestly, purifying the
world sounds so difficult;


350
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,125
I'm not sure if
I'll be able to do it.


351
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,125
I'm sure you'll learn.


352
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,125
Still, I will try my hardest,


353
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,083
training as we journey
around the world.


354
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,500
And maybe someday
I'll be strong enough


355
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,291
to banish all the malevolence!


356
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,916
If you've been thinking
about it as well,


357
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,291
then maybe you can help me!


358
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,500
[SOREY laughs]


359
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,875
Well, I am the Shepherd!
Purifying's my job.


360
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,083
[LAILAH gasps]


361
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,416
Something wrong, Lailah?


362
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,583
I finally got it!


363
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,083
Huh? Got what?


364
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,875
Purification! I figured it out!


365
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:35,750
[SOREY]
Hm?


366
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,083
Come now, Sorey.


367
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,333
I don't understand why
you'd wanna fight Mikleo.


368
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,916
Really, it's pure nonsense.


369
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,375
Get it? It's pure nonsense.


370
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,458
This was all a set-up
for a bad pun?


371
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,083
Next episode,
"Rayfalke Spiritcrest."


372
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,166
Look forward to it!


373
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,041
Hey, Lailah.
Who was that just now?
