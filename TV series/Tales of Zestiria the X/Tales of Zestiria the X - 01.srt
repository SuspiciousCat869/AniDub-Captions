It's a mural of the Shepard!

I think this is what it depicts.

10
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:28,083
Yes. It's the Legend
of the Shepard.

11
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,791
The Capital of Seraphim
was a sacred place.

12
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,750
It stood higher than
the highest peaks,

13
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,791
magnificent and unassailable.

14
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,666
Its gates remained
tightly closed,

15
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,708
opening only for those
whose task it was

16

to lead the world of man.

17
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,375
And a time came when
the Shephard arrived

18
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,541
on the Earth,
accompanied by Seraphim

19
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,166
and wielding their might.

20
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,583
The Shepherd then cleansed
the world of darkness.

21
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,458
and brought salvation.

I think it is.

00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,833
The symbol of the Shephard.

50
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,458
Where the symbol...
How does the legend go?

The symbol will guide the way,

00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:45,666
and the path will open.
Is the legend actually true?

Sorey!

Hey, Mikleo!

61
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,000
[MIKLEO]
What are you thinking,

62
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,958
wandering off on your own again?

63
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,125
Sometimes I think you forget

64
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,041
that you're just
a regular human.

65
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,208
Fall from here,
and that's it for you.

68
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,916
I can see why you risked it.

69
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,208
Pretty amazing, huh?

70
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,166
Yeah, it is!

71
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,875
[MIKLEO]
Anyway,

72
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:14,916
we may not have known
about those ruins,

73
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,125
but you can be sure
the elders did.

74
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,125
[SOREY]
I guess you're probably right.

75
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,250
I wonder...

76
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,666
They know we love
exploring ruins,

77
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,791
and they didn't tell
us about that one.

78
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:25,750
Is there a reason?

79
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,125
Huh?

80
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,125
[MIKLEO]
Hm? What are you doing?

You don't yet,
but check this out.

85
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,541
[MIKLEO]
I get it now.

86
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:53,375
One of Gramps' illusions, huh?
That's a nice catch Sorey.

87
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,041
Ha, ha!

88
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,833
So... What now?

89
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,541
We head right down and
check it out, obviously!

90
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,666
[GRAMPS]
No.

[SOREY]
Gramps?

93
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,166
Why aren't we allowed in there?

94
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,125
Because the area is sealed off,

95
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,291
and it's not your
place to question why.

96
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:14,333
You boys are not to
approach it for any reason.

97
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,833
Do not even think
about exploring it.

98
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,375
Understood?

99
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,375
I wonder why that ruin's
off-limits to us.

100
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,875
Gramps was so serious about it.

101
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,125
Come here and look at this.

102
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,000
The chapter of arrival.

103
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,000
"Long ago, in the
age of the gods.

104
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,000
the world was
shrouded in darkness.

105
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,166
but dark fled when
the Seraphim came.

106
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,125
bringing light back
into the world.

107
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,750
The Seraphim did not
all abide in one place.

108
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,291
Rather, they spread
throughout the world,

109
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,625
that they could support
all its inhabitants.

110
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:54,208
Some choose to reside
in the Capital of Seraphim.

111
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,791
And you're thinking
the ruins we saw today

112
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,166
are that same Capital.

113
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,000
Interesting theory,
I'll give you that.

114
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,333
Look.

115
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,541
[MIKLEO] According to this,
the humans who lived

116
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,708
within the Capital of Seraphim
began to worship the Seraphim,

117
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,125
and those men who had the talent

118
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,000
were allowed to speak to them.

119
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,291
Humans and Seraphim, together?

120
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,583
[SOREY] That's right,
living in the same place.

121
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,625
The people prayed to the
Seraphim, and in return,

122
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,500
the Seraphim blessed them.

123
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,291
Can you imagine what living in
that era would've been like?

124
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,750
Two worlds uniting--
humans and Seraphim actually

125
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,458
bonding together and
talking to each other.

126
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,750
[MIKLEO] Hm. Certainly
sounds different.

127
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,458
[MIKLEO]
<i>The Celestial Record</i> .

128
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,750
You put a lot of faith
in that book, don't you?

129
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,000
Of course.

130
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,625
Anyway, it's got
tons of descriptions

131
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,791
of what certain places
used to look like.

132
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,875
Based on what it says,
I think the ruins we found

133
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,666
are the Capital of Seraphim!

134
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,250
[MIKLEO]
So you're going to explore them?

135
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,958
[SOREY]
Aren't you coming with me?

136
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,541
Of course.

137
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,458
But there is something
we ought to keep in mind.

138
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,416
I noticed it when
we were out there.

139
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,791
Did you catch it?

140
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,375
The ruins are outside
Gramps' area of protection.

141
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,333
Guess they are, aren't they?

142
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,458
[MIKLEO]
Even so,

143
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,375
I still wanna see them.

144
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,458
Are you sure?

145
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,625
Gramps'll be really mad
if he finds out.

146
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,333
[MIKLEO] Don't tell me you've
changed your mind about going.

147
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,791
No way, <i>and</i> I'm
gonna find something

148
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,541
cool in there before you do.

149
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,875
So it's a race, then.

150
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,208
Yeah!

I guess this means
you win. Well done then.

that for me now?

Thank you, Kyme. But I am aware.

There has been a disturbance.

Yes.

How would you like to proceed?

of Sorey and Mikleo?

Such reckless young men.

be more careful.

Oh, right.

How do you think this was made?

[MIKLEO]
Not with human technology.

265

That would've been impossible.

00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,333
Then wouldn't that
mean that the bridge

is at least as old as

is essential.

It's too scary! I don't
know where to start.

about talking to girls.

306
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,041
Gramps did give me
a few pointers for that.

307
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,833
As the guy, you've
gotta keep it cool.

308
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:24,708
So...

309
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,666
Show me an example.

310
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,458
Okay.

311
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,416
I'll be playing the girl.

312
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,916
Right.

What's your favorite food?

317
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,708
Mine's salad!

318
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,916
I ignore.

319
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,250
And how exactly is this
supposed to help me

320
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,041
get close to her?

321
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,583
Don't ask me, okay?

322
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,041
Gramps just said this is the
right way to deal with humans!

323
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,291
Next week, "Elysia."

Look forward to it!

325
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,791
Sorey. You've got some time.

326
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,250
Make sure you practice.

327
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,833
Okay...
