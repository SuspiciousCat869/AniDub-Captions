1
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:03,313
All right. Let's do this...

2
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:05,313
From here we should split up.

3
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:06,273
Okay.

4
00:00:08,636 --> 00:00:11,274
There are at least three intruders in our facility.

5
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:14,088
Terada and Koyama have been defeated.

6
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,572
It's time for you, the Awakened, to shine!

7
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:21,357
You've endured the trials of
rigorous training and came out strong.

8
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:24,892
Now's your chance to show just how powerful we can be!

9
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:31,433
Though... none of you stand a chance.

10
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,781
No way!

11
00:02:08,065 --> 00:02:10,821
So all the Scars were sent after the intruders?

12
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:13,521
That's big. They must be worried.

13
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,378
When are we gonna get in on the action?

14
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:18,226
I feel like all we do is lame grunt work around here.

15
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:19,812
Just let it go, man.

16
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:22,635
'Cause those who don't awaken
will always be stuck at the bottom.

17
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:25,408
Eventually, we'll end up subordinates of kids like him.

18
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,928
Ain't that the truth. Speaking of...

19
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:31,315
Did you hear about the kid who
was sent here from HQ as a temp?

20
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:32,915
From what I understand,

21
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,649
he's an Awakened Child that they created on their own.

22
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,520
A normal kid survived that insane
awakening experiment HQ puts them through?

23
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:41,593
Lucky!

24
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:44,285
I wanna be in an experiment for the big-wigs, too.

25
00:02:44,394 --> 00:02:47,120
You wanna die? Don't even think about it.

26
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:50,350
The destruction of your mind's
just the beginning of that torture.

27
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:52,854
Really? Gen, you know about HQ?

28
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:54,622
Just stories, mostly.

29
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:57,917
Heard the trials are so painful
most people don't make it out alive.

30
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:02,407
After 20 years as a lackey around
here, I've learned HQ is bad news.

31
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,362
You don't want nothin' to do with those guys.

32
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:05,488
Wait...

33
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:08,769
Hang on a sec. What the hell
do you think you guys are doin'?

34
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:10,908
Should've known it wouldn't be easy.

35
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,546
What happened to your trainers?!

36
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:13,626
Took them out.

37
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:17,125
What?! Can't believe they were
beaten by a bunch of snot-nosed kids.

38
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:18,286
We'll take care of...

39
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,439
Let 'em go!

40
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,408
No way! Are you serious?

41
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:25,202
I wasn't expecting that... Are you sure?

42
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:27,443
Yeah. Just go.

43
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:28,957
Thanks, I appreciate it.

44
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:31,738
We aren't gonna get stabbed in the back, are we?

45
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:34,459
What the hell?! Why'd you...?!

46
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,654
Shut your mouths, you youngins!

47
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:39,258
You don't know anything about how the world works!

48
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,488
An ESP-er and a normal human are like night and day.

49
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,836
The difference in strength is astronomical.

50
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:48,226
If it's a powerful one, it's like zero versus ten.

51
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,873
There's no way you can win.

52
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,791
Damn it. If only my powers had awakened, I could've...

53
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:54,691
Give it up.

54
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:58,123
If you don't awaken the first time
around, there's no hope of it happening.

55
00:03:58,184 --> 00:03:58,662
Ever.

56
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:00,287
Wait. Seriously?

57
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:02,420
We're gonna be lackeys forever?!

58
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:04,705
There's no way you're fine with that, Gen!

59
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,781
I don't think you kids are really grasping the situation.

60
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,994
Claw will definitely rule over this world.

61
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,201
And when they do, all of us lackeys
who supported them will be rewarded.

62
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:21,729
But for right now, we just need to wait things out.

63
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:24,613
Until the day the revolution is finally upon us!

64
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:29,108
Ah-hah. What do we have here?

65
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,772
From the looks of that door, I'd say I
found somewhere or something pretty special.

66
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,267
Must be where they're keeping Ritsu and the others.

67
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,140
Hm?

68
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:41,888
Uh?

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,705
I thought it was one of the intruders at first,

70
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,204
but it's just security.

71
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,286
What are you wanderin' around for?

72
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,463
Oh, so that's where I am! I got a little turned around.

73
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:53,620
My sense of direction is just terrible.

74
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,715
Just do your damn job, okay?

75
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:57,453
Right, sorry about that.

76
00:04:57,518 --> 00:04:58,123
Hmm...

77
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:00,147
What's over here?

78
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:02,584
I haven't actually been inside this room yet.

79
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:05,824
Maybe I'll just have a peek as long as I'm down here.

80
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:06,494
Hold it!

81
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:09,546
You're lying. You're an impostor.

82
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:14,243
I'm telling you to let me see the room, small fries.

83
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:16,204
This guy's one of the intruders!

84
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,000
Everyone, release your powers!

85
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:19,493
Whoa.

86
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,051
Individually, they're no big deal, but
they're not bad when they work together.

87
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,593
A normal human wouldn't be able to escape from this.

88
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,383
How long do you think you can keep this up, tough guy?!

89
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,289
Hey, nice effort.

90
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,586
But you're still outclassed!

91
00:05:40,677 --> 00:05:42,740
Now. Back to the matter at hand.

92
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:45,763
Let's see what's goin' on in this room.

93
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,764
Hey, you! Explain this.

94
00:05:48,797 --> 00:05:52,065
Uh. Well, th-this is the awakening experiments room...

95
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,607
These look like a bunch of torture devices.

96
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,462
Yes...

97
00:05:55,627 --> 00:06:00,274
Our organization discovered that experiencing
pain is a catalyst to being awakened.

98
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:04,024
Hmm... Actually, they're not too far off.

99
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:06,589
But even after going through that much pain,

100
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,940
all you guys can do is momentarily inconvenience someone.

101
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:13,301
In the end, the world really does favor the gifted.

102
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:17,867
You'll never be A-listers. You have a
better chance focusing on body building.

103
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:19,315
Is that so?

104
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:22,003
What do we have here?

105
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:25,224
It's not every day a ghost wanders into our facilities.

106
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:27,373
How would you like to become my ghost?

107
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:30,310
I promise I'll take excellent care of you.

108
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,912
So you wanna own me, do you?

109
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:37,940
Someone dangerous just showed up.

110
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:41,757
Huh?!

111
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:44,072
You weren't able to find them in their cage?!

112
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:45,848
Don't mess with me, punk!

113
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,411
I told you to bring 'em here! So where are they?!

114
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:49,744
Well, you see, uh,

115
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:52,301
from the looks of it, they got out on their own.

116
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,221
If you're lying to me, I'll kick your lackey ass!

117
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:57,023
I'm not lying. I swear!

118
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,423
Okay, then.

119
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:03,017
Good grief.

120
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:06,998
I don't like imitating those thugs from the alley,

121
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:09,325
but it seems to work well on weaklings.

122
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:12,121
This isn't over.

123
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,983
You're wide open! Ignite!

124
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:18,018
Ha, ha! With this flame, I'll...!

125
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:21,321
Can't believe you thought you could fight me.

126
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:22,976
Those powers are a joke.

127
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:27,188
It's funny. Everyone in Claw seems a little...

128
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:35,810
Aw, did you get burned?

129
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,506
What you're seeing is true pyrokinesis.

130
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,680
The ability to wield fire at will.

131
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:46,256
A Scar...

132
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:49,353
Are you the brat Koyama was goin' on and on about?

133
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:50,867
How pathetic.

134
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,761
I'll turn your body to ash.

135
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,148
I know what you're thinking.

136
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:03,338
"It's okay, my barrier can withstand this!"

137
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:24,116
The inside of your barrier
turns into an insanely hot sauna.

138
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:27,691
So much so that your lungs will burn when you breathe.

139
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,565
A stupid mistake amateurs like
you make time and time again.

140
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,069
You're the amateur here.

141
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,084
Big talk, kid.

142
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,639
But in order to fight back,
you'll have to drop your barrier.

143
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:42,271
And when you do, you'll be burned to a crisp.

144
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:44,766
And if you keep this up, you'll be steamed.

145
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,296
So that means this fight is over.

146
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,783
Your options are either burn to
death or surrender to me and hope...

147
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:51,686
Bring it on.

148
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:55,247
Sure!

149
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,538
Prepare to die!

150
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:01,283
Now I won't spare you, even if you beg me to!

151
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,659
But given how much heat I'm throwing at you,

152
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:06,483
your pleading tears would evaporate anyway!

153
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:14,294
Ow!

154
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,558
When I switched my barrier
over, my clothes got kinda singed.

155
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,428
It's true that you can't defend and
attack at the same time with psychic powers.

156
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:24,293
So the solution was to put a barrier around my attacker.

157
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,903
Uh? Well, guess you're not listening.

158
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,858
You're causing a racket, so I'll let you out.

159
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,062
Wow, that's surprising.

160
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:35,259
You can still move around with all those burns?

161
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:39,676
Who knows? Maybe people with pyrokinesis
have a higher tolerance to heat.

162
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:41,734
Either way...

163
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:46,099
Your arrogance and lack of
flexibility led to your downfall.

164
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:49,835
And with that, I'm the winner.

165
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:53,971
Whew! Now I'm sweating.

166
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:55,616
Maybe I was a little scared.

167
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:57,995
I must say. Well done.

168
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:01,052
You're much stronger than I was as a child.

169
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:06,288
However, I possess more strength now
than you will have in your whole lifetime.

170
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:08,208
It's the end of the road. Just give up.

171
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:10,664
Exaggerate much, buddy?

172
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:25,724
Oh, hello. How's it goin' everyone?

173
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:29,283
So, uh... I'm looking for my younger brother.

174
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:31,896
Apparently, he's somewhere inside this building.

175
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:33,523
Yipee!

176
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:36,830
My dolls found one! They found an intruder!

177
00:10:36,855 --> 00:10:40,271
Hey, Tsucchi. Can I do whatever I want with him?

178
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:43,294
Yeah, sure. You caught him, so he's your toy now.

179
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:44,325
Yay!

180
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,546
I'm gonna go have a look!

181
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:50,264
If I don't hurry, my dolls will break
him before I have a chance to play!

182
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,602
Mukai, the puppet master.

183
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:55,176
Quite the ability she's got.

184
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:59,599
She can control all those wooden
dolls remotely and telepathically,

185
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,838
holding an immortal army in her hands.

186
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:05,855
And just look at her, so excited over finding a new toy.

187
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,432
I wouldn't wanna get on her bad side.

188
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:11,475
It's all clear now.

189
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:14,366
Then let's move. We need to find the exit, and quickly.

190
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:15,347
Ah-ha!

191
00:11:15,518 --> 00:11:17,059
Found you, jail-breakers!

192
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:19,130
Ha! That was easy!

193
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:21,492
Sorry, you guys. Guess I picked the wrong route.

194
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:24,042
No, don't worry. You did just fine.

195
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:26,444
We'll force our way through.

196
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,574
Ya think so, brat?!

197
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:31,276
Now! Combination Super Psychokine...

198
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:36,710
Holy crap!

199
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:39,553
It looks like their espers aren't really all that strong.

200
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:42,182
Power-wise, they're all on the same level as Hoshino.

201
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:43,748
What's that mean?

202
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,363
They're better off punching people.

203
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:48,722
Not bad!

204
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:50,949
You're right about them not being strong.

205
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:52,872
They're useless as real soldiers.

206
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:55,869
I don't see a scar like the trainers talked about.

207
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:58,248
He's not a part of the upper echelon.

208
00:11:58,766 --> 00:11:59,475
Who are you?

209
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:01,726
Who, me? Wonder who I could be.

210
00:12:01,842 --> 00:12:03,842
Perfect. We're dealing with a smartass.

211
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:05,824
We're all in a bit of a hurry right now.

212
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:07,901
We can play guessing games some other time.

213
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:12,199
Now, now, no need to be so mean.

214
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,208
I thought we could all be friends here.

215
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,433
This guy seems dangerous.

216
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:17,893
Agreed. We're finished.

217
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:20,961
It's okay. You guys can go on ahead.

218
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:21,881
Kageyama.

219
00:12:22,186 --> 00:12:24,293
I'll take care of this one myself.

220
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:26,574
Hang on! I've got a bad feeling about this!

221
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,777
Just give it up. You can't defeat me.

222
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,543
I don't believe that.

223
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,367
Really? Why?

224
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:34,715
I mean you're not a moron or anything, are you?

225
00:12:34,806 --> 00:12:35,615
Maybe...

226
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,725
Or maybe it's 'cause I know someone stronger than you.

227
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:40,292
Is that so?

228
00:12:40,478 --> 00:12:42,830
He must be one of the other intruders, I take it?

229
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:46,067
Then, I suppose I'll just have to use you as bait

230
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:48,022
and bring him out of the shadows.

231
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:50,533
Tsucchi!

232
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,191
Oh, Mukai.

233
00:12:52,474 --> 00:12:54,058
You're back from playtime already?

234
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,811
You're as ruthless as ever.

235
00:12:58,567 --> 00:12:59,463
Wood scraps?

236
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,035
Hey, Mukai. What happened to your dolls?

237
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:14,250
That boy broke them. He broke all my lovely dolls!

238
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,850
Leave this to me.

239
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:17,859
He's mine now.

240
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:21,088
Hm?

241
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:22,021
Hey, you!

242
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,538
Tell me, are you one of the intruders?

243
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:27,066
He really is just a kid.

244
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,873
How could he possibly...?

245
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:31,536
Are you the violent-type too, old lady?

246
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:36,651
You brat! Who are you calling old, huh?!

247
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:39,726
Tsucchi!

248
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:44,757
You're not going to stop me with telekinesis like that!

249
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,124
Her ability is hardening qigong,

250
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:54,818
which she uses to divert all of her qi into
her fists or knees to make them more powerful.

251
00:13:55,353 --> 00:13:58,808
She's a top-class fighter, even among the Scars.

252
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:03,646
If she manages to lose, you might
actually have to step in, Takeuchi.

253
00:14:03,794 --> 00:14:06,421
And take this intruder seriously.

254
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:16,300
This could get tricky if I give
him enough time to attack again.

255
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,777
These hits aren't having much of an effect.

256
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,949
Is his qi guard really that thick?

257
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:27,866
Without any build up?!

258
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,096
Hey! Your damn phone's ringing!

259
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:47,998
Wait a minute. What the...?

260
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:50,566
You came this far, so why are you crying?

261
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:56,395
Because... I really don't wanna have
to beat up a lady during this rescue.

262
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:57,268
Huh?

263
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:58,837
What did you say?

264
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:03,349
My master always told me guys
who go around beating up women

265
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:05,684
are the biggest losers in the world.

266
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:10,140
You're quite the gentleman, but that's an insult.

267
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:13,923
I'm giving you permission to
fight me fair and square, okay?

268
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,994
Give it everything you've got!

269
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:20,306
Stay away from me!

270
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:23,142
Tch.

271
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:26,638
It sure looks like I drew the short straw in this one.

272
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,415
I've never even heard of this power.

273
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:32,376
This human can make evil spirits his obedient pets.

274
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:34,886
You're good at running away.

275
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,588
But why don't you leave that body behind?

276
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,018
It'd be easier to move as a spirit.

277
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:40,345
Huh?

278
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,822
Are you holding that man hostage?

279
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,274
Forget him. He's not worth it.

280
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,901
Crap!

281
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,425
This body won't hold up much longer.

282
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:58,859
Only third-rate spirits would let
the body they possessed be damaged.

283
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,327
But I have even less of a chance
of beating him in spirit form.

284
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:03,907
In that case...

285
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:07,547
What exactly are you trying to do?

286
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:11,757
I've noticed those things return
to their master after they attack.

287
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,932
Now why would they be trained to do that?

288
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:19,042
Maybe it's 'cause their master
isn't strong enough to protect himself?

289
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:21,169
I see right through you!

290
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,107
He's fast!

291
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,602
Here, Cookie! Here, Gum!

292
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:27,217
Now he can't come any closer.

293
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:28,197
What?!

294
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:34,980
Did he fall?

295
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,490
No, wait! He's not...?!

296
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:41,116
We can fight some other time. See ya, dude!

297
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:43,030
I'm gonna crush you in the next round!

298
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:46,958
Go! After that bastard!

299
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:49,657
Bring him to me! He will be mine!

300
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:54,582
Fooled ya, dumbass!

301
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:57,020
Oh, man, you fell for that?

302
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,880
Crap!

303
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,281
Get back here!

304
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:02,520
Three seconds should be plenty of time.

305
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:04,651
How about a knuckle sandwich?!

306
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:09,229
Not so fast...

307
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:11,477
You're the one who underestimated me.

308
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:14,734
What makes you think I only have two evil spirits?

309
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,431
You mean... all those around his waist are...?

310
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:19,775
Crap! There's nowhere to run!

311
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,934
Looks like Tsuchiya was defeated.

312
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:29,149
Takeuchi, I'm counting on you.

313
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:30,161
Very well.

314
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:33,898
No one in the world is a match
for the power of my super qigong.

315
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:36,779
I'll win, no matter what!

316
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,729
Takeuchi, the super qigong user.

317
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,651
His face changes in battle mode.

318
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,441
Even I can't completely get a read on him.

319
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,845
What do you think?

320
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:50,393
I was thinking you should all run away from here.

321
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:51,556
Why is that?

322
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:54,130
Simple. Because I know Kageyama.

323
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,100
Oh?

324
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:59,081
Not to mention, it's impossible to
take over the world with psychic powers.

325
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:01,937
Use this opportunity to wake up from that dream.

326
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:04,782
You won fighting against Miyagawa.

327
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:09,771
Why are you wasting your time living among
the normals when you're such a powerful esper?

328
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:14,045
We are special beings. And that's a fact.

329
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:15,383
Not a dream.

330
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:19,540
Long as you keep believing that, you
will never be able to take him down.

331
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:26,660
I know you were trying to do something, but I'm sorry.

332
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm kind of in a hurry.

333
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:46,758
N-No way...

334
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,205
Is that Ritsu?

335
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:50,794
What happened?

336
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,227
Oh, he's still breathing. Thank goodness...

337
00:18:56,815 --> 00:18:58,781
But I don't understand.

338
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,085
Why does my little brother have
to be put through all of this?

339
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:05,544
I just... I don't get it.

340
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:08,696
It's unforgivable.

341
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,372
Well? What's the situation here, young one?

342
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:20,349
Hope you haven't already been defeated by others.

343
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:23,116
I haven't even used my powers yet.

344
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,099
Did you do this to him?

345
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:29,324
Not hiding your hostility, eh?

346
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,596
In that case,

347
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:34,364
I'll show you even greater despair, free of charge.

348
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:48,089
No...

349
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:54,076
This... isn't real...

350
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,981
Man, that was a close one.

351
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,131
He managed to amplify the illusion
Muto showed him and reversed it.

352
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:35,036
But was it planned or natural instinct?

353
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,933
Gotta admit, he's pretty interesting.

354
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:41,047
It was totally worth using his
brother as bait to get him down here.

355
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:43,066
Not bad you two.

356
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,962
Out of the 11 Scars, 7 have been
defeated during this intrusion.

357
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:52,146
How should I explain that situation to the boss?

358
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:55,784
What's going on? Kageyama actually lost?

359
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:57,338
It can't be.

360
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:01,007
The guy who carried those two here... did he really...?

361
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:04,729
Hey, what's up? It's okay, don't be scared!

362
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:07,185
There's no way he'd lose to someone like that!

363
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,809
Hi, I'm back! What's up?

364
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,101
Seems you captured the others, too.

365
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:14,797
You look pretty happy.

366
00:21:14,966 --> 00:21:15,768
Yes.

367
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:19,353
One of the intruders is an evil
spirit who has a very strong ego.

368
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:20,833
They got Dimple, too?

369
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:25,060
This poison jar has hundreds
of evil spirits thrown inside it.

370
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:30,337
The one that survives after viciously attacking
and devouring the others becomes the ultimate pet.

371
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,060
What in the hell is this place?

372
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:33,784
No, wait! Stop it!

373
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,384
Let's talk about this! W-Wait! You don't wanna eat me!

374
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:38,232
I have no nutritional value!

375
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:42,011
Help me, please!

376
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,332
I see it! There's the exit!

377
00:23:15,357 --> 00:23:16,658
Now we can call for help!

378
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:19,345
Wait! Stop, it's no use.

379
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:20,945
We've got a problem here.

380
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,152
What's wrong, Hoshino?

381
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:26,293
Damn! There's no way we can get through that!

382
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:28,116
Wait a second, they're...!

383
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:28,823
What the...?

384
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,553
Did someone important show up or something?

385
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,359
That aura...

386
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:38,559
Holy crap! Even I can feel it.

387
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,552
It's an insanely powerful esper!

388
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:43,572
No way, it can't be.

389
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:46,762
There's only one person with those powers.

390
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:49,066
And that would be their leader.

391
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:50,819
Claw's boss!

392
00:23:55,453 --> 00:23:57,774
The boss of Claw finally shows himself.

393
00:23:57,889 --> 00:23:58,854
Yes, it's me.

394
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:01,247
I'm sorry I kept this hidden from you so long, Mob.

395
00:24:01,318 --> 00:24:04,058
No matter what happens from now
on, live your life to the fullest.

396
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,670
Next time on Mob Psycho 100, Episode 11: "Master Leader."

397
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:09,866
The serious option C? An excellent decision.
