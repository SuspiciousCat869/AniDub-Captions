1
00:00:01,373 --> 00:00:04,166
Shigeo Kageyama, also known as Mob,

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:05,866
second year of middle school.

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:12,207
In one's life, the second year of middle
school kicks off a most sensitive time.

4
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,799
It is commonly known as adolescence.

5
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:18,938
Some thrive in athletics.

6
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,213
Some work hard on their studies.

7
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:23,660
Some devote themselves to their hobbies.

8
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:26,036
Some polish their talents.

9
00:00:26,303 --> 00:00:27,456
Some rebel.

10
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:34,036
While some fall for the opposite sex, tasting
bittersweet, and sometimes unrequited, love.

11
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:39,773
All those youthful desires form
the amalgamation that is adolescence.

12
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,921
And, what was Mob doing during this precious time?

13
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:46,515
Working as an assistant for a psychic at 300 yen an hour.

14
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:50,591
The reason for your curse is porn sites!

15
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,144
Wait a second. Porn sites?

16
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:53,869
Yes!

17
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:56,870
The jinx you carry on your shoulders is a terrible one,

18
00:00:56,994 --> 00:01:00,837
commonly referred to as the One-Click Curse!

19
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:39,036
A-A one-click curse contracted from web porn?

20
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:44,522
They use illegal, 18-plus sites to curse your
shoulders while also burdening you with their fees.

21
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,920
Nowadays, even supernatural curses are being digitized.

22
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:48,759
Get real!

23
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:51,380
Who in the hell would believe that giant tub of hogwash?

24
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:55,096
Relax and keep perfectly still.
I'll lift the curse right now.

25
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:56,855
No, there's no need to go...!

26
00:02:58,096 --> 00:02:59,731
Your right shoulder is stiff.

27
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:01,639
The curse really has a hold on you.

28
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:04,787
If you think I'm payin' for this,
you've got another thing coming!

29
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:07,960
What the...?

30
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:10,583
It actually feels pretty good!

31
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:14,429
Sorcery Crush!

32
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:16,046
Finishing blow!

33
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,738
This is one of Reigen's special moves.

34
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:21,642
He relieves the stress from physical fatigue,

35
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:24,486
and gets rid of stiff shoulders and back pain.

36
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:30,342
I believe that I was able to lift the curse.

37
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:31,998
Do your shoulders still feel heavy?

38
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,099
No! I'm sorry that I doubted you.

39
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,822
Everything feels so much better!

40
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:37,645
May I come again for a follow-up?

41
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,258
That'd be no problem!

42
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:40,891
Let's see...

43
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:44,594
The fee for a 40-minute massage is 3,800 yen.

44
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:46,622
Idiot! Don't call it a massage fee!

45
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,273
Call it the "curse-dispelling" fee!

46
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:50,498
Two hundred yen is your change.

47
00:03:50,873 --> 00:03:52,011
Hey, here you go, Mob.

48
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:52,998
Feelin' kinda hungry?

49
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:55,039
Yes. Thanks for the food.

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,391
Master Reigen, you're getting much
better at these massages, lately.

51
00:04:00,477 --> 00:04:01,331
Well, yeah.

52
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:04,973
I've been tryin' different things to
improve, like reading up on some new techniques.

53
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,997
'Course, it's only effective 'cause of my spiritual power.

54
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:11,332
Hot!

55
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:13,039
Such a waste!

56
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,717
Master, I...

57
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,646
I've been thinking about something...

58
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:20,700
Well, this is a rare occasion.

59
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:22,664
You don't start conversations.

60
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,248
Well...

61
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:26,615
I can use a little ESP, and
I'm different from other people,

62
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,812
so I came to discuss that with you

63
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:30,825
and then I ended up becoming your student.

64
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:35,863
At the time, I didn't have anybody else
to talk to, so I was and am grateful...

65
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:39,473
Because you teach me things, and pay me on top of it all.

66
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:42,214
However, I wonder...

67
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:43,756
Is this really okay?

68
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:47,433
That's what's been on my mind.

69
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:50,517
Does he think his pay's too low?

70
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:52,850
Or did he finally figure out that I'm a fraud?

71
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:55,717
What do you mean exactly?

72
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:57,417
How do I put this...

73
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,429
Rather than waste my youth working after school,

74
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:05,110
I have this sneaking suspicion that there are
other things I should be experiencing in my life.

75
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,225
Huh?!

76
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:09,042
Ah, so that's what you're talkin' about!

77
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,817
Puberty! An important phase in one's life.

78
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:14,556
Is there something specific you wanna do right now?

79
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:16,687
Be in a band? Dance?

80
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:18,393
Hitchhike across the country?

81
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,110
No, I don't have anything particular in mind.

82
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:23,203
Okay. Listen, Mob.

83
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:26,673
I understand what you're going through,
but there's no need to rush into things.

84
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:29,794
In my opinion, the Going-Home Club is what's best.

85
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:33,366
You're goofin' off during the period
of your life you can goof off the most,

86
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,321
and that makes you a winner in my book.

87
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,750
So, I say, just keep on bein' a
slacker and make money off me. Ya know?

88
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:43,053
Now, hold on a second, Takenaka!

89
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:46,179
I get treated like a weirdo
just for being in this stupid club!

90
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:47,225
Take it easy!

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,005
I can't do it anymore!

92
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:51,789
This isn't good.

93
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:54,590
A club's supposed have five or more members, right?

94
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,710
So what should we do now, President?

95
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,054
There's only one thing we can do.

96
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:01,397
We've gotta find a new member.

97
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:03,111
And I mean now!

98
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:08,487
Maybe Takenaka changed his mind and came back.

99
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:10,892
That's gotta be it! Takenaka!

100
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:15,700
I just received a submission
of resignation from this club.

101
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:16,664
It's...

102
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,260
The student council!

103
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:20,514
This club... is abolished.

104
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:21,514
Abolished?

105
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:22,903
Wow! Already?!

106
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:26,159
Sadly, I'm going to have to ask you to gather your things.

107
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:30,404
I recently had a brand-new club
request for a room just like this.

108
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:31,056
Hold on!

109
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:33,179
We've only been down to four members for a few minutes!

110
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:35,704
I'm not gonna let you get rid of the Telepathy Club!

111
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,973
The bond we share in this Club's too strong!

112
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,889
The student council's got nothing on us!

113
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:42,900
You think you're all high and mighty
because of how you part your hair?!

114
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:44,094
Shut your mouths.

115
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:46,577
You pissants don't really wanna anger me, do you?

116
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:50,973
If you're that desperate to
keep this joke of a club going...

117
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:54,752
...then bring me a brand new member
by the end of the school day on Friday.

118
00:06:56,026 --> 00:06:58,136
B-By Friday? For real?

119
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:00,660
That only gives us two days.

120
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:01,893
Impossible.

121
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:04,532
Quit your whining!

122
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,081
If we ask everyone we see to join,
we'll be able to snag at least one!

123
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,577
But, that's not gonna happen, now.

124
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,738
The recruiting season ended a long time ago.

125
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:13,871
No! I'm gonna let this go!

126
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:18,625
We haven't overcome obstacle after obstacle to
be shot down in such a ridiculous way, have we?!

127
00:07:19,222 --> 00:07:20,516
Uh, president?

128
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,744
We haven't done a single thing.

129
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,712
I didn't even know this school had a Telepathy Club.

130
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:33,307
It's creepy, so forget it.

131
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:34,580
Nah, I've got a job, guys.

132
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:36,887
What's the big deal? If it's abolished, it's abolished.

133
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:39,332
You should be studying. Entrance exams are this year.

134
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:41,310
Well, are any guys in your club hot?

135
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:44,362
I wanna leave time for dating.

136
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:47,033
I'd be worried about the stares,
and it seems too dangerous.

137
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:48,503
It's creepy, so forget it.

138
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:50,210
Sorry. It's creepy, so forget it.

139
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:51,755
It's creepy, so forget it.

140
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,264
Creepy.

141
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:54,723
Nope.

142
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:55,299
Forget it.

143
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:55,914
Uh, no.

144
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:57,366
Sounds lame. No.

145
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:04,679
Guess it really is impossible to
find new members this time of year.

146
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,469
Not to mention we keep getting called "creepy."

147
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,594
Now even I wanna quit.

148
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,539
The president's lost it!

149
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:17,303
You need to calm down, okay?!

150
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:20,574
The Going-Home Club...

151
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:22,795
President!

152
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:23,875
I found him!

153
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:27,192
He's not in any clubs or committees, and
he doesn't have any friends or girlfriends.

154
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:30,664
Salt's go-homer and all-round bum,
Shigeo Kageyama of Year 2, Class 1.

155
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:32,712
Well, I'd say he's basically right.

156
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:34,385
Well done, Inukawa!

157
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,943
Please allow me introduce you to the other members:

158
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:38,883
Kijibayashi, and Saruta.

159
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:39,868
Nice to meet you.

160
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:40,708
How's it goin'?

161
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,904
And I'm the president of this group,

162
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,890
Tome Kurata, Year 3, Class 5.

163
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,865
You can call me All-The-Way Tome.

164
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,963
She's pulling out all the stops!

165
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,857
Tome, huh? Hey, what a coincidence!

166
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,223
That's my grandmother's name.

167
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:58,875
Uh... See? The fates have brought us together!

168
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,056
There you have it!

169
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:01,964
Please join the Telepathy Club!

170
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:02,905
I can't today.

171
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,390
What?!

172
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,517
Wait just a second, Mob! Are you
serious? You actually have plans?

173
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:11,139
Mm-hm. I have to head out to my
after-school exorcism job right now.

174
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:13,587
Exorcism? What is that supposed to mean?

175
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:14,789
Ah! President!

176
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:16,050
I just remembered something!

177
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:18,290
This guy was sort of famous back in grade school!

178
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,549
He could bend spoons and make erasers move.

179
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:22,056
You know, like telekinesis!

180
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:24,322
In other words, he's an esper!

181
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:27,419
Stop being such a weirdo and just join our club.

182
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:29,987
I mean, the exorcism can wait a little while, right?

183
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:35,747
Mob. Hey, so how's it goin' with you?

184
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:37,039
Uh, Master...

185
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,223
I'm being recruited into a club.

186
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:40,828
Is it okay if I'm a little late?

187
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:42,828
Just join and leave, what's the big deal.

188
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:47,848
No, I have to wait until the student council
meeting is over, then go submit my club admission form.

189
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:48,522
Wait.

190
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,525
So if I told you to come to work immediately,

191
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,955
you'd end up not joining?

192
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:53,223
Uh, yeah, but...

193
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,527
Shouldn't I try and keep the
promise I made to the others first?

194
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:58,447
Then, it's not like you actually want to join?

195
00:09:58,539 --> 00:09:59,847
Not really, no.

196
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,641
'Kay, hurry on over.

197
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:04,441
Time for you to show 'em how things
are done in the Going-Home Club.

198
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:07,677
He says he needs me right away, so I'll be going now.

199
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:09,224
P-Put me on for a sec!

200
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:12,841
Look, I really need Kageyama to
join today no matter what, understand?!

201
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:16,011
A girl, huh? She must be trying to use Mob.

202
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,107
He's not really the type to play any kind of sports stuff.

203
00:10:19,147 --> 00:10:20,781
Probably isn't a good idea to force him.

204
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,527
We're not some stupid sports club!

205
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,208
We're the Telepathy Club!

206
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:25,466
Huh? You're kidding me.

207
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:28,335
It's a club where we train to feel telepathic powers.

208
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,181
Uh, that sounds shady as hell.

209
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,357
"Telepathic," huh?

210
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:32,534
Don't play dumb with me!

211
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,382
You know exactly what I'm talking about!

212
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:38,226
I've heard from a reliable source
that Kageyama has telekinesis and ESP!

213
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:41,639
I bet you're just using him to solve cases
and get more customers 'cause you can't do it

214
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:43,380
on your own 'cause you're a big phony!

215
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:44,984
Shut your mouth, amateur!

216
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,330
Don't you dare waste my student's precious time

217
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:48,889
with your middle-school nonsense!

218
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:49,517
What?!

219
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:52,958
Are you saying that you don't
care if they shut down our club?

220
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,742
We'll get kicked out of the room and have nowhere to go!

221
00:10:56,954 --> 00:11:01,331
Master, the club president is crying,
so I think I should join after all.

222
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:03,737
Don't be fooled! They're crocodile tears!

223
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:04,477
Huh?

224
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,212
Bonds, memories, and friendship...

225
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:11,152
It's not like any of those things will
disappear just because a club is abolished.

226
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:12,578
They're using you!

227
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:16,073
Trust me, they just don't wanna
lose their room, their budget,

228
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,074
and their pointless after-school time,
judging from what their club sounds like to me.

229
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:21,574
See through it, Mob!

230
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:23,804
If that shady club goes down,

231
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,479
it's because it was damn well meant to go down.

232
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:29,121
If you understand, hurry up and come to work!

233
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,540
I get it. See you soon.

234
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,806
So, it looks like I gotta go.

235
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:36,014
Sorry about that. I'll catch you guys later.

236
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:37,540
Uh... Wait a sec!

237
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,395
Please, just hear me out, okay?!

238
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:43,521
Now listen, the president seriously
believes in telepathy and all that stuff,

239
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:46,829
but honestly, the rest of us here
just wanna lie around and goof off.

240
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:48,826
Right now, we're in middle school.

241
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:52,143
This is the only time we're gonna be
able to do nothing and get away with it!

242
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:56,965
Play cards with us in this lazy little
paradise we've created! What do ya say?

243
00:11:57,623 --> 00:12:00,458
You're not gonna find a more carefree club than this.

244
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:03,941
We have until tomorrow to set
things straight, so think it over?

245
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:07,413
You're our last hope, Kageyama!

246
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:08,639
Save us!

247
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,826
Mm...

248
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:12,514
So I assume you turned them down, didn't ya?

249
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,409
Nuh-uh. I figured I'd take a night to think about it.

250
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,043
You shouldn't drag these things out, Mob.

251
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:21,458
You need to turn down things you don't wanna do.

252
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:24,360
Right now, the thing I least wanna do...

253
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,839
..is to be dressed up like this.

254
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:28,799
Oh, there it is.

255
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:30,657
Saint Highso Girls' Academy.

256
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:32,797
It's a private all-girls high school.

257
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:35,965
And, the clients have asked us
both to meet up with them on the roof.

258
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:36,718
Right.

259
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:39,195
Stop! What in the world do you think you're doing?

260
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,968
Excuse me?

261
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,030
You heard what I said! Don't play dumb!

262
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:44,098
Oh, I'm just a student here on my way to class.

263
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:45,739
Reporting from the front gate.

264
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,257
Suspicious individual here! Requesting backup!

265
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,255
That's kinda mean, isn't it?

266
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,958
Can it, you perverted weirdo!

267
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:53,573
I knew this wouldn't work.

268
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,897
But I'm glad they saw through our disguises.

269
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,816
I didn't wanna sneak into the school dressed like this.

270
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:01,014
That was a close one, huh?

271
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,377
Now hurry along and stay away from that freak.

272
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:04,123
Huh?

273
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:07,647
Don't you worry. We'll deal with this phony.

274
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,667
Uh...

275
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:12,379
Huh?

276
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:24,571
What am I doing?

277
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:27,512
Won't I get in a lot of trouble if I'm busted?

278
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:32,611
He said we were supposed to meet
our clients on the roof, but...

279
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:39,737
Um, hello?

280
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,065
I've come from the consultation office.

281
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,956
So, are you three the clients, or uh...?

282
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:45,992
Huh? Who in the hell are you?

283
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:48,389
You don't look familiar. Transfer student, right?

284
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:48,887
Huh?

285
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,190
Consultation office?

286
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:53,124
You're here to see if you can "get
through" to us thugs, is that it?

287
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:54,224
So annoying!

288
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:58,360
Do you really think we're just gonna sit
here and let some twerp like you lecture us?!

289
00:13:58,414 --> 00:13:59,460
No, I'm just...

290
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:02,081
Why don't you mind your own damn business, do-gooder?!

291
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:04,649
If you don't, we're gonna make you regret it!

292
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:06,649
Sorry about that. My bad.

293
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:09,484
Ugh. Talk about a downer. Let's get outta here.

294
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:10,370
Hmph!

295
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:15,797
Hello?

296
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,393
First thing you do is get picked on by thugs.

297
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:19,118
Way to go.

298
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,386
We're the clients you're here to meet with.

299
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:24,919
Isn't that Reigen guy coming?

300
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:27,318
He got caught up at the front gate.

301
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,866
Also, you both came dressed as girls?

302
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:30,525
Really?

303
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:33,472
He couldn't get permission to
come in, so we didn't have a choice.

304
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:34,539
I see.

305
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,653
We're sorry to make you go through all that.

306
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:40,720
The school just refuses to take us
seriously about any of this supernatural stuff.

307
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:42,212
So that's why we called you.

308
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:44,411
What exactly was it that you told them?

309
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:47,524
Students' belongings are mysteriously vanishing,

310
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:49,513
and we've been hearing weird noises.

311
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:51,425
Like, a poltergeist or something.

312
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,680
We heard things have been spotted
floating through the air, too.

313
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:55,440
Yeah.

314
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,638
Apparently a bra started
floating around in the locker room.

315
00:14:58,765 --> 00:14:59,785
A bra?

316
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:02,405
We're sure it's not just kids playing pranks.

317
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,052
It's definitely supernatural.

318
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:05,753
So we went online, looked around,

319
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:09,726
then called the cheapest exorcist in
the area and somehow ended up with you.

320
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:11,491
Looks like you get what you pay for.

321
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:11,850
Huh?

322
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:16,557
Can't believe a guy was trembling so much
just from dealing with some high school girls.

323
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,887
You must be quite the reliable gentleman.

324
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:20,156
Oh... Thank you.

325
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:21,098
That was sarcasm, duh!

326
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:22,723
She wasn't complimenting you!

327
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:25,181
Are you sure we can trust him with this?

328
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,705
I have my doubts. You seem pretty unreliable.

329
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,223
What's up?

330
00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:31,139
Something wrong?

331
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:33,035
I-It's okay...

332
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:35,765
I just have to perform an exorcism.

333
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:40,584
Now, let us know if you feel anything spiritual.

334
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:42,375
Right.

335
00:15:44,831 --> 00:15:46,673
Well? Do you sense anything?

336
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:48,307
Maybe a little.

337
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:50,619
Is he being serious right now?

338
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:53,842
There. It's nearby.

339
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,510
Are you for real?

340
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:57,535
Someone help!

341
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:00,312
What's going on?

342
00:16:01,273 --> 00:16:02,873
Something was here...

343
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,130
Something was just looking in from the top of the door...

344
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,778
The windows are locked tight.

345
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:12,012
And we would've seen if somebody
tried to leave through the exit.

346
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:14,138
I'm going to follow the spirit.

347
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,723
Whatcha got? Anything so far?

348
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,814
So, we can trust you, right?

349
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:23,620
Right.

350
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,399
You still can't find it?

351
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:29,413
The spirit is angry.

352
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:30,278
Huh?

353
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,056
And, if we keep pursuing it, it might try something.

354
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:35,996
Wh-What are we gonna do?

355
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,486
The basketball team is practicing inside.

356
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:40,293
Let's end this.

357
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:45,072
I've trapped the spirit.

358
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:56,506
Found you.

359
00:16:59,078 --> 00:16:59,569
Huh?

360
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,873
It's huge!

361
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,917
What is that?! A ghost?!

362
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:10,316
Now you've done it, you psychic brat.

363
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,837
How dare you trap me in my own haunting grounds!

364
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,963
Are you going to try to ruin my paradise?

365
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:20,401
If so, then this is what you'll get!

366
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:34,730
Crap! I underestimated his psychic abilities!

367
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,642
If I don't take a hostage, he'll erase me!

368
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:42,245
You! You smell nice.

369
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:44,880
I choose you!

370
00:17:45,054 --> 00:17:46,427
Now, get back!

371
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,645
Huh?

372
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:10,262
It's all over now.

373
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:16,189
Listen to them cheer. Good for you, dude.

374
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:17,134
Thanks a lot.

375
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:18,902
You were pretty reliable after all.

376
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:20,950
Damn it...

377
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:23,336
How?

378
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:26,557
How was I defeated by a loser like you?

379
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:29,450
And I thought I'd finally found happiness.

380
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:32,718
Honestly, you seem to be similar to me.

381
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:34,131
Similar?

382
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:37,443
The way you get nervous around girls.

383
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,336
You're playing the loser role in
youth just as I did, aren't you?

384
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:43,455
I...

385
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:47,112
I finally started to have fun after I died.

386
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:48,978
I was content.

387
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:52,507
But I guess that's all over now. Isn't it...

388
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,625
So...

389
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,851
Are you living every day to the fullest?

390
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:12,236
What's wrong?

391
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:14,598
You seem kinda out of it. Somethin' bothering you?

392
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:16,566
Huh? No, I'm all right.

393
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:17,337
Thanks, though.

394
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,352
Sure. Okay then.

395
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,223
Ah! Mob! You actually showed up!

396
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,994
We believed in you, Kageyama! We knew you'd be back!

397
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:32,069
Now, hurry up and sign this club admission form.

398
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:33,748
Huh?

399
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:35,248
You're already here?

400
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:38,653
That was much faster than I expected, Vice President!

401
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:42,271
Well, I had to make a little
extra time to show this room...

402
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:43,391
...to them.

403
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:48,056
This will become the club room of
the newly formed Body Improvement Club.

404
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:50,432
And they'd like to get set up as soon as possible.

405
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:52,573
What? Now, just hold on a minute!

406
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,639
The Telepathy Club won't be taken away!

407
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:57,608
Kageyama was about to sign all
the paperwork needed to join!

408
00:19:57,674 --> 00:19:58,401
Seriously?

409
00:19:58,941 --> 00:20:00,408
Are you out of your mind?

410
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:01,428
Uh...

411
00:20:01,854 --> 00:20:03,413
Tell me, what grade are you in?

412
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:04,490
I'm a second year.

413
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:06,598
Have any experience in other organizations?

414
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:07,623
No, I don't.

415
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:10,216
Do you have a close friend or
love interest in the Telepathy Club?

416
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,473
I have an acquaintance.

417
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:12,397
Cram school?

418
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,496
I don't attend.

419
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,271
Do you study?

420
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,348
Not particularly.

421
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:16,196
Any hobbies?

422
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,150
I, uh...

423
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,493
Don't you have anything at all you want to do?

424
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,453
Huh?

425
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:24,834
If you let these students goad you into
joining while having no interest at all,

426
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,071
what exactly will you gain from it?

427
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:28,079
Well, uh...

428
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,871
All I wanna do is live every day to the fullest.

429
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,944
Will wasting time after school
with soda, snacks, and video games

430
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:36,123
help you "live every day to the fullest"?

431
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:39,423
If you want to join this club
of your own free will, go ahead.

432
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:42,311
However, you should carefully think this through.

433
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:45,203
What is it you really want to do with your life?

434
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:47,283
What I wanna do...

435
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:50,166
Do I have anything I wanna do?

436
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,561
Does everyone else have something?

437
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:56,424
Something enjoyable? Something I'm envious of?

438
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:57,948
What are they enjoying?

439
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,769
Clubs, hobbies, studying?

440
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:04,939
Now that I think about it,
hanging out with girls might be fun.

441
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:08,065
I did have a dream!

442
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,178
I wanted to confess my feelings to my first love,

443
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,110
Tsubomi, and hold hands as we walked home.

444
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:18,153
Take a look, Tsubomi!

445
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,848
When you make frogs float, they start swimming.

446
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,423
Oh, wow! That's so cute.

447
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,713
I can make the bar all squishy, too.

448
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:27,926
You're amazing, Mob!

449
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:30,048
Look!

450
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:32,668
I'm only showing you these things, Tsubomi!

451
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:35,621
I'm getting bored.

452
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:39,556
The red team can move!

453
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,526
You're fast, Akira!

454
00:21:45,662 --> 00:21:46,518
That's it...

455
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:49,506
If I can change anything by joining a club...

456
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:53,713
...then I'm gonna join!

457
00:21:54,953 --> 00:21:58,415
Thank you for having me, Body Improvement Club!

458
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:00,836
Wait, what'd you say?

459
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:03,122
Huh?

460
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:05,717
Welcome aboard! Good to have ya!

461
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:06,717
Thank you!

462
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:45,748
Unable to locate the whereabouts of
the suspicious individual who infiltrated

463
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:48,014
an all-girls' school by crossdressing,

464
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:50,693
the whole area is on high alert...

465
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:53,705
Hot!

466
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:57,411
Mob joins the Body Improvement Club.

467
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,181
On his way home, in an attempt to be popular,

468
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:01,914
he goes to the main temple of
an obviously shady-looking cult.

469
00:24:01,988 --> 00:24:03,164
Are you sure about this, Mob?

470
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:06,095
Next time, on Mob Psycho 100,
Episode 3: "An Invite to a Meeting

471
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,661
Simply Put, I Just Want to be Popular."

472
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:09,760
Recording it? That's also a wise decision.
