1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,280
Wow!

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,866
Feels neat!

3
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:08,503
Hey, do you think I'll be able to do this, too?

4
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:09,276
Mh-mm!

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,085
Of course. After all, you're my little brother!

6
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:29,506
He! Hoo! Ha!

7
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:10,509
Everything's ready.

8
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:13,805
We will now begin the séance.

9
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:23,254
Hey, tell me, is that you, Dad?

10
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:25,078
Do you know who I am?

11
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:29,886
Oh... Oh! Hitoshi!

12
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:32,014
I never thought the day would come

13
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:35,555
when I would have the chance
to see your face again, my son.

14
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:36,955
Oh, Dad.

15
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:38,522
One thing...

16
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:40,612
When did you learn to speak English so well?

17
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:42,723
Click! Loggin' out for a sec.

18
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:43,816
Huh?

19
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:46,526
Sorry, It doesn't seem like
I'm getting a very good signal.

20
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:47,961
Were you satisfied, though?

21
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:49,181
Of course not!

22
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:51,012
Please, call him back this instant!

23
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,870
Whoa! Calm down, buddy!

24
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:55,663
It takes a lot of concentration to head up a séance.

25
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:57,958
By the way, where is your father from?

26
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,238
He wasn't local?

27
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,107
No, he was from New Jersey in America.

28
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:04,309
Foreign languages are automatically translated.

29
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,257
Oh!

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,290
It's an advanced technique that does
something-or-other to the wavelength

31
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:10,065
of the spirit's languages and is hard to master.

32
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,992
But, don't worry, there will not be an additional fee.

33
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:14,179
Amazing! But my English isn't bad.

34
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:15,164
I'm pretty fluent.

35
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:16,357
Now, then...

36
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:19,243
Oh! Hey, Hitoshi!

37
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,822
How have things been goin'?

38
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:22,487
Kinda weird, but...

39
00:03:22,674 --> 00:03:23,454
Whatever.

40
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,028
Hey, Dad. Ya know when I was young?

41
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:28,490
You and I used to play ball together.

42
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:31,891
And we did that one thing that
was popular on TV back then!

43
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:34,959
Would you do it for me one last time?

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,124
Dad?

45
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,342
Uh... What the heck was that?

46
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:48,752
That was the "Cheeseburger Tornado,"

47
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:51,673
the main character's special
move in "Junk Food Fighter Michael,"

48
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,440
the super popular show at the time.

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,812
Wait... Dad, what are you talk...?

50
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:56,487
Get to the point, Hitoshi.

51
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:58,388
I've come all the way from the other side.

52
00:03:58,413 --> 00:03:59,339
What do you want?

53
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:00,863
Well, I...

54
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:05,024
Aw, screw it! You were never nice to me, anyway, Dad!

55
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:06,590
Cough up the password to the hidden safe,

56
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:07,636
you stupid old man!

57
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,520
I know there's a fortune in there!
You're dead so you don't need it!

58
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,475
Uh, let me see...

59
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,458
I believe the password was my birthday.

60
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:15,956
Don't give me that "birthday" crap!

61
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,715
It's thirteen letters of the alphabet!

62
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,605
With that kind of money, I'll have
enough cash for the rest of my life!

63
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,927
Oh! Wait a second, now I remember!

64
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,350
The password is...

65
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,319
"GETAJOBYOUGOODFORNOTHINGBUM"!

66
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:30,615
Like the Junk Food Fighter,

67
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,791
this is one of Reigen's special moves:

68
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:37,359
using his body like a spring, he smashes his
fist into his opponent's face with a powerful spin.

69
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:40,854
Crap! I went too far!

70
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,782
The client's consciousness logged out!

71
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:45,246
What happened? Did you just take him down?

72
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:48,516
Yeah... But, it was all in self defense.

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,834
Self defense, huh?

74
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:53,572
Yep. Hey, you look kinda pale.

75
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:57,557
If it's in self defense, is it
okay to shave off someone's hair,

76
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,089
rip off their clothes, destroy their pride,

77
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:04,238
make them lose their friends, and
completely demolish the school they go to?

78
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:09,032
I think that's going a bit beyond "self defense."

79
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,525
There are some times when my
psychic powers go outta control.

80
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:16,228
And it always seems to happen when I'm unconscious.

81
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,455
I don't want these powers anymore.

82
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:19,434
It's too much.

83
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,337
If nothing else, I think they're quite useful.

84
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:25,332
The way you use them when you work as my apprentice?

85
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:28,276
So many clients have been helped with those powers.

86
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:31,117
So don't just focus on the negatives.

87
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:33,601
It's all about how you use those knives, right?

88
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:35,621
Don't suppress yourself.

89
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,542
You hold the keys, here. Maximize your potential.

90
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:39,442
You do that,

91
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:41,532
and you're gonna be just fine, Mob.

92
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,148
Huh?

93
00:05:45,535 --> 00:05:47,865
The shadow leader system? Seriously?

94
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,521
Yeah.

95
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:53,920
I completely lost to that shadow leader
named Hanazawa, but the guy who bested him

96
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:55,485
is from Salt Middle School.

97
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,158
No way! Someone that strong?

98
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,212
Yeah.

99
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,181
I'm gonna find him and make him our shadow leader.

100
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:02,861
It was you, wasn't it?

101
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:05,422
You caused the supernatural stuff at Black Vinegar.

102
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:06,649
Uh, well, I...

103
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:10,081
You're basically the only person
who could do something like that.

104
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,189
But according to the rumors,

105
00:06:12,276 --> 00:06:15,762
a kid who goes there can throw
people around just as easily as you do.

106
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:16,917
Who knows?

107
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:19,154
Maybe that means he's an esper, too.

108
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:23,156
You guys met up at Black Vinegar and fought, didn't you?

109
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,028
That's it, right?

110
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:26,612
You two had a psychic-telekinetic battle!

111
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,638
Twitch, twitch.

112
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:29,790
You don't wanna talk about it?

113
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:32,969
That's enough for today, then.

114
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:37,728
But someday soon, you're definitely
gonna tell me all I wanna know.

115
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,845
No way!

116
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,720
That wasn't the work of aliens?

117
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:44,780
And, that aside...

118
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:47,747
...are there really espers
around here other than yourself?

119
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:49,943
Yes, there are.

120
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:54,448
And you can find them.

121
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:57,234
But... He's the only other one I've ever met.

122
00:06:57,336 --> 00:07:00,109
That's strange. What about your master?

123
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:00,862
Ah...

124
00:07:01,573 --> 00:07:04,451
Well, actually, I don't sense anything from my master.

125
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:06,522
But that's 'cause his powers aren't psychic,

126
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:07,882
they're spiritual.

127
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:09,944
What kind of rule is that?

128
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:13,040
Well, whatever. Let's go on a date after this.

129
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:13,547
Huh?

130
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:16,106
We'll find other telepathic people!

131
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,810
Then take our first step toward
connecting with life forms in outer space!

132
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:20,770
Think about it!

133
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:24,135
But, remember? I'm not in the Telepathy Club.

134
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,482
Black Vinegar Middle School's shadow leader?

135
00:07:27,557 --> 00:07:28,822
Yeah, I lost to him.

136
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,555
That guy had some seriously nice muscles.

137
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:35,756
Then who was it that beat him? It was
someone from the Body Improvement Club, right?

138
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,315
He's a gentleman who usually
has quite a distaste for violence.

139
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:42,671
Do not involve him in this. Be gone.

140
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:45,260
Damn that Musashi.

141
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:45,973
Huh?

142
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:47,461
Hey...

143
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:49,001
Um, yes?

144
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:52,824
You were picked on by the guys from
Black Vinegar Middle School last week, right?

145
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,593
Well, that was all my fault.

146
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:56,032
Sorry, okay?

147
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:59,045
Huh? What do you... I apologized! Just leave it at that!

148
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,611
I'm sorry, Kageyama.

149
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:03,072
Tenga's kind of a dummy. He can't explain things...

150
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,432
Shut up!

151
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,167
Stupid idiot!

152
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:09,211
I'm the one talking to him, so just stay out of it!

153
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:11,341
Well, then...

154
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:15,426
It appears that will be all the student
council's activities for this month.

155
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:18,507
Is that all right, President Kamuro?

156
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:20,281
I'm glad you asked.

157
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,783
It's not bad for a start, but I think
we need something with a bit more impact.

158
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,752
Right, first year Kageyama?

159
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:32,828
You rank as one of the smartest in the
nation, so I want to hear your opinion.

160
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:34,568
Well...

161
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:38,859
In our school, there are a few students
who would be classified as delinquents.

162
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:44,031
If the student council could find a way to
reprimand them, I think we'd be able to create

163
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,724
a more peaceful school environment.

164
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:47,006
That sounds nice.

165
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:48,413
"A more peaceful school."

166
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:50,932
Yes. Let's do that.

167
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:55,821
I have to make it a more comfortable place for my brother.

168
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,428
Kageyama, I presume?

169
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:01,595
Thank goodness.

170
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,915
Guess there was a point in waiting around after all.

171
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:06,370
Let me present my credentials.

172
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,801
Awakening Lab?

173
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:10,202
So, what do you think?

174
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:12,217
Why not give it a try?

175
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:16,453
This is an opportunity to amplify your
psychic powers at my research facility!

176
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:20,028
Sounds like he's got me confused with my brother.

177
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:22,411
Ah! Tome, take a look...

178
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,164
What is it? Another esper?!

179
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,390
No, I just thought this guy had a really unique hairstyle.

180
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:29,243
Oh, wow! You're so right.

181
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,811
Stop fooling around already.

182
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:34,848
But... I was being serious.

183
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:40,047
Oh, it's you, Kageyama.

184
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:42,408
Ah, Vice President Tokugawa.

185
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:44,082
Loitering, huh?

186
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,308
I guess even people like you

187
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,309
feel like doing that from time to time.

188
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:49,136
Like me?

189
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,503
I'm just an average middle school student

190
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:52,577
you can find anywhere.

191
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:54,454
A totally simple and normal guy.

192
00:09:54,877 --> 00:10:00,039
If you ask me, you won't find a "totally simple"
and "normal" middle schooler anywhere on this planet.

193
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:01,920
But, for whatever reason,

194
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:05,028
you want to be one and are
still trying to act out the part.

195
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:07,836
I'm not really sure I understand what you're saying.

196
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,998
Despite having abilities that would
always make you the center of attention,

197
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:15,944
you consistently seem to play the minor
role and let others take the spotlight.

198
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:20,144
Stop acting like your brother.

199
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:33,744
Hey, Captain! Kageyama's down!

200
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:35,888
No, I'm fine.

201
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:36,951
Nice drive!

202
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:39,218
I think you're starting to build up some stamina!

203
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:50,196
Awakening Lab...

204
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:51,726
This place?

205
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:53,875
It's just an apartment complex...

206
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,054
Kageyama, you're here! I'm so glad you showed up!

207
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,488
There's no research facility here.

208
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:00,541
You lied to me!

209
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,388
Now, now, just come in.

210
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:05,791
Welcome!

211
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:10,181
I call it the Awakening Lab!

212
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,881
What is this place?

213
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:15,484
I bought an apartment complex and remodeled it.

214
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:20,714
I've hired the front runners in the fields of
neuroscience and engineering, and we do research here.

215
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,698
On the floor above us, all of
the other esper kids are gathered.

216
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:25,801
Did you say others?

217
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,983
Yeah, other people, just like you.

218
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,415
Look there.

219
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:35,063
Is it another weird haircut?

220
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:37,400
That's an adult esper.

221
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:42,341
What is this feeling coming over me?

222
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,220
It's kind of sickening.

223
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,528
Sorry, Tome. I was wrong again.

224
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:50,031
Hey, Mob. Take a look!

225
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:52,036
Isn't that hairstyle super weird?

226
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,741
Allow me to introduce them!

227
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:59,427
Standing before you is a group of
real espers that the Mitsuura Group

228
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,054
worked hard to bring together!

229
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,319
First is Takeshi Hoshino.

230
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:12,037
Step back, I'm going all out!

231
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,022
He's psychokinetic!

232
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:16,276
That's "amazing"?

233
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:18,744
Next, we have Rei Kurosaki.

234
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:24,177
Her powers of clairvoyance allow her
to pick the one correct card out of ten!

235
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:27,904
Her efficiency rate is a staggering 62 percent!

236
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:31,748
Yay! I was right again!

237
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:33,138
Wait, that's it?

238
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:35,283
Next, we have Go Asahi.

239
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:39,218
Behold, my flames of fury! Ignite!

240
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:40,757
Huh?

241
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,214
Ignite! Ignite!

242
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:45,041
Ig... There we go!

243
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:45,941
Oh, it went out.

244
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:47,694
He uses pyrokinesis.

245
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,231
Less useful than a cheap lighter.

246
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:51,338
And here are the Shiratori brothers:

247
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:52,625
Daichi and Kaito.

248
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:56,448
They're telepaths who can use their
power to communicate with each other,

249
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:57,708
even when they're apart.

250
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,337
And less useful than email.

251
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:01,687
This is Shigeo Kageyama.

252
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:03,422
Now be nice to him, everyone.

253
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:04,735
It's a pleasure.

254
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,892
Nice to meet you.

255
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:06,832
Tell me...

256
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:08,418
Has Mitsuura helped you at all?

257
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:10,698
Well, yeah, what kind of question is that?

258
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:12,655
Absolutely. He's been good to us.

259
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,010
And he's really fascinated with psychic powers.

260
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:15,845
Huh?

261
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:21,488
Though I'm wealthy, it's just family money,
I did nothing to earn it. I'm nothing special.

262
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:25,737
I don't believe in doing anything to
make big advancements in society or science.

263
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:29,983
I just want to become an esper myself,
so I funded this research facility to see

264
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,109
if I could make it happen. That's the reason!

265
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:36,786
It's a childish pipe dream, but if he's
able to achieve that goal, I'd be interested.

266
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:39,931
I've always wanted to know if there's power within me.

267
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:44,692
Well, you're finally home, Shinji.

268
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:47,065
Student council again, huh?

269
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:49,488
Make sure you don't fool around too much.

270
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:53,694
My brother was the student
council president, too, remember?

271
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:57,155
But, unlike you, Takuya was also good in his studies.

272
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,236
Exactly, Mom. I'm embarrassed, Shinji.

273
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:02,984
You haven't even hit a test score of 70 yet!

274
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,542
Are you really my younger brother?

275
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,150
You have no talent at all.

276
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,389
So you became the student council president, right?

277
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:10,284
You should have plenty of time to study.

278
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,628
How much are you going to disappoint Mom and Dad, anyway?

279
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:13,508
Elites like...

280
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:28,299
Ugh, you really need to fix that annoying habit of yours.

281
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,634
But it just bends on its own.

282
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:33,199
Ha, ha! My farts bend things, too!

283
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:33,938
Oh, come on!

284
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:35,781
Stop that! We're eating dinner!

285
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:38,849
Shige, you should really try to be more like Ritsu.

286
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:39,856
Yeah, I know.

287
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:42,344
Ritsu doesn't do any weird stuff like me.

288
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:43,737
And he's super talented.

289
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:55,263
Kageyama. Good morning.

290
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:57,722
President, what's going on, exactly?

291
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:00,003
And, why did you wanna meet me here so early?

292
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:03,102
See this? It's a girl's recorder bag.

293
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:06,070
And what would you presume is inside of it?

294
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:07,878
A girl's recorder, I guess?

295
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,105
That's correct.

296
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,220
Okay...?

297
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,113
She won't be needing this...

298
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,634
President...

299
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:17,200
What do you think you're doing?

300
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:18,435
The answer's simple.

301
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,439
Why, a little spring cleaning, of course.

302
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:21,916
Spring cleaning?

303
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:23,650
You said it yourself, didn't you?

304
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:26,944
There are trashy students here
who're classified as delinquents.

305
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,614
The student council needs to get rid of them.

306
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,754
Hey, hold on!

307
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,673
I never said anything that extreme.

308
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,919
Don't twist my words around...

309
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:35,666
What do we have here, Kageyama?

310
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:38,833
I believe it's the desk of our
school's biggest piece of trash...

311
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:41,204
Onigawara, the thug delinquent.

312
00:15:42,617 --> 00:15:44,271
Are you serious, President?

313
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:46,845
Why would an elite like you ever stoop to that?

314
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:48,278
"An elite", you say...

315
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:53,001
That's just an imaginary persona I
was labeled with somewhere along the way.

316
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:55,556
You've realized it, too, haven't you?

317
00:15:55,634 --> 00:16:00,012
That the praise others lavish upon you
doesn't actually fit who you really are.

318
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:04,389
Come on. Help me, Kageyama.

319
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,097
You got another perfect score on your test?

320
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:09,915
Good job!

321
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,316
I-I'm...

322
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:14,073
Ritsu doesn't do any weird stuff like me.

323
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:15,479
And he's super talented.

324
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:17,683
Stop acting like your brother.

325
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:18,915
Even I...

326
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,450
Hey... do you think I'll be able to do this, too?

327
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:22,256
Mm-hm.

328
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:23,771
Of course!

329
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,556
After all, you're my little brother!

330
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:26,556
Really?

331
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,292
Yay! I can't wait!

332
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:40,768
Huh?

333
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,343
All right, we made it to our goal.

334
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:48,548
You got some good muscles on you, Onigawara.

335
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,360
Damn it.

336
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,463
You called me out here super early,

337
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,797
so I thought you were finally gonna
tell me who the shadow leader is!

338
00:16:58,197 --> 00:16:59,656
Remember this pain.

339
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:02,658
You may feel wrecked now, but you'll feel amazing later.

340
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:05,270
The one you're looking for is in the same state as you.

341
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:06,628
He's fighting with himself.

342
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:09,140
So you should change in the same way he's hoping to.

343
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:12,333
All right, fine!

344
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:14,656
Bring it on, dude!

345
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,775
Something weird happened!

346
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,221
Whoa, that's creepy!

347
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:24,438
We're so grossed out, how are we
supposed to stay in class with that?!

348
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:26,185
Now, now, please calm down.

349
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,389
I promise, the student council will find
the culprit and put a stop to all of this.

350
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:34,657
Now's the time to open up Onigawara's desk.

351
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:37,777
We'll have to inspect everyone's belongings.

352
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:40,767
If they get caught like this, they must be pretty stupid.

353
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,118
Oh, the teacher's not here yet?

354
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,927
I was about to ruin my record
of never being late or absent.

355
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:53,943
What's the matter, Onigawara? You seem out of breath.

356
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,891
Huh? What's Kamuro doing here?

357
00:17:57,168 --> 00:17:58,554
What's going on anyway?

358
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:00,321
Did something happen?

359
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:01,816
I found them.

360
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:05,560
They were all inside Onigawara's desk.

361
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:08,025
Huh? Who are you?

362
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:09,689
Why are you going through my stuff?

363
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,070
It was you! Don't deny it!

364
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:14,037
Deny what? What are you talking...?

365
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:14,725
Pervert.

366
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,433
Who the hell just said that?!

367
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:19,635
What is this?

368
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:22,630
Wanna tell me exactly what you found in my desk?

369
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:27,761
Every one of the girls' missing recorder
pieces all stashed away in your desk drawer.

370
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:31,314
You were going to lick them to get
your sick kicks when no one was looking!

371
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:33,102
You're a pervert, Onigawara!

372
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:33,762
What?

373
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,655
Kamuro, don't make me punch you!

374
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,905
There's still time to redeem yourself!

375
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:39,018
Apologize!

376
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:44,510
Seriously, what kind of sicko crap is this?

377
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,486
Do I really look like someone
who'd do something like that?

378
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:50,699
You're violent with other people
and act like a low-life thug.

379
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,640
That's reason enough for anyone not to trust you.

380
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:55,333
Now just hold on a minute!

381
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:56,611
It wasn't me, I tell ya!

382
00:18:56,758 --> 00:19:00,013
Look, if I really wanted to lick those
things, I'd take them out of the school!

383
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,473
Only a complete idiot would leave them in his desk.

384
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:04,591
Well, you are a complete idiot...

385
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:08,229
Stop trying to pin this crap on me, Kamuro!

386
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:09,241
I didn't do it!

387
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:10,928
There were some in his bag, too.

388
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:12,936
Take a look.

389
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,804
Guess he did take a few of them out of school.

390
00:19:15,418 --> 00:19:16,564
My school bag...

391
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,901
I left it wide open in my locker.

392
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:20,608
Nice, Kageyama!

393
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,169
You even put some in his bag!

394
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,409
You're into this.

395
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:24,796
You bastard!

396
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,779
Stop snooping around in my bag!

397
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:28,492
Violence, huh?

398
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:31,012
Let him go!

399
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:32,093
Poor Kagayama!

400
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:33,633
So violent!

401
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,917
...it's Tenga the Recorder Licker!

402
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,306
Pervert! Pervet! Pervert!

403
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:45,770
Screw you guys! All of you!

404
00:19:45,795 --> 00:19:46,903
Run, everyone!

405
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,619
The perv's lost his temper!

406
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,226
No...

407
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,559
No! I didn't do it!

408
00:19:58,042 --> 00:19:58,646
Isn't...

409
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,269
Isn't there anybody who'll take my side?

410
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:02,235
Guess what?

411
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,809
One day, we're gonna get married, Tenga!

412
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:07,796
That'll never happen!

413
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:08,776
Don't be stupid!

414
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,831
That's right... Mariko!

415
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:12,635
You believe me...

416
00:20:13,564 --> 00:20:16,005
Don't you? Say something!

417
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:17,938
So gross!

418
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:27,199
Oh, yeah!

419
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:31,243
Get away from me, you pervert!

420
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:36,585
On this day, after two years of hard
work and dedication, Tenga Onigawara's

421
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,670
perfect attendance record was finally broken.

422
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:45,856
What's the matter?

423
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:47,909
Now, don't let it get you down.

424
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,219
I mean, everyone has bad days now and then.

425
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:52,616
Did you see his face, Kageyama?

426
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:56,323
He didn't even know how to handle
something he couldn't fight his way out of!

427
00:20:56,348 --> 00:20:58,161
He just stood there like an idiot!

428
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,411
He's finished!

429
00:21:06,856 --> 00:21:08,189
What happened to me?

430
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:09,198
What am I doing?

431
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,664
I'm going home.

432
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:12,224
Huh?

433
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:14,663
I don't actually have psychic powers.

434
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:16,663
Oh, come on...

435
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:17,203
Hey!

436
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:18,876
Kageyama, wait!

437
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,805
Hey...

438
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:27,548
If it isn't Mob's little brother.

439
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:31,660
I see you're giving me the cold shoulder, as usual.

440
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:34,583
So what are you wandering around near my house for?

441
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:36,097
It's for a job.

442
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:40,022
I got a request to exorcise a creepy
ghost that's been showing up in this area.

443
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:41,846
Ya wanna help me out with it?

444
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:42,966
Don't waste your breath.

445
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:46,403
Unlike Shigeo, I don't have any special psychic powers.

446
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:47,949
Really, are you sure?

447
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,408
I figured since Mob's your older brother and all...

448
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,375
You figured wrong.

449
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:54,508
Why don't you get rid of that ghost yourself?

450
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:55,542
Aren't you a psychic?

451
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,176
He quit by throwing a spoon instead of a towel?

452
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,824
He's got quite the sense of
humor, I'll give him that much.

453
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:07,480
But, when it comes to talent,
he doesn't exactly seem blessed.

454
00:22:07,698 --> 00:22:09,845
Actually, you might be wrong.

455
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:11,245
Take a look.

456
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,232
Hm? What's that?

457
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:21,974
It's not a balloon. What is it?

458
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,134
Ritsu continues to go wild by pairing up with Dimple.

459
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,268
And then the gang leader alliance makes its move.

460
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,593
Meanwhile, some scary people try to make Mob buy a vase.

461
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:04,100
Both brothers are in huge trouble!

462
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,586
Next time on Mob Psycho 100, Episode
7: "Exaltation I've Obtained Loss."

463
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:09,773
Illegal downloads? You're gonna be cursed.
