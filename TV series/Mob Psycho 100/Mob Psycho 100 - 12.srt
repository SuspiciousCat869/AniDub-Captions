1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:03,040
All four of you are going to hell.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,736
Shige, you're the only one of us who can stop them!

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:08,327
Kageyama! Use all of your powers!

4
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:10,344
I can't just let them die.

5
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:13,279
I have no choice but to fight with all I've got.

6
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:17,207
I'm warning you. Don't do it.

7
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,229
When things go south,

8
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:21,990
it's okay to run away and save yourself!

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,023
Damn it! I can't believe this is happening.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
R-Reigen... He's...

11
00:00:36,347 --> 00:00:37,367
This isn't good.

12
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:40,827
Stress is about to hit my brother like a tidal wave.

13
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:42,862
There's no telling what'll happen!

14
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,730
Honestly.

15
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:20,658
I really don't wanna hurt people.

16
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,096
But if I don't, we're going to be killed.

17
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:26,165
So I'm kinda stuck.

18
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:29,997
I realize that to protect everyone, I've gotta do it.

19
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:32,425
Guess that pretty much sums things up.

20
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:34,649
Brother...

21
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:36,549
And yet.

22
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,599
My master told me that it was okay to run away.

23
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:41,945
So...

24
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,599
No... Impossible...

25
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,741
Hey, don't scare me like that!

26
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:54,791
I thought you actually cut me for a second.

27
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:58,617
How is he standing? He was sliced hard!

28
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:02,836
I know you said that katana was just a
toy, but you really had me goin' there.

29
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:04,158
It's nothin' but plastic.

30
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:07,188
Pretty sneaky.

31
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,250
Tell me, what kinda trick did
you use to cut the floor earlier?

32
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,013
Hey, what's going on?

33
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,461
He's acting like he usually does.

34
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:18,445
Bastard. How 'bout I just chop your damn head off?!

35
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:19,278
Ow!

36
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:24,343
Listen, real adults don't have
time to play with toy swords.

37
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,003
It's time to grow up!

38
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:28,455
Huh...

39
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:31,258
Guess I understand how he's Kageyama's Master now.

40
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:32,780
Sakurai, move!

41
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:34,480
Candy, attack!

42
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,125
Whoa! An evil spirit?

43
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:39,703
Hey! Mob! Do something.

44
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,988
That's it? What a weak-ass punch. Are you a plushie?

45
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:47,906
Huh?

46
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:50,805
Eat fist, mascot!

47
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:58,529
Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to shred your costume!

48
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:01,019
Reigen is actually the real deal?

49
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,774
Don't get cocky.

50
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:05,575
Oh, crap! He's surrounded!

51
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:16,823
Huh? What was that all about?

52
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:19,202
Some kinda new 3D imagery or something?

53
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:20,649
What was the point?

54
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,757
He nullified all of them?

55
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:24,936
Is he some kind of monster?

56
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:26,956
How can this be?

57
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:30,595
Someone who's this skilled still exists in this world?

58
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:32,628
He must be eliminated.

59
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:35,567
He can't get in the way of our global domination.

60
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:37,320
Huh? Oh, I see.

61
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,395
You were using some kinda magic trick, too.

62
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,317
You guys are total frauds.

63
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,020
Just try that thing with the black orbs again.

64
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,345
There's a lot!

65
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:49,594
Is he gonna be okay?

66
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:51,660
Leave this to the adult here.

67
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:54,681
Wow! I'm in great shape today!

68
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,136
Master really is amazing.

69
00:04:58,262 --> 00:05:00,022
"It's okay to run away."

70
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,099
As soon as he heard those words,

71
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,786
the explosive amount of energy building up to a
critical level within Mob changed its direction.

72
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:12,629
There are times when the power
of one's words are unfathomable.

73
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:16,304
Those with power must choose to fight.

74
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:19,778
The thought of that responsibility
made Mob's bridge collapse.

75
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:21,278
But sometimes,

76
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:25,703
one's heart can find the resolution
it needs just by getting a helping hand.

77
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:31,412
As a result, all of Mob's energy
was temporarily tossed over to Reigen.

78
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,717
In essence, he'd successfully run
away and was feeling calm and refreshed.

79
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:42,487
All that was left in his heart was
gratitude towards his wise master.

80
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:53,766
Are these soap bubbles?

81
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:56,121
My Black Orbs...

82
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:59,277
They swallow up and destroy anything they touch.

83
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:03,507
And this man is swatting them away with his bare hands.

84
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:05,065
How?

85
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:08,900
What happened to the man who was
trying to run away just a moment ago?

86
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:12,536
I'll have to put my body on the line, too.

87
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,319
Five Hundred Kilogram Tackle!

88
00:06:22,702 --> 00:06:24,330
One Ton Punch!

89
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:33,687
Two Ton Guillotine!

90
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,687
You still conscious? Didn't think so.

91
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,195
No matter how powerful an esper you are,

92
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,589
you still fall short of excellence.

93
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,096
You have no desire for domination.

94
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:03,119
The reason you're so powerful yet so unknown
is because you're hiding your true abilities.

95
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:05,362
Well, I am different!

96
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:07,160
I am filled with ambition!

97
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,987
And I'll use my powers to go higher and higher,

98
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:10,878
and hold this world in...

99
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:14,044
Get up. Nobody wants to hear you monologue.

100
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:17,032
What a dense energy barrier!

101
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,167
Now I see what happened.

102
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:21,888
The reason my Black Orbs burst earlier was because the

103
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:24,570
energy they were trying to
take in was way over their limit!

104
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:28,302
Inconceivable. Who in the world are y...?

105
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:29,544
Where are your manners?

106
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:32,595
When speaking to someone, you should take off your mask!

107
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:33,361
Head's up!

108
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,595
Oh, guess it came off.

109
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:40,697
Anyway, what's with all this strength?

110
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:42,988
Could it be Mob's doing?

111
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:45,074
That's the only plausible explanation.

112
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:52,494
Listen, somebody your age should
stop messing around with toys.

113
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:55,487
What could you possibly know?!

114
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,598
To hell with that!

115
00:07:56,777 --> 00:08:01,241
Don't try and lecture me about my place in
society when you've only seen its good side!

116
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:03,879
When I was born, my parents abandoned me.

117
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,088
I was all alone.

118
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,845
A big happy family? Mother's cooking?

119
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:10,120
I got to experience none of that as a boy.

120
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:12,887
At the orphanage, I was bullied relentlessly.

121
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,332
I cursed the world!

122
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,085
If I hadn't, I wouldn't have survived!

123
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:22,157
All that rage and resentment helped awaken my
powers, and I was able to get by because of them!

124
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,105
Anyone who rejects my way of living can just... Uh!

125
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:28,528
What's with that face? Don't look at me like that!

126
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:32,032
You and I... we're like brothers.

127
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:35,188
Wait... He's the same as me?

128
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:37,292
Back when I was in grade school...

129
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:39,394
...maybe it was around fourth grade...

130
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,820
I forgot to tell my parents
that it was sports day at school,

131
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,430
so I was the only one with nothing to eat.

132
00:08:46,256 --> 00:08:48,545
Sure, that's sad, but you did it to yourself.

133
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:50,271
Why bring it up now?

134
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:53,075
To show our bond of feeling lonely at times as boys.

135
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,303
Don't compare that stupid story to mine!

136
00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:58,919
Jugan Air Gun!

137
00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:01,263
Behold the ultimate weapon of destruction.

138
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:02,350
Die!

139
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:08,611
If all else fails, I can still put
you to sleep with this cursed cologne!

140
00:09:08,762 --> 00:09:09,189
Hm?

141
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:12,590
I don't really get it, but don't
point or spray that at others.

142
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:14,105
Gimme that.

143
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:16,206
Huh?

144
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:19,681
Come on, seriously? This crap again?

145
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,138
You have all these psychic powers
and you use them to do stuff like this?

146
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:23,951
What a waste.

147
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:25,211
What'd you say?

148
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,328
It's like you're a little kid with a knife or something.

149
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,693
I can't bear to watch.

150
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:30,553
Who do you think you are?

151
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,644
What's with all that stuff on your forehead?

152
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,257
What?! That's, uh...

153
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,415
It's nothing. You wouldn't get it.

154
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:40,569
And what's with these goofy
things that look like shoulder pads?

155
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:43,341
Well, uh... Those are there to guard my shoulders.

156
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,512
Yeah. They're fashion accessories.

157
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:47,621
They don't serve any real purpose.

158
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:48,013
Huh?

159
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:52,596
You guys just don't get it.

160
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,970
No matter what kind of special powers you may have,

161
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:57,343
you're still only human.

162
00:09:57,387 --> 00:10:00,188
No more and no less. It's the same for everybody.

163
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:02,713
But somehow, you've all forgotten that.

164
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:05,940
You're so addicted to your special
powers, you've developed tunnel vision.

165
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:09,063
You want world domination, but you haven't seen the world!

166
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:11,430
No one's gonna follow you knowing that!

167
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:12,771
Don't make me laugh!

168
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,356
First, get rid of those
ridiculous shoulder pads and grow up!

169
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:19,793
You, too! You just wanna escape from society, right?

170
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:22,555
If you hope to make it big, you have to live in reality!

171
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,656
Consider that the starting point!

172
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:27,737
You're telling us to return to being commoners?

173
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:29,570
What? No way! You're not getting it!

174
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,399
Why don't you understand this?!

175
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,552
Think about who the hell you are for a second!

176
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:37,357
You've always been a commoner! A cog in the population!

177
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:40,509
But Claw only allows the elite espers to...

178
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:42,153
Look, I'm a commoner!

179
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:45,345
And I'm much more powerful than any of you will ever be!

180
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:48,463
So tell me! What the hell does that make you?!

181
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:57,953
He dragged them out of their
delusions and back into reality.

182
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:01,041
Shattering their dreams and putting them in their place.

183
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:02,930
Your master's amazing!

184
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:03,776
Yep!

185
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,238
No!

186
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:08,117
That is absolutely false!

187
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:12,784
It's the division leader's face. Is he really that old?

188
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,679
I actually thought he was a girl this whole time...

189
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,423
I reject your claims that deny our greatness!

190
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:22,112
"You're only human. No more and
no less. The same as everyone else."

191
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:23,643
That is what you said, right?

192
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:24,330
Yeah.

193
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:28,012
It's not true! And it's cruel to even suggest it!

194
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:31,653
We are superior lifeforms to
the rest of the dregs of humanity!

195
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:33,570
Our powers make us elite!

196
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,900
I'm sure you convinced yourself of that to go on,

197
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:37,503
but the truth of the matter is

198
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:39,772
society really doesn't care about you either way.

199
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:42,195
"Society, blah, blah, blah."

200
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,241
No group of average people is big
enough for a god-among-men like me!

201
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,387
You rely too much on these espers you've recruited.

202
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:51,745
The more I think about it, the sadder I get.

203
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:54,228
I was born with these powers, understand?

204
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:56,609
So what's the problem with me showing them off?!

205
00:11:56,678 --> 00:11:59,084
What's wrong with changing the world?!

206
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:00,678
Stupid ape!

207
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,470
That's how I see you. No different from a monkey!

208
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,925
It's hard to live!

209
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,370
Surviving's a chore, even though I'm so special!

210
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,737
It's obvious I'm amazing.

211
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,470
Why won't you just acknowledge that?

212
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:12,507
I'm a gift!

213
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:15,237
This planet should put me on a pedestal and worship me!

214
00:12:15,262 --> 00:12:17,341
That is the only world that is worthy of me!

215
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:20,547
Wrong. Having psychic powers doesn't make you popular.

216
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,477
See? There you have it.

217
00:12:22,762 --> 00:12:24,945
You'll never be popular. So give it up.

218
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,296
I'm going to erase you all...

219
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:33,263
Erase this whole building and start over!

220
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:36,278
Crap. Looks like I'm outta gas.

221
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:38,720
Mob, lend me your powers again.

222
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,054
Actually, I'm kinda tapped out right now.

223
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:44,155
Oh, no! We're being sucked in!

224
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,835
Disappear! Disappear! Disappear!

225
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:50,517
You just don't know when to quit.

226
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:51,950
Hey, that's...

227
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,555
Damn it!

228
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,342
I've got enough for you, too!

229
00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:58,768
Disappear!

230
00:12:59,303 --> 00:13:01,960
A mass of gravity, huh? Interesting.

231
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:05,583
Imagine the gravity going backward.

232
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,189
As neat as that power is, that
wasn't an actual black hole.

233
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:17,364
If it's conceived from psychic powers,

234
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:19,444
I can always find a way to deal with it.

235
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:22,270
Sorry, Gramps.

236
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,560
But you're no longer needed.

237
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:29,419
And as for you...

238
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,674
Listen up.

239
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,771
I'm disappointed in you. You coward.

240
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,414
The 7th Division will be dissolved.

241
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:43,852
I was ordered to inspect the place and take
anyone who seemed useful back with me to HQ.

242
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,422
What're you talking about?

243
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:46,542
Weren't you a trainee?

244
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:49,049
Sadly, there wasn't anyone worth bothering with.

245
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,594
At least... not on the inside.

246
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,309
Well, see ya!

247
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,864
The evil spirits have been whittled down to one.

248
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,255
The poison jar has finally been completed!

249
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:07,543
Matsuo. We're finished here.

250
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:10,852
Come out, Marshmallow! Be free!

251
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:17,755
The hell is that?

252
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:18,502
Dimple!

253
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:20,437
I was finally able to get out.

254
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:23,061
All right!

255
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:27,429
Now that I've consumed those spirits and
regained some of my strength, I can help here!

256
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:28,706
It's already done.

257
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:29,375
Huh?

258
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:31,778
You mean the climax happened without me?

259
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,271
Is this an evil spirit?

260
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:34,371
Whoa!

261
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:37,688
How is it that you're able to see
me when I'm not in my visible mode?!

262
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:39,288
They're really strong.

263
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:40,027
No.

264
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:41,803
We're weak, plain and simple.

265
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,568
Which leads me to this.

266
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:46,376
I've realized those guys just might be able to do it:

267
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,884
Stop Claw from world domination.

268
00:15:26,387 --> 00:15:27,748
Really? Let me see.

269
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:28,842
Check it out!

270
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,598
Oh, that looks great! Let's all go together!

271
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,033
Ah... Tsubomi...

272
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:37,570
She's as cute as ever today.

273
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,330
Huh?

274
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:39,922
Our eyes met!

275
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:41,612
Stare much, creeper?

276
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:43,286
Ah! Mezato!

277
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:44,707
You are such a spaz.

278
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:47,318
Look, staring at girls is all well and good,

279
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:50,019
but today is the day that you're going to talk to me.

280
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:52,173
The Body Improvement Club's today.

281
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:53,972
Fine, I'll just wait for you.

282
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:56,463
But I've got my job after that.

283
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,211
Ugh!

284
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:00,099
Come on, when're you gonna tell me everything?

285
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:03,858
Your older brother came by my place last night.

286
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:05,751
Huh? What did he want?

287
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,348
You must've been through quite a lot, too.

288
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:10,945
I think we both went a little crazy.

289
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:14,235
I'm done. I'm gonna apologize to Onigawara.

290
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:15,855
I'll go with you.

291
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:17,820
But are you sure about this?

292
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:20,731
I mean, the entire student body's gonna hate you.

293
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:22,031
Probably.

294
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,660
But that's my fault for doing something so stupid.

295
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:28,499
And now, my brother's on my side, so I'll keep in line.

296
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:30,854
It'll be tough, but it's for the best.

297
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:34,391
What?

298
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,735
So it was you guys who planted the recorders on me.

299
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,831
That was a crappy thing to do.

300
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:43,144
And I knew anyway, so it's not like it really matters now.

301
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:43,951
Huh?

302
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:45,617
Wait, what do you mean by that?

303
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:49,535
I mean that people didn't care whether
I was actually the culprit or not.

304
00:16:49,845 --> 00:16:51,639
They were chomping at the bit to come at me,

305
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,065
a chance to kick me out.

306
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:55,065
That's where the problem was.

307
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:59,378
I realized that I was hated by
everyone, and how weak my heart was.

308
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:01,920
It's not the best feeling in the world, let me tell ya.

309
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:03,627
Hey.

310
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:04,527
Uh?

311
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:07,368
Your brother was worried about you, you know.

312
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:10,398
He thought I was gonna kick
your ass since I was so pissed off.

313
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:13,939
But I'll let things slide since you're
the shadow leader's younger brother.

314
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:15,903
What's wrong, Onigawara?

315
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,496
You out of energy back there?

316
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:19,496
Just gimme a damn minute!

317
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:21,053
I'm still gonna grow,

318
00:17:21,137 --> 00:17:23,669
just like White T Poison did before me.

319
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:26,362
Body Transformation! Fight!

320
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,070
On!

321
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:27,637
Fight!

322
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:28,287
On!

323
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:28,854
Fight!

324
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:29,537
On!

325
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:34,464
Uh?

326
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,626
That's your older brother, isn't it?

327
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:40,849
Is he okay? Seems like he's about to pass out.

328
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:42,490
Yeah.

329
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:45,421
'Cause despite how he might look, my brother is strong.

330
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,012
Stronger than anybody else.

331
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:48,600
He looks passed out to me.

332
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,729
Oh, by the way.

333
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,954
Did you give up on your search
to find telepaths, President?

334
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:57,074
Actually, I haven't even started yet.

335
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,550
Right now, it's like a wild-goose chase,
so I'm trying to get some solid leads first.

336
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:04,292
It would be nice if you guys
tried to help me out with that.

337
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:07,887
Well, I did a search on the internet
earlier today, but I didn't find anything.

338
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,385
You lazy ass! It's not gonna be that easy!

339
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:11,532
What's up?

340
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:12,752
Musashi!

341
00:18:13,262 --> 00:18:16,345
Seriously, what the heck, Mob? Did you pass out again?

342
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,987
Inukawa, get some water!

343
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,072
Right. Sure.

344
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,350
So what's goin' on?

345
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:24,812
Why did you insist on bringing us here again?

346
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:27,578
I guess you haven't given up on psychic powers, huh?

347
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:30,124
Well, I wasn't the one who requested you.

348
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,892
Actually, it was for someone else.

349
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:33,887
Hey, nice to meet you.

350
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,011
So you guys must be the research subjects here.

351
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:39,227
Whoa. It's another hot guy.

352
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:40,614
I see.

353
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,337
Your powers are still kinda weak,

354
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:44,220
but they're totally worth nurturing.

355
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:46,278
Let me introduce Hanazawa, everyone.

356
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:48,120
He helped fight the organization that day.

357
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:49,675
What do you say?

358
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:52,430
Do you guys want to train with
me to help you get stronger?

359
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:53,204
Huh?

360
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,213
Since one of their divisions was crushed,

361
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:57,500
I'm sure Claw will make a move again soon.

362
00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:01,259
It'll be for self-defense, so you
can fight back when that happens.

363
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:02,685
And I'll be here as support.

364
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,445
We should. Kageyama took all the glory that night.

365
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,803
We barely even helped.

366
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,630
You're right.

367
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:11,769
Come on guys, let's do this!

368
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,616
Yeah!

369
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,083
Oh, hey. So what brings you here?

370
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,053
I'm only here because Shigeo asked me to come.

371
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:23,148
He passed out and can't help with exorcising spirits.

372
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:26,610
Now that I think about it, do
you even need Shigeo anymore?

373
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,133
You awakened your psychic powers, right?

374
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:32,237
Don't be stupid. Everything you saw was Mob's powers.

375
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:34,940
The only thing I gained from
it is the ability to see you now.

376
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:36,695
Otherwise, nothin's changed at all.

377
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:38,830
Back to a plain ol' con artist, huh?

378
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,905
You're a rather rude spirit, aren't you?

379
00:19:41,143 --> 00:19:43,476
Okay. Then come along and help me out.

380
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:45,137
The name was Dimple, wasn't it?

381
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,320
Huh? You're kidding me. Why do I have to help you?

382
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:50,637
Isn't that the reason he had you come over to begin with?

383
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:52,112
If he just wanted to say hi,

384
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:53,552
he could've simply called me up.

385
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:55,695
What? You can't be serious!

386
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,262
Who do you guys think I am?

387
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,994
Well, unless I'm mistaken, you're Mob's errand boy.

388
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:02,272
I'm a high-level evil spirit!

389
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:09,341
I'm disappointed in you. You coward.

390
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:12,558
Did I do something he thought was lame?

391
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,034
Did I make some kind of mistake?

392
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:20,068
Really, Shigeo? Again?

393
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,570
I thought I told you to fix that habit of yours.

394
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:24,512
Come on, dear, he's just at that age.

395
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:27,220
Let him bend all the spoons he wants. What's the big deal?

396
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:29,565
You always say that, you pushover.

397
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,781
Here. Let me see it.

398
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,778
What is with these kids?

399
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:37,819
There. Good as new.

400
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:40,259
Thanks, Ritsu. Appreciate it.

401
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,482
Eh, who cares what some guy thinks anyway?

402
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:50,671
Oh! I've been looking for you.

403
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,625
Hello? Yeah, I dropped my phone.

404
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:59,302
The 7th Division? They were annihilated.

405
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:02,867
Espers infiltrated the place
and slaughtered the upper echelon.

406
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,175
The division leader, Ishiguro,
went down like a house of cards.

407
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,470
Ha. Oh, and as for all of the underlings?

408
00:21:08,553 --> 00:21:11,740
The enemy totally appealed to
their emotions and won them over.

409
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,009
Sho, what're you talking about?

410
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,434
I was asking you for a status report on the inspection.

411
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,489
The organization you're so proud of

412
00:21:20,553 --> 00:21:22,651
isn't the best in the world by a long shot.

413
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,371
Quit messin' around and come back
to Japan already, dad, you idiot.

414
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:29,966
Makin' me do an annoying inspection...

415
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:31,481
I sure told him.

416
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,991
Yes. I'll return very soon.

417
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,841
And now, the local news.

418
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:50,178
Throughout Seasoning City, we've
gotten reports of tsuchinoko sightings.

419
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:53,970
City Hall, in a bid to reinvigorate
the area, put a bounty on the tsuchinoko

420
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:55,816
and is requesting help in capturing it.

421
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:58,637
Hey, Mob, are you free right now?

422
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,012
Meet me here in 90 minutes in your exercise clothes.

423
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:02,661
Yeah, something you can get dirty in.

424
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:12,937
We're gonna capture a tsuchinoko.

425
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,984
Huh?

426
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:16,199
Come on, aren't you excited?

427
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,222
Isn't this private property?

428
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:22,397
It's the kind of place where
those suckers are known to show up.

429
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:25,045
Have you ever seen a tsuchinoko, Master?

430
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,794
Nope. It's just a hunch.

431
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:28,361
That's pretty random.

432
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:30,881
Don't you have any passion for UMAs?

433
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,769
You know, Bigfoot, Nessie, and tsuchinoko!

434
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,469
From what I understand, there's a bounty on its head.

435
00:22:36,494 --> 00:22:37,774
Well, there's that, too.

436
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:40,795
Master, um...

437
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:41,504
What is it?

438
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:45,863
I don't think amateurs without hiking
experience should go this deep into the mountains.

439
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:49,297
Listen, Mob. We might be amateurs when it comes to hiking,

440
00:22:49,322 --> 00:22:50,804
but you have psychic powers.

441
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:52,686
So to me, that kinda evens things out.

442
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:55,416
Add that to my ingenuity, and we've got a...

443
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:57,651
Ah! Check it out! Over there!

444
00:22:57,762 --> 00:22:58,942
Get your net ready, Mob!

445
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,119
I knew this place was the jackpot when we got here!

446
00:23:01,387 --> 00:23:03,240
Huh? You actually found one?

447
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:05,895
No, it's a matsutake! It's huge!

448
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:06,947
Oh...

449
00:23:07,115 --> 00:23:08,763
After all that talk about passion,

450
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,909
he's already distracted by the matsutake.

451
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:17,591
The hell is that?!

452
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:20,239
Whatever it is, it's starving and headed right for us!

453
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:22,592
We're gonna exorcise it, Mob!

454
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,708
Actually, Master, isn't that the UMA we were looking for?

455
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:28,164
You idiot! Those things don't exist!

456
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:30,326
Quick! Quick! Kill it!

457
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:30,972
Okay.

458
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:40,818
Amazing. It shrank so much after you exorcised it.

459
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:43,135
Actually, that's 'cause it threw up a lot.

460
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:46,359
What the hell was that thing anyway? So weird.

461
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:47,985
You already picked that many?

462
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:50,002
Whatever. Let's go home.

463
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,284
But... the tsuchinoko...

464
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:54,270
What are you talkin' about?

465
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,543
Those things don't exist.

466
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,081
I'm gonna grill up some matsutake.

467
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:01,510
You'll have some, right?

468
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:02,130
Sure.

469
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:04,576
Guess we should buy some kabosu, too.

470
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:05,365
Sounds good.
