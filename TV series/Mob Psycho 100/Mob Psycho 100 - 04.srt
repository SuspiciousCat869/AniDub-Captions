1
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:07,173
The guys from Salt are crazy strong!

2
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:10,835
You must be Salt Middle School's "Tenga the Demon"!

3
00:00:10,918 --> 00:00:12,310
Come on, that all ya got?

4
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:14,729
'Cause my buddies and me were just gettin' warmed up.

5
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:15,935
Aw, crap!

6
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,039
The shadow leader!

7
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,718
Somebody get Teru!

8
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:19,357
Huh?

9
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:22,642
Whoa...

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,496
That's Teru for ya.

11
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:26,695
Yeah, but isn't this kinda overkill?

12
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:28,441
It had to be done.

13
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:30,430
They had the nerve to stand up to me.

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,710
If you show a pack of idiots like
these you're out of their league,

15
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:36,937
they'll suddenly bow down to you,
like completely different people.

16
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:39,357
The same way that all of you guys did.

17
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,368
Not to mention, it's never a bad idea
to have a bunch of fools indebted to me.

18
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:48,252
Be it through power or through people:

19
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:51,052
I'm going to take advantage of everything I can.

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,984
After all, I'm the main character in this world.

21
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:34,744
Shige, wake up! You're gonna be late.

22
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,521
Good morning.

23
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,586
Lovely day, isn't it, aye, partner?

24
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:42,043
Surprised?

25
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:43,269
Well, you know what they say.

26
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:45,976
"Yesterday's enemy could be today's friend."

27
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:48,679
Hm? You wanna shake?

28
00:02:48,823 --> 00:02:51,703
What are you doing? Stop! Wait, wait!

29
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:52,769
Hold on!

30
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:55,960
Y-You startled me! Wh-What was that for?!

31
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,834
Wanted to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

32
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:01,514
When you think that, you're supposed to
pinch your own cheek! Not slam me around!

33
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,127
Who are you?

34
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,570
Who? It's me, Dimple!

35
00:03:04,595 --> 00:03:06,085
The religious group guy!

36
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:09,237
Come on, we had that fight to the death yesterday?

37
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:11,372
So, you didn't completely disappear.

38
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:13,426
No! Wait! H-Hear me out!

39
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:17,104
I don't plan on living out the
rest of my life as some spirit blob!

40
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:18,902
But aren't you already dead?

41
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,352
Easy, Shige...

42
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:21,797
You're not supposed to go there.

43
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,225
An idol! A pro baseball player!

44
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,192
A movie star!

45
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:27,668
Everybody out there has some kind of dream!

46
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:30,040
And I have an ambition, too.

47
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,067
To stand tall at the top of all creation...

48
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,220
Basically...

49
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:35,688
God's my dream!

50
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:38,449
I fantasize about the day I finally become God!

51
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:39,409
Oh...

52
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,342
That's why you made that religious organization.

53
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:43,823
Though it was destroyed.

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,447
But that taught me an important lesson.

55
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:49,046
In order to gain command over people's hearts,

56
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:52,290
one must show off some strong psychic powers.

57
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,678
So what do ya say?

58
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,082
Team up with me!

59
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:57,268
Let's shoot for the top of the world together!

60
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:59,152
Do you have any more final words?

61
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,477
Seriously... have some compassion, will ya?!

62
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:03,810
I don't wanna leave just yet.

63
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:04,499
Please!

64
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:06,790
I won't do anything bad anymore!

65
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:08,592
Really? You promise?

66
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:10,335
Really! I promise!

67
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:12,124
All right.

68
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,849
I'll discuss it with my master.

69
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:17,942
Just don't do anything weird
here, at home, or at my school.

70
00:04:18,922 --> 00:04:21,085
Heh. Talk about a softy.

71
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:24,154
I'll just bide my time and
wait for my chance to possess him.

72
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,026
Hey, Shige?

73
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:29,298
Mom says to hurry up and eat breakfast.

74
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:30,843
Right. Coming.

75
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:33,609
Were you just talking to somebody?

76
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:35,015
Nope, not me.

77
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:37,501
Okay, well... Anyway, hurry up.

78
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:38,281
Sure.

79
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:43,107
Your brother seems like a totally cool guy, Lil' Shige.

80
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,374
My name's Shigeo, understand?

81
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:48,102
Call me "Little Shige" again and I'll exorcise you.

82
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:51,561
Whoa! My bad! Sorry about that, Shigeo.

83
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:54,975
Just as I discovered yesterday,

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,577
it's hard to read what Shigeo's thinking.

85
00:04:58,283 --> 00:05:00,451
I must study his personal and social life

86
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:03,151
if I ever hope to figure him out.

87
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:07,832
If all goes well, he could start to see
me as someone who truly understands him.

88
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,240
Who knows?

89
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:12,666
Maybe he'll eventually start relying on me.

90
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:15,889
Hey, you there...

91
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:19,210
You're Ritsu Kageyama from Year 1, Class 3, right?

92
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:20,390
Yeah?

93
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:23,578
I'm Mezato, Year 2, Class 1, from the school paper.

94
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:25,230
Do you have a few minutes?

95
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:27,395
You're in the same class as my brother.

96
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,400
If you wanna know about his psychic
powers, you should ask him yourself.

97
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,362
Aw, come on. Gimme a break.

98
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:34,976
Got something interesting to tell you, too.

99
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:35,977
What do you mean?

100
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,447
Did something happen to Shige?

101
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:41,148
I accept this spectral challenge.

102
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,830
I will exorcise the evil spirit

103
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,607
haunting the confines of this photo.

104
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:48,968
And I'll need about two hours to perform the rites.

105
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:53,696
Graphic Exorcism!

106
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:57,810
This is one of Reigen's special moves,

107
00:05:57,835 --> 00:05:59,934
editing photos with CG software...

108
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:03,787
...making them look perfectly natural.

109
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:05,761
Aw, crap!

110
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:08,554
I accidentally erased the client's eyebrow, too!

111
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:10,108
Master.

112
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:11,849
Mob? I'm a little busy right now.

113
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:12,752
Gimme a sec.

114
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:15,348
Wait. That's your master?

115
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:15,848
Yep.

116
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:18,602
He's Master Reigen, a powerful psychic.

117
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:20,377
You can't be serious...

118
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:21,471
What do you mean?

119
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:24,883
I don't feel any spiritual
power coming from this guy at all.

120
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:28,289
That idiot Shigeo is totally getting used by him.

121
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:30,995
I could let him know, but...

122
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:33,143
Nah, this is fine.

123
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:36,631
I'm sure I'll find a way to
make use of this knucklehead, too!

124
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:40,460
There we go. All done.

125
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:43,951
Master, I've had this spirit
stuck to me since this morning.

126
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,650
What do you think I should do with it?

127
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:47,350
Maybe erase it, or...?

128
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,045
Hm?

129
00:06:48,627 --> 00:06:50,111
Uh...

130
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,809
Heh. You won't be able to see me, ya fake.

131
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,852
Must be too weak for me to see it.

132
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:56,890
What?!

133
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:58,560
To put it in perspective,

134
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,869
it'd be about the same as a ladybug on your shoulder.

135
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:02,408
Do whatever you want.

136
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:04,135
Lucky you.

137
00:07:04,268 --> 00:07:06,823
Now, don't cause any harm and I won't erase you.

138
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:10,562
There's nothing that triggered it.

139
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:13,979
He's always had psychic powers. He was born with them.

140
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,583
As far back as I can remember,

141
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:19,633
my brother has been causing strange phenomena to happen.

142
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:24,507
To me, Shige... was the standard of the world.

143
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:25,753
Huh?

144
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:31,613
Even so, he hasn't used his powers
in front of others in a long time.

145
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:33,960
What happened to him, anyway?

146
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:35,775
Oh, that.

147
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,076
Your brother's caused quite a stir...

148
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,617
Hey, that kinda looks like you.

149
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:42,744
I don't see it.

150
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:45,059
Oh. That phone number...

151
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:46,545
Oh, I see...

152
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:50,772
Now my brethren are seeking
spiritual leadership from Shigeo.

153
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:55,017
Are they quick to jump on the next bandwagon or what?

154
00:07:56,002 --> 00:08:00,134
Mob's hidden charisma managed to bring out
quite a bit of adoration from a lot of people.

155
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,360
Pretty suddenly, too.

156
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:04,079
So much so that it formed a new religion.

157
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,460
And I'm here telling you about all this
because I think he deserves more recognition.

158
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:11,579
With that in mind, I'd like an
exclusive from your point of view...

159
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:13,672
Sorry, Mezato, but I must decline.

160
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,528
My brother's powers aren't some sideshow circus act.

161
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,757
No, that's not what I meant.

162
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:20,730
Well, yeah, maybe it is.

163
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,438
But he could get really popular and...

164
00:08:22,463 --> 00:08:24,322
All right, then. I'll be going now.

165
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:29,632
Ritsu Kageyama...

166
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,177
His grades are at the top of his class.

167
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:36,543
He's an attractive, popular guy who's
also great at lots of different sports.

168
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:39,832
He's pretty much got everything that Mob doesn't.

169
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:41,917
Jeez...

170
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:45,383
Despite what the-powers-that-be want us to believe,

171
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,486
people really aren't born equal at all.

172
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,622
Shige made my whole world seem normal.

173
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:57,871
Psychic powers were a perfectly ordinary existence for me.

174
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:00,405
Because I'm his little brother,

175
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:02,773
I thought that I'd be able to use them, too.

176
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:05,059
That's what I wished for.

177
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,905
"Charisma"? Who cares?

178
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:11,788
"Popularity"? Give me a break!

179
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,444
Compared to psychic powers, those qualities are cheap!

180
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,676
I'm leaving now.

181
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,202
Hey, wait up. I'll go with you.

182
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:26,828
Wow, this is rare.

183
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:28,648
You usually leave early.

184
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,659
Well, there isn't a student council meeting this
morning. Also, I wanted to talk to you about something.

185
00:09:34,962 --> 00:09:36,936
He seems to be pretty close to you.

186
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:39,613
I was wondering...

187
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:42,226
You don't use your psychic powers very often.

188
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:43,279
Why is that?

189
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:45,293
Well, Don't always have the chance.

190
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:46,714
That's where you're wrong!

191
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:48,663
There are plenty of opportunities, dude!

192
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:51,185
I guess there isn't anything you really want, then.

193
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:52,005
No...

194
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,135
It's just that using my powers
for everything would be pointless.

195
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:55,742
Huh?

196
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,477
Having them is kinda weird, anyway.

197
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:00,602
I mean, it's not like they're needed for survival.

198
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:01,482
They're awesome!

199
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:03,132
You're the only one who thinks that!

200
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:06,974
Using them isn't pointless! You
just don't realize how useful they are!

201
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:08,031
What do you mean?

202
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:10,877
You're saying there're things you
can't have, even if you use your powers?

203
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,283
That's not true at all!

204
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,565
You can even become G-O-D!

205
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,376
Muscles.

206
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:18,898
What is he talking about?

207
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:24,336
Or understanding girls, knowing what to do
in social situations, reading my surroundings.

208
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:25,960
I think there's even more...

209
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:27,153
like wisdom.

210
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:29,818
And, for that, I envy you, Ritsu.

211
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:38,439
Yeah... Like this, for example.

212
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:41,764
Psychic powers can't even help me solve math problems.

213
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,893
If those powers of his belonged to someone else,

214
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:49,950
we would've seen something
completely different in this world.

215
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:53,926
What did you want with the Body Improvement Club, anyway?

216
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,781
This is no place for a bunch of
delinquent thugs like all of you guys.

217
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,622
Unlike the lot of you with no
ambition, wasting your little lives away,

218
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:04,050
we try to better ourselves, Onigawara.

219
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:06,588
Yeah? What about those guys over there?

220
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:12,257
You wanna talk? Let's go outside.

221
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:14,003
He totally dodged the question!

222
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:17,355
I'll keep this short and to the point.

223
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:22,189
You guys in the Body Improvement Club are
the strongest dudes in Salt Middle School.

224
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,643
I'm here to ask you to brutally take down

225
00:11:24,695 --> 00:11:27,070
those guys from Black Vinegar Middle School!

226
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:30,787
Listen, this is lower-body strengthening
month, so we don't have any time.

227
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,915
We are way too busy doing squats.

228
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:35,243
Squats?! Are you kidding me? What are you...?!

229
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:36,765
Fighting's dumb, okay?!

230
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:41,655
We don't spend hours a day honing our bodies and
strengthening our muscles for something so petty!

231
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:43,872
What did you say?!

232
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,445
Say no to violence.

233
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:52,905
He stopped Yamazaki with one hand...

234
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,005
With these musclebound freaks on our side,

235
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,703
we'd definitely be able to win!

236
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:58,956
Uh... What?

237
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:02,433
That one guy obviously hasn't improved his body...

238
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:08,151
Shigeo, you aren't actually
aiming for this mindset, are you?

239
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:21,172
And now for a look at today's weather.

240
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:23,810
Although many areas across the country will be sunny,

241
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:26,606
there's some instability in the atmosphere.

242
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,154
This brings a higher chance
of thunderstorms and high winds.

243
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,377
So, if you're going out, it may be a good idea...

244
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,977
Gotta fight poison with poison.

245
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:35,019
Here's the plan...

246
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:38,352
Salt's extraterritoriality, the Body Improvement Club,

247
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:40,185
will fight against Teruki Hanazawa,

248
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,130
Black Middle School's shadow leader!

249
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,349
I kinda know what you mean,
but you've got that saying wrong.

250
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:47,960
And the Body Improvement Club isn't really poison.

251
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,543
Plus, "extraterritoriality" makes no sense here...

252
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,810
I think you just wanted to say that to sound smart.

253
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:55,603
That word and that "poison" phrase came up in class, too.

254
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,510
Guess Tenga's actually payin' attention.

255
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:58,398
Who'd of thought?

256
00:12:58,423 --> 00:12:59,256
That dummy...

257
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:05,992
There it is! Demon Rush!

258
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:08,707
Tenga's special move of repeated punches!

259
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:09,810
It's legendary!

260
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:11,518
Rarely seen by the human eye!

261
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:14,598
Though it becomes less rare if
he just uses it whenever, like now!

262
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,840
You really are amazing, Tenga!

263
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:28,317
This is...

264
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:31,327
What does this say?

265
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,549
"Abhore"?

266
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,906
Did I offend somebody?

267
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:38,264
It's probably a love letter. They spelled "adore" wrong.

268
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:40,557
Adore? Wha...?!

269
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:43,210
Though the whole thing is definitely fake.

270
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:43,625
Huh?

271
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,067
This is a lie?

272
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:48,143
That's an angry guy's handwriting.

273
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:50,039
It's clearly a fake love letter.

274
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:52,301
You're so unpopular, you don't realize it.

275
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:54,236
It's not real, then?

276
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:56,677
Just let it go, Shigeo.

277
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,141
Just let it go.

278
00:13:58,252 --> 00:13:59,528
A lie...

279
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:01,811
We received a challenge.

280
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:07,263
The only person I know with handwriting anywhere
near this bad is Onigawara from Salt Middle School.

281
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,185
He doesn't give up, does he?

282
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,223
Uh, what does "you rice bastards" mean?

283
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:14,643
Think he meant to write "you rat bastards."

284
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:16,727
You're so smart, Edano! Way to go!

285
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:18,935
No, it's just that Onigawara's stupid.

286
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:25,860
My plan is so perfect that I scare
myself with my own genius brain.

287
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:29,854
Now we wait for them to take the bait, and make our move.

288
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:34,448
I'm sure the guys from Black
Vinegar Middle School will be there,

289
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:36,994
but will the guy from the Body Improvement Club show up?

290
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,998
He might think it's just a prank.

291
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:41,148
Oh, no, he'll fall for it.

292
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:44,270
I wrote "I'm a girl" on it to seal the deal.

293
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:46,413
And I added a heart!

294
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,606
A girl wouldn't write "I'm a girl."

295
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:52,565
Seriously, no one's gonna fall for that.

296
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:55,035
But he did.

297
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:56,857
Seriously...

298
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:57,990
Well, you know,

299
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:00,921
if a girl is actually waiting here, I'd feel bad.

300
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,198
I told you, that's a fantasy!

301
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:05,226
You sure about doing this by yourself?

302
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:07,299
You didn't even tell the muscle guys.

303
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:09,431
We're supposed to train on our own today.

304
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:10,578
Hey.

305
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:13,310
You're from Salt Middle School, aren't you?

306
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:14,323
Huh?

307
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,054
Captain Musashi, there's trouble!

308
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:22,918
I found this under a dumbbell.

309
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,988
Kageyama's been kidnapped!

310
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:33,159
We're goin' to Black Vinegar
Middle School to get Kageyama back!

311
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:35,727
Finally, just the two of us.

312
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:36,893
So what do you wanna do?

313
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,227
What do you wanna do?

314
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:41,261
Well, maybe we can go to a café...

315
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:46,147
Tch.

316
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:49,065
Shigeo, do you know any of these guys?

317
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:50,443
Nu-uh, not a one.

318
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:52,888
Know what's happening here?

319
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:54,660
Uh, nope, not at all.

320
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,643
No matter what, your submissiveness

321
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:57,941
doesn't go away, does it?

322
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:00,714
For the guy that Onigawara called in to help,

323
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,513
he seems pretty quiet right now.

324
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,448
You're Kageyama, aren't you?

325
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:07,727
Sorry about this, but we've got a reputation to uphold.

326
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:10,477
No hard feelings, but we're
gonna have to take you hostage.

327
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:11,402
He's the one.

328
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:14,727
Looks like you were tricked by that Onigawara guy, Shigeo.

329
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:15,534
Tough break...

330
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:18,382
We've already told Onigawara.

331
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:22,616
If he wants his friend back in one piece,
then he needs to come get you himself.

332
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:26,033
When it comes down to it, I'd
say you're screwed either way.

333
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:27,873
Shigeo.

334
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:29,977
If there's one thing thugs and politicians

335
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:32,768
care about more than anything, it would be their image.

336
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:33,575
Get ready.

337
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,283
Make sure that you're prepared
to release your powers at any time.

338
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:37,770
'Member the rule?

339
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,891
"Don't use psychic powers against other people."

340
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:43,752
Ugh! He's always so accepting of things,
but he's so staunch when it comes to that.

341
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:44,977
In a situation like this...

342
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:46,929
...just use your damn powers!

343
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:51,596
The guys from Salt Middle School are here to fight us!

344
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:54,275
Took ya long enough, Onigawara.

345
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:58,274
They shouldn't have been able to recover
from their wounds yet from the last butt-kicking!

346
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:01,282
Let's put these punks in their place and finish them off!

347
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:02,852
Actually, we've got a problem...

348
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:08,040
Onigawara didn't show, but these guys in short
sleeves and shorts who I've never seen before did!

349
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:09,340
One more thing...

350
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,117
They're insanely strong!

351
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:16,184
Who the hell are these guys?

352
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:22,365
Hey! Who are you?

353
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:27,490
Salt Middle School's Captain of the
Body Improvement Club, Musashi Goda.

354
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:29,952
Bring Kageyama out here.

355
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:31,891
Kageyama?

356
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:32,810
Who's that?

357
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:35,876
Captain Musashi? I wasn't expecting to see you.

358
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,170
What are you guys doing here?

359
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:38,464
That's Kageyama?!

360
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:40,727
I'm just out running some errands today, no big deal.

361
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:42,979
This guy wasn't a helper, at all...

362
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:44,636
He was a landmine!

363
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,606
Damn! Onigawara tricked us! That bastard!

364
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,832
It looks like you're not hurt.

365
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:52,765
All right, Kageyama, let's get going.

366
00:17:52,877 --> 00:17:53,525
Okay.

367
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,415
We need to get back and work out.

368
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:59,983
Stop messing around, you jocks!

369
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:02,715
Do you think that we're just gonna let you leave here?!

370
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:05,727
We're all going to beat you into a big, bloody pulp!

371
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:07,785
Go get 'em, boys!

372
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:35,810
Somebody... Go get Teru...

373
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,335
I already called him.

374
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:38,807
It's been a while now.

375
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,606
Is he late 'cause he's flirting with some girl again?

376
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:47,036
Did some stray gorillas wander in?

377
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,310
Do I need to tame them?

378
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:50,748
Teru! You're here!

379
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:53,929
You aware of the term "organized violence"?

380
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:59,168
Those pieces of trash you see lying around
before you are the symbols of my authority

381
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:00,712
within my life at school.

382
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:03,640
And now that you've shattered it completely,

383
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:06,592
you've basically thrown mud in my face.

384
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:09,375
Are you one of these delinquents, too?

385
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:14,268
He's our shadow leader, the
one and only Teruki Honuhzahwa!

386
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:17,871
Teru! These guys think they're
tough, so please teach them a lesson.

387
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:19,262
Edano...

388
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,439
Today marks your last day as leader.

389
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,310
You just can't cut it.

390
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:25,484
Huh? No, wait a second...

391
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,199
You've put my dignity on the line here.

392
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:32,710
No way.

393
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,360
Looked like he just teleported.

394
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:36,119
You're just seein' things.

395
00:19:36,404 --> 00:19:38,279
We got what we came here for.

396
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,273
We'll be going back to training now.

397
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:43,303
I'm the one who decides whether or not you leave.

398
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:45,130
And don't you forget it.

399
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,473
Oh, well...

400
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:51,543
Doesn't feel right to face someone
with such a frail body, but...

401
00:19:52,553 --> 00:19:55,178
Society always underestimates me.

402
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:58,623
People never try to look beneath the surface.

403
00:19:58,793 --> 00:19:59,737
Fools.

404
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:01,827
That's why you're so easy to control.

405
00:20:02,123 --> 00:20:04,799
One doesn't take the spotlight 'cause they're the star.

406
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:07,467
They're the star because they take the spotlight.

407
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:10,102
And once that light finally shines onto you,

408
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,988
bugs with low IQs will always flock to it.

409
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:15,477
What are you talkin' about?

410
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:17,252
Hey, you insects around the corner.

411
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:19,022
Stop hiding and come out.

412
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,150
Onigawara!

413
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:24,216
So it's you.

414
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,817
Hurry up and crush that pretty boy!

415
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:35,792
Damn you! Take this!

416
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:42,677
That's insane...

417
00:20:42,793 --> 00:20:45,607
It was just a slap, but it packed a real punch!

418
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,121
He's tiny, but he swings like a bear.

419
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:52,151
Are you even human, you monster?!

420
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:54,883
Well, I'm impressed.

421
00:20:57,218 --> 00:21:00,154
You managed to blow us away despite the weight difference.

422
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:03,418
You must have some uniquely excellent musculature.

423
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:04,846
Musculature?

424
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,125
You little bastard!

425
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:23,927
I'll send you to hell!

426
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:26,180
Demon Rush!

427
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:27,933
What?! My fists...

428
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:29,560
They aren't even reaching him!

429
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:31,776
Muscles and fighting techniques, huh?

430
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,868
Average people are so sad.

431
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:36,621
Now it's my turn.

432
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:40,046
That was close!

433
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:48,500
Some leader.

434
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:51,941
Hm?

435
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:56,053
Wow, at least one of you is pretty tough...

436
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:00,161
What's with this guy?

437
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,088
His presence barely registers,
so I didn't even notice him.

438
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:05,057
On top of that, why's he tied up?

439
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:07,765
You shouldn't use them against people.

440
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:09,971
What are you talking about?

441
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:12,692
I'm talking about your psychic powers.

442
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:15,687
The ones that you've been hitting them with.

443
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,683
You should never use them for fighting.

444
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,680
Teru, the handsome esper, attacks Mob.

445
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:01,167
As men flee while psychic powers and
knives fly around the thunderous battlefield,

446
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,833
a mysterious figure appears, and a miracle happens!

447
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:07,585
Next time on Mob Psycho 100,
Episode 5: "OCHIMUSHA Psychic Powers and Me."

448
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:09,713
Blu-ray? Another excellent decision.
