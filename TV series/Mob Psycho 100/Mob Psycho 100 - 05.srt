1
00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:04,620
What a surprise.

2
00:00:04,686 --> 00:00:08,384
Guess there are other middle-school-aged
espers besides you, Shigeo.

3
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:12,570
But, looks to me like he's surprised
to discover another one, as well.

4
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:16,066
Impossible... Are-Are you a natural?

5
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:18,279
Someone with powers like me?

6
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:21,778
And what's that creepy-looking ball of energy next to you?

7
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:22,585
Huh?!

8
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:24,670
Are you that thing's master?

9
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:26,721
No, it's haunting me.

10
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:28,954
Well, whatever.

11
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:32,328
There are a bunch of questions I wanna ask you,

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,621
but first we need to establish something.

13
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:37,303
How the hierarchy works around here.

14
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:38,756
The what?

15
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:19,677
Now remember... be careful, Shigeo.

16
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:22,019
Even you could get tripped up if you don't take...

17
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,093
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

18
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:27,940
What?!

19
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:30,394
Why do you keep trying to attack me?

20
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:33,356
I haven't done anything to you. Let's be fr...

21
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:37,432
You've got him worried, pal.

22
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:41,022
Not that I don't understand how he feels.

23
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:45,817
So far, I bet he's lived his life
as a big fish in a very small pond.

24
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:49,968
And for the first time ever, he's meeting
someone who could be his natural enemy.

25
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:52,846
If he doesn't establish his superiority right away,

26
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,718
there will always be a struggle for power between them.

27
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:56,917
But all that aside...

28
00:02:57,306 --> 00:02:58,953
What's with those weird movements?

29
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,453
They're kinda like wire stunts.

30
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:01,785
Telekinesis.

31
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,982
It lets you move objects around and stuff.

32
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:05,686
So, are you up for doin' that?

33
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,210
Nah, makes me nauseous.

34
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:11,120
Using telekinesis, I teleport to my opponents

35
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:13,910
and blow them away with my Psycho Fist.

36
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:16,627
But, this strategy I use against average people

37
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,535
looks like nothing more than "weird movements" to him.

38
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:21,392
Damn it!

39
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:22,839
Shigeo...

40
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:24,876
You need to teach this kid a lesson here.

41
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:27,191
Show him that you're not someone to mess around with.

42
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,991
Come on. Look how he's standing.

43
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,478
He's gonna attack again.

44
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:33,120
You need to retaliate and hit him with something big, too.

45
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:34,400
No, I can't.

46
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,583
You're not supposed to use psychic
powers against people, remember?

47
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:38,870
Don't be such an idiot!

48
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:40,342
Look at who you're talking about!

49
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:44,401
That kid's putting his abilities to
good use and living a fulfilling life!

50
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:47,076
On the flipside, look at you.

51
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,335
You live quietly, one boring day after another.

52
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,911
Do you really think there's anything appealing

53
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:55,484
about you without your psychic powers?

54
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:57,301
Listen very closely, Mob.

55
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:58,643
You and I are different.

56
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:02,138
We were born with special and unique
powers that other people don't have.

57
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,447
Even so we mustn't let it get to our
heads and think we're special or above them.

58
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,094
People who're fast...

59
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:09,647
People who sing well...

60
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,788
People who're book smart...

61
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,482
People who're good at talking...

62
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:15,965
People who can use psychic powers...

63
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:18,720
They're all unique and you can't put one over the other.

64
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:21,186
Confidence in your powers is fine,

65
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:22,605
but you mustn't get conceited.

66
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,564
Depending on how we choose to use them,

67
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:26,715
they can also be deadly weapons.

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,155
They're just the same as knives.

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,700
And you know what not to do with them, right?

70
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:34,240
Point them at other people?

71
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,188
Then, you understand perfectly.

72
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:37,718
Don't ever forget that.

73
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:42,355
That's the moral code people like us
with special powers need to live by.

74
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,692
That gets ruined once you know Reigen said it.

75
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:47,520
Anyway, I won't use them in a fight.

76
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:51,877
Also, I don't wanna live a life
having to rely on psychic powers.

77
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:55,293
I'm going to find some other
potential within me to nurture.

78
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:57,693
Not to mention, I started working out.

79
00:04:58,161 --> 00:04:59,788
I'm gonna improve myself.

80
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,368
You say that, but...

81
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:04,779
Shigeo!

82
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:06,078
How'd you like that?!

83
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:08,555
A telekinetic tackle with all my weight behind it!

84
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:14,495
You've been given psychic powers
but choose not to use them? How stupid!

85
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:18,344
There's no reason to live your life
stooping to the level of average people!

86
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,994
Bringing out other potentials when
you have these powers is useless!

87
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:24,661
Working out? Studying?

88
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:27,526
Ridiculous! Leave that crap to the masses!

89
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:34,620
Brains, brawn, and even the law
are powerless before a gift like mine!

90
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,203
I'm special... better than others!

91
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:39,502
And the entire world revolves around me!

92
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:42,539
Jeez, I guess there's no choice.

93
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:44,632
Hey, little boy.

94
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:47,763
How about we just end all this and call it a draw, okay?

95
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:50,815
No way. Ending in a draw with a guy like that

96
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,881
would be the biggest disgrace of my life.

97
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,835
I understand you feeding your ego, but
I can't have you breaking Shigeo, either.

98
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:01,395
He's not going to fight back,
so obviously he's going to lose.

99
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,162
And that...

100
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,768
...won't work.

101
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:06,082
Dimple...

102
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:09,520
Most of my spiritual power's been erased,

103
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,226
so I'm pretty much just some leftover scraps.

104
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:15,894
Even so, I shouldn't have any
problem serving up some discipline...

105
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:18,254
...to a cocky little brat like you.

106
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,895
Shigeo's someone who can become a god.

107
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:23,330
He's not some second-rate loser like y...

108
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:24,576
Huh?

109
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,183
Dimple, no!

110
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:32,915
I erased that thing with my Psycho Wave from the core.

111
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:35,633
So there shouldn't be a single shred of him left.

112
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,367
Dimple's been... He was exorcised...

113
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:45,397
Forget about your club.

114
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,021
Work on your psychic powers instead!

115
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:51,350
That Tsubomi's sure got a nice ass, doesn't she?

116
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,583
Who the hell are you calling a ladybug?!

117
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,778
How 'bout I send your master to the hospital.

118
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,935
Come on! Listen to me! I'll make ya popular.

119
00:06:59,322 --> 00:06:59,688
Hey!

120
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:02,103
Want me to show you how to use X-ray vision?

121
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:03,369
Ha! Fooled ya!

122
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:04,924
I don't know either, ya pervert!

123
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,172
Just for a sec, would you do me a solid

124
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:08,947
and let me take over your body?

125
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:11,224
Dimple...

126
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,168
What's wrong?

127
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:16,407
Does it actually bother you
that your little pet was erased?

128
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:18,367
No, not really.

129
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:22,847
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't be.

130
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:27,055
After all, it was sort of a
pointless existence to begin with.

131
00:07:28,686 --> 00:07:31,411
'Course your existence is as pointless as his.

132
00:07:31,436 --> 00:07:33,807
Compared to someone like me, you're third rate.

133
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:35,153
Just a small fry.

134
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,158
You can become big, Shigeo!

135
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:38,330
I guarantee it!

136
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:42,435
Some idiots get the wrong idea if
everything isn't spelled out for them.

137
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,843
They actually think they can be someone "special"

138
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:46,376
if they put in a little effort.

139
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,603
Be more confident!

140
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:49,808
After all, you're the main character!

141
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:54,984
What's with that look?

142
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:56,209
Got something to say?

143
00:07:57,383 --> 00:08:00,508
Tell me, why do you have to belittle other people

144
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:03,147
by calling them things like "average" or "small fry"?

145
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:04,713
Huh?

146
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:09,403
I mean, I just realized Dimple
might've been an okay guy, that's all.

147
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,330
Compared to you, anyway.

148
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:12,603
What did you say?

149
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,599
Bastard...

150
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:20,499
I'm going to wipe that smug look right off of your face!

151
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:26,384
I'll make you submit to me with
the power of my psychic abilities!

152
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:29,714
So, I hope you're ready. Nothing will stand in my way!

153
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,907
That's dangerous.

154
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,747
If it wasn't me, you could hurt someone.

155
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:33,637
So, stop.

156
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:36,266
Are you trying to tell me that you won't get hurt?

157
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:41,620
I'll teach you to underestimate my power!

158
00:08:59,228 --> 00:08:59,852
So...

159
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:01,954
You just gonna keep defending yourself?

160
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,293
Look, I told you to stop doing that.

161
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:08,052
Show me these powers of yours!

162
00:09:11,186 --> 00:09:12,966
If you won't let me see them

163
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:14,910
we'll have to try something else.

164
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,893
I'll know how much you can take

165
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:20,319
by administering an endurance test.

166
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:34,164
Ugh, that hurt.

167
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,561
The home ec room.

168
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:43,257
Knives are sharp and dangerous.
You shouldn't point them at...

169
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,078
Don't try to order me around, runt.

170
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:47,156
You'll just reduce your lifespan.

171
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,422
I have no intention of killing him.

172
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,288
I just want him to fight back.

173
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:54,116
Will you stop this?

174
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:55,442
You'll cause an accident.

175
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,349
Huh?

176
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,355
You did this on purpose didn't you?

177
00:10:09,738 --> 00:10:11,224
It was an accident!

178
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:15,571
You're dead!

179
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:30,036
You're gonna pay for this.

180
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:32,982
I won't forgive you, no matter what you say!

181
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:42,968
How dare you...

182
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:47,427
You think I look like some middle-aged
pencil-pusher now, don't you?!

183
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,088
Huh? I didn't say that.

184
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:50,708
But you thought it.

185
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:52,772
No. That's fine.

186
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:56,097
I'll admit it. It's the truth!
I look ridiculous! It's awful!

187
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,590
But now that it's come to this,
I feel I must know your name.

188
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:00,663
What is it?

189
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:02,632
My name's Shigeo.

190
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,055
Shigeo Kageyama.

191
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:05,988
Kageyama...

192
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:09,096
I'm Teruki. Teruki Hanazawa.

193
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:12,027
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you, Teruki.

194
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:13,712
No, it's not nice.

195
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:16,103
It isn't as if we're friends now or anything.

196
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:20,100
I just wanted to know the name of
my enemy before I rip you to pieces!

197
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,437
Hey! Stop this already.

198
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:31,422
If you want me to stop, make me stop!

199
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:33,176
Come on! What's wrong?

200
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:35,355
You've gotta start fighting back!

201
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,710
Stop stalling and face me!

202
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,940
I'm popular and the main character of my story!

203
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:44,608
This entire world and everything in it revolves around me!

204
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:48,495
I am the chosen one... me, Teruki Hanazawa!

205
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:50,035
I don't get it.

206
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,285
How are you able to find all
of this confidence in yourself?

207
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,265
What a stupid question!

208
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:57,572
It's my psychic powers, of course!

209
00:11:57,657 --> 00:12:01,250
I can control the destiny and
movement of everything around me!

210
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,655
And you are my first enemy!

211
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:05,049
Now, attack me!

212
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:06,972
Let's have a test of strength!

213
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:08,286
No way.

214
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,370
Why not?! I told you it's okay!

215
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:12,202
Come at me!

216
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:13,204
Because...

217
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:15,177
I don't wanma hurt you, that's why.

218
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:15,950
Huh?

219
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:20,282
Are you kidding? That's absurd!

220
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:23,318
It's not like I'm some "Average
Joe" you're dealing with here!

221
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:27,038
I'm on a different level than the rest
of the lowly creatures on this planet!

222
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,315
Just because you're able to use psychic powers,

223
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,000
you're no better than... What'd you say?

224
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:32,254
Uh, I mean...

225
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:34,231
You're kinda goin' overboard here.

226
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:35,651
Think so?

227
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:38,014
Well, you're the only person who could make that argument.

228
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:41,011
That's why your very existence pisses me off!

229
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:42,991
Hold on... That's it!

230
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,121
I think I just realized why you hate me so much.

231
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:49,218
It's because you and I are the same.

232
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:51,732
And not because we both have psychic powers.

233
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:54,885
But the fact that you have no confidence in yourself...

234
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:56,485
...same way that I don't.

235
00:12:57,091 --> 00:13:00,012
If you take away your abilities, there'll be nothing left.

236
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:01,159
You'll be empty.

237
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,042
You're scared of that realization.

238
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:07,801
No friends, no standing out.

239
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,686
Just another loser who won't leave a mark in this world.

240
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:12,600
That's me.

241
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,663
Don't you see?

242
00:13:14,842 --> 00:13:16,781
Deep down, you're the same as I am.

243
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:20,026
You just don't wanna admit that you're
nothing without your psychic powers...

244
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:20,826
No!

245
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:23,161
Quit dreamin', idiot!

246
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:25,960
The two of us are completely different, understand me?

247
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:27,013
We're the same.

248
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:29,963
From my perspective, you're just an average person.

249
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,189
Shut up!

250
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,884
He's not using his powers.

251
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,107
What am I doing?

252
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:49,724
How did this happen? Damn it, it's you!

253
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:52,348
This is all your fault, you bastard!

254
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:54,728
Everything was perfect.

255
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:56,495
You got another high score?

256
00:13:56,623 --> 00:13:58,373
Long as I used my powers,

257
00:13:58,436 --> 00:14:00,285
everything went just the way I wanted.

258
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:02,394
Look at that shot! Amazing!

259
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,915
We're sorry! Please forgive us!

260
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,911
And yet, you took my world...

261
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:08,895
I-I made some cookies, if you'd like some.

262
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:12,477
You... Your very existence...

263
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:16,441
...destroyed that!

264
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:18,716
Damn it!

265
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:23,516
Use them! Use your psychic powers!

266
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:27,144
No... I won't...

267
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,909
I can't... use them...

268
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:33,073
...against people!

269
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:33,953
Is this it?!

270
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:40,953
What the hell was that?

271
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,863
How many times are you gonna reject me?

272
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:47,661
Kageyama, didn't you say you started working out?

273
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:49,999
That means, no matter how hard you try,

274
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:53,059
whatever that was you called a punch is all you've got.

275
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,728
Don't you get it?

276
00:14:56,777 --> 00:14:58,804
People can't change that easily.

277
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:03,358
Just give it up. Use your psychic powers.

278
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:06,606
Otherwise, I'm going to...

279
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,554
Hey! Give it back!

280
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,784
Give us back our New Year's money!

281
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:16,010
Don't get so cocky, kid. I'll kill you.

282
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,407
Ritsu!

283
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,153
You stay out of this, brat!

284
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:21,952
Brother!

285
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:26,460
Bro... ther...

286
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:29,578
It hurts... brother...

287
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:31,218
I'm going to change.

288
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,602
No, I won't use them.

289
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:39,818
It's coming... I'm going to change.

290
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,935
Huh? Hey, Kageyama?

291
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,667
Hey! Wake up! Wait!

292
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:55,700
Don't leave me behind!

293
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:56,800
Kageyama...

294
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:03,943
The battle between the two espers,

295
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:07,060
Shigeo Kageyama and Teruki Hanazawa,

296
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:09,104
never reached its conclusion.

297
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:12,870
As a result of rejecting each other's ideals,

298
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:15,578
there was no victor, and they were only left

299
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:19,510
to fill the void in their hearts
with a feeling of deep emptiness.

300
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,365
Or so it seemed...

301
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:30,402
What is that thing?

302
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:35,392
Do you finally feel like fighting?

303
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:36,872
Good!

304
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:40,603
In the end, you couldn't stay true to your ideals, either!

305
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:42,781
Bring it! Ultimate Barrier!

306
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:54,812
You used them! Kageyama!

307
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,680
You couldn't stand it anymore
and used your psychic powers!

308
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:03,433
You broke down and used them against another person!

309
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:04,835
So how does it feel?

310
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:07,150
Huh? Is he unconscious?

311
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:08,443
What is all this?

312
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,428
What the hell is this power?

313
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:11,902
What...

314
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,122
My powers are being sucked in by Kageyama...

315
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,828
No, that's not all...

316
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:19,737
All of the energy in the atmosphere...

317
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:23,242
Are you telling me his vessel is able to handle this much?

318
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:28,797
Teru sensed something that must never be touched in there.

319
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:32,760
Something incomparable, its identity unknown.

320
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:41,572
You're kidding... What is this?!

321
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,224
What in the world did I awaken?

322
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:53,578
That's enough, I'm sorry!

323
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:55,484
I won't do it again! Please!

324
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:59,952
I won't use my psychic powers against other people!

325
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:07,418
Oh... I guess...

326
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:10,912
I'm just an average person after all.

327
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:21,357
It was then that Mob realized:

328
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:25,480
He failed to change as he had promised himself.

329
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:29,341
He caused another accident because of his psychic powers.

330
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,832
He didn't know where to direct his emotions.

331
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,853
His powerlessness born from overwhelming contradictions...

332
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,512
...and the feeling he would
never be able to conquer himself...

333
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,472
Sadness.

334
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:50,311
What had just occurred

335
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,611
was Mob's meager attempt at resisting his inner self.

336
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:09,228
Hanazawa...

337
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:10,770
I-I'm sorry about your clothes an...

338
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:13,496
W-Wait, Kageyama... I'm... I...

339
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:17,142
What happened? Who won the fight?

340
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,953
Huh? Hey, look! It's Teru!

341
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:20,134
He's right over there.

342
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:21,881
Huh? What the hell?

343
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,870
He's been beaten, stripped, and shaved!

344
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:27,343
I'm not gonna let that happen to my hair!

345
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:28,645
Those guys...

346
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,512
You saw it, Kageyama.

347
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,147
It's just as you said it was...

348
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,808
Take away our psychic powers,
and we're nothing more than...

349
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:36,892
Kageyama!

350
00:19:37,513 --> 00:19:38,847
Oh. Hey, guys.

351
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:41,975
We were worried about you. You're not hurt, are you?

352
00:19:42,203 --> 00:19:44,216
No, I'm fine. Really.

353
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,116
All right, then. Good to hear.

354
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,600
Now let's all go back and do some more squats!

355
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:51,075
There's nothing I can say.

356
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:53,180
I completely lost.

357
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:14,954
Mob searched for about three hours,

358
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,247
but he couldn't find Dimple anywhere.

359
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:20,397
I'm home.

360
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:25,548
Shige?

361
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:28,420
Glad you're back. Don't catch a cold.

362
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:30,691
Thanks.

363
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:33,148
You're home late today.

364
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:34,422
Wanna eat?

365
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:38,342
Nah. I'm gonna get to bed.

366
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:40,706
You seem kinda down.

367
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:42,332
Did somethin' happen?

368
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:45,954
If you wanna talk about it, I'm here.

369
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:47,186
Goodnight, then.

370
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:48,064
Ritsu.

371
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,512
I'm sorry about that one time.

372
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,032
"That one time"?

373
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,797
You mean when you got super carsick
and threw up into the hood of my jacket?

374
00:20:57,822 --> 00:21:00,576
No... Well, sorry about that, too.

375
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:04,226
I really can't remember what happened...

376
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,936
...with that accident involving my powers.

377
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:10,017
I've wondered... Back then...

378
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:11,777
What did I do to you, exactly?

379
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:15,374
Oh, you mean when those high
school kids picked a fight with us.

380
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,637
Don't worry, you didn't do anything to me.

381
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,336
One of the punks kicked me away and I got hurt.

382
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,288
But you were there to protect me.

383
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:28,868
Just forget about it, it's no big deal.

384
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:29,948
Goodnight.

385
00:21:37,103 --> 00:21:39,716
Earlier today, sometime just after 5 PM,

386
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,285
countless people reported seeing a
supernatural phenomenon in the stormy skies

387
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:44,845
above Seasoning City.

388
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,661
Among the rubble, there were also
reports of what looked like a person

389
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:50,457
flying up into the air, but we
have not been able to confirm...

390
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,424
Back then...

391
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:52,894
Ritsu!

392
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:54,581
You stay out of this, brat!

393
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:01,527
Brother!

394
00:22:05,145 --> 00:22:07,941
The theory that this was man-made is gaining traction.

395
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,075
That wasn't him. That wasn't my brother.

396
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,320
I have no appetite.

397
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:24,653
He caught a cold.

398
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:58,759
His desire for psychic powers
makes Ritsu stray from the right path.

399
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,052
Having no idea that was happening,

400
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,867
Mob goes on a carefree date with Tome.

401
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:03,844
Come on, Mob. This isn't the time for that!

402
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:07,391
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i>,
Episode 6: "Discord To Become One."

403
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,871
First-press limited edition?
That is the absolute best decision.
