1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,926
Damn it, Mob.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,546
You could've let me know you had other plans.

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,127
Why do you think I gave you a cellphone? Pick up, already!

4
00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:11,007
You can just drop me off here.

5
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:17,756
Uh, okay then, sure. It's 8,810 yen.

6
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,418
Sir! What are you doin' so
late out in the middle of nowhere?

7
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:25,236
Don't worry.

8
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,395
I'm not planning to do anything crazy.

9
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,988
That kid... What the heck is he doin' out here?

10
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:07,941
Um... It's okay, Ritsu. I'm pretty sure it's this way.

11
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,187
Okay...

12
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:13,128
This is the same place as earlier.

13
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:17,442
Sorry, this is all my fault
for saying we should go exploring.

14
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:18,736
Forget about it.

15
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:21,237
Let's just focus on finding a way back, all right?

16
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:22,125
Hmm...

17
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,753
But how we gonna do that?

18
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:24,612
Umm...

19
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:25,931
Oh, I know!

20
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,599
You do?

21
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,452
I learned this in science class.

22
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:31,807
The side with moss growing on it is north.

23
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,226
Moss always grows in places where the sun shines least!

24
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,253
You see?

25
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,021
This way is north.

26
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:40,185
This direction will take us to the river.

27
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,424
Then we can get back to where we were barbecuing.

28
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:43,678
Let's go!

29
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:46,010
Yeah!

30
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:51,399
Looks like you're awake.

31
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:53,445
Where are we? Ugh!

32
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:55,100
Hey, are you all right?

33
00:02:55,326 --> 00:02:57,328
Do you remember anything about how you lost?

34
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,146
No, not at all.

35
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:01,606
Thank goodness. Are you okay?

36
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,646
Were you hit on the head?

37
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,890
I hope it's nothing serious.

38
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,876
Ritsu.

39
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:16,797
I'm so glad you're safe.

40
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:20,038
You're not hurt, are you?

41
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:21,598
No, but...

42
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:22,572
Let's hurry home.

43
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,143
That sound good, Hanazawa?

44
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:24,908
We can't.

45
00:03:25,513 --> 00:03:26,608
I'm not sure why,

46
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:29,571
but it seems we're completely powerless in this room.

47
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,086
I tried repeatedly, but no luck.

48
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:35,987
Usually, I could bust a hole in a
wall like this one with no problem.

49
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,473
Wow. Yeah, you're right.

50
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:42,641
But that's okay! We've got Ritsu here with us!

51
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:43,678
Huh?

52
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:46,606
Oh, yeah? What can your little brother do?

53
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,414
He happens to be really smart.

54
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:52,186
I can't do anything special
without using my psychic powers.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,845
But he can figure things out and solve anything.

56
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,999
Even without his powers.

57
00:03:58,158 --> 00:03:59,268
Is that so?

58
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:01,198
It sounds like you're pretty proud of him, aren't you?

59
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:04,671
Oh, very much so. There's nobody I admire more.

60
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:06,051
No fair...

61
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:06,697
Hm?

62
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,807
You won't even let me apologize.

63
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:15,262
It's just not fair. Even after everything I've...

64
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,018
Thank you, Brother.

65
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:27,085
The sanctity of your sealed room
is as amazing as always, Sakurai.

66
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:28,297
Of course it is.

67
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:30,466
All Frivolities aside, what now?

68
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,221
Do you plan on taking them in?

69
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:34,556
Making these intruders part of the upper echelon?

70
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:35,945
You're jumping the gun.

71
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:38,185
First, we need to brainwash them thoroughly.

72
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:40,332
Whoa, hold on a second, you guys.

73
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:43,320
You planning to turn decent talent into junk?

74
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:46,060
Those middle schoolers will be recruited to HQ.

75
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,118
It's a done deal.

76
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:49,709
Hm... Your name is Suzuki, correct?

77
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:55,043
I call the shots here in the 7th Division,
and that would include all personnel decisions.

78
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,140
I'll be taking them, especially that one.

79
00:04:58,413 --> 00:04:59,807
The kid who's in the uniform.

80
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,355
We'll be great friends.

81
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:05,335
I suggest you quit acting like
you're more than a temp trainee.

82
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:07,468
I'm a bit blunter than the others.

83
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:10,285
Come on. Don't get so worked up.

84
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:13,467
You're really upset about your coworkers being defeated?

85
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:15,812
You guys must get along better than I thought.

86
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:20,293
Lay off the sword play, old man.

87
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:21,601
That was a compliment.

88
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:23,285
Take it easy, Sakurai.

89
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,810
Everyone at HQ hates one another.

90
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,286
Nothing like the happy family out here.

91
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:29,320
Hmph.

92
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:32,083
Kids these days. They just don't get it.

93
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:39,012
Hey! You there! Who the hell are you?!

94
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:40,601
Do you think he's one of the intruders?

95
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:41,903
Quick, get the others!

96
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,810
Hey, what are all you guys talkin' about?

97
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,062
What's goin' on inside?

98
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,792
First thing's first, you suspicious jerk!

99
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:47,876
Tell us who you are!

100
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:49,560
Oh. Sure, just a sec.

101
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:51,326
Does he have a gun?! Careful!

102
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,935
Ah, wouldn't you know it?

103
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,994
I'm completely out of business cards.

104
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,085
Seriously?

105
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,314
His business card?

106
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:59,784
So anyway, back to the matter at hand.

107
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:02,387
Is there something going on inside that building?

108
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,394
S-Stay back!

109
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,462
We have nothing to say to some weird outsider!

110
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:06,609
Just get outta here!

111
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:08,959
Huh... That's kinda strange.

112
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:12,885
I'm usually informed when something
happens, but I haven't heard anything.

113
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:14,451
I'll check again.

114
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:17,101
What the heck is he talking about?

115
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,272
Could he mean...?

116
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:20,851
So then, let's get straight to the point, shall we?

117
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:22,964
Can everyone here use psychic powers?

118
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:24,307
How does he know about that?

119
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:26,263
He's heard about the organization?

120
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,351
Sorry, but I'm gettin' nowhere with you guys.

121
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,560
Hold it right there, you damned intruder!

122
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:34,745
Whoa, take it easy! I get the feeling he might be...

123
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,601
I was thinking the same thing.

124
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:37,752
Let go of me.

125
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:42,062
I'm only here to discuss work matters with my subordinate.

126
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:45,752
Your what? Wait a sec. You don't mean...?

127
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:48,168
Everyone here works under Ishiguro,

128
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,674
the 7th Division Leader's subordinate.

129
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:51,989
But Ishiguro's a subordinate of the boss,

130
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:53,037
which means...

131
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:57,840
Oh, crap! I was so rude! I'm gonna be killed!

132
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,080
What's the matter? Are you not feeling well?

133
00:07:00,611 --> 00:07:01,875
Hey, someone help him in.

134
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:03,516
Surely you guys have a break room.

135
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,549
He's-He's such a kind man!

136
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:08,357
He totally exudes superiority. He's gotta be...!

137
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,050
He's Claw's boss!

138
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:11,793
He's come back to Japan!

139
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:12,907
He's coming through!

140
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,346
Make way!

141
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:17,797
Pardon me. Reporting in!

142
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,070
What is it?

143
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,545
The boss has arrived on-location from HQ.

144
00:07:23,147 --> 00:07:24,014
He's here?

145
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:27,025
He said he wouldn't be back until next month.

146
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:29,862
Hm?

147
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:33,518
Hey, look. Somebody just ducked and hid upstairs.

148
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:34,543
What did you say?!

149
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:36,267
It's either an intruder or an escapee!

150
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:37,268
Capture them!

151
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:39,275
Yeah!

152
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:42,598
Looks like we got caught again.

153
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,973
Hang on, there's no need to be violent with kids.

154
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:47,063
Oh! I'm sorry about that, boss!

155
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:49,585
Wait a second. So you're the boss around here?

156
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,251
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.

157
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:54,018
Oh, come on. Don't be modest.

158
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:56,636
The real deal has no need to brag to children.

159
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:59,053
We might actually be able to get through to him.

160
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:02,126
'Scuse me! We were kidnapped and brought to this place.

161
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:03,970
We're here totally against our will!

162
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,220
Our friend is still in custody somewhere.

163
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:08,116
Would you please help us out?

164
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:10,335
Did you guys really do everything he just said?

165
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,940
Well, uh... Yes, but we were just following orders.

166
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,768
You're blaming others for this?

167
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,133
I'm very sorry, sir!

168
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,992
Listen, just because you were ordered to do something,

169
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:20,931
that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

170
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:24,361
When underlings start getting too
obedient, they're nothing but trash.

171
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:25,810
What? But, sir!

172
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:27,453
We thought we were doing what we...!

173
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,053
You fools!

174
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:34,080
Even if you're able to rise to the top like that,

175
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,469
all you'll see when you look down
is the filth you left in your wake.

176
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,347
I'm not sure what you're trying to do here,

177
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:44,304
but getting to the top only feels good
when you do everything the right way!

178
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,086
You just think about that!

179
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,643
Yeah, he's got a point.

180
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:50,382
I feel awful. We've been doing such petty things.

181
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:51,676
Wow, that's crazy.

182
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:53,661
It's like they just changed in an instant.

183
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:56,247
Oh man, this guy's in a league of his own.

184
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:59,064
Have you thought of anything, Ritsu?

185
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:01,828
It's probably best if we don't try anything now.

186
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:04,270
They'll stop by and check on us for sure.

187
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:07,293
I say we conserve our energy until then.

188
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:08,942
Sounds like a plan.

189
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,335
We'll have more options when we get our powers back.

190
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:15,064
Speaking of, we can count on
your strength as well, can't we?

191
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:15,549
Huh?

192
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:18,518
It's my fault for involving you two to begin with.

193
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,261
I'll help however I can.

194
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,390
Will he be okay?

195
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:25,980
Him? Oh, come on. I was the one
who was almost burned to death.

196
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:29,362
Besides, if you really get serious about going all out,

197
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:32,397
then two of us won't have to
put up a fight in any capacity.

198
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,642
They're here.

199
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:39,971
And they're roaming around in a group, as always.

200
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:40,651
Uh?

201
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,162
There you are, Mob.

202
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:46,756
What the heck are you doing in a place like this?

203
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:49,146
Oh, your little brother's here, too.

204
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:49,762
What's up?

205
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:52,463
W-Wait a second, who are you anyway?

206
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,893
And just how do you know the Kageyama brothers?

207
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:55,901
Quiet, you!

208
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:57,847
Don't talk that way to the big boss, got it?!

209
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,024
Th-The big boss?!

210
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:00,870
What are you doing here, Master?

211
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,607
His Master?!

212
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:03,627
A wig?

213
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,958
Hey, Mob. Who is this guy?

214
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,736
So he's Kageyama's master and the boss of Claw?!

215
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:11,110
This is our chance!

216
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:13,811
We're being held here against our will!

217
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:15,886
Please, step aside and let us go!

218
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:17,976
Why do you have them trapped in here?

219
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,000
Uh. Well...

220
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:21,451
I can't hear you.

221
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,306
It's top secret, so, uh...

222
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:26,458
Oh, really?

223
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,633
Come on, guys. That's a crime and you know it.

224
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,926
We're very sorry, sir!

225
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:32,576
You're amazing, Master.

226
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:34,918
Did he really manage to fool them?

227
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,218
All right, let's get outta here.

228
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:38,283
Can it be? Are we saved?

229
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:40,370
Boss, where are you going?

230
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:42,138
I said that we're leaving.

231
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:44,835
You should at least wait for Division Leader Ishiguro.

232
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,715
Uh?

233
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,356
Huh?

234
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:00,743
Who are you?

235
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:02,923
Doesn't look like the boss to me.

236
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:06,168
Introduce yourselves, criminal organization.

237
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:10,552
I'm Ishiguro, the 7th Division
Leader of the psychic association, Claw.

238
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:11,631
And you are?

239
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:15,974
I'm the greatest psychic in
modern history, Reigen Arataka!

240
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,788
Feel free to Google me.

241
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:18,834
What?!

242
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:20,730
So he's not the big boss man?!

243
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,347
Fraud or not, you had the nerve to
disregard me and call yourself the boss.

244
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,390
That's a severe offense.

245
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:30,685
Yeah, what're you talkin' about, you shrimp?

246
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:35,151
Step aside or I'll take care of you with
my green belt in Shorinji Kenpo with a snap.

247
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,991
Damn, that's strong!

248
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:38,711
Uh, what is this?

249
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,773
You're a spirit specialist. Stand back.

250
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:44,626
You've gathered some efficient pawns.

251
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:48,351
If you gather enough, you might
actually be able to oppose Claw.

252
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:50,101
D-Division Leader, wait!

253
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,121
If you attack him from that angle, we're gonna die, too!

254
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:55,601
Like I care. Seems fitting.

255
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:57,270
That guy's your boss, isn't he?

256
00:11:57,295 --> 00:11:58,783
No! We swear!

257
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:00,393
All of you, go and hide somewhere.

258
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:00,894
Huh?

259
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:04,451
If you wanna make it big and do something
with your lives, then you can't die here!

260
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:07,839
This is your chance to free
yourselves from this shady organization.

261
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:09,026
So hurry!

262
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:11,275
Leave this to me and my student and go!

263
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:13,200
You're such a kind man.

264
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:15,916
Thank you!

265
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:18,204
Actually, I'll be going, too.

266
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,908
Ah! The ceiling fell!

267
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,516
You won't get away that easily.

268
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,399
Whoa, what is goin' on here?

269
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:30,728
Are there seriously espers out there other than Mob?

270
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,816
Unfortunately, I'm no match for that kind of power.

271
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:36,271
It'll be a pretty tough challenge for me, too.

272
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:37,351
And that means...

273
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,361
...it's up to you... Kageyama.

274
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:45,027
Hm?

275
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:47,690
Yes. He's a strong one.

276
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,390
Let me take care of him.

277
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:53,477
I'll bet he's never met anyone
with powers that exceed his before.

278
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,334
He's in for a surprise.

279
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:58,216
Let me make myself clear.

280
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:00,679
You're not getting anywhere near me.

281
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:02,132
You'll be crushed.

282
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:04,364
Brother!

283
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,124
Some kinda gravity control?

284
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:10,722
Hey, Mob, what are you doing?

285
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:12,642
Master...

286
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:16,353
Not bad. You're able to resist my powers a bit.

287
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,657
Let's increase the gravity.

288
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:23,079
Anti-Esper Dropkick!

289
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:25,251
This is one of Reigen's special moves.

290
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:28,764
To execute it, he dropkicks an esper as hard as he can.

291
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:33,978
Master...

292
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:34,837
Mob.

293
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:38,332
Were you planning on fighting
these guys with your psychic powers?

294
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:42,749
I told you that it's dangerous to
use them against other people, remember?

295
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:44,746
Are you going to break the rule?

296
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,603
He had a rule like that?

297
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:50,293
In order to save me, he had no choice!

298
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,194
Mob.

299
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:56,518
Is this true? You felt that cornered?

300
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:03,013
It must've been rough.

301
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:04,609
Listen.

302
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:07,401
Confrontation with others is the hardest thing for him,

303
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:10,387
especially when it's with adults like you.

304
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:15,611
Watching you guys bully an awkward kid who
gets discouraged so easily is hard to take

305
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:17,421
and it twists my stomach.

306
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:21,711
So show some decency and stop stressing out my student!

307
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:25,554
Then you plan on fighting us yourself, I take it?

308
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:28,109
Let me give you a bit of advice.

309
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:30,886
No matter the disagreement, you shouldn't harm others.

310
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,959
But dropkicks are okay?

311
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:38,218
If you're too stubborn or set in your
ways to take that advice, then I'll fight you.

312
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:41,156
Either way, due to my position
as their temporary guardian,

313
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,814
I'm not going to let them go at it.

314
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:44,856
So yes, I'll face you myself.

315
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:46,637
As peacefully as possible.

316
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:49,101
First off, show me your powers...

317
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:50,389
...and I'll show you mine.

318
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,198
Starting with hypnosis!

319
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:55,453
Stare deeply into this five yen coin.

320
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:57,034
Hmph. How foolish.

321
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,838
That's odd. I don't sense anything from him.

322
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,447
Kageyama's master's powers...

323
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,424
Is he actually is an esper?

324
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:07,766
If this is a ruse, it's gonna be dangerous.

325
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,008
While you're watching this slowly swing back and forth...

326
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:14,411
...Hypnosis Punch!

327
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,810
This is another one of Reigen's special moves,

328
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,906
where he suddenly punches his opponent.

329
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,779
A sucker punch?

330
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:23,369
That's not a special power, that's just fighting dirty!

331
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,369
All right, guys.

332
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:26,989
Quit messing around!

333
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,630
Hey! Be careful with that thing!

334
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:34,837
That's a really sharp katana!

335
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,949
This is Jugan. It actually started
out as a toy sword made of plastic.

336
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:42,624
But after carrying it around and
cursing it again and again over the years,

337
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,645
it became truly powerful.

338
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,751
Hey, hold on. Listen to me.

339
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,247
My little ones, time to come out and play.

340
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:53,377
What do you think of the evil spirts I've collected?

341
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,497
Think you'll be able to handle them on your own?

342
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:56,886
No really, listen.

343
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,538
Ethereal Bodies Technique.

344
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:03,006
As you can see, I can freely exit my physical body.

345
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,071
I'm even able to limitlessly clone my ethereal form.

346
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:07,774
Come on, you're dealing with children here.

347
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,706
Maybe I'll get a little angry.

348
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,863
Let me introduce you to my Black Orbs.

349
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,733
Their varying gravity will rip you apart.

350
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,650
Reigen's plan backfired.

351
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,393
I was going to try to reason with them

352
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:23,038
while they were shocked from being hit,

353
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:25,026
but all I did was piss them off!

354
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:26,306
I blew it!

355
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:30,444
Reigen was very confident in
defeating others in arguments.

356
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:34,133
He'd never lost to anyone in a
verbal dispute, no matter who they were.

357
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,371
But that's only when I'm actually
dealing with normal human adults.

358
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:42,512
These irrational goons who are full-on
trying to attack middle school kids...

359
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:47,773
This bunch of deranged misfits who are
seriously talking about taking over the world...

360
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,074
They're simply children who failed to grow up.

361
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:53,742
How'd they end up like this? Either way, new plan.

362
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:55,560
Mob! Run for it!

363
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:56,464
Die!

364
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:01,018
Ah! I'm being pulled in!

365
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:03,026
Holy crap! Pull him back!

366
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:04,805
Hang on, Master!

367
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:11,376
While I don't like the idea of
being sucked into a black hole,

368
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,849
don't rip my body apart by pulling too hard!

369
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:15,322
Take it easy!

370
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:19,072
Maybe I went too far.

371
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,322
That was rough...

372
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,685
You can defeat them with psychic powers?

373
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,672
Give it a try.

374
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,145
Wha...?

375
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:46,438
Leave him alone!

376
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:15,311
I'm surprised you dodged that. Either way...

377
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:17,710
I think this look suits you better.

378
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,518
Damn it. We're dealing with some real weirdos here.

379
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:24,310
If they were evil spirits, I'd be able to exorcise them.

380
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:28,412
Really? Ha, ha. They are, so just try it.

381
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:29,420
Huh?

382
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,410
Guess you can just exorcise them.

383
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:36,810
Bastard. I call upon my ultimate creation.

384
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:38,693
Candy come out here!

385
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,143
Wreak as much havoc as you want!

386
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:44,393
Screw that, we're gettin' out of here.

387
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:45,667
Don't bother with them, Mob!

388
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:48,352
Kageyama! Use all of your powers!

389
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,699
Just blow these guys away!

390
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:53,118
No, don't! Now stop fighting back!

391
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:55,442
I'm the adult, so I'll deal with them!

392
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,243
Mob, there's no need for you to stoop to their level!

393
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:03,668
Shige, you're the only one of us who can stop them!

394
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,923
Yes... He's right.

395
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:07,915
I have to defeat them now.

396
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,412
No! Stop! Don't fight back, Mob!

397
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:13,021
Ritsu's hurt.

398
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:16,804
We've gotta fight power with power!

399
00:19:17,348 --> 00:19:19,750
At this rate, we're all gonna die!

400
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,598
We just need to run away!

401
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,994
Get real! How can we run when
they won't stop attacking us?!

402
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:29,522
Do it! Use the powers you used that time before!

403
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:30,816
No, keep it together!

404
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:34,292
Don't go head-to-head with
someone who has murder on their mind!

405
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,991
All four of you are going to hell.

406
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,714
Ritsu... Hanazawa... Master Reigen...

407
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:44,356
I can't just let them die.

408
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:49,114
I have no choice but to fight with all I've got.

409
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:54,995
If I can save them, I don't care
what happens to the ones attacking me!

410
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:03,060
I'm warning you. Don't do it.

411
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:05,289
In the end, you're the one who's gonna be suffering.

412
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:07,800
When things go south,

413
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,659
it's okay to run away and save yourself!

414
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:25,173
Excuse me. I saw your sign and thought I'd stop by.

415
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:26,419
Sure, come on in.

416
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:27,792
How may I...?

417
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,429
Oh, it's just a kid.

418
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:33,144
All right, young man. So what do you want?

419
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:35,884
Well, um. I'm an esper.

420
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:36,589
Huh?

421
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:40,988
There are times when I can't control my
powers too well, and it gets kinda scary.

422
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,804
Let me guess, did somebody tell
you to come here and say that to me?

423
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:48,002
No. I haven't talked about this with anyone.

424
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:51,854
I saw your sign and thought you
might have the same kind of abilities.

425
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,603
If I tried, I could see spirits, too.

426
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,586
Well, come on in.

427
00:20:58,168 --> 00:20:58,939
Sure.

428
00:21:01,068 --> 00:21:03,190
I was troubled when I was a kid, too.

429
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:04,137
Huh?

430
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:04,917
Uh.

431
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:08,951
Listen, just because you have
these psychic powers and abilities,

432
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:11,768
it doesn't mean you're any
less of a human than anyone else.

433
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,043
There are people who are fast, people who are book smart,

434
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:16,789
and people with strong body odor.

435
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:18,828
Psychic powers are just like that:

436
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:20,168
Another characteristic.

437
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,889
You must embrace that characteristic as a
part of yourself and continue to live positively.

438
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:27,850
After all, the truth behind one's charm is kindness.

439
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:30,607
So just be a good person. You got it?

440
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,708
So may I come by and talk to you again?

441
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:36,582
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.

442
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:38,114
I'm pretty busy, you know?

443
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,844
Anyway, you should go home for tod... Hot!

444
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:42,317
Move! You'll get burned!

445
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:49,056
Hey... You said...

446
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:51,698
You said you could see ghosts, too, didn't you?

447
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:56,357
Do you know how to exorcise them?

448
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:02,101
All right. Come again tomorrow. Same time, okay?

449
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:03,317
Yeah? Really?

450
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:06,763
I'll show you exactly how to use your powers.

451
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:11,150
Master!

452
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:21,392
Master...

453
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,286
Huh? Master...?

454
00:23:58,168 --> 00:23:58,826
Master?

455
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:00,186
Master!

456
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:02,099
Master, please! Wake up!

457
00:24:02,835 --> 00:24:06,309
Next time on Mob Psycho 100,
Episode 12: "Mob and Reigen."

458
00:24:06,418 --> 00:24:09,993
This was in Master's will: "Watching the
finale in real time is an excellent decision."
