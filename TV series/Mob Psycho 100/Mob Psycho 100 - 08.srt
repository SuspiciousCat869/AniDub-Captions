1
00:00:01,053 --> 00:00:03,733
It looks like there really aren't
many espers out here, are there?

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,432
I mean, all of these people have walked
by and not one of them has stood out to you.

3
00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:12,037
Unless, of course, you're just
not saying anything to trick me.

4
00:00:12,296 --> 00:00:13,889
No, there really haven't been any.

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:15,522
Hm...

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,411
Hey. So are the two of you on a date?

7
00:00:19,324 --> 00:00:21,466
Whoa. This guy seems pretty unique...

8
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:23,286
It's Hanazawa.

9
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:25,720
Sorry, but... something's come up.

10
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:27,650
Cool if I borrow him for a bit?

11
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:30,147
Uh... Sure...

12
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,391
Someone's fighting under my name?

13
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,154
Yeah. It's a student from Salt Middle School.

14
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:36,514
You might even know him.

15
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:39,533
He's back that way.

16
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:41,392
You should go and take a look for yourself.

17
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,148
It's you...

18
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:53,381
What are you doing, Ritsu?

19
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,278
Shige... What are you doing here?

20
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:34,790
I'd ask you the same thing, Ritsu.

21
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:36,703
Must be his younger brother.

22
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:39,050
Who's this kid?

23
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:41,992
Who are these people piled up on the ground?

24
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,122
Did you do all this?

25
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,577
Ritsu...

26
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:49,301
Yes. I'm responsible.

27
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,291
Watching two siblings fight isn't
exactly the classiest thing to do.

28
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:59,740
Really? This is your doing, Ritsu?

29
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,027
It's true.

30
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:04,339
No way.

31
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:07,007
Come on, you're just kidding, right?

32
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:10,153
I mean... seriously? Brother...

33
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,481
Seriously. I did this.

34
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:16,144
See, I've finally obtained psychic powers.

35
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:16,971
Huh?

36
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,875
Whoa, Ritsu! What do you think you're doing?!

37
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:22,663
Not another word, Dimple.

38
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,905
Tch! He's drunk with power.

39
00:03:25,324 --> 00:03:27,099
This is why I hate brats.

40
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,761
I'm not hanging around for a battle I know he'll lose!

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,146
Dimple?

42
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,875
Whatever. I don't need him.

43
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:36,284
I've got the hang of it now.

44
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,090
Listen, Brother.

45
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,820
I've come to realize something very important.

46
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:43,050
What? What do you mean?

47
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:44,943
Look, if something's bothering you...

48
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:51,632
You do have psychic powers...

49
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,205
I missed...

50
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,149
Ritsu... You did it!

51
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,053
You've wanted them for so long!

52
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:03,144
Do you remember? Back when you were a little kid,

53
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:05,452
you'd cry your eyes out 'cause you couldn't bend spoons.

54
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,495
Who would've thought that now...

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,960
The situation hadn't changed until recently.

56
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,784
Now listen to what I was trying to tell you.

57
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:14,248
I've always wanted psychic powers.

58
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:17,627
And because you had them, I'd always admired you, Brother.

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,097
Really? You're making me blush.

60
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:22,739
But that was just a big misunderstanding.

61
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,119
It was?

62
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:28,490
I couldn't handle my inferiority
complex and fear towards you...

63
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:32,869
So I was protecting myself by
thinking it was simply admiration.

64
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:35,433
More than anything, I was scared of you.

65
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,465
I never knew what you might do if you got stressed out.

66
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:41,089
We could never even have a fight as brothers.

67
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:44,023
I mean, that would be suicidal, right?

68
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:46,798
I'd have no way to protect myself from your powers.

69
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:51,764
So I did my best to stay out of your
way and not cause any trouble between us.

70
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:54,268
Now that's just a humiliating past.

71
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:57,460
I tried so hard for so long,

72
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,261
no matter how crazy or frustrated it made me...

73
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:00,941
And yet...

74
00:05:01,862 --> 00:05:04,366
...you never worked hard in your life, so why?!

75
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:08,505
But now I've obtained them.

76
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:11,120
Now I don't have to be scared anymore.

77
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:13,675
The delusional admiration is gone.

78
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:15,661
Actually...

79
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,764
...I've lost all interest in our relationship.

80
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:23,410
So, this buddy-buddy act of ours ends now.

81
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,526
It's over.

82
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,607
Ritsu. I can tell. That's all just a lie.

83
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:31,180
I want you to face me!

84
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,688
Hit me with the full force of your powers!

85
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:36,103
But I guess part of what you said is true...

86
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:37,690
I am your brother.

87
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:40,065
And that means...

88
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,509
...I have to help take care of you.

89
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:48,706
I'm terribly sorry that my little brother hurt you.

90
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,621
He lost his temper, that's all.

91
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:53,262
Please look past this and be friends with him.

92
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,463
Huh?

93
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,258
What'd you say?

94
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:58,713
You're the older brother of that freak show?

95
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,763
Yes. And I'm very sorry.

96
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:01,751
You idiot!

97
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:04,226
Think that's enough to be forgiven, do you?!

98
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:06,627
You need to grovel down on your knees first!

99
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:07,846
Oh... Okay...

100
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:11,191
Stop it.

101
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:13,754
Why would you do that?

102
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,329
Tch! What do you think you're doing?!

103
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,133
Ritsu... There isn't any use in trying to get rid of me...

104
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:24,647
I mean, we're brothers.

105
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:28,453
Hello?

106
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:30,347
I'd like a status update.

107
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:35,002
It's been ten minutes since you reported
that you've found the target. What are you doing?

108
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:36,952
Thought while I was here, I'd observe the...

109
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:38,145
What are you, an idiot?

110
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:39,452
Hurry up and bring him here.

111
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:41,207
All right, fine.

112
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:44,563
Actually... just in case, send a photo.

113
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,418
It'd be a real pain in the ass if you brought back

114
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,865
the wrong brat.

115
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:49,677
Yeah, yeah...

116
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,128
Mocking me...

117
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,378
There you go. Sent.

118
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,466
Got it.

119
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,873
That's him... Shigeo Kageyama.

120
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,409
Like I said...

121
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:04,714
Confirms the "Awakening Lab's" data...

122
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:07,637
Tch. What a completely exaggerated name.

123
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,641
It's embarrassing to even have to say it.

124
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,137
Now, listen. Don't mess this up.

125
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:17,570
The more information we leak, the more annoying it'll be.

126
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:19,358
No fooling around.

127
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:21,418
I got it, I got it...

128
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,928
Acting all high-and-mighty...

129
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,990
Let's get this wrapped up.

130
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:30,051
The tables have turned!

131
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:31,659
White T Poison!

132
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:35,787
If you don't want us to beat the crap out
of your brother, then get your ass over here.

133
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:38,515
Ah. Hold it. You shouldn't do that.

134
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:40,035
Huh?

135
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:43,591
I was hoping we'd end this. No more hurting people.

136
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,124
There's been enough violence.

137
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:48,925
Now, just who in the hell do
you think you are, small fry?!

138
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,474
Only the strongest can give out orders like that.

139
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,092
And the strongest will rule. That's the way of the world.

140
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:56,808
Just how pathetic are these people?

141
00:07:57,701 --> 00:08:00,045
The strongest one here is obviously...

142
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:09,251
You're exactly right.

143
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:10,839
Tch! Let go!

144
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:12,921
Ritsu!

145
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:13,379
What?!

146
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:13,846
Who's that?!

147
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:15,126
Who the hell are you?!

148
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:17,745
Like you said, the strongest will rule.

149
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:21,251
It's such an obvious thing that
sometimes, you forget about it.

150
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:22,611
Let me guess...

151
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:27,378
You guys figure that if you're strong at
fighting, you can rule your school and turfs, right?

152
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:31,308
That's cute. Really. Nice job. You should keep it up.

153
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:35,068
But this guy's on a completely different level.

154
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:37,955
You punks don't stand a chance in hell of beating him.

155
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,885
So I'm gonna take him from the fighting grounds.

156
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:43,496
You can keep squabbling with whomever else in peace.

157
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:45,066
He's comin' with me.

158
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,823
Hold it right there! He's our target! You can't...

159
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:49,663
Yaugh!

160
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:50,902
That's our business!

161
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,026
How dare you treat our boss like that?!

162
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,572
Wait, I got a bad feeling.

163
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,412
This guy's too strong... It's not fair...

164
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,183
You thugs are such simple creatures...

165
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:06,669
Pathetic.

166
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,360
Uh?

167
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,975
My little brother...

168
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,378
Shige...

169
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:18,299
Did I hit him too hard?

170
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:22,096
Well, if he dies, I'd say he was just unlucky.

171
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,863
Hey, tall guy.

172
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:27,734
What's with that angry stare, huh?

173
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,315
It wasn't angry... I was just looking, that's all...

174
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:33,283
Grovel and apologize to me!

175
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:33,906
Huh?!

176
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,581
We're reviewing the scene you were playing out earlier.

177
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:40,217
I know! All of you should grovel! Get on your knees!

178
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,138
Oh, do you need a little added incentive?

179
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,453
If you don't grovel, I'll kill you little punks.

180
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:53,440
What a sight to behold!

181
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,430
Look at all you pathetic dipshits!

182
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:58,465
Let this be a lesson for those who think they're badasses.

183
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:02,501
And I've got one piece of advice
for the rest of your rotten lives.

184
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:05,354
Try to live by walking on the side of the road,

185
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:10,126
so you don't cause the strong ones you
can't handle any trouble. See ya, brats.

186
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:14,577
Damn it!

187
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:16,204
What was that about?

188
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,601
Look that's...

189
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:25,712
Ritsu!

190
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,874
You, too, brat? You want some of this?!

191
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,261
Wait... What are you...?

192
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:47,437
I wasn't told anything about this kid
having a brother with psychic powers...

193
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,814
Let go of my brother... or you'll regret it.

194
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:56,589
So, you've put up a barrier.

195
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,129
Oooh, I'm shaking!

196
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:00,727
I'm not supposed to use these powers against others...

197
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,646
But this is different!

198
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,340
Is that all you got, little man?

199
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,099
I remember now!

200
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:15,534
From before... He's that adult esper I noticed.

201
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:19,325
Love to stay and play, but I've got other plans.

202
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,699
Luckily, there are ways to deal
with little esper brats like you!

203
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,240
Telekinetic Helix!

204
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:32,593
He's attacking again.

205
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:34,849
I don't wanna grow up and become this guy.

206
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,369
Now, cry...

207
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:38,750
Huh?

208
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:47,288
You're so light. You fly like a bird!

209
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:50,918
It hurts... I can't exhale...

210
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:54,890
Or inhale... My stomach is burning...

211
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:04,609
You surprised? My powers rip through your
barrier like an excavator through a pile of rubble.

212
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,940
Shige!

213
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:07,634
Stand up.

214
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,456
You're gonna protect your little brother, right?

215
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,301
Whoa, holy crap!

216
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:16,141
That is one hell of a beating!

217
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:17,465
This can't be real...

218
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:18,301
Seriously?

219
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:19,385
He's gonna die.

220
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,045
Brother...

221
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:25,103
Leave him alone...

222
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,963
Stop hurting him! Please!

223
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:43,651
Stop it, now!

224
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,588
Just take me! It's what you wanted, right?!

225
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:48,827
Then do it!

226
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:51,755
That's a wise decision.

227
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,997
But I don't play fair...

228
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,658
What's with that look on your face?

229
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,795
Think I'll take this opportunity to wipe it off!

230
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,209
Look what you've done...

231
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:10,971
This is the first time this has
happened while I'm still conscious.

232
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:17,777
Can you feel it? Rage. Burning in me.

233
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,845
He brought my hands to the ground...

234
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,336
A brat like that...

235
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:46,524
I can't get away!

236
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:53,404
That guy is finished. It's over.

237
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:56,681
You who attacked my brother and me unprovoked...

238
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:00,727
You did this to yourself, and now you're gonna pay for it.

239
00:14:01,349 --> 00:14:04,230
Don't you ever show your face in front of us again.

240
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,545
Telekinetic Helix!

241
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:18,859
What?! How can it have no effect this time?!

242
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:46,742
Unbelievable...

243
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:48,268
Hey, did you see that?

244
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,336
What the hell happened?

245
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,869
What's going on?

246
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:54,917
You're kidding!

247
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:57,522
Energy Bomb!

248
00:14:58,686 --> 00:15:01,695
You're actually making me use my trump card...

249
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:03,302
Shige!

250
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,864
Why won't he fall over?

251
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:11,472
At this rate, things won't end well.

252
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:14,067
Oh! I know! Reinforcements!

253
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:18,921
Damn it! What's with this brat?!

254
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:23,998
H-He's strong!

255
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:27,345
If I don't put up my guard,
I'll be knocked out in an instant.

256
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:29,552
Yeah! Get him!

257
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,769
Can't believe a guy like that exists.

258
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:36,269
Hey, look at that! It's... It's a white T-shirt!

259
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:37,756
That's it!

260
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:40,170
He's not White T Poison's older brother.

261
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:43,218
He's the shadow leader at Salt Middle School.

262
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:45,984
White T Poison!

263
00:15:47,051 --> 00:15:49,641
Taking him on in a battle of abilities isn't good.

264
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:52,511
I don't have a choice. The mission comes first.

265
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:54,926
Hey, look out! He's got a knife!

266
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:56,741
Shut up, you stupid punk!

267
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:00,092
If you're not giving up, I'll end it.

268
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,902
The next move will be the last.

269
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:03,690
Take this, brat!

270
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:07,362
Damn it! This barrier's so powerful!

271
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:09,713
My knife's not even gonna scratch it!

272
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,126
Just kidding!

273
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:17,837
What happened?!

274
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:19,721
I don't like using this stuff,

275
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:22,609
but I don't have time to deal with this crap anymore.

276
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:25,691
You've all gotten a good look at my face.

277
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:28,301
So, I'm gonna have to make you disappear.

278
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:29,578
O-Oh, crap!

279
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:30,337
Run!

280
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:31,262
H-Hurry!

281
00:16:31,882 --> 00:16:35,363
You really think I'll let you get
away after everything you've seen?

282
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,884
Impossible! I can't take him on anymore!

283
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:42,340
You're coming with me!

284
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:49,399
He left and he didn't kill us?

285
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:50,982
We did it!

286
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:51,696
Yeah!

287
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,202
All right!

288
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,337
Amazing! You saved our lives!

289
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:56,603
What the...?

290
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:59,143
He's unconscious, but still standing.

291
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:01,527
I'd stay away, if I were you.

292
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:03,315
It's still dangerous to be near him.

293
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,436
You're from Black Vinegar Middle School.

294
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:10,491
I can't believe someone was able to push him
over the edge like that. That's no ordinary guy.

295
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,695
He left and took Ritsu with him.

296
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:15,118
Dammit! Looks like we're too late!

297
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,200
This is rock salt from the Himalayas.

298
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:23,214
It goes great with pasta or meat.

299
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,919
It'll also come in handy for our needs in the exorcism.

300
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,980
Your shoulders feel heavy, right?

301
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:32,317
Yes. A fortuneteller said there was
something dense weighing down on them.

302
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:34,650
So they just told her that and took the money?

303
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,103
How irresponsible.

304
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:38,256
I know just what to do.

305
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:41,837
Uh, why are you...?

306
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:44,261
Ghosts and spirits are completely powerless against salt.

307
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,521
First, we'll weaken them with the rock salt powder.

308
00:17:46,546 --> 00:17:48,698
And with this scraping noise by your ears...

309
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:51,573
This'll be really annoying to spirits
that wanna live in a quiet place.

310
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:53,743
Eventually, they'll grow agitated and leave.

311
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:55,191
Phase two!

312
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:57,935
We'll use the hard edges of the rock salt and do a massage

313
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,695
to loosen up your tense muscles
and improve your blood flow.

314
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,188
We'll place a hot towel on your face to cover your eyes.

315
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:07,699
This shuts out the spirits' visual interferences.

316
00:18:07,724 --> 00:18:10,401
Along with using aroma oils to maximize your relaxation,

317
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:12,516
we'll light some incense that spirits hate.

318
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,477
Such a wonderful smell!

319
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,538
Aroma Runaway Express!

320
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:21,604
This is one of Reigen's special moves,

321
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:26,076
where he sends his clients on a specialized
beauty trip that relaxes the body and soul.

322
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,722
Oh, my goodness! I feel so much younger!

323
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:32,379
That's an added bonus!

324
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:35,447
I'm so glad there was no actual spirit to deal with.

325
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:38,599
This is the first time I can remember
that Mob didn't show up for work.

326
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,092
I'm gonna have to lecture him when I see him, again...

327
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,194
Brother...

328
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:48,094
If there's anything troubling you, let me know.

329
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:49,885
I'll be there to listen anytime.

330
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:52,580
Shige, somethin' bothering you?

331
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,530
You sure everything's okay?

332
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,043
If you're not feelin' right, I'm here to listen.

333
00:18:57,182 --> 00:18:59,797
Oh, it's nothing. Really. I'm fine, Ritsu.

334
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:00,904
Thanks for asking, though.

335
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:02,868
Sure.

336
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:08,497
Ritsu... Ritsu... I see, now...

337
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:11,501
I'm sorry I didn't realize it sooner.

338
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:19,724
Good, you're finally awake. I was worried.

339
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,420
Hanazawa... Where are we?

340
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,008
My apartment.

341
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,047
Dimple told me about everything that happened.

342
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:29,081
Hey! Looking good, Shigeo...

343
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,910
Dimple... What's going on?

344
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:34,561
Why were you there with Ritsu?

345
00:19:34,903 --> 00:19:36,327
It's a long story.

346
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:39,366
And he was kidnapped. Dimple...

347
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:39,886
Oh?

348
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:41,831
Are you to blame for all this?

349
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:43,273
It's a misunderstanding!

350
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:44,991
I don't know who those guys are!

351
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:46,515
He doesn't, but I do.

352
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,421
Huh?

353
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:50,553
They've been trying to follow
me around for a few years now.

354
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:54,077
Huh? Is that why you live by yourself
even though you're in middle school?

355
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:56,363
Let me give you a little bit of advice.

356
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,234
Stay away from them.

357
00:19:58,504 --> 00:19:59,000
Huh?

358
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:01,254
But they've got my brother.

359
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:03,456
You'll die.

360
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,425
It's an organization called Claw,

361
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,241
formed by dangerous espers.

362
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:13,568
They want a revolution and aim
to turn the world on its head.

363
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:16,346
Their ability to function as a group is first-rate

364
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:19,089
and there're over a hundred who're actively involved.

365
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,289
You're kidding, right?

366
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:22,437
Over a hundred...

367
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:28,060
There are plenty of facilities across the world
that are researching ways to manufacture psychic powers.

368
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,841
But the only one to succeed
at such an undertaking is Claw.

369
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:35,865
Apparently, they take child espers who have yet to mature,

370
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,479
brainwash them, and raise them as soldiers.

371
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:41,834
They aren't as powerful as us Naturals,

372
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:43,454
but if you underestimate them,

373
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:45,088
their sheer numbers will crush you.

374
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:46,908
You know a lot about 'em.

375
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:50,698
Got most of my info from one of their
guys who tried to kidnap me before.

376
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,515
Luckily though, that time around, I taught him a lesson.

377
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:57,109
So basically, they're a bunch of
shady espers from a dangerous group.

378
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,693
Hey, Shigeo, you're lucky. You
could've been killed back there!

379
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:02,166
It doesn't matter...

380
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:06,522
Ritsu, my little brother, was kidnapped.

381
00:21:07,677 --> 00:21:08,718
I'm gonna go save him.

382
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:09,030
Huh?

383
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,925
Do you have a death wish?

384
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,325
No, not at all.

385
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:14,202
Then calm down and think.

386
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,801
I think I can win.

387
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:20,391
Have it your way.

388
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:23,501
But how do you think they found
out about your little brother?

389
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,608
I don't really have any idea.

390
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:27,469
Ah! I just remembered!

391
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,231
There's a research facility where
people like you were gathering.

392
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:32,836
As a matter of fact, Ritsu was there recently, too.

393
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:33,681
Are you serious?

394
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,856
So the information must have leaked from there.

395
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,676
Maybe we should check it out.

396
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,812
But I have a bad feeling about this...

397
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:41,639
I can lead you there.

398
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:47,168
Ah! This is terrible...

399
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:49,512
How could they do this to civilians?

400
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:53,488
It looks like they're unconscious, but not dead.

401
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,752
Wh-Who are you?! Where did he
go?! That guy with the sword!

402
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:03,711
You need to answer our questions first.

403
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:07,166
Now tell me, did you sell Ritsu
Kageyama's personal information to Claw?

404
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:10,816
To Claw? What's that? Ritsu Kageyama?

405
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:12,616
You must be mistaken.

406
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:15,551
The one I invited here was a kid named Shigeo Kageyama.

407
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:16,837
You're wrong. That's me.

408
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,154
It can't be!

409
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:22,928
This all started with a misunderstanding,
and yet they really managed to awaken Ritsu.

410
00:22:24,424 --> 00:22:25,844
I don't what's going on.

411
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:27,152
Damn it all!

412
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,733
And we were finally seeing some hope in our research, too.

413
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,503
It looks like this guy really doesn't know anything.

414
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,193
Where are the other kids?

415
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:39,317
They were kidnapped. Is all of this my fault?

416
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,369
To think there's a group like that...

417
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:46,224
All right, so what level of power
did the kids who were kidnapped have?

418
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,905
'Cause I'd like to know exactly
what we're up against here.

419
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:52,810
Hold on a second. Who are you guys, anyw...?

420
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:57,189
What do you think you're doing, Hanazawa?

421
00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:58,742
Introducing ourselves.

422
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,286
Come on, brats. Hurry and get out.

423
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:22,143
Quit dawdling. Keep moving. Don't make me smack you.

424
00:23:22,674 --> 00:23:25,017
Now, don't scare them any more than necessary.

425
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:26,334
They'll be useless.

426
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:27,019
Tch.

427
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:28,116
Kageyama.

428
00:23:28,193 --> 00:23:29,723
You look rough, are you okay?

429
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:31,229
Don't worry, I'm fine.

430
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:33,690
But listen, we really shouldn't fight back right now.

431
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:57,467
Trapped in a suspicious research facility,

432
00:23:57,558 --> 00:23:59,754
Ritsu plots an escape with the good-for-nothing espers.

433
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,843
Meanwhile, Mob rises to save Ritsu.

434
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:03,762
That's right, Mob! That's what you call a man.

435
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,320
Next time on Mob Psycho 100,
Episode 9: "'Claw' 7th Division."

436
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:09,733
Option B involves buying the Blu-rays and the manga.
