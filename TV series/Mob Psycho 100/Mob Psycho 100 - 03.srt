1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,248
Fight!

2
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:06,177
Fight on! Fight on! Fight on! Fight on!

3
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:09,530
Psychic powers don't make a man appealing.

4
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:12,646
So, in order to change this aspect of myself,

5
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:15,195
I joined the Body Improvement Club.

6
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:17,075
Body improvement!

7
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:19,744
Fight on! Fight on! Fight on!

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,877
Move it!

9
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:26,254
Fight on... Fight... on...

10
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:30,648
Hm? This isn't good.

11
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:33,303
Guess he must be anemic.

12
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,030
Fi... Fight on...

13
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:12,813
There is something wrong with him.

14
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,244
I mean, who would choose the
Body Improvement Club over us?

15
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,575
Let it go. What's done is done.

16
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:20,121
Let's not dwell on it.

17
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,352
Come on. It's your turn, President Kurata.

18
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:24,165
Hey, guys.

19
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,851
Oh! Hey, Musashi!

20
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:26,931
And, once again,

21
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,543
thank you so much for letting us use this room!

22
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,230
Really, you don't have to grovel.

23
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:33,431
Most of our training's outside, anyway.

24
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:35,299
We just need this room to store our equipment.

25
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:36,786
Uh... What's with him?

26
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:39,261
Oh, Kageyama passed out.

27
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:40,985
Would you mind looking after him?

28
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,250
We're still exercising.

29
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:45,742
Now, seriously...

30
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:48,911
Why did you join the Body Improvement Club?

31
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:51,221
Because...

32
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:53,569
I've never been the most athletic guy,

33
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:55,589
and I'm a really slow runner.

34
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,663
I've always relied on my psychic powers for everything.

35
00:02:58,918 --> 00:02:59,910
Huh?

36
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:02,199
What kind of lame excuse is that?

37
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:06,228
Besides, I don't even know if you
really do have psychic powers. Prove it.

38
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:17,450
So was that enough?

39
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:18,542
Do you believe me now?

40
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:20,740
Whoa, it's heavy!

41
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,095
Seriously?

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,987
He could only bend spoons before!

43
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:25,007
Oh!

44
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:26,932
Kageyama! Please!

45
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,492
Help me make my dream come true!

46
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:29,105
Huh?

47
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,391
Believe it or not...

48
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:37,240
...my dream is to make contact and have initial
interplanetary dialogue with extraterrestrial life forms!

49
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:41,755
When first trying to achieve this goal, I followed
an instructional guidebook, but it didn't work.

50
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:43,998
Before I knew it, I was just lazing around...

51
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,523
But now that you're here with your psychic abilities,

52
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:49,337
I've finally got a shot!

53
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:50,230
Mob,

54
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,427
let's research telepathy together, seek out new life,

55
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,000
and boldly go where no man has gone before!

56
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,920
Can't. I've gotta go pump some iron.

57
00:03:58,348 --> 00:03:59,592
What? You're kidding.

58
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:02,184
I'm burning with passion here. Why're you so indifferent?

59
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:05,144
Because I've finally found something that I wanna do.

60
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:07,942
What, putting on some muscle?
You have psychic powers here.

61
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,731
So what difference does bulking up make?

62
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:13,675
Actually, it might be more accurate to say...

63
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:16,067
I want to become more appealing.

64
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:17,333
So, you mean...

65
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:18,753
You wanna be popular?

66
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:21,723
No, not really...

67
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:22,692
Well, you won't be.

68
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:23,379
Huh?

69
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:28,112
Even if you gain tons of muscle,
that'll never happen. Not a chance!

70
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:30,429
What? Then what should I do about it?

71
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,456
Read girls' minds using telepathy.

72
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,713
You have the power!

73
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,914
Do that, and you'll be super popular.

74
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,462
What? Telepathy?

75
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,615
I can't really do anything like that.

76
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:44,301
Though, I am able to hear the voices of spirits.

77
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:45,848
What brought this on?

78
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,429
Oh, I was just wondering...

79
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,821
Is there someone's mind you wanna read in particular?

80
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:55,293
Maybe a girl?

81
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:57,750
Mob, Mob, Mob...

82
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,730
You are so easy to read.

83
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:01,390
Look.

84
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:03,681
Every middle school boy wants to be popular.

85
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:05,390
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

86
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:06,505
It's just a fact of life.

87
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:09,580
Even yours truly has dreams of popularity.

88
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:14,636
It's not like I have to be popular or anything...

89
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:17,185
I just want Tsubomi to like me.

90
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:20,588
Young man, may I ask you a question?

91
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:22,381
Is something troubling you?

92
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,181
You aren't laughing or smiling.

93
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:26,548
No...

94
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:28,139
I can sense these things.

95
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:30,172
You're worried about your studies, right?

96
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:31,852
My grades are just fine.

97
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,640
Of course they are.

98
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:35,175
It's not your studies...

99
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:38,125
But, it must be hard dealing with family issues.

100
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,605
Actually, I don't have any.

101
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,304
What I meant to say was...

102
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,791
It must be your health.

103
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:43,865
No...

104
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,519
It's about love.

105
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:48,441
That's amazing! How did you know?!

106
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,408
If you want to resolve these troubles, come with me.

107
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,388
I can't. I have to head home.

108
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,600
You'll be popular.

109
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,684
'Kay, let's go, then.

110
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:09,859
It so happens that I belong to a brand-new
religious order that came into existence last month.

111
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,388
Religious order?

112
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:13,844
Yes. It's called LOL.

113
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,481
Founded by our leader, Master Dimple,

114
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:20,448
it's the happiest, trendiest, most
satisfying gathering of the century!

115
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,839
The master has the amazing and mysterious
ability to make anyone laugh immediately.

116
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:26,752
That's cool.

117
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:28,727
So, how do I become popular?

118
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:32,662
Now, now, don't be so hasty.

119
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:37,013
LOL is in no way a suspicious group,

120
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:38,917
so make yourself at home.

121
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:42,667
Wow, there are a lot of people here.

122
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:46,128
I wonder if they all wanna be popular, too.

123
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,112
Oh, are you new, young man?

124
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:49,872
Huh?

125
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:52,032
Then you need to get up on stage.

126
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,303
Why would I do that?

127
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:54,327
Come on, now.

128
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:55,580
Hurry, hurry!

129
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,990
Heave ho, heave ho!

130
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:01,898
I have no idea what's going on.

131
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,840
Mob? Is that you?

132
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,797
Do you recognize me?

133
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:07,914
I'm Mezato, from your homeroom class.

134
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:10,636
Whoa, I've never talked to her before.

135
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,293
Did they lure you in?

136
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,160
Well, actually...

137
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:13,790
He's here!

138
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:15,649
It's Master Dimple!

139
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,358
Let me ask you...

140
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,855
Are you laughing?

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,761
Are you warmed up now?

142
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:36,478
Why don't we take off these masks, then?

143
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,700
Sparkle!

144
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:43,617
You're all smiling so brightly.

145
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:50,900
Man, what a creepy bunch this is.

146
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:55,221
And stop!

147
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,660
Today, we have three new
smile-mates joining our congregation.

148
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,163
Give them a hand!

149
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:03,931
What? "Smile-mates"?

150
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:05,603
Hey, what's the big idea?

151
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:09,306
In order to openly accept the gift of happiness,

152
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:11,806
you must lower your walls and set your hearts free.

153
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:15,216
They're locked up, you see. Imprisoned in your own body.

154
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:16,773
Get it?

155
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:18,777
It's completely obvious why you're unhappy.

156
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,683
You aren't laughing!

157
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:23,773
The key to your freedom is laughter!

158
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:26,943
Do so, even in pain, and your hearts will be unlocked!

159
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,415
And once they have been set free, your
hearts will have the ability to accept happiness

160
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,503
as it comes your way.

161
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:38,653
Like our brethren here already know.

162
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:41,354
To have a happy life, you must have a hearty laugh!

163
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,163
That is the teaching of LOL.

164
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:48,473
Huh. You really think people can
be happy just by laughing? Get real.

165
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,761
Who might this be?

166
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:52,826
We found him sleeping on a
park bench under some newspapers.

167
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:55,550
How sad. A victim of the recession!

168
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:56,910
You poor soul.

169
00:08:56,956 --> 00:09:00,218
No wonder you lost your smile. But worry not!

170
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:03,598
Let's put on this smile mask and fix that.

171
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,263
Hey, what are you...?

172
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,274
Wait a minute!

173
00:09:06,521 --> 00:09:08,680
This is the road to salvation.

174
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:13,032
I assure you, we want nothing more than to make you smile.

175
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:15,654
Huh?

176
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,064
No resistance.

177
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:20,110
And, that brings us to the girl.

178
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,949
It appears you have something to say.

179
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:26,268
This religious order, LOL...

180
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:28,392
It was established last month?

181
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:33,453
How did you manage to attract this many
followers in such a short time? I don't believe it!

182
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:35,610
Oh? And you are...?

183
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:37,773
I'm Mezato, Year 2, Class 1!

184
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,707
Salt Middle School's ace reporter!

185
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:43,216
I'm here to investigate the bad
rumor concerning this organization.

186
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,400
"Bad rumor," you say?

187
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,765
That you're using hypnosis to brainwash people,

188
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,603
then forcing them to join your cult.

189
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:54,338
What nerve, saying that after
sneaking in by herself. Splendid.

190
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:56,590
Let me provide you with proof, then.

191
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:59,010
Please take a look at that gentleman from earlier.

192
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:02,244
As you recall, moments ago, he was a very sad man.

193
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:03,777
Sparkle!

194
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:07,212
Now, look at that smile!

195
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,473
He's laughing. Why?

196
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,111
He has finally let go and is truly grasping happiness.

197
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,580
So, what do you think now, young lady?

198
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,359
He didn't really do anything bad, I'll give him that.

199
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,269
I'm sure you'll find a job now!

200
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:26,393
But something still stinks about all this.

201
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,681
There's a strange feeling in the air here.

202
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,158
I guess the rumors I heard weren't true!

203
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,351
My mistake!

204
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,271
So, if you'll excuse me, I'll just be...

205
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:36,558
That won't do.

206
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:42,168
You infiltrated LOL, doubting our smiles for no
reason, insulting our beliefs and our congregation.

207
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,723
I-I know, and I'm terribly sorry.

208
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:46,822
I won't write about you in the school paper.

209
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:48,715
That is not enough!

210
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,338
For it will not ease our hard feelings!

211
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,309
We won't let you leave until you laugh.

212
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,282
I...

213
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:57,297
I don't really feel like laughing now.

214
00:10:57,452 --> 00:11:00,018
A-And if I forced myself to right here on the spot,

215
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:01,604
it wouldn't be sincere at all!

216
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,830
Start smiling. I insist you do!

217
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,215
No way! I don't wanna lie to myself like that.

218
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:09,482
H-Hey!

219
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:13,045
What is this?!

220
00:11:13,846 --> 00:11:15,718
H-Huh? I'm...

221
00:11:16,797 --> 00:11:18,750
No! Don't! No!

222
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,431
Sparkle!

223
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:25,339
Look at that magnificent smile! I just love it!

224
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:26,123
Congratulations!

225
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:26,956
You've changed.

226
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:29,647
No, please... No... I can't!

227
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:32,168
What is this feeling that's come over me?

228
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:36,333
We're all smiling, and it feels really nice.

229
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,587
But no!

230
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:39,259
I don't actually want to smile!

231
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:42,721
I can't control it! Somebody save me!

232
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:44,885
Um, excuse me.

233
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:46,211
Mob!

234
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,959
So the theme here is smiling and happiness?

235
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,345
It doesn't have anything to do with being popular?

236
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,018
May I leave now, then?

237
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,625
Who is that?

238
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,498
I found him looking troubled on his way
home from school, so I brought him here.

239
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,937
He's having some problems with his love life.

240
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,810
Well, maybe...

241
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:05,361
But this isn't gonna help.

242
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,296
He's not smiling!

243
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:09,780
Does that mean the smile mask didn't work on him?

244
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,540
Huh? He's not smiling?

245
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:13,265
Later.

246
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:15,470
W-Wait a minute!

247
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,015
Wanna spend the rest of your life with that frown?

248
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:19,562
You are missing out!

249
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,481
Hm.

250
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:28,146
My dad once told me that "people who've never
smoked before are missing out on half of their lives."

251
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:29,959
It made me realize

252
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,167
people define "missing out" differently.

253
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:35,007
That's not what I'm talking about.

254
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:39,995
LOL is the starting line for me to
become the religious leader of all humanity!

255
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,605
I can't let this stupid kid mess this up for me!

256
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:44,998
You misunderstand.

257
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:48,348
I simply want you to know just how
wonderful it is to smile, that's all.

258
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,935
It's okay, don't worry about it.

259
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:53,375
Th-Then would you like to play a game before you leave?

260
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,454
A staring contest competing
with three of my smile leaders.

261
00:12:57,863 --> 00:13:01,704
You'll all drink some milk, and the
first to laugh and spit it up loses.

262
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:02,911
What do ya say?

263
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:05,511
Mob, no! It's a trap!

264
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:16,863
Are you two ready?

265
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,697
If ya laugh, ya lose.

266
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:20,834
Why did you accept the challenge?!

267
00:13:21,096 --> 00:13:23,884
It just so happens, Mob loves milk.

268
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:27,394
Ready... go!

269
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:35,929
What? Why?!

270
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,309
Go!

271
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,070
Impossible...

272
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:44,325
Pfft. Those two are pathetic.

273
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:46,083
With my smiling powers,

274
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:49,005
I'll throw him into a smiley
maelstrom the likes of which...

275
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:52,280
Ah, I see!

276
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:55,910
Forcing my congregation to laugh all the time backfired!

277
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:59,056
I won, so I'm gonna head home.

278
00:13:59,081 --> 00:13:59,782
Wait!

279
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:03,450
You'll have to face me, now!

280
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:04,836
What?

281
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,818
The Master Dimple is gonna face him?

282
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:09,846
I will not let you win, you little troublemaker.

283
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,121
I will make you spit out that milk!

284
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:15,255
Ready, go!

285
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:21,693
Of course, this time...

286
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:26,256
...the milk has a little extra kick to it.

287
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:29,335
Ha, ha! He laughed!

288
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,224
He laughed!

289
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:33,476
We expect nothing less from Master Dimple!

290
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:35,859
Even I'm starting to have fun right now.

291
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,912
No, you're wrong.

292
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,525
That wasn't laughter.

293
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,956
What the...?

294
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,067
Where's my smile?

295
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,303
Wait a minute... why am I here again?

296
00:14:57,642 --> 00:15:00,257
Oh, yeah! Because it's so much fun!

297
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:02,350
Wait. Did you...?

298
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:03,762
No...

299
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:06,996
He couldn't possibly have undone my hypnosis.

300
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,400
But why can't I make him laugh?

301
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:11,060
I have no choice.

302
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,996
I'll have to go all out.

303
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:15,488
My brethren! Please!

304
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:18,598
We must all work together to save
the laughter trapped within him!

305
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:20,412
He can't stay this way!

306
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,722
How wonderful!

307
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:24,702
Let us laugh together!

308
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:26,259
Hey! Wait a minute!

309
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,208
What are you doing?

310
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:28,181
You see?

311
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:31,265
You don't have a single enemy
here, so why are you fighting?

312
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:33,943
We only want to save you from yourself.

313
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,148
Come on already, get a clue.

314
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,028
Hey, Mob.

315
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:43,803
Why do you always look so bored all the time?

316
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:44,429
Huh?

317
00:15:44,763 --> 00:15:46,847
If you are, then just go home.

318
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:49,056
I-I'm not bored. I promise!

319
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,248
Hey, guys!

320
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,574
You're the only one who's not laughing!

321
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:56,285
Come on, Mob.

322
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:58,442
Tsubomi...

323
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:00,522
Get a clue already.

324
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:06,526
You leave me little choice.

325
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:08,810
I'm forced to show you my true power.

326
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,906
Now, start laughing!

327
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:14,471
There it is!

328
00:16:16,146 --> 00:16:18,587
Master Dimple's divine power!

329
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:21,931
What?

330
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,092
Why?!

331
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:26,721
Why aren't you laughing?!

332
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,864
Are you trying to tell me that
my powers don't work on you?

333
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:31,846
Laugh! Come on, you little brat!

334
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:33,963
Laugh it up already!

335
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:36,793
I see. He has psychic powers, too.

336
00:16:37,183 --> 00:16:39,574
What the hell?! Are you a corpse?!

337
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:42,113
Your powers can't make me laugh.

338
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,482
It's not like I'm fighting it. I just can't, okay?

339
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,783
Even if I really wanted to.

340
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:53,215
But I don't mean anything bad by it at all.

341
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:56,589
I see. So that's it.

342
00:16:56,816 --> 00:17:00,862
Heh. You must not have any emotions brat.

343
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:04,409
They mentioned that you were having troubles with love.

344
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:09,453
With a personality such as yours, you
won't be able to laugh with the girl you like.

345
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:14,029
When feelings are shared, typically,
they're physicalized in some way.

346
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:17,066
But you're not able to do that, are you?

347
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,758
You'll never laugh together, cry
together, or be moved emotionally in any way.

348
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:24,458
You'll be alone forever.

349
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,505
This is it, boy.

350
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,375
I'll give you one last chance!

351
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:32,048
Now, laugh!

352
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,087
Ha, ha!

353
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:38,295
Why don't you make me laugh with your psychic powers.

354
00:17:41,248 --> 00:17:43,277
Ah... I see now.

355
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,684
So you have similar abilities...

356
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:51,949
I specifically chose to start up a peaceful religious
order so the least amount of blood would be shed.

357
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:54,116
But you're in my way, brat.

358
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,578
I have to get rid of the outsider
who brought in all this chaos!

359
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,005
Thank goodness.

360
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,618
You're not even a person.

361
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:06,895
I'm glad that the one who said something as
horrible as "get a clue" was an evil spirit.

362
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,770
My followers!

363
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:13,747
Do not let him leave this place alive!

364
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:15,747
A strong commanding signal.

365
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:24,970
Come on, Mob.

366
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:28,727
Get a clue already.

367
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:31,453
He is an esper,

368
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,186
blessed with psychic abilities.

369
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,041
A grade schooler called "Mob" by those around him.

370
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:39,981
Even though these tremendous
powers have been bestowed upon him,

371
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:44,373
subconsciously he's always
avoided displaying these abilities.

372
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:47,870
As he grew older and became more aware,

373
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:51,813
he came to realize just how dangerous his powers were.

374
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:56,479
When people are unable to act or to do as they please,

375
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:00,993
or to truly express themselves,
their emotions come to a halt.

376
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:04,130
While attempting to spare the world around him,

377
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:06,522
Mob's aversion to using his powers

378
00:19:06,642 --> 00:19:08,384
has become a complex.

379
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:14,698
The emotions locked away deep inside his
heart expand little by little, moment by moment.

380
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:20,690
However, there's a limit to how much his
emotions can take before leaking out and going wild.

381
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:25,748
And now, an emotion is swirling around
inside him like a torrential hurricane,

382
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,295
going past the limit.

383
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,038
That emotion... is rage.

384
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,341
To think you were such a powerful esper.

385
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:44,158
No wonder the smile mask didn't work.

386
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,305
Didn't work?

387
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,644
So the mask itself had a trick, too...

388
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:50,665
I didn't even notice the hex because it was so weak.

389
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:52,465
Meh, whatever.

390
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:56,064
If the policy of your religion is to kill outsiders,

391
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,236
come at me with everything you've got.

392
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:02,377
You might find that task a hell of
a lot easier than making me laugh.

393
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:05,248
"Come at me with everything you've got"?

394
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:13,422
I'm only going to need about two
seconds to make you disappear, brat!

395
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,738
Emotionless livestock!

396
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:21,096
Don't act like you're actually angry!

397
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,393
You should try to cry!

398
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:32,206
Oh, ho, ho! Flashy.

399
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,425
What the hell?!

400
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:43,230
I'll be damned, kid.

401
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:49,595
Never thought I'd have to fight anyone
with the fullest extent of my power.

402
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:54,078
You may be the real thing, brat, but it's time to die!

403
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:58,909
What?! No way!

404
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:10,326
Y-You're...

405
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,648
I only allowed them to come out upon your request.

406
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:16,066
This is what happens when I let them show.

407
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,828
These are my emotions. Satisfied?

408
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:21,281
You some kind of monster?!

409
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:26,165
Enough! Wraither Beam!

410
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:31,102
Yes! A direct hit!

411
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:37,533
The number of fights I've endured is what
will decide the victor and the loser here!

412
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:44,382
I'm...

413
00:21:46,444 --> 00:21:47,463
...terrible.

414
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:01,644
So, you wanna be able to get a clue, huh?

415
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:05,227
Well, social skills like that are
beyond your level of comprehension.

416
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:08,681
Only ones capable of them have
common sense and experience.

417
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:11,871
And, after all, your whole existence makes no sense, so...

418
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,035
Hey, come on.

419
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:15,923
Why are you bummed out about this now?

420
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:18,073
Because I'm always such a downer.

421
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,551
This time, I ruined a whole bunch of people's fun.

422
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:26,245
Hah! Who says their fun has to be the same as your fun?

423
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:27,485
Look.

424
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:29,635
You're the protagonist of your own life.

425
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:32,728
I hear what you're saying.

426
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:35,618
But still, that whole group is gone now because of me.

427
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,068
And all they were doing was laughing.

428
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:42,543
Well, your inability to get a clue is pretty destructive.

429
00:22:44,915 --> 00:22:46,357
Come on, what happened?

430
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:47,697
You can tell me all about it.

431
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:52,222
Huh? What were we just doing?

432
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:54,452
Master Dimple's passed out.

433
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:56,046
Did he always look like that?

434
00:22:56,966 --> 00:23:01,675
I seem to remember him trying to make some
boy smile, but it just wasn't gonna happen.

435
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:02,699
Yeah...

436
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:03,861
Who was that kid?

437
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,052
Let's look for him.

438
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:07,367
He might be the true messenger of God!

439
00:23:09,707 --> 00:23:11,001
Ah, I see...

440
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:13,625
Some kind of typical mind control scheme, huh?

441
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:15,251
That's not salvation.

442
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:17,144
He just wanted all of them to depend on him.

443
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:22,058
It's a popular con based on crowd
psychology, usually aimed at the weak-willed.

444
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,559
But with powers like yours, it didn't work.

445
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:25,486
Oh...

446
00:23:25,843 --> 00:23:28,216
Which means you accomplished something pretty special!

447
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:32,540
Today, you were able to save a group
of people that only you could have saved.

448
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:34,026
So, you should be proud of yourself.

449
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:42,810
Shige, wake up! You're gonna be late.

450
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:49,093
Good morning.

451
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,987
Lovely day, isn't it, partner?

452
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:52,967
Huh?

453
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,647
Mob gets dragged into an idiotic event

454
00:23:57,672 --> 00:23:59,069
run by idiots for idiots.

455
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:01,893
The one who appears before him
is a violent yet handsome guy.

456
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:03,199
What are you gonna do, Mob?!

457
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:07,206
Next time on Mob Psycho 100,
Episode 4: "Idiots Only Event Kin."

458
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:09,760
You're gonna buy the DVD? That's an excellent decision!
