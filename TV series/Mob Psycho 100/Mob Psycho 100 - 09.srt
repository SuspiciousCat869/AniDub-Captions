1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,733
Guess we ran into more trouble than expected.

2
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:05,015
You mean you did.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,496
Whatever! You only had wimpy-looking ones to deal with.

4
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:12,643
I'm amazed this one actually managed to hurt you, Koyama.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,474
He might get special treatment.

6
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:16,600
No, it wasn't him.

7
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:19,964
Another guy got in my way, and he was freakin' tough.

8
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:22,935
What? You're saying you encountered another esper?

9
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:23,832
Yeah.

10
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:26,271
His psychic abilities were really strong for a kid.

11
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:29,071
I couldn't match him in power, so I used your spray.

12
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,995
And where is that kid?

13
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:33,310
He wasn't part of the mission, so I left him.

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,073
This is why I didn't wanna pair up with you.

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,760
Huh?

16
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:38,808
What's that?

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,877
Though he may not've been your target,
our orders are to make abducting kids

18
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:44,518
with the strongest psychic powers our top priority!

19
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:47,610
If the division leader found
out that you messed up like this...

20
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,043
This all sounds very interesting, indeed.

21
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:54,230
Just fill me in on the situation.

22
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:55,745
We'll handle it ourselves.

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,380
I'll make sure the division
leader never hears a peep about this.

24
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,324
This is the worst person to overhear us.

25
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:42,830
Pardon me for asking, Terada, but wouldn't
it be better to bring the other Scars here?

26
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,665
No. I'm all that's needed for this one.

27
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:48,896
Koyama's an idiot, but he is powerful.

28
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:51,094
As an enemy, that kid'll be a handful.

29
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:54,695
If he joins us, he'll likely
surpass me, which is not an option.

30
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:57,212
So I don't consider this a mission.

31
00:02:57,305 --> 00:03:00,010
We're just gonna go nip a little trouble in the bud.

32
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:02,593
Oh. And this is a secret, by the way.

33
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,002
Let's say we're gonna capture him, got it?

34
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,505
Yes. Understood.

35
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,558
What do you wanna do, Kageyama?

36
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:12,293
This is a big organization. Well-run too.

37
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:13,515
If you ask me,

38
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:17,043
I think you're going to need somebody
pretty special on your side for this.

39
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:18,125
What do you mean?

40
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:20,710
Somebody strong and extremely smart.

41
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:23,545
You know, like somebody right under your nose.

42
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:25,479
The Body Improvement Club!

43
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:28,045
Come on. There's no need for you to play the fool here.

44
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,287
I'm talking about me! So let's team up for this one.

45
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:33,322
Yeah? You sure, Hanazawa?

46
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,503
That came from outta nowhere, didn't it?

47
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:38,852
Look, I'm going to end up
clashing with Claw again someday.

48
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:42,648
So I figured I should do it now while I
still have a fighting chance against them.

49
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:45,914
And by fighting chance, I mean you.

50
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:49,715
You get serious about this, and there's no way we'd lose.

51
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:51,018
How can you say that?

52
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:53,110
We don't even have a clue where to start.

53
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:55,213
Please! Let me help, too!

54
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:56,925
If there's anything you need, let me know!

55
00:03:57,218 --> 00:03:58,628
That won't be necessary.

56
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:01,305
I'm confident that the next attacker

57
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:02,887
will be here any second.

58
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,884
But that's no good at all! You should hurry and...

59
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:07,358
Hm?

60
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,629
Well, that was quicker than I thought.

61
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,490
I'm looking for Kageyama.

62
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,831
Now which one of you would that be?

63
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,165
Let's ask him some questions.

64
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,050
Do you think Terada can win against that kid?

65
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,588
Come on, I'm stronger than that guy.

66
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:27,231
That's not what I'm asking you.

67
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:29,281
I wanted to know if he could win.

68
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:32,118
Well, Terada's always been cautious.

69
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,645
As strong as that kid was, he was still only a kid.

70
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,692
If I hadn't let my guard down, I
could've squashed him from the get-go.

71
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:42,502
Terada will probably be fully prepared.

72
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,297
So if you ask me,

73
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,915
that kid's probably gonna go through some harsh torture.

74
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,671
Hurry up and spit it out.

75
00:04:54,696 --> 00:04:56,620
I let my guard down!

76
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,143
He's tired.

77
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:01,617
Why don't you let him catch his
breath and relax with a sip of water?

78
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,337
Do you have any idea how cruel that suggestion is?

79
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:07,314
You don't have to be nice to scum like these clowns.

80
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,244
But either way, it seems like this guy won't talk.

81
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,223
Guess Claw's elite, the Scars, live up to their name.

82
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,518
Despite fighting the boss and ending up with a scar,

83
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:19,130
their abilities were acknowledged,

84
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:20,992
and they became part of the upper echelon.

85
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:26,929
And then this guy Terada heard about the kid who gave
another Scar member, Koyama, some trouble and showed up.

86
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,298
Tough break, man. You ended
up being captured and tortured.

87
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:33,960
Now, if you feel you're in danger,
tell us what you know, quickly.

88
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:35,466
I did! I did!

89
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:38,876
Everything you just said to me is
from the information that I gave you!

90
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:39,460
True.

91
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:40,852
We know about their hideout,

92
00:05:40,877 --> 00:05:44,204
the names, as well as the abilities,
of all the other Scar members,

93
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:46,181
and a few other things on top of that.

94
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:47,334
Maybe...

95
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:50,342
But I find it hard to believe
he'd tell us everything so easily.

96
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,010
Come on, kid. Gimme a break.

97
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:55,205
What's the hold up?

98
00:05:55,771 --> 00:06:00,943
It's past the time for our regular upper echelon
meeting, yet only 7 out of the 11 are even here.

99
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:01,823
What a joke.

100
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,038
You've gotta wonder about Claw's management system.

101
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:06,617
Terada knew about this and left anyway.

102
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:08,077
So he should be fired!

103
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,147
Need I remind you that you two just showed up?

104
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:14,084
He's right. Makes you about 30 minutes late.

105
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:17,872
This group is comprised of numerous
people who have never worked well with others.

106
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:21,357
As long as we do what we need to
do when we need to do it, it's fine.

107
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,393
Ha! Then I guess you're out, Koyama.

108
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:27,298
Heard you got your ass kicked by a middle-schooler.

109
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:30,699
I didn't lose. And I completed my mission.

110
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,004
You really are a simpleton, you know that?

111
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,377
I suggest you stop playing
around with these macho games and...

112
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:37,646
Shut your mouth, fugly!

113
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:39,429
I'll kill you, you pierced chicken.

114
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:40,074
What?

115
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:43,964
Koyama. Go and take a seat. The division leader is here.

116
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,838
Hope you weren't waiting long.

117
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:50,643
I just got a message from the boss.

118
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,695
He's coming back to Japan next month.

119
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:55,657
From what I've gathered, he's
going to pick a couple of you

120
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,852
to be the upper echelon back at HQ.

121
00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:59,839
What? Are you serious?

122
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:02,597
Yes, but it seems doubtful he'd pick you,

123
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:05,151
considering how badly you messed up today.

124
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:08,452
That's right!

125
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:10,764
Basically, our goal is world domination.

126
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:13,750
A skilled hawk can hide its claws until the last second,

127
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:14,870
but we're not like that.

128
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:17,655
We're more like badass hawks who don't hide our claws!

129
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,698
'Cause of that, we'll steal all we
can, stand at the top of the world,

130
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,713
and lead humanity into its rightful and glorious future!

131
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:26,417
Sound good? Anyone wanna join us?

132
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:27,945
Any of you guys?

133
00:07:28,252 --> 00:07:29,187
What morons.

134
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:32,822
Listen up, you cocky Natural brats.

135
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:36,005
I wouldn't underestimate the power
of your trainers, if I were you.

136
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:39,383
Remember, you noobs haven't even
been acknowledged as members yet!

137
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:40,676
It's not a done deal!

138
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:45,260
Are you the person in charge here?

139
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,415
No one in our group has psychic powers.

140
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:50,585
This is a big misunderstanding, so please let us go.

141
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:55,560
Did you all make a secret agreement to act
as though you don't have any psychic powers

142
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,628
in the hopes that you would be freed?

143
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:02,285
Very well... You, come out here.

144
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:05,988
The younger Shiratori brother.

145
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,320
You have ten seconds.

146
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:11,440
Now show me your powers.

147
00:08:11,678 --> 00:08:12,606
Be quick.

148
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:17,560
Don't do it.

149
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:22,323
All right. I understand.

150
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:26,464
Come. Nobody holds out on me.

151
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:27,544
K-Kaito!

152
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,938
They're gonna try to brainwash us one by one.

153
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:35,965
Why is this happening?

154
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,258
I just wanna go home!

155
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:44,560
Daichi, help!

156
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:46,829
Save me!

157
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:50,771
Huh? Oh, no! What happened?

158
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:52,975
No... Kaito...

159
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,221
Wh-What have they done to you?

160
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,347
H-He's dead...

161
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:14,928
This will happen to all of you.

162
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:18,143
Take the evening to reconsider your attitudes.

163
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,652
If you value your pathetic lives.

164
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,243
I see it. It's that building, right?

165
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:36,920
Yes. That's it.

166
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:39,917
These powers can't be coming from a child.

167
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:46,661
Okay. We should go the rest of the way on foot.

168
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:51,547
Terada's getting away.

169
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:52,848
Should we go after him?

170
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:54,055
Hmm...

171
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:58,098
Considering how badly we beat
him, I doubt he'll defy us again.

172
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:02,215
It'd just be a waste of time, so let's
continue on inside and save your little brother.

173
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:05,866
Stupid brats.

174
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:09,954
You'll pay with your lives for
mocking me and trampling my pride!

175
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:12,946
Telekinetic control.

176
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:16,065
Air Whips!

177
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:22,206
With a range of 60 meters, my powers will
display their true potential here among the trees!

178
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:37,327
Kageyama! Are you all right?!

179
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,168
Yeah, but that startled me.

180
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:42,869
Where'd these trees come from?

181
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:45,115
It's that Terada guy.

182
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,714
He said he used telekinetic powers in the shape of whips.

183
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:50,069
Say your prayers, brats!

184
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:51,352
Terada!

185
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,774
If I let you escape me and
infiltrate the facility like this,

186
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,669
my reputation will be ruined!

187
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:03,434
I've got you now, punk!

188
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:14,006
Well, I guess you aren't so lame after all.

189
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:15,792
Oh, crap!

190
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:20,877
My powers are pretty impressive, huh?

191
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,746
How long can you keep this up?

192
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,605
Kageyama!

193
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,380
I have to focus on keeping these trees away from me.

194
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:28,320
Do something!

195
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,372
I guess there're a lot of ways to use powers.

196
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:46,581
Apparently, in the face of absolute
power, technique and finesse don't mean much.

197
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:50,091
You were finished as soon as
Kageyama considered you an enemy.

198
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,501
This battle will only last one night.

199
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:01,085
Let's escape.

200
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:02,288
Come on, man!

201
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:05,685
You saw what happened! If we defy them, we're all dead!

202
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,590
Can't stop thinking about it. Blood everywhere...

203
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:10,490
Shut up! Just stop it.

204
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:14,124
If they're gonna torture me, and brainwash me later,

205
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:16,787
I'd rather risk my life trying to escape.

206
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:20,102
Maybe, but Shiratori's still grieving over his brother.

207
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,188
It'll take him a while to get over this.

208
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:25,691
Shiratori, help us escape from this place.

209
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:26,943
Have a heart, dude!

210
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,522
Sure. I wanna get outta here, too.

211
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:30,257
Uh?

212
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:32,305
Apparently, my younger brother is fine.

213
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:34,527
We're telepaths, remember?

214
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,710
We can communicate with each
other even if one of us is far away.

215
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,478
I was talking to him just now.

216
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:44,568
He said that he was shown a glimpse of
all of our bodies, bloody and lifeless.

217
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:50,165
I'm not completely sure how it works, but I think
that guy has hypnotic powers that show us illusions.

218
00:12:50,485 --> 00:12:53,066
Must be how this organization brainwashes people.

219
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:54,079
Through fear.

220
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:56,987
Good thing he chose to take my brother.

221
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,956
'Cause together we saw through their tricks.

222
00:12:59,018 --> 00:13:00,377
So he's alive.

223
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:04,501
Yeah, but that doesn't change the
fact that these people are dangerous.

224
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:07,251
And that's exactly why we need to get out of here.

225
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,266
Let's make our move tonight.

226
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:13,107
Those trainers still underestimate
us, and we should take advantage of that.

227
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:16,493
Wait. Hey, what're you guys talking about over there?

228
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:19,898
They must be workin' on their escape plan.

229
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,806
Yeah whatever. They're not gonna go anywhere.

230
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:25,085
Not the best time for this, but...

231
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:25,983
What's wrong?

232
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:29,947
Well, before I tell you all of
my plans, I just wanted to know...

233
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:31,946
Uh...

234
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,954
What're your names again?

235
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:39,409
For real? Man! You don't even remember
our names? What's wrong with you?!

236
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:42,710
You always were hard to read
with that gloomy face of yours.

237
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,391
But that is kinda rude.

238
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:46,058
Now, now...

239
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,932
Let's put that behind us and introduce ourselves again.

240
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:50,705
My name is Rei Kurosaki.

241
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,670
And my specialty is clairvoyance.

242
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:53,924
Pleasure to work with you.

243
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,117
Likewise.

244
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:56,727
Takeshi Hoshino.

245
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,351
I have some super strong telekinetic powers.

246
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:01,002
Go Asahi.

247
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:04,839
I'm known as the godsend who's able
to burn down everything in his path.

248
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:06,254
By whom, exactly?

249
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,300
I look forward to working with you.

250
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,648
My name is Daichi Shiratori.

251
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:13,482
Kaito's my little brother who got taken away from us.

252
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:16,784
Let's hurry up and rescue Kaito,
then get the hell outta here.

253
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:20,265
But do you have any kind of plan? We'll need one.

254
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,640
And don't forget, the trainers are right over there.

255
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:26,790
I think they already know we're
trying to pull off some sort of escape.

256
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:29,552
I'm sure there were other kids
who tried to do the same thing.

257
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:32,602
That would mean they're used
to dealing with escape attempts.

258
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:35,187
There goes any chance we had of leaving this place.

259
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:36,310
Not necessarily.

260
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:39,755
If they're still underestimating
our powers, then we can get outta here.

261
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,928
Really? How?

262
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:43,810
They probably let their guard down 'cause we're kids.

263
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:46,160
They didn't check our belongings.

264
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,414
A spoon? So do you just carry that around everywhere?

265
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:53,522
Ignite!

266
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,792
Now, Hoshino!

267
00:14:57,894 --> 00:14:58,599
All right!

268
00:14:58,684 --> 00:14:59,440
There!

269
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:07,495
Oh, it opened.

270
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:09,275
That was easier than I thought.

271
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,268
Well done, brats. What's your next move? Huh?

272
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:15,100
Can't wait to hear about it.

273
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,635
Crap. Kageyama? What now?

274
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:20,349
Let me warn you; It's safer in that cell.

275
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:23,277
Take one step outside of there and you'll regret it.

276
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:25,091
Kageyama?

277
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,523
You had a plan for all this, didn't you?

278
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:30,728
Let's use Hoshino's super strong telekinesis

279
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:33,155
and Asahi's fire power to get outta here.

280
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:34,208
Uhh...

281
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,614
Isn't that adorable?

282
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,579
Listen, man...

283
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,941
You can't move something as heavy as a
person with telekinesis. It's impossible!

284
00:15:44,221 --> 00:15:48,391
I might be a pyrokinetic genius, but even
I can't set fire to something that's moving.

285
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,697
Really sorry about this.

286
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:51,585
I'll take care of it, then.

287
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:52,771
Huh?

288
00:15:58,502 --> 00:16:01,131
Ha, ha. You'll all be held responsible.

289
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,094
If you think we're gonna hold back on
you 'cause you're kids, you're mistaken.

290
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,395
I don't think that.

291
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:09,445
The three of you are incompetent, disposable lackeys,

292
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,340
so why would I ever expect you to have common sense?

293
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:14,811
Y-You're gonna be killed, Kageyama.

294
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:17,560
Oh, I see. Tough guy, huh?

295
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:20,426
Well, try protecting yourself with that spoon-bending.

296
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,427
Mr. Natural!

297
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:27,128
Please, powers. Do as I say. I really need you!

298
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:35,961
Wh-Whoa... That's crazy!

299
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:38,576
Guess you didn't even need us to open the lock.

300
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:42,361
No, we needed to show them that
we were limited in our powers.

301
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,216
This is a blind spot for that security camera.

302
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:51,177
Let's have whoever's watching think we're
being disciplined for a while and go rescue Kaito.

303
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:53,958
But even with my powers, I don't know where he is.

304
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:55,258
Kurosaki.

305
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:58,294
At this point, we're gonna
have to rely on your clairvoyance.

306
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,183
Huh? My powers?

307
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:02,493
Can we count on you?

308
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,792
I'll-I'll give it my best.

309
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,325
Oh... Give me a break...

310
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:12,895
There're some tough-lookin' guys by the entrance.

311
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:14,388
What should we do?

312
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:17,811
Shigeo, you really need to think about this.

313
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:19,245
Wanna blow them away?

314
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,200
But we don't know anything about 'em.

315
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,093
Uh. Umm...

316
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:25,863
Uh, let's focus on rescuing Ritsu.

317
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:27,571
That figures.

318
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,684
Okay then.

319
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:30,532
Oh! What's that technique?

320
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:31,936
It's the Air Whips.

321
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,658
I figured them out.

322
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,810
Sorry 'bout that.

323
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:50,555
I'm not sure if you knew this, but it's
easier to possess somebody when they're in shock.

324
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:52,543
You seem used to this, Dimple.

325
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:54,643
Are you a pretty dangerous evil spirit?

326
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:57,206
No, of course not. Right, Shigeo?

327
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,602
He's totally dangerous.

328
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,776
We might've been better off if you'd possessed Terada,

329
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,516
'cause then we could've used of his powers.

330
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:06,444
All espers have their own mental protection.

331
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:09,828
As such, it makes it harder
for evil spirits to possess them.

332
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:11,698
That goes for you guys, too.

333
00:18:12,278 --> 00:18:15,941
Not to mention, I'm in a lot weaker
state of being than usual right now.

334
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:19,254
But normally, I'm able to destroy
people's minds with little effort.

335
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:21,894
Honestly, you weren't a big deal before, either.

336
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,123
Don't you get it?! I was weakened then, too!

337
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:25,471
But why is that?

338
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:27,933
Oh, come on! Because you almost exorcised...

339
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:29,668
Never mind, forget it.

340
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,032
All right! Let's go!

341
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:39,270
Good. The coast is clear. We're counting on you, Kurosaki.

342
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:45,428
We should go this way.

343
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:46,121
Let's move.

344
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:50,204
There, let's keep going.

345
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:51,124
Right.

346
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:56,567
Huh? Who're you guys?

347
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,252
Easy! Are you trying to kill him?

348
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,461
I guess we both hit him at the same time.

349
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,095
Listen up, Kageyama.

350
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:07,737
Leave all these lackey-grunts to me, okay?

351
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:11,029
Now, the first thing we should do is
find out where they're holding your brother.

352
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:13,524
Oh, okay. Sorry...

353
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,316
He's so laid back. It's really starting to throw me off.

354
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:18,625
Identify yourselves!

355
00:19:21,397 --> 00:19:23,298
You abducted some kids, didn't you?

356
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,402
Tell us where they are or you're gonna get it.

357
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:29,065
Okay, okay. The children are in the basement.

358
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:30,389
He said the basement.

359
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:33,222
There we go. That wasn't so hard, now was it?

360
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:34,809
Thank goodness.

361
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,739
You fools. We can hear you over the radio.

362
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:41,739
We got intruders. Go capture 'em.

363
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,227
Hold up. Let's contact the Scars about this.

364
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,230
You never know, they might be espers.

365
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,266
An emergency, huh?

366
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:52,400
It's gotta be him.

367
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:55,096
That means Terada got his ass kicked.

368
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,900
First it was Koyama, and now Terada.

369
00:19:58,607 --> 00:19:59,966
What's goin' on?

370
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,998
Again, I didn't lose to that little twerp, got it?!

371
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:05,573
Terada just rushed into things without thinking.

372
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:08,013
I'll take care of him this time.

373
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:12,466
I'm delighted beyond words to have the
opportunity to face the little runt again so soon.

374
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:15,078
Are you saying we should leave the intruders to you?

375
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:17,880
Yes, exactly! Stay outta my way, you bastards!

376
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:20,824
Don't rush things. There's more
than one intruder to deal with.

377
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:22,155
What does that matter?

378
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,852
You're gonna lose again.

379
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:27,127
Is that so?! You wanna die first, Sakurai?

380
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,015
Stop it. You're both Scars.

381
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,924
That plan is fine, Koyama.

382
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:32,417
Find the intruders.

383
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:36,517
But you won't get away with
losing to the same person twice.

384
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,182
Yeah, I know.

385
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:41,432
At this point, we're up against the clock.

386
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:43,627
Let's split up and look for your brother.

387
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,644
I'll head off to the right.

388
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:48,301
Kageyama, you take the middle. Uh?

389
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:55,335
Lucky us. It looks like the mini boss just showed up.

390
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,400
This guy again? Ah, great.

391
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,642
We meet once more.

392
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,627
I beat the crap outta you, and you can already move?

393
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:04,996
Well, I'm glad you're doin' all right.

394
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:08,219
I'll kill you this time, for sure.

395
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,443
And the rest of you.

396
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:13,420
Now let's both hit him together with our full powers!

397
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,436
We don't have time for all that.

398
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:18,935
Oh, yeah? Is that so?

399
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:22,090
What, are you tryin' to reserve your stamina or somethin'?

400
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,119
You're gonna have to face me.

401
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:31,276
Now die!

402
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:32,981
He's coming! Uh?

403
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:40,648
What...? What's happening?

404
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,416
I can't move a finger.

405
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:04,573
Sorry. Didn't think about that being so noisy.

406
00:22:04,934 --> 00:22:05,806
I see.

407
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,083
You meant that you didn't have
time to try to hold back on him.

408
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:11,800
Didn't expect that from Kageyama.

409
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,375
Koyama's not responding.

410
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:16,885
We're dealing with someone powerful here.

411
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,752
Ha! How pathetic.

412
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,360
Let's go.

413
00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:24,330
It's time to show these intruders the true terror of Claw.

414
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:58,405
Mob infiltrates Claw's hideout
along with Teru and all of his hair,

415
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,811
and the body-possessing Dimple.

416
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:02,043
They end up facing the Scars, who refuse to hold back.

417
00:24:02,123 --> 00:24:03,221
Think you can win this, Mob?

418
00:24:03,246 --> 00:24:07,085
Next time on Mob Psycho 100, Episode
10: "The Heinous Aura Mastermind."

419
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:10,106
Option C involves Blu-rays, manga volumes, and events!
