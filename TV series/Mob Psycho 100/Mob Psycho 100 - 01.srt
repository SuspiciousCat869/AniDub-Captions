1
00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:49,086
Whether you believe it or not,

2
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:54,515
the world around you is filled with strange
phenomena that science has yet to explain.

3
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,591
And in those unfortunate moments
when people come face to face with them,

4
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:02,277
they are helplessly thrown into the dark depths of fear.

5
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:07,782
But, there are those who choose to
fight against the darkness every day

6
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:10,530
shining a ray of hope into that chaos.

7
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:12,845
These warriors opposing the shadows

8
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,811
are called "Psychics."

9
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:17,594
You're in luck!

10
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:20,055
I, Reigen Arataka, shall accept this job!

11
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,066
Oh, my god, really?

12
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,502
Thank you so much!

13
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:25,261
I had no idea who else I could turn to!

14
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:27,009
No one would take me seriously!

15
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,244
There, there. It's okay.

16
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:32,430
Now, the fee for my services will depend
on which course of exorcism you pick.

17
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:34,263
"Which course"?

18
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:36,790
Option A, the trial course, gets you 20 percent.

19
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:38,916
Option B, the serious course, gets you 50 percent.

20
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:42,247
And Option C, the all-out course, gets you a 99 percent...

21
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:43,469
...spirit reduction.

22
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:45,857
A hundred percent guaranteed, certain restrictions apply.

23
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,150
Reduction?

24
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:48,578
How should I put this...

25
00:02:48,605 --> 00:02:50,612
Spirits're kinda like carbon dioxide.

26
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:52,473
So you're saying they're poisonous?

27
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:53,347
That's monoxide.

28
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,686
I mean they occupy a sort of gaseous space.

29
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,934
Makes it a bit difficult to completely get rid of one.

30
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:01,375
That said, have no fear.

31
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:04,670
If it comes back, I'll get rid of it for 20 percent off!

32
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:06,998
Oh! You're so amazing!

33
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:08,555
Hold on a second!

34
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:10,508
Huh? And, who might you be?

35
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,977
Oh, this is Taro. He's my boyfriend.

36
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:15,166
Ah, what a calm fellow!

37
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,541
What's that s'posed to mean?!

38
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:18,708
Stick to the subject.

39
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,450
Listen up, you! This is all super shady!

40
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,427
Uh...

41
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,113
Hanako, you should really reconsider this.

42
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,515
"Super shady," huh?!

43
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,460
I guess I can't blame you for feeling that way.

44
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,315
I mean, all that stuff about nightmares and ghosts?

45
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:34,582
What a stupid story.

46
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:38,770
I wasn't talkin' about her, you
snake-oil salesman! It's you I can't trust!

47
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,890
Just leave everything to me.

48
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:46,087
If I exorcise the spirit, I'm sure
Hanako's face will return to normal, too.

49
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:48,618
There's nothing wrong with her face, you moron!

50
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:50,164
I see.

51
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:54,400
So you've been having these dreams since you
walked through that abandoned building last week.

52
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:55,599
Yes, that's right.

53
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:57,582
They're so scary and creepy.

54
00:03:57,648 --> 00:03:58,783
Here we are, Reigen!

55
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:00,387
It's that building over there!

56
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:06,567
What an unbelievable aura!

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,984
This will be my first big one in a long time!

58
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:12,624
It's right over here.

59
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:14,083
Hold up.

60
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:16,098
Did you just point at the wrong building?

61
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,997
Hh? Ah, so it's that one!

62
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:21,245
Funny story...

63
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,442
An immense aura was coming from that other building, too!

64
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:25,728
These things happen, nature of "the biz."

65
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:28,925
It gets confusing with all these
evil spirits in the world, you know?

66
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:30,817
Ah! Yes, that makes sense!

67
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:31,635
Come on.

68
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,885
There's no way ghosts are hangin' around everywhere.

69
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,830
Oh, no!

70
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,693
A man-shaped evil spirit almost walked through you!

71
00:04:37,718 --> 00:04:38,093
Huh?

72
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:38,418
Phew!

73
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:39,405
What a close call.

74
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:40,964
You can't be too careful these days.

75
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:50,687
The Butt-chin Goblin.

76
00:04:50,712 --> 00:04:52,080
Aw, what are you, eight years old?

77
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,186
Shut your mouth, Taro! You're being rude!

78
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,066
He's the one who's being rude here!

79
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,605
Making fun of people's looks...

80
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,830
Now, now, Hanako...

81
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,375
There're always people like him.

82
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:03,697
Silly skeptics.

83
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,310
Anyway, shall we go?

84
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,337
They say this place is haunted by the
angry spirit of a man who saw a cockroach.

85
00:05:12,464 --> 00:05:15,738
He freaked out and jumped so high,
his head went through the ceiling!

86
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,478
Such a horrific way to go.

87
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:20,223
Get a grip. You believe that horse crap?

88
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:22,566
Ah, I see.

89
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:26,006
Everything's... becoming so clear.

90
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:29,852
He's so serious all of a sudden.

91
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,250
Could there really be...

92
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:34,339
I'm getting creepy vibes.

93
00:05:34,364 --> 00:05:37,100
Even someone like me might not be able to handle it!

94
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:38,771
It's too dangerous!

95
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,334
Cockroaches are terrifying!

96
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:44,407
Huh?

97
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,176
Come on!

98
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,488
There's no way this guy is a psychic!

99
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,061
He's a complete and total fake!

100
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:57,687
How would you like me to haunt your dreams, too?

101
00:05:58,156 --> 00:05:59,692
A ghost!

102
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,557
Maybe I'll use my curse and crash
both your heads through the ceiling.

103
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:09,167
That's the guy who keeps head-butting me in my dreams!

104
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,047
Look!

105
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:12,787
Ugh. He actually appeared.

106
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:14,843
I've got this!

107
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,400
Salt Splash!

108
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:20,392
This is one of Reigen's special attacks,

109
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,968
where he violently throws table salt everywhere.

110
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:26,337
This is just regular old salt, you buffoon.

111
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:28,717
If it's not purified, it's not gonna work.

112
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:31,484
Impossible...

113
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,140
I heard that spirits were totally
weak against any kind of salt!

114
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:38,643
Well, if salt won't melt this guy down,

115
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:40,743
I'll just call my ultimate weapon.

116
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,004
Hey, Mob.

117
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:50,835
Sorry, do you think you could swing by?

118
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:52,662
I'm bein' serious here.

119
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:54,048
Evil spirit's right in front of me.

120
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:57,954
The client and the evil spirit are both
waiting, so you'll need to hurry, okay?

121
00:06:58,664 --> 00:06:59,607
Cool. Thanks.

122
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:00,986
Huh?

123
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:14,549
Hey! Mob!

124
00:07:14,587 --> 00:07:15,535
We were waiting for ya.

125
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,280
Hm?

126
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:19,992
Hmph.

127
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:21,066
Heh.

128
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,260
So after the salt, you're sending in a middle schooler?

129
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,193
Get your...

130
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,150
He is Kageyama Shigeo,

131
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:39,746
also known as Mob.

132
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:44,672
An actual psychic, mentoring under the
questionable expertise of Reigen Arataka...

133
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:48,284
Who also happens to be the protagonist of this story.

134
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,138
Master, I asked you not to summon me on such short notice.

135
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:29,985
Oh, man, you're a lifesaver!

136
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:33,337
Never thought that evil spirit would actually show up.

137
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,900
Here. Your pay for the day.

138
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:38,054
Oh, thank you.

139
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,446
That one today was just a lower-level spirit,

140
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:43,074
so I really shouldn't be paying you more than half.

141
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,670
But, hey, I'm a nice guy.

142
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,683
Think of your full pay as a bonus.

143
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,285
Right...

144
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:47,964
Hm?

145
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:50,070
What's wrong? Are you not okay with that?

146
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:51,062
Oh, no.

147
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:54,240
Just don't know why you called
me to handle such a weak spirit.

148
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:55,126
I mean, ones like that...

149
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:57,152
Uh! You just don't get it.

150
00:09:57,372 --> 00:10:00,620
When you reach my level, you get
so crazy-strong, you end up melting

151
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:03,099
everyone around you during a simple exorcism.

152
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:05,766
That's why I ask you to take care of the weaker ones.

153
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,181
Really? If you say so.

154
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:09,922
I'm also not quite sure what you mean by "melt," either...

155
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,552
Well, of course you don't, idiot!

156
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,432
That's because you lack training!

157
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,520
You need to learn all you can from me, your master!

158
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,344
Your powers are meant to be used.

159
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,890
Not doing so would be a waste.

160
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:22,958
Working for me gives you the
opportunity to help other people

161
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:24,982
and continue training at the same time!

162
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,175
Two birds, one stone!

163
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:29,098
But if you misuse a power such as yours,

164
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:31,550
it can only lead to your own self-destruction.

165
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,595
That's why I'm teaching you how to control your powers.

166
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:36,612
You don't want them to go berserk, do you?

167
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:39,860
Remember your promise.

168
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:43,464
You will not use your psychic powers against other people.

169
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,688
There you go again, always bending spoons.

170
00:10:57,721 --> 00:11:00,176
You really need to stop doing that... it's a bad habit!

171
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,358
Oh, come now, my dear. Shigeo's going through puberty.

172
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:06,712
A young man should be able to bend
a spoon from time to time, right?

173
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:08,694
Sorry.

174
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,144
And there you go, spoiling the boy again.

175
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:13,565
You need to learn a thing or two from Ritsu, Shige.

176
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,380
He got another perfect score on his quiz today.

177
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:18,504
Come on, Mom, anyone can do that.

178
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,343
Listen, if you ever need someone to talk to,

179
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:22,129
let me know.

180
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,582
I'll always be there for my big brother.

181
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,808
Thanks. I appreciate it. Will do.

182
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,589
And, now you're spoiling him as well, Ritsu.

183
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:33,784
The next one you bend gets replaced
using your allowance, you hear?

184
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:34,411
Huh?

185
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:36,183
Sorry, dude. Tough break.

186
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:38,585
You're on your own when it comes to what Mom tells you.

187
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:42,593
Now, you're in a real pickle, aren't ya, Shigeo?

188
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:45,463
'Morning!

189
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:52,322
Right?

190
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:54,020
Good morning, Tsubomi!

191
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,009
Good morning!

192
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:57,816
Beautiful day, isn't it?

193
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,072
Oh! Guess what I saw on TV yesterday.

194
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:01,125
What?

195
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,928
Tsubomi's as cute as ever today.

196
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:07,628
Okay, class.

197
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:09,932
So what would be the answer for this one?

198
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,264
Let's go with Kageyama.

199
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:13,157
Huh?

200
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:14,064
Yes, sir!

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,187
Uh... Um...

202
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:18,539
I have no idea.

203
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:20,153
If you can't solve this,

204
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:22,619
that would mean the only thing
you know how to do is addition.

205
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:24,965
You were asleep, weren't you?

206
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,726
Forget it. Sit down, please.

207
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:32,013
Head's up!

208
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,082
This way!

209
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:35,651
Pass, pass, pass!

210
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:36,684
Go!

211
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:37,416
Stop 'em!

212
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,359
Come on, pass it!

213
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,059
Move!

214
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,590
Hello?

215
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,877
Mob! How goes it?

216
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:52,887
Sorry to call you two days in a row, but
could you come down to the station right now?

217
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,608
Sure. What for?

218
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:55,675
Well...

219
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,266
We've got another job.

220
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,300
And it's a big one.

221
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:00,287
Right. Okay, see you soon.

222
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:14,331
Today's job is from a local neighborhood council.

223
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:17,582
It's over at Honeido Tunnel, along the old highway.

224
00:13:18,226 --> 00:13:20,018
It's a famous haunted place.

225
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,627
The tunnel's always had some shady stories,

226
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:26,818
and though it's been closed for
years, the bad rumors just won't go away.

227
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:31,220
Also, a number of college students and
bloggers have gone there to snoop around a little

228
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,292
and went missing, likely contributing to those rumors.

229
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:36,261
And this is the kicker.

230
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,855
So, it's the site of a huge group accident?

231
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:40,988
Yeah.

232
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:43,201
The incident occurred about 30 years ago.

233
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,583
From what it says here, more than 20 people died at once.

234
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:50,474
The bitter hatred of all those people
must be swirling around that tunnel.

235
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:51,680
Oh...

236
00:14:06,772 --> 00:14:08,147
Stay on your toes, Mob.

237
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,735
Never know what might happen.

238
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,088
Oh, right.

239
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,149
This is it.

240
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:18,059
Well, let's take a look around.

241
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:23,242
I, Reigen Arataka, new star of the
paranormal world, will clean this place up.

242
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:26,434
We're gonna exorcise every last one of them!

243
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,054
What's the big idea?!

244
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,416
What are you doing, student?!

245
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:35,889
You're coming, too!

246
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:38,050
It'll be bad if the sun goes down.

247
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:39,283
Mob, are you listening?

248
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:39,743
Huh?

249
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:41,678
I'm gonna go melt down a big one,

250
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:42,978
so follow me!

251
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:44,178
Okay?

252
00:14:44,264 --> 00:14:45,466
Sure, if you want.

253
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:48,823
You seemed to have it under control, so
I didn't think that you'd need my help.

254
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:50,069
Idiot!

255
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:52,089
Who do you think's gonna ex... Ahem.

256
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:54,388
I mean, this is nothing really,

257
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:56,827
but stick with me so you can learn something.

258
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,812
You're amazing, Master.

259
00:14:59,238 --> 00:14:59,572
Huh?

260
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:02,908
I mean, this tunnel actually seems pretty dangerous.

261
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,317
I can sense the presence of a
very powerful spirit further down.

262
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:10,814
Usually, haunted spots like these end up being fake,

263
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,082
but, this time, it's definitely the real deal.

264
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:17,627
If a normal person happened to anger the spirit in here...

265
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:19,380
What would happen?

266
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,546
They'd never make it out in one piece.

267
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:28,449
Of course they wouldn't.

268
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,760
That's why you and I are going to exorcise it.

269
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:33,749
All right, here we go!

270
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:35,868
Let me take the lead.

271
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:39,581
I'll be counting on you to support
me however you can from behind.

272
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,374
Right.

273
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:47,565
It's kinda chilly down here.

274
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:48,865
Yes, it is.

275
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:50,454
Great.

276
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,389
We forgot to bring flashlights with us.

277
00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:55,412
Master, don't you feel something?

278
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:56,072
Hm?

279
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,452
Well, it is pretty humid in here.

280
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:00,567
No, I'm talking about auras.

281
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,366
Oh, right, that.

282
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,857
My nose is a little stuffy today, so...

283
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:08,568
Does that have anything to do with sensing auras?

284
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,677
When you get to my level, it does.

285
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,729
Do you feel anything down here at all?

286
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,104
"Feeling anything" would be an understatement.

287
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:17,595
There are 12...

288
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:18,983
...18...

289
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:22,066
No, wait, I'd say even more than that.

290
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:23,595
Right nearby us.

291
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:27,150
It looks like we're being surrounded.

292
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,842
They're going to attack us now.

293
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:30,126
All right!

294
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,046
I'll leave the small fry to you.

295
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,086
Go, Mob!

296
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:42,878
Man, that's a lot of noise.

297
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,972
They're really strong, aren't they?

298
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:48,152
Hm. If we were a couple of normal
people, we might have been in real danger.

299
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:50,708
Oh, well, I'm pretty sure that took care of all of them.

300
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,063
Another piece of ca...

301
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:54,958
There's someone right in front of me!

302
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,339
Who are you?!

303
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,913
An evil spirit?!

304
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,726
Oh, it's just a wrestler screwing around in the dark.

305
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:06,505
Don't scare me like that! I
thought you were an evil spirit.

306
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,811
Now, go practice somewhere else.

307
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:10,806
Uh, Master?

308
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:14,991
I'm sure you sense it, but the boss of
the evil spirits is over there, so watch out.

309
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:15,458
Okay?

310
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:16,502
Oh?

311
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,771
Hmph, so you're the boss here, huh?!

312
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:26,058
You may have tried to disguise yourself as a
wrestler, but you can't fool me, you trickster!

313
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,491
You fool!

314
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:32,317
In this tunnel...

315
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,993
When my biker gang and I were driving through it,
the guy in front happened to slip on a banana peel.

316
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:39,726
We all died!

317
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:41,757
And I'm their leader!

318
00:17:42,624 --> 00:17:45,044
Listen up, this tunnel...

319
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:50,505
...is my turf now. Do you understand?!

320
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,024
I'll crush every last intruder!

321
00:17:53,091 --> 00:17:54,082
Here we go!

322
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,142
I curse you!

323
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,599
Cigarette Burn Poltergeist!

324
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:06,136
Wh-What?

325
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,879
My ignition attack... Isn't working!

326
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:09,491
Hmph.

327
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:12,078
A forcefield? No way!

328
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,548
How could this power be coming from someone like him?

329
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:16,710
Oh, crap!

330
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:18,875
I thought this guy was just an average wimp!

331
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:21,197
Too late for regrets now, spirit!

332
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:24,874
The moment you tried to take on
the genius psychic, Reigen Arataka...

333
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:27,502
...was the moment your fate was sealed!

334
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,845
You're gonna be exorcised!

335
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,733
Banishing Salt Punch!

336
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,813
This is one of Reigen's special attacks,

337
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:36,873
where he punches the enemy with
his fist covered in table salt.

338
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,779
Hold on a second. That didn't hurt at all.

339
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:42,639
Oh, dear.

340
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:45,367
So, you are a fake.

341
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,715
I'm disappearing!

342
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,462
W-Wait! Wait!

343
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:53,624
Go back to the ozone layer.

344
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,348
We were just being forced to do this!

345
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,691
Hm?

346
00:18:58,913 --> 00:18:59,502
Uh...

347
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,575
Hey, what are you doing, Mob?

348
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,348
Hurry up and melt him, already.

349
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:04,916
Hold on a minute, Master.

350
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:06,191
Let's hear him out, first.

351
00:19:06,236 --> 00:19:08,002
A-Ah, ah...

352
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:10,390
Sure, I may act tough but neither me

353
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:14,384
nor my gang are anything compared
to the evil spirit down the tunnel.

354
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:18,336
We've been getting orders from him all these
years, and that's why we've been scaring people

355
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:19,681
that come down here.

356
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:20,860
Heh.

357
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:24,570
Do you really think you can fool the likes
of Reigen with such lies, you little speck?!

358
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:26,297
I'm not lying to you!

359
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,604
It's just... If I were to disappear
while being falsely accused...

360
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:32,898
My brothers, the Death Specters,

361
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,048
and I just couldn't take take it!

362
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:37,865
Our memories would never rest in peace!

363
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,321
That's all I wanted to say!

364
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:43,936
Now you can make me disappear, or melt, or whatever!

365
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:47,164
So your big plan is to try to make us pity you?

366
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:48,733
Don't let him fool you, Mob!

367
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:52,456
Those are nothing but the typical lies of a con artist.

368
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:53,316
Melt him.

369
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:55,875
Before that, I'm gonna go have a look.

370
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,548
Huh?

371
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:01,347
It's a little weird that the aura I felt
before coming in here hasn't disappeared yet.

372
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:02,844
Something's still not right.

373
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:03,637
Hm?

374
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,516
I-I thought so, too...

375
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:07,316
Stop him!

376
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:07,742
Huh?

377
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:12,326
No matter how strong that kid may be,
he doesn't stand a chance against it!

378
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:16,977
That thing is an evil spirit that's
lived on this mountain for hundreds of years.

379
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:21,625
Everyone that's died here was
killed by him, you understand?!

380
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:24,772
S-So, you guys were also killed by...

381
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:25,439
No.

382
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:28,400
Like I said, we just happened to slip on a banana peel.

383
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:35,349
You get it now?!

384
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:37,904
If you care for that kid at all, call him back.

385
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:38,984
Hurry!

386
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:44,256
Hey, Mob! Come back!

387
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:47,115
You listening to me? Come back!

388
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:13,905
Mob...

389
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:43,485
Ah.

390
00:21:46,612 --> 00:21:48,339
Oh! You're safe.

391
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,858
Yeah. That evil spirit wasn't very powerful.

392
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:55,561
No way! Wh-Who are you?

393
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:58,333
Huh? Oh, I'm nobody...

394
00:21:58,389 --> 00:21:59,482
You idiot!

395
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:01,930
You're Mob, and you are the student of...

396
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,580
...the new star of the paranormal world,

397
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:05,639
Reigen Arataka!

398
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:07,446
Oh, right. Sorry.

399
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,477
I thank you, Mob.

400
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,534
Now the Death Specters Gang can leave
this tunnel and pass on peacefully.

401
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,836
Oh, could this be yours?

402
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:15,507
Huh?

403
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:18,883
Huh?!

404
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,013
All right, here we go, Boss-man!

405
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:21,961
Yeah!

406
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:32,779
I wanna thank you!

407
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,125
Thanks, dude.

408
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,656
Now we can depart to the afterlife!

409
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:48,761
Mob.

410
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:52,028
Our work here is done. Let's go.

411
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:54,110
Right.

412
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:03,382
By the way, Master...

413
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,188
Huh?

414
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:06,952
Why didn't you do anything back there?

415
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:07,832
Huh?!

416
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:10,473
Uh, well, you know, uh...

417
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,115
A-Ahem...

418
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,694
Didn't I tell you from the beginning

419
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:16,704
that I'd leave the small fries to you?

420
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,228
Oh, right.

421
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:31,104
What do you wanna do?

422
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:32,948
Let's get somethin' to eat.

423
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:34,661
I'm not gonna last until I get home.

424
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,875
Sounds like a plan.

425
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,958
Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we?

426
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:38,952
Sure.

427
00:23:39,222 --> 00:23:41,233
So, does ramen work for you?

428
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:42,079
Uh-huh.

429
00:23:43,108 --> 00:23:43,956
All right, well, if you're gonna add on

430
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,324
chashu pork, limit it to two.

431
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:47,331
Okay.

432
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:50,968
Here ya go.

433
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:58,649
A group of telepaths suddenly
appear and disturb Mob's daily life.

434
00:23:58,674 --> 00:24:00,155
Having doubts about his peaceful youth,

435
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,595
Mob heads into a world of women.

436
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,185
Where's the goal? Which way's tomorrow?

437
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,580
Next time on Mob Psycho 100, Episode 2:
"Doubts About Youth The Telepathy Club Appears."

438
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,879
Watching it in real time?

439
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:09,966
Wise decision.
