1
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:03,453
Hm? What's that?

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:10,132
At the same time that Ritsu was mistaking
Dimple for some sort of creepy-looking balloon...

3
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:14,995
...the rumors going around about Mob,
who had bested Hanazawa, shadow leader

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,932
of Black Vinegar Middle School,
started to take on a life of their own.

5
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,097
"White T Poison"...

6
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:23,185
This was the title given to Mob,

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,907
whose identity had yet to be revealed.

8
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,168
White T Poison...

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,838
I'll be the one to defeat him!

10
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:38,658
I'm gonna defeat this Poison guy
and make him admit that I'm the best.

11
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,714
So the next target is Salt Middle School.

12
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:45,090
White T Poison will make excellent prey.

13
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:47,350
This is my chance to shine.

14
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:51,493
And so, the rumor mill continued churning out of control.

15
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:56,140
The fierce battle to see who would take
down White T Poison was about to begin.

16
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:33,734
Whew! Thanks for the help!

17
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:38,379
Somehow I managed to make it back
from the particle level all by myself.

18
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:41,900
But my spiritual energy was way less than it used to be.

19
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:44,542
So I couldn't get back into the house anymore.

20
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,986
It appears that low-level spirits

21
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:50,597
can't go anywhere near this place
simply because Shigeo lives here.

22
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:52,915
What is that?

23
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:56,011
Some kinda talking jellyfish-looking thing?

24
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:59,170
I know what needs to be done.

25
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:02,709
Huh? Wanna shake hands?

26
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:04,103
I have to exorcise it!

27
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:05,894
Whoa, wait a second!

28
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,620
Stop kneeing me in the face already!

29
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,812
I'm not a threat! I'm Shigeo's friend!

30
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:10,624
You're what?

31
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,331
You could even call me his mentor.

32
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:15,853
I'll let you off the hook this time, because
you were obviously confused and panicked.

33
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,101
But, that aside...

34
00:03:17,508 --> 00:03:19,258
I've got a proposition.

35
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:21,078
How about you and I team up?

36
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:21,971
No thanks.

37
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,495
Hey, let's not be so hasty.

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,130
Wait a second, just hear me out.

39
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:28,258
You've only recently awakened your psychic powers, right?

40
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,643
What? I have psychic powers now?

41
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:35,206
The fact that you can see me is
proof of your newfound abilities.

42
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:36,978
The name's Dimple.

43
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,879
I'm what most people would call a ghost.

44
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:42,973
So are my psychic powers only strong
enough to allow me to see ghosts like you?

45
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,030
Well, I see you haven't realized how to use them, yet.

46
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:48,340
Go ahead.

47
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:51,162
You should be able to do that now, just like your brother.

48
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:53,483
I shouldn't get my hopes up.

49
00:03:56,558 --> 00:03:58,071
Hm? What's the matter?

50
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,778
Doing anything like this is way out of my reach.

51
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
What's with him?

52
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:06,042
Does he have a complex or something?

53
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:07,917
Well, that's understandable,

54
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:09,632
given who his brother is and all.

55
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,188
It... It's... It's not...

56
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,817
I can't do it!

57
00:04:18,145 --> 00:04:20,002
Dimple!

58
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:22,022
It's not bending!

59
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:23,719
Hey, relax, kid.

60
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,026
What the...?

61
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:27,800
Did I do that?

62
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,247
Join me, little Ritsu...

63
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,005
Join me and I'll help you surpass your brother.

64
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:40,300
Surpass... my brother?

65
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:43,177
Is that even possible?

66
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:47,949
I can be more powerful... than Shige?

67
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:51,609
Sure you can if you'll let me use your body.

68
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,453
Ritsu's not eating with us?

69
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,100
I guess he's not hungry.

70
00:04:57,576 --> 00:04:59,735
I wonder what could be wrong with him.

71
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:01,945
Is he upset about something?

72
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:02,911
No...

73
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:05,407
In fact, he seems oddly happy.

74
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:09,834
How do I get to the point
where I can use my powers freely?

75
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:13,465
It's better to actually try them
out, rather than explain, little Ritsu.

76
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,728
Stop calling me that.

77
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:17,270
Fine, then. Plain old Ritsu it is.

78
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:18,852
Now, how 'bout you close your eyes,

79
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,511
and relax your entire body.

80
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:26,770
Prepare for possession, you fool!

81
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:29,490
Now your body's mine for the taking!

82
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,474
Heh, heh!

83
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,227
What?!

84
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,480
I've possessed him, but I can't control him?

85
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,434
Hey, Dimple. Where'd you go?

86
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:43,440
It's because my spiritual powers
have become so weak... Damn it!

87
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:51,342
I heard the student council took care of the problem.

88
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:53,353
You mean with the pervy gang leader?

89
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:54,676
Wow, way to go.

90
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,436
They're the heroes of the school.

91
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,258
Yamazaki, Year 2, Class 4.

92
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:01,885
I'd like a word with you.

93
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,658
Huh? What do you want?

94
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:05,787
Your coat. It isn't buttoned.

95
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:07,641
So what? Buzz off.

96
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:09,872
I can do it.

97
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:13,109
Now, I can use psychic powers, Dimple.

98
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:16,394
That's because I'm helping to regulate their output.

99
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:21,286
But rest assured, these abilities
have always been there, lying dormant.

100
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:26,845
And it's my guess that the reason they came out now
is due to some radical change in your emotional state.

101
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:31,297
Have you endured some
"way-above-average" stress levels lately?

102
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,211
Like pooping your pants in public, or getting
caught peeking into the girls' locker room?

103
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:38,404
What kind of a question is that?

104
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:39,728
I'd never do those things.

105
00:06:39,753 --> 00:06:40,753
I was joking, Ritsu.

106
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:43,971
Don't be so damn serious. Oh...

107
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:44,857
That's right.

108
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,805
You're an honor student, aren't ya?

109
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:50,222
Then, what is it? Did you do something bad?

110
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:54,407
A rumor's going around that you're
stealing the girls' gym clothes.

111
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,828
Huh? The hell are you talkin' about?

112
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:59,197
The student council did some investigating.

113
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:01,328
And what'd we find out, Kageyama?

114
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:03,620
We discovered some of the girl's gym clothes

115
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:05,640
tucked away and hidden in your bag.

116
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,912
What?! You guys are lyin'!

117
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,398
Deny it if you want,

118
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,438
but that may not go so well for you.

119
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:16,861
You see, the school's been
very strict with deviants lately.

120
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,875
But I'm here to offer you a way out of this.

121
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:25,095
Simply admit Onigawara ordered you to do these things.

122
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,952
If you comply, you're merely another victim.

123
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,767
Sound good? Now button up.

124
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,031
Using these and other similar methods,

125
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:36,687
the whole school was cleaned up,

126
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:39,827
turning it into the optimal environment for academics.

127
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:44,995
However, because of the considerably
immoral strategy that was used upon certain

128
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,469
delinquent students to accomplish this outcome,

129
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:51,172
a deep scar would be forever engraved on their lives.

130
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:56,471
And the two student council members saddled
with this task had to live with that burden.

131
00:07:56,937 --> 00:08:01,225
So they either became drunk with power,
feeling a delusional sense of accomplishment,

132
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:04,116
or they suffered greatly.

133
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:06,600
Whoa!

134
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,510
Ritsu, your power's grown even more!

135
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,040
I see, corruption and guilt...

136
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:15,103
Those are the things that become fuel for my powers.

137
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,978
Whatever you're doing, it is working!

138
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:18,745
What's the matter?

139
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,060
Something eating at you?

140
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:23,812
Dimple, you just won't stop talking.

141
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:24,395
Oh?

142
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:27,718
Tell me. If I could control my powers on my own,

143
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:29,738
would I be able to make you disappear?

144
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:33,099
Wait, is his personality changing, too?

145
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:40,915
Whoa! S-Seriously?

146
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,924
Amazing... That's incredible, Kageyama!

147
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,437
Want me to keep going?

148
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,328
If you'd like to see a bigger example,

149
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:48,683
I could fold your car in half.

150
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:49,463
What?!

151
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,400
What in the hell's gotten into him??

152
00:08:58,562 --> 00:08:59,444
Excuse me...

153
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:01,237
May I help you with something?

154
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,258
I heard from Kamuro that you're the one who's
been planting all that false evidence around.

155
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,851
Tell me, are you the one who framed us?

156
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:10,443
I have no idea what you're talking about.

157
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:11,395
Dimple.

158
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:12,343
Leave it to me.

159
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,470
Even if I did do such a thing...

160
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:17,095
Now it's too late.

161
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:21,390
Why, you little... Who in the hell do ya think we are?!

162
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:30,762
That does it! Get him!

163
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:32,588
You're dead meat!

164
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,134
A fight.

165
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:42,342
Scary!

166
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:44,407
But isn't that guy's hair, like, totally amazing?

167
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:45,103
Check it out!

168
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:46,025
You're right!

169
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:46,932
Whoa!

170
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,149
Hey, you there.

171
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:53,394
What's up?

172
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,800
Gah! That's...

173
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,850
I think you've done enough.

174
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:01,379
If you depend on that, you'll get hurt.

175
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,981
You've got the wrong idea about this.

176
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:04,894
I know...

177
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,253
You think you're really special.

178
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:09,719
It's hard looking at someone who
reminds me of the way I used to be.

179
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,112
Consider this a warning.

180
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,648
Don't try to live relying on psychic powers.

181
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:19,092
Are you another esper like me?

182
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:20,975
I have no idea who you are...

183
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:24,339
...but I have no need to take warnings from you.

184
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:26,495
Don't mess with this guy!

185
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:28,182
He's not someone you can beat!

186
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:31,135
I'm sure he's not much different
from the people at the Awakening Lab.

187
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:33,439
I wanna size up our powers.

188
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:35,532
Ritsu?! You idiot!

189
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,091
Don't do it!

190
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:40,135
Why, thank you for the handshake.

191
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:42,831
I'm Teruki Hanazawa. Pleasure.

192
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:45,412
Don't try to fight him!

193
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,453
Let go! Now!

194
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:48,179
Having trouble standing, are you?

195
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,167
You're so young.

196
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,297
Now's your chance! Run for it!

197
00:11:03,645 --> 00:11:06,393
I was surprised at how strong he was, back there.

198
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,143
Maybe it's 'cause his brain's so developed.

199
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:11,465
Could that coincide with his power level?

200
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:14,280
No. His brain's not huge... that was a wig.

201
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:16,319
Though I'm not sure why he was wearing it.

202
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:18,382
I'm so frustrated.

203
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,929
How could I lose to someone other than my brother?

204
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:25,463
Dimple. I wanna get even stronger.

205
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:28,319
So I won't lose to anyone ever again.

206
00:11:30,645 --> 00:11:31,741
Little boy.

207
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,092
Do you have a moment?

208
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:37,046
Huh?

209
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:46,872
This is the Vase of Happiness.

210
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:51,495
A renowned potter put his heart and
soul into making it a one of a kind.

211
00:11:51,582 --> 00:11:54,957
Anyone who buys this item will surely be blessed.

212
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:57,787
Now it normally goes for about 2.5 million yen,

213
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:00,853
but I'll make you a deal: 800,000 yen just for you.

214
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,453
I don't have that kind of money.

215
00:12:02,478 --> 00:12:04,587
Then I'll drop the price to 500,000.

216
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:07,578
Well, I don't have 500,000 yen, either.

217
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:08,804
Running low on funds?

218
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,644
Just call your mommy and ask her.

219
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:14,395
I'm pretty sure my mom also wouldn't buy it.

220
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,161
This isn't over yet, kid.

221
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,511
Hey, why don't you touch it?

222
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:21,062
The grainy texture feels so nice.

223
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:21,610
Here.

224
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:23,058
Er, I can't really tell.

225
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:27,029
That was close.

226
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,187
How did he...?

227
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:31,314
You should be careful.

228
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:34,926
Hey, you broke it.

229
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:37,787
Wait! I-I didn't...!

230
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:39,960
What? You're going to say it was my fault?

231
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,200
Uh... No, but...

232
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:42,519
Look, little boy...

233
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:46,102
Problems that you can solve with money
are better than those that you can't.

234
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,829
Got it?

235
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:51,035
Oh, what a run of bad luck. Did you break that, sir?

236
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,815
Do you have a phone?

237
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:54,638
I-I don't...

238
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,995
That rang at the perfect time.

239
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:59,303
Why don't you answer it?

240
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:02,402
Now what are you doing, Mob?

241
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:04,502
Why'd you make me come down here, anyway?

242
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:06,004
You know I'm taking a meeting soon.

243
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,228
Would you happen to be this boy's guardian, sir?

244
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:11,437
Oh, I get it.

245
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:13,923
It's 5,000,000 yen to replace this.

246
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:16,828
You mean that huge piece of junk?

247
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:17,937
No way it's worth that.

248
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,735
Wait... What'd you say?

249
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:22,620
Listen, you don't seem to know how things work.

250
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:24,414
Maybe I'll teach you a lesson.

251
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:25,574
Ow! Ow! Ow!

252
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,844
You totally cracked my clavicle.

253
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:29,735
That's gonna cost you, my friend.

254
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:31,176
Huh?

255
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:34,700
The hospital will fix me up for about a million yen.

256
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:38,853
You can't be serious, you dumbass! That's outrageous!

257
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:41,103
Verbal abuse causes psychological damage.

258
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,222
So, that's gonna be another million.

259
00:13:43,294 --> 00:13:44,049
Listen, you!

260
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:45,145
You've got bad breath.

261
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,004
Subjecting me to it's another million.

262
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:48,200
What the hell?!

263
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:51,015
Your voice is causing me ear
damage. That'll be another million.

264
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:53,237
Look. You frayed my shirt.

265
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:56,365
Then, that's one more million for garment damage.

266
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:59,500
Now, that's equal to what he owes you for the vase.

267
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,603
I'm no stranger to the kind of
business you guys are running.

268
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:04,072
Come on, Mob. Let's go.

269
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,671
You're not goin' anywhere.

270
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:06,890
There's no escape!

271
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,038
This boy's misfortune was decided the
moment he broke the Vase of Happiness.

272
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,520
I'd hate for anything bad to happen to him!

273
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,777
"Misfortune"? "Bad things"?

274
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:20,837
Before I came here, I was talking to
someone who'd been haunted by an evil spirit.

275
00:14:21,146 --> 00:14:24,681
Apparently, it can be passed along,
and now the spirit's haunting me.

276
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:29,162
I hear strange noises at night, weird
things keep popping up in pictures,

277
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:30,787
doors open and shut on their own.

278
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:32,308
It becomes unbearable.

279
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:35,991
Who knows? The spirit might have
transferred to you guys by now.

280
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:38,071
Be careful when you go to bed tonight.

281
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:40,095
Huh? A haunting?

282
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:41,838
Doesn't feel too great, does it?

283
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:44,448
That's pretty much exactly what you guys are doing.

284
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:48,215
A ghost?

285
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,724
What are you, a little kid? So scary!

286
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,680
That sure shut those two up quick.

287
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:05,312
And I gotta say...

288
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:07,184
That last bit was great, Mob.

289
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,304
Huh?

290
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:10,790
You shook the building to scare them, didn't ya?

291
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:11,774
Nu-uh.

292
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:15,179
I thought all that was you sending
the evil spirit after those two.

293
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:16,287
Wait a second.

294
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:17,482
Are you saying you couldn't see...?

295
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:18,227
Come on.

296
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:20,489
Of course I could see it.

297
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:22,674
I can't believe them.

298
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:24,647
Con artists are terrible people.

299
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:26,187
The worst of the worst.

300
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:28,028
You said it.

301
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:33,252
Only the lowest of the low try to take advantage of
someone's weakness and exploit it for their own gain.

302
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,935
What? You as well?

303
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:36,722
Yes.

304
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:38,402
He said, "So, you're trash, too?"

305
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:41,434
And all I was doing was chewing some gum during class.

306
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,461
Kamuro, this school doesn't belong to you.

307
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:48,995
We still have other pieces of trash to deal with.

308
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,225
Let's keep things moving.

309
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:52,187
You plan to continue this?

310
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:53,355
Come on.

311
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:56,785
You're not going to suggest we stop, are you?

312
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:57,351
No.

313
00:15:57,518 --> 00:16:00,251
It just that you make me feel sick, that's all.

314
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:02,568
You get off on this, don't you?

315
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:07,193
I was correct in choosing you as an accomplice.

316
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,004
If you knew, why did you decide to help me?

317
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,978
Because I was tired.

318
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,703
Just tired of being myself.

319
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:20,412
Of everything. Maybe I wanted to find
out what it would feel like to be a fool.

320
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:23,195
There's more to it than that.

321
00:16:23,603 --> 00:16:25,892
In the end, it made us both popular.

322
00:16:26,062 --> 00:16:28,960
You and I have become the heroes of this entire school.

323
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:32,701
So "looks-too-old-for-school-guy" wanted to be popular?

324
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:37,789
I, on the other hand, have obtained a much bigger world.

325
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,032
By the way, President,

326
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:42,103
did you happen to find any telepaths out there?

327
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:44,640
If I did, I wouldn't be here now, would I?

328
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:47,578
Inukawa! You can't put a bomb there! That's cheating!

329
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,703
Kurata, would you mind being a little quieter, please?

330
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:53,473
'Cause I've still got a few
more things I wanna say over here.

331
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,826
Oh. Sorry.

332
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:56,903
Musashi, that's enough.

333
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:59,228
No, it's not! Now, man up!

334
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:01,010
Go to class, Onigawara!

335
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:03,076
I've got no place there.

336
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:06,347
I mean, none of my friends will even talk to me anymore.

337
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:07,977
Oh, a visitor.

338
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,135
The student council president!

339
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:15,355
I see this place is as rotten as the
rumors led me to believe. More to the point...

340
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:18,405
What are you doing on campus, Onigawara?

341
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,203
Infiltrating the school when you
haven't been showing up to class?

342
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:22,062
No!

343
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:23,228
But I can't stay at home!

344
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:24,995
If I do, my mom will ask me why I'm not...

345
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,254
Listen to me, President.

346
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:28,812
Onigawara didn't do what you think he did.

347
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:31,807
Should I have you all dealt
with for being his accomplices?

348
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:34,075
'Cause, don't forget, I have the power to do so.

349
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,556
What?!

350
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,442
President...

351
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:37,874
President, some weird guy just
showed up at the school gates.

352
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:38,659
What should we do?

353
00:17:39,246 --> 00:17:40,287
It never ends.

354
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:42,460
The problems pile up one after another.

355
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,015
So who are you guys?

356
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:47,912
I told the other nerd that I'm here for White T Poison!

357
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,787
"White T Poison"? What on earth is that?

358
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:51,877
Don't play dumb!

359
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:53,966
He's the talk of all the thugs right now.

360
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:55,667
I'll deal with him, President.

361
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:57,121
That should settle things.

362
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,322
Whoa! You really laid him out!

363
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:03,710
It was done in self defense.

364
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,635
Not to mention, they were students from
another school, so it shouldn't matter.

365
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,250
Not only is he willing to get into a fight,

366
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:13,509
he's incredibly strong, too.

367
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:14,555
Hey...

368
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:17,103
Are you the guy that knocked out Kenzaki?

369
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:17,680
Huh?

370
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,277
Who's better known as White T Poison?

371
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,157
Wh-What are you...

372
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:23,998
I was just watching, I didn't...!

373
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:26,328
Then who the hell is White T Poison?!

374
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:27,038
I don't...

375
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,861
That's enough! It's time to stop this!

376
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,207
Man, you look awful.

377
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:36,576
This is all your fault!

378
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,595
I became a victim because of you!

379
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:41,412
You taught a gang leader from another school a lesson!

380
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:42,688
Don't you understand?!

381
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:44,346
If that's true, then so be it.

382
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:46,420
He got what was coming to him.

383
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,495
Y-You're kidding me!

384
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,880
No! Not again!

385
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:54,144
Are you that White T Poison guy?

386
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,168
Oh, it's you, Tokugawa.

387
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:05,118
Shinji doesn't wanna see anyone right now.

388
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:07,085
Is that so?

389
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:10,078
Disgusting.

390
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:13,853
For someone who wanted to get rid of the
garbage, you should've started with your own room.

391
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:17,401
H-How did you get in here?

392
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:18,708
No matter.

393
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:21,487
Either way, we still have trash to contend with at school.

394
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:24,811
No way! I'm done with all of that! Get out of here!

395
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
It's too late.

396
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:28,995
We've both done something
unforgivable with our roles in this.

397
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,289
No one's going to save us, understand?

398
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:38,895
It seems the puppet's been broken.

399
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:40,912
The school is finally clean.

400
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,772
So now whatcha gonna do?

401
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:45,610
Ya know thugs from the other
schools are gonna keep showin' up.

402
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:48,809
With these powers, I can do whatever I want.

403
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:49,402
Yeah!

404
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:51,309
You could be a psychic superstar!

405
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:52,628
Dimple...

406
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:55,119
You're trying to use me as well, aren't you?

407
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:55,966
Huh?!

408
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:59,525
What are you talking about, Ritsu?
We're partners! I'm on your side!

409
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:11,381
Oh, here they come.

410
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:13,107
More than usual today.

411
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:18,700
I came to see what was going on and, of course...

412
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:22,537
Are you that White T Poison
guy who beat Hanazawa and Kenzaki?

413
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,821
What?! Is he pretending to be Kageyama?

414
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:30,162
Think things'll finally be
settled once I deal with you guys,

415
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,125
so let's just say you found your man.

416
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:35,562
It looks like I'm gonna have
to ask him about this, myself.

417
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:39,281
I found something interesting.

418
00:20:39,478 --> 00:20:41,620
I believe he's the one you were looking for.

419
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:43,460
I'll apprehend him and head back.

420
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:47,686
But before that, I should watch
for a bit and see how good he is.

421
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,786
Possession.

422
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,575
All right. Let's get this over with.

423
00:20:57,725 --> 00:20:59,570
Oh! You think it's gonna be that easy?!

424
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:01,230
Get ready for a pounding!

425
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,039
Don't stop! Go get him, you chickens!

426
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:07,021
We would...

427
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:08,995
But, we... can't move!

428
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,096
Hey, Dimple. Let's go all out.

429
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:16,232
Now's my chance!

430
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:17,407
Huh?

431
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:26,865
Your magic tricks won't work on me, White T Pois...

432
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:30,408
Hey, what's goin' on here?

433
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:32,288
Is White T Poison doing that?

434
00:21:32,598 --> 00:21:34,537
Maybe, but he can't stop all of us!

435
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:35,562
Let's charge him!

436
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,514
Don't worry, I won't judge any of you.

437
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:42,703
I've come to understand something.

438
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:47,395
When people wander from the right path in
their lives, there usually isn't any reason.

439
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:49,187
I guess it's always been that way.

440
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,608
I'm facing enemies that have lost the will to
fight, moving forward for the sake of violence.

441
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:56,490
There's no reason there.

442
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,253
This kind of freedom is strong.

443
00:21:59,812 --> 00:22:00,745
Boundless.

444
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,598
I'm much freer than all of you.

445
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,278
Why, you ask?

446
00:22:04,353 --> 00:22:07,502
I'll tell you. Because I've lost my limits.

447
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,302
I've obtained loss.

448
00:22:21,377 --> 00:22:24,296
It's you What are you doing, Ritsu?

449
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:57,953
The brothers confront each other in an alley after school.

450
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,257
Suddenly, an adult esper we've
previously seen appears out of nowhere.

451
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,120
Hey, Mob, that guy's really bad news!

452
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:06,895
Next time on Mob Psycho 100, Episode 8:
"The Older Brother Bows Destructive Intent."

453
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,646
I recommend the convenient option A with the Blu-ray set!
