1
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,166
We have another victim.

2
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,000
[FELIX] Hello, Char.
You two were in town together?

3
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,041
[CHARLOTTE] Oh. Yes.

4
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,833
[murmuring crowd]

5
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:41,000
[sobbing]

6
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:45,791
[RAISHIN] I remember her,
from before. From the fight.

7
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,083
[FELIX] My dear.

8
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,625
You seem to have a keen
interest in this case.

9
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:54,875
However, I think
it would be best

10
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,416
if you were to stay away
from it going forward.

11
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,583
[CHARLOTTE] But!

12
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,041
[FELIX] Please, leave it
to the Disciplinary Board.

13
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,166
Also, I see with
whom your heart lies.

14
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,500
While I am disappointed,
I shan't interfere.

15
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,666
You've made your decision.

16
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,083
And it was in Raishin's favor.
I shall respect your choice.

17
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,458
It isn't like that!

18
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,375
Now if you will excuse
me, I have work to do.

19
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,208
And I think I should
not see you for a while.

20
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,750
[RAISHIN] Char!

21
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,666
What the hell
was that about?

22
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,833
[FELIX] Harsh, I know.
But I had to be.

23
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,958
Otherwise she will keep
risking her own safety.

24
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,416
Understand?

25
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,833
I guess, but that doesn't
mean I like to see her hurt.

26
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,291
[FELIX] I shall endeavor make
it up to her when this is over.

27
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,833
Yaya's love has
returned after a long day!

28
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,625
Welcome home!

29
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,333
Great timing, too!
Supper is ready and waiting.

30
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,333
Come see!
Yaya has outdone herself!

31
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,625
I think I'm missing
something here.

32
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,625
[YAYA] Don't be silly, Raishin.
Come to the table!

33
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,916
Something's bothering you!

34
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,333
Not at all, Yaya is fine.

35
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,125
No need to worry about her.

36
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,375
[RAISHIN] I was thoughtless.

37
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,583
I cannot apologize enough.

38
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,375
[YAYA] That was so cruel!

39
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,666
You know quite well
how Yaya feels.

40
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,833
[sobs]

41
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,666
Do you know how much
that hurt, Raishin?

42
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,541
I'm so sorry.
Please don't cry.

43
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,875
'Kay.

44
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,666
Almost forgot.

45
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,750
I brought back a
little present for you.

46
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,208
Present for Yaya?

47
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,333
[RAISHIN] Yep.

48
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,666
[RAISHIN] I noticed yours were
looking a little worse for wear.

49
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,791
[RAISHIN] I figured these
might hold up better.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,500
[chuckles]

51
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,500
[laughs]

52
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,958
Perfect fit!

53
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,125
That other thing. Yaya?

54
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,416
What's that?

55
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,083
As far as Char goes, I don't
have feelings for her.

56
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,625
Of course you don't.

57
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,958
She is nice. And I
consider her a friend.

58
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,416
But to be honest,

59
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,958
I really just don't go for
girls who pad their brassieres.

60
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,916
Who does?

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,708
I prefer more curves.

62
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,791
Bountiful, goddess-like
cleavage. Like Shoko's.

63
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,625
Totally reasonable!

64
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,208
[YAYA] Shoko. Again.
It's always Shoko!

65
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,958
I am so sick of Shoko!

66
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,333
[RAISHIN] You're missing
the point, Yaya.

67
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,333
I had my own reasons
for going out with Char.

68
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,250
I wanted to confirm something.

69
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,083
[RAISHIN] What distinguishes
Cannibal Candy

70
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,708
is the wound it leaves behind.

71
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,458
Like a half-melted
chocolate bar.

72
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,500
It's very distinctive.

73
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,500
Sigmund's magic is light-based.

74
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,958
It could produce
that kind of effect.

75
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,750
But if I went
out with Char,

76
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,916
took her away from the academy,
and Cannibal Candy made a move.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,416
[YAYA] Then she'd
have a solid alibi.

78
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,541
Exactly. And the
killer did strike again.

79
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,166
So, that means Charlotte
is innocent, right?

80
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,541
I dunno. It seems
awfully convenient to me.

81
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,875
The timing of the attack seemed

82
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,833
to perfectly coincide with
when she and I were gone.

83
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,208
Charlotte may
not have been here,

84
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,541
but Sigmund was.

85
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,375
Were you with
him the whole time?

86
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,958
Well, no.

87
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,833
But he wouldn't have been able
to use magic anyway, would he?

88
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,875
At least not without
his puppeteer nearby.

89
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,416
Yeah, except that
he's a Banned Doll.

90
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,750
You know what that means.

91
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,875
He could provide a little
bit of magic by himself.

92
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,333
[telephone ringing]

93
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,166
Why're you calling?

94
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,916
[LISETTE] I'm attemptin'
to locate Charlotte, actually.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,833
She ought t'have
been here by now.

96
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,583
Y'see, she and I both live
in the Griffin Hall dorm.

97
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,875
[RAISHIN]
Oh. And she isn't there?

98
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,750
No. I haven't set eyes on her,
and it's quite late.

99
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,166
I thought perhaps
she was off pursuin'

100
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,791
impure relations with you,
so I rang to see.

101
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,708
'Parently I was incorrect,
so ta. Useless git.

102
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,625
Lovely girl.

103
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,791
[RAISHIN] Char must be out
somewhere investigating again.

104
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,458
What a pain.

105
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,791
[YAYA] Oh, no.

106
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,500
[SHOKO] Such a beautiful night.

107
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,166
Don't you, think, boy?
The moon especially.

108
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,125
Shoko, ma'am, hello.

109
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,125
[SHOKO] Yaya, my dear,
you're looking well.

110
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:38,166
Yes ma'am. Yaya is in
excellent working order.

111
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,375
[IRORI] If you are operating
normally, as you say,

112
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,958
then why is it obvious
you have been crying?

113
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,041
[YAYA] Irori, hi!
You're here, too?

114
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,791
[IRORI]
Indeed. You're growing lax.

115
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,916
[SHOKO]
I hear you started a brawl

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,875
almost the moment
you arrived. Yes?

117
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:56,875
[RAISHIN]
Pretty much.

118
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:57,750
[SHOKO]
Interesting.

119
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,125
Would you care to explain why

120
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,958
you didn't destroy a
single one of your opponents?

121
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,375
Whatever, I did
plenty of damage.

122
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,541
[SHOKO] Don't play
the simpleton, boy.

123
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,041
I know you're not one.

124
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,166
An automaton won't die unless
you stop its Eve's Heart.

125
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,000
There is no point
in taking half measures.

126
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,750
Remember, dolls are not people.

127
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,083
Sorry, I don't buy into that.

128
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,833
To me, automatons are human.

129
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,625
I wouldn't stop a
doll's heart so lightly.

130
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,750
Far as I'm concerned,
it's murder.

131
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,041
That's my school of puppetry.

132
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,666
We need to talk
about Cannibal Candy.

133
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,541
Please understand,

134
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,625
he is a far greater
threat than you realize.

135
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,333
Even the Army's involved.

136
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,000
They're in the process
of trying to identify him.

137
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,666
But nothing yet, huh?

138
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,791
Not yet.

139
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,666
The academy is
concealing information

140
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,500
pertaining to the case.

141
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,041
Given their secrecy,

142
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,916
we've considered the possibility
British royalty is involved.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,708
You don't have
to be part of this.

144
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,416
It's not too late yet
to back out, you know.

145
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,666
[RAISHIN] No.
This has become personal.

146
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:08,708
[RAISHIN]
There's someone involved

147
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,125
I don't want to abandon.

148
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,416
She's a brat,
but she's alone out there.

149
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,083
[RAISHIN] She's fixated
on Cannibal Candy.

150
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,041
I don't know why,
but she won't back off.

151
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,958
When it comes down to it,
I guess I feel like I owe her.

152
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,791
I feel guilty.

153
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,833
Damn it!
It's hard to explain!

154
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,458
I'm sayin' I wanna save her!

155
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:32,791
[SHOKO] Yaya.

156
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,625
[YAYA] Oh! Y-yes, ma'am!

157
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,541
[RAISHIN] Yaya!

158
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,666
[RAISHIN] What did you do?

159
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,708
For lack of a better term,
I "unbound" her.

160
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,833
See, boy. Yaya's
Diamond Strength circuit

161
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,791
is without peer.

162
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,958
[SHOKO] However,
one thing it cannot do

163
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,875
is defy the Law of Causality.

164
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,291
For example,

165
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:11,708
consider Tyrant Rex's
magic circuit, called Gräm.

166
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,000
[SHOKO] Yaya cannot withstand
a direct hit from that magic.

167
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,125
It would be the end of her.

168
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,375
One more thing you
should keep in mind.

169
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,291
Yaya's natural enemies
are water and wind.

170
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,333
No matter how much
power she may have,

171
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,708
she cannot subdue
that which has no form.

172
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,875
So do try to be
careful out there.

173
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,458
We will.
Yaya. Let's go.

174
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,375
[IRORI] Master. Are you sure
that was the right decision?

175
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,750
[SHOKO] Worried about Yaya?

176
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,583
[IRORI] No! I have no
personal feelings invested.

177
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,541
[SHOKO] Worry not, child.
All will be well.

178
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,291
Yaya is fine.
I did unbind her.

179
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,833
[IRORI] And what of Raishin?
Will he be all right?

180
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,041
Yaya won't inadvertently
drain him dry?

181
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,875
[SHOKO] Come, now,
the boy is not so weak as that.

182
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,375
[IRORI] No, Master.

183
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,625
But he has only been studying
puppetry for a few years.

184
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,416
[SHOKO] A short time.
That is true.

185
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,875
[SHOKO] You. Boy.

186
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,958
You are the only surviving
member of Clan Akabane, correct?

187
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,166
[RAISHIN] Who are you?

188
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,666
[SHOKO] Magnificent, isn't she?

189
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,375
[SHOKO] She is the second part

190
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,375
of my Seasonal
Treasures trilogy.

191
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,625
She is Yaya, the Moon.

192
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,625
Karyusai is the

193
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,958
greatest living doll
maker in the world.

194
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,250
Likes fine wine,
women, and parties.

195
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,166
Well known as the
biggest carouser around.

196
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,833
Oh-ho. I see
my reputation precedes me.

197
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:20,125
I will admit, I do like
my wine and my girls very much.

198
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,166
[RAISHIN] Then it was you.

199
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,875
You made the
Army's Veiled Fuji series.

200
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,666
[SHOKO]
I consider that a failure.

201
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,833
They weren't beautiful at all.

202
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,833
However, thanks to
my work on that series,

203
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,666
I am well known among
the military elite.

204
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,333
[SHOKO] In fact, with
my contacts and influence,

205
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,250
I am in a position
to grant your wish.

206
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,333
I can help you, boy.

207
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:48,250
I can find him for you,
the one you hate.

208
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,625
The one whose life
you long to take.

209
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,208
And I can lend
you the automaton

210
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,833
you'll need to
accomplish that goal.

211
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,625
[SHOKO] So, boy.
What do you say?

212
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,208
Are you mine now?

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,750
[SHOKO] He's simply unaware
of his natural gifts.

214
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,041
There is genius inside him.
Always has been.

215
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,333
His clan are Onmyoji,
blending cosmology and religion.

216
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,666
They at one time used
dharmapalas and shikigami

217
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,083
in their practice--truly
fearsome familiars.

218
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,500
[SHOKO] Doesn't it
sound magnificent?

219
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,291
Of course.

220
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,916
Their bloodline is
one of the reasons

221
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,708
such grave misfortune
befell the Akabane siblings.

222
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,875
[IRORI] When they finally meet,

223
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,333
what do you suppose
the outcome will be?

224
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,416
Can Raishin defeat Tenzen?

225
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,166
[SHOKO] Revenge.
Such rubbish, isn't it?

226
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,708
[IRORI] Master?

227
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,416
[SHOKO] I daresay he'll resent
me when he learns the truth.

228
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,541
No avoiding it at this point.

229
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,750
[YAYA] Up ahead!

230
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,291
[RAISHIN] It's me,
Lisette! Raishin!

231
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,833
[LISETTE] I didn't
expect you 'ere.

232
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,333
[RAISHIN] What's going on?

233
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,625
[LISETTE] The Disciplinary
Board has been mobilized.

234
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,750
We are all out here
searching for Charlotte.

235
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,166
[RAISHIN] Why are you so
desperate to find her tonight?

236
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,125
[LISETTE] We made
a startling discovery.

237
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,916
A store of magic circuits
was found in her room.

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,916
[RAISHIN] That can't be!

239
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,583
We are not
yet certain they

240
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,916
were the ones taken from
Cannibal Candy's victims.

241
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Good night.

242
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,416
[RAISHIN] Wait a sec.

243
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,708
Technically, I'm affiliated

244
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,916
with the board
right now, right?

245
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,750
So, you're duty-bound
to help me.

246
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,083
[SIGMUND] You should
turn back, Char.

247
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,125
What's got your goat, anyhow?

248
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,625
[CHARLOTTE] It is unforgivable.

249
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,625
I cannot stand idly by
and do nothing.

250
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,875
[RAISHIN] This is
where the lockers are?

251
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,458
[LISETTE] Yes.
This is a repository

252
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,458
for important machines.

253
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,708
I've received
permission to enter.

254
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:54,375
However, a great many automatons
are kept inside this building.

255
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,208
[LISETTE] Your doll
could destroy them easily,

256
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,875
so you understand the concern.

257
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,375
[RAISHIN] But we
would never do that.

258
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,166
[LISETTE] Nevertheless,
I assume my meaning was clear.

259
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,666
[RAISHIN] Yeah, fine, I get it.

260
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,291
[RAISHIN] Yaya will remain here.

261
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,791
[YAYA] Raishin!

262
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,708
[RAISHIN] Lisette.
Can I ask something?

263
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,958
[LISETTE] You may.

264
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,583
[RAISHIN] I've never
met Felix's automaton.

265
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,750
I was hoping you could
tell me what it's like.

266
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,916
[LISETTE] I can't
vouch for this myself,

267
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,625
but I have heard that it
dates back to the Renaissance.

268
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,333
[RAISHIN] That
makes it an antique.

269
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,666
A doll that old,

270
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,250
I wonder what sort of
magic circuit it runs on.

271
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,208
Sorry. I wouldn't know.

272
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,291
Felix's locker
is right through here.

273
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,541
There's something I've
been wanting to ask you.

274
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,750
Huh?

275
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,750
[RAISHIN] When we were
at the crime scene,

276
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,833
you said the victimized
doll was a boule user.

277
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,750
How did you conclude that?

278
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,125
There wasn't much to suggest it.

279
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,583
[LISETTE] Well, it was
patently obvious, actually.

280
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,416
Boules leave very
distinctive injuries--

281
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
[RAISHIN] The doll's legs were
crushed, I know, I saw it.

282
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,166
Which is what
I'm asking about.

283
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,041
The natural conclusion would be
the attacker was a boule user.

284
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,250
It shouldn't occur to you

285
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,166
that she was attacked
with her own weapon,

286
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,750
unless you had
something else to go on.

287
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,500
Or unless you saw it happen.

288
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,250
[LISETTE] What're you
accusin' me of?

289
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,208
No need
to get defensive.

290
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,458
I just thought you might've
been an eyewitness.

291
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,916
It's a bad idea
to make assumptions!

292
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,625
[LISETTE] Raishin!
Where are you goin'?

293
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,875
Get back 'ere!

294
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, bollocks.

295
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,958
[RAISHIN]
How did it take so long

296
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,708
to figure out
something so obvious?

297
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:33,458
This is
Lisette Norden's corpse!

298
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,041
[RAISHIN] You're a Banned Doll!

299
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,000
I warned you 'bout makin'
assumptions, didn't I?

300
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,291
You shouldn'ta
stuck your nose in!

301
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:54,583
[alarm blaring]

302
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,791
[GUARD 3A] What happened here?

303
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,291
[LISETTE] You're just in time.

304
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,083
I'm Lisette Norden, Vice-Chief
of the Disciplinary Board.

305
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,708
Apprehend this lad:
Raishin Akabane.

306
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,875
I want him held on suspicion of
colluding with Cannibal Candy.

307
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,333
And as a precaution,
take the doll out front.

308
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,125
[GUARD 3B] Understood.
We'll bring her in.

309
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,708
[LISETTE] I shall go an'
report this to the board.

310
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,125
[GUARD 3C] Thank you, ma'am!

311
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,833
[CHARLOTTE] There it is,
at last. I want it alive.

312
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,583
[CHARLOTTE] Lustre Flare!

313
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,208
[CHARLOTTE] Smashing!

314
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,958
[FELIX] Stop at once!

315
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,583
[FELIX] The plan worked.
Hello, Char.

316
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,166
[CHARLOTTE] Felix!

317
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,291
[FELIX]
We set out that automaton

318
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,166
as bait for Cannibal Candy.

319
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,583
The dormitory warden alerted us

320
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,541
that you'd slipped
out of Griffin Hall.

321
00:18:56,625 --> 00:19:00,291
That's when we found the proof--
quite a lot of it--in your room.

322
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,083
[CHARLOTTE] What?

323
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,875
[FELIX] It was a large
collection of magic circuits.

324
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,500
Eve's Hearts to be exact.

325
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,083
[CHARLOTTE] No, wait!
That isn't--!

326
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,625
[FELIX]
Charlotte of House Belew!

327
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,958
You are Cannibal Candy.

328
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,250
[CHARLOTTE] What?

329
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,833
[KIMBERLEY] Wait.

330
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,583
Several broken ribs, it seems.

331
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,083
[KIMBERLEY]
She's badly injured, too.

332
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,208
Been beaten half to death.

333
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,666
[KIMBERLEY] Stand back!
Get down!

334
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,291
[KIMBERLEY] What is this?
What's happening to her?

335
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,916
What manner of beast--?

336
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,375
[MALE DISCIPLINARY 3A]
Do you see that light?

337
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,791
[MALE DISCIPLINARY 3B]
It's off near the lockers!

338
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,125
[FELIX] We need to know
what's happening over there.

339
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,375
All board members,
dispatch at once.

340
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,750
[MALE DISCIPLINARY 3C] Sir,
you shouldn't stay here alone.

341
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,166
Tyrant Rex is a
formidable enemy.

342
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,500
[FELIX] I shall be fine.

343
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,541
In case you've forgotten,
I am one of the Rounds.

344
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,416
There, you see.
My automaton's arrived.

345
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,250
I won't require
further assistance.

346
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,583
[FELIX] Now.
Make haste, all of you!

347
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,541
[MALE DISCIPLINARY 3B] But, sir!

348
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,583
Exactly how
dense are you?

349
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,291
I'm telling you you'll
be in my way. Go!

350
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,291
[FELIX] There.
Now we can chat in private.

351
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,541
You don't
honestly believe

352
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,208
I'm Cannibal Candy, do you?

353
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,291
Can't you see how
ridiculous that is?

354
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,541
[FELIX] I don't need
to believe it.

355
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,166
I just need others to.

356
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,250
That was the
original plan, anyway.

357
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,750
To set the new chap,
Raishin, on your tail,

358
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,625
and have him destroy you.

359
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,916
[FELIX] But, unfortunately,
he dug too deeply.

360
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,083
[CHARLOTTE] Wait, what
have you done to Raishin?

361
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,500
[FELIX]
Hmph!

362
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,958
[CHARLOTTE] Where is he?

363
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,500
[FELIX] If you
find it comforting,

364
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,833
think of it as a
cruel twist of fate.

365
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,375
It's fate that we were both here

366
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,208
in the year of the festival--the
year of the magical eclipse.

367
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,666
Yes. And it is also fate

368
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,500
that your doll's Gräm is
like my doll's Predator.

369
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,333
[CHARLOTTE] I see now.

370
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,833
You set me up! Which means--

371
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:32,166
You're a murderer!
You're Cannibal Candy!

372
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,500
Felix! How could you--?

373
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:39,458
Why would you--
do something so cruel?

374
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,791
[FELIX] Because I want to
be named the Wise Man.

375
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:46,791
Obviously. I will be
king of the magical world!

376
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,958
[FELIX] Now, Char,
this is goodbye.

377
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,750
[SIGMUND]
Why are you sitting there?

378
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,791
Quickly! I cannot
defeat him on my own!

379
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,041
[CHARLOTTE] Raishin. I'm sorry.

380
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,708
[RAISHIN] Don't be an idiot,
Char. It's not you.

381
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:34,041
You have nothing to
apologize for. He does.
