Just stay close.
You'll be fine.

00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,541
[RAISHIN] Look out!

00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,666
[RAISHIN] Yaya!

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,458
Concentrate.
Sense his movements.

00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,791
Use fighter's
intuition to track him.

[YAYA cries out]

Rai... shin.

00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,041
Augh!

12
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,166
Stop it!

13
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,583
Whatever am I thinking?

14
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:45,291
I nearly forgot my young
master's explicit orders.

15
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,791
[SHIN] While the
Granville's deserve a butler

16
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:52,333
with enormous talent,
I am not without my failings.

17
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,041
If I had to name
one flaw it would be--

18
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,125
The slightest tendency
toward absentmindedness.

19
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,875
I remember now, though.

20
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:04,333
My orders, Master Akabane,
were to bring him your head.

21
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,750
Stop it! Please,
I'm begging you!

22
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,041
[LOKI] I am a humble,
tolerant person.

23
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,666
However, there are three
things I simply cannot abide.

24
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,416
People who order me around.

25
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,750
People who stand
against me. And...

26
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,250
...bastards who
go after <i>my</i> prey.

27
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,916
Second Last isn't yours to kill!

28
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,166
[LOKI] Cherubim!

29
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,916
[CHERUBIM] Ready.

30
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,708
[LOKI] Cherubim!

31
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,958
Spin! Cherubim!

32
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,708

even touch him.

[barking dogs]

34
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,458
[FREY] Rabbi!

35
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,041
[LOKI] You should
stay out of this, Frey.

36
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,833
If you interfere,
you'll only be in the way.

37
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,125
[LOKI] Look, what
I'm trying to say is,

38
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,750
it's difficult for me
to protect somebody

39
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,375
in the middle of a fight.

40
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,041
It can be a bit distracting.

41
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,291
I-- uh. Okay,
wait a minute.

42
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,916
What was that for?

43
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,333
[FREY] A way to
thank you. That's all.

44
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,416
I appreciate you
protecting Raishin.

45
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,250
Professor Kimberley
is forcing me to do it.

46
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,958
I don't need anyone's gratitude.

47
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,125
[LOKI] Why are you
lookin' at me like that?

48
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,875
Was there something
you wanted to say?

49
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,125
[CHERUBIM] No. No, sir. Ready.

50
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,416
[CEDRIC] Chilly. These late
nights are murder on my skin.

51
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,208
You've something to report?

52
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,041
My most abject apologies.

53
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,958
I failed to recapture
Henriette as ordered.

54
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,375
[CEDRIC]
There was no helping it.

55
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,666
What with Sacred Blaze
making a surprise appearance.

56
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,958
[SHIN] Master. I have
also failed to bring you

57
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,125
the head of Second Last.

58
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,583
[CEDRIC] You still have much to
learn about my sense of humor.

59
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,416
I didn't <i>want</i> him beheaded.

60
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,250
I was putting on an act
for the Belew tramp.

61
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,333
Forgive me, Master,

62
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,458
I am not quite
certain I believe that.

63
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,125
It would have its uses.

64
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,458
[CEDRIC] Indeed.

65
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,833
I would still love to
have it, were it feasible.

66
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,500
Akabane's head would make
rather superb magic material.

67
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,625
But if we're to succeed,
we must not be too greedy.

68
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,416
The Granvilles'
objective is to assist

69
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,791
the Kingsforts in
their time of need.

70
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,583
However, you and
I have a different goal.

71
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,916
To reveal your existence to
highly-placed academy faculty.

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,166
With that in mind,

73
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,833
preparations are
proceeding according to plan.

74
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,000
We've even confirmed

75
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,458
the existence of the
Cathedral of Fools.

76
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,083
I'm most satisfied.

77
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,625
Now then, what have you
discovered about Magnus?

78
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,916
To be perfectly honest,
I'm outmatched.

79
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,166
It would simply not be possible

80
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,250
to defeat all six of his
automatons on my own.

81
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,666
[CEDRIC] Put your findings
in a detailed report.

82
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,833
After all, one rarely
gets a chance to face off

83
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,833
with his 'Squadron' directly.

84
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,541
Oh, and, investigate
the Cathedral.

85
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,166
My understanding
is that another team

86
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,708
is exploring the
site at present.

87
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,666
[CEDRIC] Not anymore.
They've been eliminated.

88
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,250
The vaunted
headmaster of Walpurgis,

89
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,625
old Edward Rutherford, is a
formidable opponent indeed.

90
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,500
He wasn't hailed as
the most powerful mage

91
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,541
of the nineteenth century
without reason.

92
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,875
[SHIN] The deadline
swiftly approaches.

93
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,041
Will Tyrant Rex succeed
in her assignment

94
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,750
to assassinate
Headmaster Rutherford?

95
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,125
[CEDRIC] Not a chance.

96
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,958
Magnus is practically glued
to Rutherford's side.

97
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,375
Killing him now
will be impossible.

98
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,416
I could send an entire division
and they wouldn't succeed.

99
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,416
Then why ever did you task
Charlotte with his murder?

100
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,166
In order to placate
the Kingsforts' wishes.

101
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,375
They'd be thrilled
if she succeeded.

102
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,708
But if she failed, they
would quite obviously plan

103
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,208
to pin the blame
on the Granvilles.

104
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,958
They have plots within plots.

105
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,708
As we speak, they're
even covertly trying

106
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,750
to seal an accord
with the academy.

107
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:54,416
[SHIN] Interesting. What sort
of accord are they seeking?

108
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,083
[CEDRIC] What else would it be?

109
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,916
Joint research into
"god replication."

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,500
[SHIN] Ah. I see.

111
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,666
Then if the Granville butler
were to appear involved.

112
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,875
[CEDRIC] Fear and
suspicion abound.

113
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,916
Of course, the adults' agendas

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,208
are only part of my motivation.

115
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,250
I'm also doing this
because I want to.

116
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,500
After all, the pursuit
which gives me the

117
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:19,791
greatest pleasure is witnessing
the misfortune of others.

118
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,291
As always, young master,

119
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,916
there can be no doubt you
are rotten to your very soul.

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you, Shin.

121
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,750
Now. I have a thirst.

122
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,666
Make me some tea before
we begin your punishment.

123
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,125
Something that'll
pep me up a bit.

124
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,958
As you wish.

125
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,791
[distant howling]

126
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, wow.

127
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,083
You really do
despise dogs, don't you?

128
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,000
[HENRIETTE] You're awake!
I don't though.

129
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,583
I like them, really.

130
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,583
[RAISHIN] You do? Then why're
you so afraid of 'em?

131
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,833
[HENRIETTE] Because of Alfred,
our canine automaton.

132
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:02,083
My sister gave me care of him
while she was away at school.

133
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,083
If only I had been able
to control him properly!

134
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,791
The prince never would
have come to any harm.

135
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,416
Now everything
that's going wrong

136
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,208
is my fault again.

137
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,208
I simply don't care anymore!

138
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,791
[RAISHIN] What do you mean?

139
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,583
Don't care about what?

140
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,583
[HENRIETTE]
We were given a deadline.

141
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,000
They said if Charlotte failed

142
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:25,208
to kill the headmaster
before dawn, they would kill us.

143
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,208
So, you see,
our time is nearly up.

144
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,375
[RAISHIN] You shoulda
told me that sooner!

145
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,541
No, please! Don't go!

146
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,791
You have to help me kill myself!

147
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,833
Charlotte might
have a decent chance

148
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,291
of escaping if she
were on her own.

149
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,083
Without me holding her back.

150
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,708
[RAISHIN] Don't say that!

151
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,375
Why the hell do you
think Char's doing all this?

152
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,000
It's because she
wants you to live!

153
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,291
[HENRIETTE] You know.

154
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,833
I've always been
so envious of Char.

155
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:55,041
She's my big sister; so smart,
beautiful, and brave.

156
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:59,250
Everyone always liked her.
But I was there, too.

157
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,041
Always stuck in her shadow.

158
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,875
No matter what,
I could never be as good as her.

159
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,291
I'm nothing like her at all.

160
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,916
The truth is... I hate her!

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,916
My own sister!

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,916
I could have taken the
blame for our family's fall,

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,416
but instead, I made it
seem like Alfred's fault.

164
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,333
Charlotte's fault.

165
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,416
Don't you see?

166
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,125
I'm a wicked,
horrible girl. So, I--

167
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,458
You're wrong!

168
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,833
Everyone gets
jealous sometimes.

169
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,708
You don't really hate your
sister, you're just scared.

170
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,458
[RAISHIN] You gotta
stop running away, Henri!

171
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,500
It's time to face
your true feelings!

172
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,375
I'm afraid!

173
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,291
[RAISHIN] It's your choice.

174
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,958
What do you want me to do?

175
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:49,291
I want you-- I want
you to save my sister!

176
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,791
Of course.
I'd be happy to.

177
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,750
Yaya! What's wrong?

178
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,750
Yaya is sorry. She
failed to protect Raishin.

179
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,375
Because of Yaya,
you were hurt.

180
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,416
[RAISHIN] Don't be silly.
I'm the one who's sorry.

181
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,125
When this pretty
face got hurt today,

182
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,750
all I could do was watch.

183
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,750
You deserve far better than
that from your puppeteer.

184
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,208
Yaya's fine.

185
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,000
Even so, I am sorry.

186
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,625
It seems I'm always
causing you pain,

187
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,750
even when I try not to.

188
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,666
Anyway.

189
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,333
There'll be plenty time
to beat myself up more

190
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,291
after we bring
Dinosaur Girl back.

191
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,583
What about Henri?

192
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,375
[yawns]
I can look after her.

193
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,458
Can you?
That'd be great.

194
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,208
Mhmm. It's no trouble.

195
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,208
We'll stay here and
keep her company.

196
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,500
[RAISHIN]
Thanks, Frey.

197
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,041
Oh. I could probably
track Char down faster

198
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,833
if I had one of
your dogs with me.

199
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,875
Would that be okay?

200
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,291
You won't do
anything dirty?

201
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,750
[RAISHIN] Of course not!

202
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,916
You really think I'm some
kind of deviant, don't you?

203
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,750
Here, Riviera.

204
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,166
Nothing to be scared of,
girl. I think.

205
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,875
Thanks for
the help, Riviera.

206
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,750
Are ya ready?

207
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,333
It's Shoko.

208
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,083
I find myself in
an unpleasant mood.

209
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,791
Wanna help?

210
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:33,958
[RAISHIN] Sure.

211
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,500
I'll say this only once,
boy, so listen good.

212
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,583
You're at a crossroads

213
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,916
and you gotta take
one of two paths.

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,750
Go on back to bed and
sleep like a good child.

215
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,833
Or continue, and I'll put
you to sleep right here.

216
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,583
And what if I choose
neither of those paths?

217
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,125
You cannot honestly
mean to defy me.

218
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,583
Nothing in this world is
more tragically worthless

219
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,916
than a dog who's
forgotten his master.

220
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,500
Well, that's me.

221
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,416
[SHOKO] Yaya.
Come here right now.

222
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,791
But Raishin...

223
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,375
[SHOKO]
I said now.

224
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,375
Yaya's sorry.
She can't leave.

225
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:11,625
She wants to stay by Raishin's
side. Whatever happens.

226
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,125
I never want to see your
face again, boy, understand?

227
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,041
It's okay.
Shoko's scared.

228
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,166
She'd only react that way with
someone she truly cared for.

229
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,708
 Yeah, I know.

230
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,625
And I don't enjoy
worrying her, but still.

231
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,166
I can't abandon the
"Awkward Sisters."

232
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,000
Not when they need my help.

233
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,625
[CHARLOTTE] Let's go.

234
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,833
It's not too late to
reconsider your plan.

235
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,375
Stop and think, Char.

236
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,750
[CHARLOTTE] I'm sorry! But if
I disobey, Henri will die.

237
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,291
[SIGMUND] That may be true,
but what guarantee

238
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,083
have they given us that
she'll live if we succeed?

239
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,666
[CHARLOTTE] Sigmund!

240
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,208
[SIGMUND] If you do this, you'll
never be able to go back to him.

241
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,458
Remember how
lonely you were?

242
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,625
How the other
students avoided you?

243
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,333
It was beginning to
look like you'd never

244
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,375
develop any real
friendships here.

245
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,250
And then you
finally found someone

246
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,791
who was willing to take
the time to understand you.

247
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,458
Giving Raishin up
means sacrificing

248
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,916
the happiness it took
you so long to find.

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,125
Is that what you want?

250
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,125
Doesn't matter. It's too late.

251
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,250
I am an assassin,
out to kill the headmaster.

252
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,083
There's no turning back.

253
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,791
Happiness isn't
an option for me!

254
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,583
[SIGMUND] I've failed.

255
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,166
If I'd only been stronger,

256
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,416
I would have been able to save
you and Henri from this fate.

257
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,375
[CHARLOTTE] No! That's not true!

258
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,708
I've been hurt and
depressed and alone.

259
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,916
I've been frightened and unsure,

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,333
but through it all,
you were always there.

261
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,750
You've never left my side!

262
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,708
So thank you.

263
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,291
Now, I can't just sit
here bawling forever.

264
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,208
It'll be dawn before long.

265
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,458
[SIGMUND] That's right.

266
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,291
And while I have nothing
against the headmaster,

267
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,791
we do as we must.

268
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,666
[RAISHIN] If you got nothing
against him, don't kill him.

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,625
Heya, Dinosaur Girl.

270
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,666
How's about that second date?

271
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,875
[CHARLOTTE] Raishin.

272
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,375
Just forget this
stupid plan of yours

273
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,250
and go back to the dorm.

274
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,541
Catch up on your beauty rest,
apologize to the

275
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,291
board of trustees,
get a good stern talking-to.

276
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,833
Then go into town
with me to celebrate.

277
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,125
Instead. You could
celebrate here on campus

278
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,541
where Yaya can chaperone.

279
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,958
Don't stand in my way.

280
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,958
[RAISHIN] Now which
one of us is the twit?

281
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,000
Have you honestly forgotten
what you came here for?

282
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,583
Kill the headmaster today,

283
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,500
and you will <i>never</i> restore
the Belew family name.

284
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,208
Your dream will die with him!

285
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,875
You think
I don't know that?

286
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,958
I'm doing this because
I have no choice!

287
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,458
[SIGMUND] Stand aside, laddie.

288
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,833
Please don't force us
to hurt you, as well.

289
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,291
And what
makes you so sure

290
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,416
you two would get
the best of us?

291
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,958
[SIGMUND] It is a dangerous
fancy to believe your power

292
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,250
is equal to that of the Rounds.

293
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,416
You think far too highly
of your own abilities.

294
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,833
Char will do what
she believes necessary.

295
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:16,541
Whether you can understand
it or not, the fact remains.

296
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,083
There is only so much
one human can do.

297
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,250
No matter how talented
a puppeteer she may be.

298
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,125
No see, I think you're the
one who doesn't understand.

299
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,833
It doesn't matter how weak <i>I</i> am.

300
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,375
Or how strong you and Char are.

301
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,625
Regardless of our
enemy's strength,

302
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,250
Yaya and I refuse to back down.

303
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,500
Ever. You know why?

304
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,416
Go, Sigmund!

305
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,416
As I was saying,

306
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,625
it's 'cause Yaya's the
best automaton in the world!

307
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,666
[loud crash]

308
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,708
Now, Yaya. Fall back!

309
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,500
[CHARLOTTE] Lustre Cannon!

310
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,666
Flare! 36 Sho!

311
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,125
Right!

312
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,791
[CHARLOTTE] Lustre Flare!

313
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:45,250
Whistle 36--no wait!
Forty-eight Sho!

314
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,958
Stronghold!

315
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,083
Come on, Sigmund!
You're stronger!

316
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,875
Good Yaya!
Push him back!

317
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,000
Now, Flare! 48 Sho!

318
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,833
[RAISHIN] Come on,
Dinosaur Girl!

319
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,791
You're fighting
the wrong person!

320
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,041
Why wouldn't someone

321
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,791
with your power unleash
it on the real enemy?

322
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,000
There'd be no point.

323
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,000
I would never be able
to stand up to them!

324
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,166
So you come to me for help!
Your friend!

325
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,166
[CHARLOTTE]
No! I have come too far!

326
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,416
It's too late to turn back now!

327
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,125
Believe in me.
Please, Char.

328
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:48,083
I want to, but this
is my fight, not yours.

329
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,250
So? We'll face it together.

330
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,541
Ahhh!

331
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,625
[CH ARLOTTE] Oh, no.

332
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,041
What's wrong?
You're burning up.

333
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,291
[SHIN]
Your concern is misplaced.

334
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,541
You've far more pressing
worries at the moment;

335
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,041
like the headmaster,
for example.

336
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,375
My mind's changed.

337
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,916
I won't do your dirty work.

338
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,625
[SHIN] Such a pity.

339
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,875
[SHIN] Still conscious,
Master Akabane?

340
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,458
You took quite a tumble.

341
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,333
[SHIN] Despite my past actions,

342
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,208
Granville butlers abhor
physical confrontation.

343
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,625
Settling matters with one's
fists is so primitive.

344
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,958
Perhaps you'll simply
allow me to kill you?

345
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,291
Please do. I should consider
it a personal favor.

346
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,166
[RAISHIN] Go to hell.

347
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,416
[RAISHIN] Silence 48 Sho!

348
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,041
[SHIN] Now, then.
I believe it's your turn.

349
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,583
[CHARLOTTE] Sigmund!
Lustre Cannon!

350
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,083
Impossible!

351
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:37,708
The Belew's prized Gram has
a well-deserved reputation.

352
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,208
No point in looking.
So sorry.

353
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,000
Search all you want,
you'll find no one there.

354
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,916
[CHARLOTTE] Your puppeteer!
He must be nearby.

355
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,291
[SHIN] Automatons don't
create magical energy.

356
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,750
Even in the case
of a Banned Doll.

357
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,625
It isn't the doll who
produces the magic.

358
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,125
It's the human parts that have

359
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,500
been combined
with the mechanical.

360
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,208
How then do you explain the
fact that I'm fighting alone?

361
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,833
You're being ridiculous.

362
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,208
I should really believe
you're here on your own?

363
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,875
While blessed
with enormous talent,

364
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,541
I'm not without my failings.

365
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,125
If I had to name one flaw,

366
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:25,375
it would be that on occasion
I have a rather loose tongue.

367
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,333
Therefore I shall
enlighten you.

368
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,208
I am something
truly extraordinary.

369
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,416
A divine instrument--
a Machine-Doll!
