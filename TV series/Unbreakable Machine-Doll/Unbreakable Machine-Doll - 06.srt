1
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,625
[YAYA screams]

2
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,125
[SIGMUND] Yaya!

3
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,083
Ah, Ms. Karyusai!

4
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,458
Impeccable timing.
Care to patch her up?

5
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,250
And hello to you, Professor.

6
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,958
I hope you're well.

7
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,666
That brat of yours is
proving quite the handful.

8
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,000
I hope he had good reason

9
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,916
for sneaking off
academy grounds like that.

10
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,916
Really. It's no wonder
she wound up in a bad way.

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,166
It sounds like you might know

12
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,791
who was responsible for
the attack on his doll.

13
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,458
Even if I did,

14
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,958
that would be a
discussion for another time.

15
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,208
For now...

16
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,875
Well, you wouldn't want
to lose her, would you?

17
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,041
[SHOKO] Your concern
is noted, Professor.

18
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,333
But don't worry.

19
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,041
You'll find she's quite
tougher than she looks.

20
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,666
[KIMBERLEY] That covers
the automaton, then.

21
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,041
But what of Second Last?

22
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,750
He's playing a dangerous game.

23
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,583
Don't underestimate him, either.

24
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,916
No boy of mine
would die so easily.

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,250
It has been lovely catching up.

26
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,333
Give my regards to
Father Time, won't you?

27
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,416
That woman practically
bathes in intrigue.

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
Loves her secrets.

29
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,291
Though, I suppose
it's not my place to judge.

30
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,041
[YOMI] Something I can
do for you, young fellow?

31
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,875
Whoa, a talking dog!

32
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,416
[YOMI] Both my thought processes

33
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,875
and vocal chords are on par
with that of any of you humans.

34
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,000
For better or for worse.

35
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,916
[RAISHIN] You shouldn't
be able to detect us.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
And yet, as should
be clear, I can.

37
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,958
You are well
concealed, though.

38
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,291
A passive sensor wouldn't
even know you were here.

39
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,500
[KOMURASAKI]
So you're active!

40
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,875
Hmph. Well, we have a
clever one on our hands.

41
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,916
Now then, it's only
polite say 'hello'

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,666
when sneaking into someone's
home without permission.

43
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,000
Of course. Sorry.

44
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,916
I'm Raishin Akabane.
Pleasure to meet you.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,708
We're undercover!

46
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,000
How refreshing!

47
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,458
It's not every day you meet
such well-mannered intruders!

48
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,458
Those other dog
automatons out there.

49
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,166
Are they your pups by chance?

50
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,250
[YOMI] In a way
I suppose they are.

51
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,250
I am the prototype
for the Garm Series,

52
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,791
the line to which
my son Rabbi belongs.

53
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,625
[RAISHIN] With the
Sonic magic circuit!

54
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,125
Indeed. So you've
heard of it, then.

55
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,208
Since you're so smart,
do you know how it functions?

56
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,041
We emit sound
and it bounces back;

57
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,333
seeing and hearing the world
via changes in wavelength.

58
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,583
It's rather impressive, really.

59
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,666
Like a bat.
So you're a Banned Doll?

60
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,875
What led you
to that conclusion?

61
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:53,333
[RAISHIN] Far as I can tell,
there's no puppeteer nearby.

62
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,750
Yet you're still using magic.

63
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,125
Well spotted.

64
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,708
Clearly you're more intelligent
than you first appear.

65
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,708
Gee thanks. So why are
you locked up in here?

66
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,125
I near the end of the
great road we all travel.

67
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,375
I'll soon be disposed of.

68
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,875
Happens to us all eventually.

69
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,958
They're putting you down?
But why?

70
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,458
They no longer have
need of a prototype.

71
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,500
Which means there's nothing to
justify the cost of my upkeep.

72
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,500
How can they do that?

73
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,791
Sorry for yelling.
It just makes me sick to see

74
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,958
a living creature's
worth reduced to numbers.

75
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,375
[RAISHIN] Wait, why
don't you come with us?

76
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,791
And why would I do that?

77
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,416
Because where's
the fun in living out

78
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,541
your final days in a dismal
hellhole like this place?

79
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:39,166
[chuckles] I'll say this:
you are a most amusing chap.

80
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,875
Why'd you break in here, anyway?

81
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,041
[RAISHIN]
For information on a girl

82
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,708
who keeps trying to
kill me, named Frey.

83
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,166
That's ridiculous!

84
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,125
What on Earth would compel
her to do such a thing?

85
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,708
That's exactly what
I'm trying to find out.

86
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,666
If you're interested,
I could really use

87
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,833
a guide to help
show me around.

88
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,333
Then follow me, son.

89
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,791
I'll share the secrets
entombed within these walls.

90
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,458
But beware: you're about

91
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,083
to see a glimpse
of hell on earth.

92
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,833
Hold up. You never
did tell us your name.

93
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,250
It's Yomi.

94
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,791
[SIGMUND] Yaya!
Yaya! Stay with me!

95
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,625
[YAYA] Wh-what happened?

96
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,541
Are you all right?

97
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,916
Yaya should be fine.
She's still functional.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,166
You were lucky;

99
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,875
surviving an abdominal
blow like that is rare.

100
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,541
Yaya is not lucky;

101
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,250
she is the best
automaton in the world.

102
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,166
She's strong.

103
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,625
[SIGMUND] Steady now, child.

104
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,125
I'll go an' fetch a technician.

105
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,125
No, that won't do.

106
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:47,916
Not Yaya. Normal
repairs won't be enough.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,583
[SIGMUND]
Then what will help you?

108
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:54,958
[YAYA] Raishin.
Yaya needs Raishin.

109
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,875
[SIGMUND] His magic
is our only hope, is it?

110
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,791
[CHARLOTTE] Good lord!
What is all this ruckus?

111
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,541
[SIGMUND] Char! Thank goodness.

112
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,958
You're just in time.
Lend me a hand!

113
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,000
No! We need to leave
this to the technicians!

114
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,500
How could those bastards
have built her like this?

115
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,500
She's made up of even more
fragile parts than you are!

116
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,708
I'm afraid only her
designer would be able

117
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,958
to repair something this severe.

118
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,291
I'm not sure it'll help,

119
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,458
but I can give her
some of my magic.

120
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,875
What is this? I can't--

121
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,500
Aaaaa!!

122
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,875
[SIGMUND] Are you all right?

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,750
[YAYA] Please don't
endanger yourself for Yaya.

124
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,416
This is nothing!
I've got this!

125
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,541
[YAYA] But...
You're the ene--

126
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,250
I am Charlotte of
the House of Belew,

127
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,958
who were granted
the noble unicorn crest

128
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,000
and northern earldom
by Her Majesty the Queen!

129
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,791
Whatever enmity you
and I might share

130
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,916
can be settled
on festival grounds.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,291
[YAYA] No. Yaya doesn't want
to be indebted to a vixen.

132
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,333
You don't know
when to shut up!

133
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,000
[door opening]

134
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,541
[sighs]

135
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,250
[KIMBERLEY] Haven't changed
a bit, have you, Doctor?

136
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,666
All part of the
treatment. My word.

137
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,541
Just makin' sure the
stethoscope was properly placed.

138
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,250
[KIMBERLEY] Ugh. Spare me
the details, won't you?

139
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,583
So, what tears you away

140
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,458
from your busy schedule
to come bother me?

141
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,458
A stomach ache, perhaps?
Menstrual cramps?

142
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,291
Not menopause already?

143
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,708
Actually, I'd like your thoughts

144
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,041
on a certain student.

145
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,375
What's your opinion
of Raishin Akabane?

146
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,541
[CRUEL] Wondered when
you'd ask after 'im.

147
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,791
[KIMBERLEY] So, something
has caught your eye.

148
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,500
[CRUEL] Well, first, his wounds
are terribly slow to heal.

149
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,083
He suffers from
poor blood formation

150
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,333
and cell division as well as
inefficient nutrient intake.

151
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,625
All of which
suggests he's having

152
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,833
the life sucked out of him.

153
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,208
[KIMBERLEY] Is it
possible it's being used

154
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,875
to repair an automaton?

155
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,166
Certainly.

156
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,875
Provided he is in
possession of a Banned Doll.

157
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,000
I want him very
closely monitored.

158
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,833
Naturally you'll be under
exclusive contract with us.

159
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,958
Your life's about
to change, Doctor.

160
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,083
Both Academy and English
government are your enemies.

161
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,041
I am a reasonable
woman, though.

162
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,000
You have a choice.

163
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,458
Between the cash
or a sniper bullet.

164
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,041
[YOMI] Here we are; Frey's room.

165
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,416
[RAISHIN] Is Frey her real name?

166
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,000
[YOMI] More of a codename.

167
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,041
[RAISHIN] And her parents?

168
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,541
Such a tragic story;

169
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,458
they were in a traveling puppet
show in the United States.

170
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,083
Halfway through
one of their shows,

171
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,541
an automaton malfunctioned,
and they were both killed.

172
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,083
Now. I know Frey well
and can't hazard a guess as

173
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,083
to why she'd try to kill you.

174
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,708
She's always been such
a sweet little dear.

175
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:02,000
Everyone loves her.
It's impossible not to.

176
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,958
That's why she was chosen;
she was the obvious choice.

177
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,500
To command Rabbi, you mean?

178
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,666
The world can
punish the kindhearted.

179
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,375
I fear her innate
goodness may have

180
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,583
led her down a
most unfortunate path.

181
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,583
[RAISHIN] Whatever
misfortune's befallen her,

182
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,916
her life doesn't seem all bad.

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,375
I mean, she has loving
family like you around.

184
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,375
[RAISHIN]
Are these all siblings?

185
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,041
No, that wouldn't be possible.

186
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,625
[YOMI] Those are
"Promised Children."

187
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,583
Rare individuals who
possess an affinity

188
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:40,375
for magic that goes
beyond that of most humans.

189
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,166
Each of the children
in that room

190
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,250
is literally one in a million.

191
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,333
[RAISHIN] Why are they here?

192
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,875
They all just happened
to be orphaned?

193
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,041
[YOMI] What would you say

194
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,375
if I told you they
aren't entirely human?

195
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,625
Come.

196
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,375
I've something even more
horrifying to show you.

197
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,666
What the hell?
What is this?

198
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,125
[alarm siren]

199
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,125
They're headed our way!

200
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,500
How many of them can see
through our cloaking spell?

201
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,666
Every Garm doll
has that ability.

202
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,833
Although I am uncertain

203
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,958
whether any of the
guards puppeteer one.

204
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,250
Then we'll
have to break through

205
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,833
and hope for the best.

206
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,375
[YOMI] Short-sightedness like
that will be the death of you.

207
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,416
[RAISHIN] Is there another exit?

208
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,791
[YOMI] Quickly. Open this.

209
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,416
A secret passage?

210
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,041
[YOMI]
No, it's only a rubbish bin.

211
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,375
[GUARD 6A] There they are!

212
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,458
They're fleein' down the sewer!

213
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,791
[splashes]

214
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,583
Argh!

215
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,875
Your shoulder!

216
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,583
It's just a scratch.
Where's this tunnel lead?

217
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,083
Into the town's sewer system.

218
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,250
You should make
it out before long.

219
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,500
Assuming of course,

220
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,125
that your pursuers are
as incompetent as ever.

221
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,666
[RAISHIN]
That's not as reassuring

222
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,458
as you probably think.

223
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,291
[KOMURASAKI] Ugh.

224
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,083
I'm positively
soaked in this muck!

225
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,125
[YOMI] I believe
I may have an idea

226
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,916
why Frey has been
attempting to eliminate you.

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,291
A loss for her at the
festival would effectively

228
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,666
end plans for the mass
production of the Garm Series.

229
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,916
[RAISHIN] And if that
happened, then all of you...

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,291
[YOMI]
...would be disposed of, yes.

231
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,583
And then, of course,

232
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,041
they would have to
introduce a different model.

233
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,375
Like Cherubim!

234
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,916
[YOMI] Correct. They would
launch the Angel Series,

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,625
to which Cherubim belongs.

236
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,041
Their individual battle
capabilities exceed any Garm's.

237
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,916
However, they are
costly to produce,

238
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,916
and are difficult to manage.

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,458
We Garms are different.

240
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,875
We are easy to control by even
the greenest of puppeteers.

241
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,375
Which makes a good deal
of sense. We are dogs.

242
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,041
Raishin, look out!

243
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,166
Yaya was quite rude before.

244
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,583
Thank you; she should be all
right until Raishin returns.

245
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,000
[CHARLOTTE] That artillery
shell is enormous.

246
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,750
But from where was it fired?

247
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,916
[SIGMUND] I don't see
any barrel marks on it.

248
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,333
The absence of
such scoring indicates

249
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,916
that it was launched
without the use of a gun.

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,291
If a weapon wasn't required,

251
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,916
the attack could have
come from anywhere!

252
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,958
This bodes ill.

253
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,791
If someone tried
to eliminate Yaya

254
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,166
as a way to force Raishin
out of the competition--

255
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,083
They'll target him next!

256
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,708
[YAYA] Raishin!

257
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,875
[RAISHIN] Aw, hang on, Yomi!
You'll be okay!

258
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,458
[RAISHIN]
Why did you block that?

259
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,083
If I die, Frey beats
me by default.

260
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,958
Here, Raishin!

261
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,083
I think I've found us
a way out of here!

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,500
Hurry up!

263
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,583
[RAISHIN] Great, more troops.

264
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,958
[YOMI] Don't die
playing the hero, son.

265
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,208
Leave me;
get your fool self out.

266
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,958
I can't just abandon you!

267
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,291
[YOMI] It's what I want.

268
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,375
These old bones are so tired.

269
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,833
I'd like to sleep now...

270
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,625
...here, with my children.

271
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:40,958
[YOMI] You did provide me

272
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,666
with a little bit of fun
in my final hours.

273
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,250
For that, you have my thanks.

274
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,666
Argh!!

275
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,333
[RAISHIN] Yomi!

276
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,041
[KOMURASAKI shrieks]

277
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,416
No! Damn them all!

278
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,208
[LOKI] What are you
staring at the gates for?

279
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,875
I'm waiting for
Raishin to come back.

280
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,416
You're going to be
waiting forever, then.

281
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,333
[FREY] Why?
What happened to him?

282
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,875
I know his automaton was
attacked and badly injured.

283
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,500
Was that you?

284
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,166
And if I told you it was?

285
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,916
What would you do, Frey?

286
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,750
Second Last
became a nuisance.

287
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,750
Uncovering secrets
best left undisturbed.

288
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,291
Our secrets.
So Father took care of him.

289
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,958
Guess I'm not quite
as dead as you think I am.

290
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,458
That one's got
ice in his veins.

291
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,083
[sniffs]

292
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,583
[FREY] You must smell like
someone Rabbi recognizes.

293
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,625
He does, and I owe
you an apology, Frey.

294
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,291
Yomi died today.

295
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,416
[RAISHIN] I dragged
her into this. I'm sorry.

296
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,166
It sounds weird but thank you.

297
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,666
Why?

298
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,291
[FREY] You let her out of
her pen before she died, right?

299
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,791
Yes, but--

300
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,625
She'd been locked
away like a prisoner

301
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,291
in that awful place for
more years than you know.

302
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,333
She must have been happy.

303
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,666
Given even that small
measure of freedom at last.

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,750
Just be mad at me.
Something!

305
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,500
Raishin!
You were gone so long!

306
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,250
Wait, what happened to you?
Were you hurt?

307
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,958
Oh, Yaya is fine. Unlike you!

308
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,041
Look at all those bandages!
What happened?

309
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,208
[RAISHIN] I uh--I messed up.

310
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,666
And Komurasaki?

311
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,375
I left her at an Army safe
house on the way back here.

312
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,833
That's not what Yaya meant!

313
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,625
Her sister was with
you the whole time!

314
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,125
Wait. Was that it?

315
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,541
Did you get hurt
because someone attacked

316
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,375
the two of you mid-tryst?

317
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,958
[RAISHIN] You're being
ridiculous. Let it go.

318
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,625
That girl is a lot more
dangerous than she seems.

319
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,958
Yaya must know!

320
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,708
Now remove
your underpants!

321
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,625
Yaya must inspect
them for evidence!

322
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,041
Made it back in
one piece, did you, boy?

323
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,583
I hope you found the
experience educational.

324
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,916
[RAISHIN] Yeah.

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,583
[SHOKO] Then you
understand why I sent you

326
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,083
to explore the orphanage?
Why it was necessary?

327
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,541
You sent me there as a decoy,

328
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,375
so you could spy on
Divine Works in the meantime.

329
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,958
[SHOKO chuckles]
That's my clever boy.

330
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,083
[RAISHIN] And did the
Army learn anything useful?

331
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,875
I'd like to know if
our mission was worth it.

332
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,708
A life was lost.

333
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,541
I'm sorry, that sounds
like a complaint.

334
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,666
And I know I have
no right to do so.

335
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,416
So you blame yourself
for what went wrong.

336
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,791
Well, that is just
downright arrogant!

337
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:46,791
S'cuse me?

338
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,958
[SHOKO]
You may have talent, boy,

339
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,541
but you're not omnipotent.

340
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,958
You can't heal the dying,
even with Yaya.

341
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,583
Do not fret over things
beyond your control.

342
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,833
I expect far better of you.

343
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,791
[SHOKO] Frey will be
entering the festival using

344
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,000
a Banned Doll.

345
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,208
With human parts
alongside the mechanical,

346
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,666
it's exceedingly
difficult to keep

347
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,958
such an automaton
alive for long.

348
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,208
But there is a way to do so,

349
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,375
provided you aren't burdened
with an overabundance of morals.

350
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,583
Yeah, by using a living
being as a vessel.

351
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,083
[SHOKO] Precisely.

352
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,625
You then need to simply provide
the nourishment necessary

353
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,500
to bring the parts
harmoniously to life.

354
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,583
Unfortunately it works

355
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,458
for a relatively
short amount of time.

356
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,583
The parts last only
as long as the vessel.

357
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,333
The "Sonic" is an
excellent magic circuit,

358
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,041
though too "heavy"
for everyday use.

359
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,916
If it could be activated
using less magic,

360
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,333
it would reduce the
strain on the puppeteer.

361
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,250
So that room I saw
in the orphanage.

362
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,875
[SHOKO] If that's what
the English Army is using

363
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,250
to maintain its supremacy,
how can Japan stay silent?

364
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,583
I'm confused.
I thought we were allies.

365
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,916
[SHOKO] For now we are.

366
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,250
[RAISHIN] Don't tell
me the Army's thinking

367
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,708
about turning on England!

368
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,250
[SHOKO] You're one
of the Army's dogs, boy.

369
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,250
Your only concern is to
follow your master's orders.

370
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,416
And speaking of which,

371
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,083
I want you to appropriate
Rahbi's magic circuit.

372
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,041
However, you must do

373
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,583
so at the festival
without arousing suspicion.

374
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,083
[RAISHIN] Whoa, wait!

375
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,333
Magic circuits are attached
directly to a doll's heart.

376
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,458
I can't remove it
without killing him!

377
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,375
You foolish boy.

378
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,125
Surely you haven't forgotten
who you're speaking to.

379
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,541
[RAISHIN] Are you
ordering me to kill Rabbi?

380
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,208
[SHOKO] Do not make
me say it again.

381
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,000
[SHOKO] Run along.
It's nearly time.

382
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,916
[HEADMASTER]
I look forward to the results

383
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,583
of your hard work
and diligent study.

384
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,625
My fellow Walpurgis competitors,
we have a sacred duty.

385
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,041
Today we honor the
source-spark of magic.

386
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,416
Today blood answers to blood!

387
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Today we shall be kings
or we shall be nothing!

388
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,750
Today, we pledge a battle true!

389
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,083
Attention students and faculty.

390
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,958
The moment is upon us!

391
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,208
Walpurgis Night begins!

392
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,708
[cheering crowd]

393
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,375
[MALE ANNOUNCER 6A] In 100th
place. Second Last. Approach!

394
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:31,041
[MALE ANNOUNCER 6A] In 99th
place. Sacred Blaze. Approach!

395
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,333
[LOKI] I told you to
withdraw from the festival.

396
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,708
You should've.

397
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,583
[RAISHIN] And I chose to
ignore you, so, here we are.

398
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,708
Time for a little payback.

399
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,708
Yaya! Whistle 24 Sho!

400
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:52,750
On it!

401
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,375
Stronghold 48 Ketsu!

402
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,000
Now, Yaya!
Flare 24 Sho!

403
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,708
Hmph! Impressive armor.
I'll concede that.

404
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,250
Even the sharpest
blades can't cut Yaya!

405
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,791
Oh, but they will.

406
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,041
As you're about to see, there's
nothing Cherubim can't cut.

407
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,875
Cherubim. Attack!

408
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,333
[CHERUBIM] Ready!

409
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,958
[RAISHIN] Move it!

410
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,125
Excellent reflexes.

411
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,083
Why are you
hesitating, Raishin?

412
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,416
Give Yaya magic! Don't worry.

413
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,125
Yaya won't get hurt.

414
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,375
You know she can hold her own!

415
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,458
Then let's do it! 24 Sho!

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,833
This is it!
Yaya can't go any further!

417
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,958
[RAISHIN] Stronghold 96 Sho!

418
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,375
[YAYA] Raishin!
