1
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,833
[CHARLOTTE] If you're looking
for the twit, he's gone.

2
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,583
[FREY] Oh! Tyrant Rex, hi.

3
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,666
Sorry about your dog.

4
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,041
I hope he heals.

5
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,875
Thanks. He's all I have.

6
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:56,041
Without him I'd--
I'd be all alone.

7
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,625
From what I've seen,
that's not the case at all.

8
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,125
You've never been alone.

9
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,291
Huh?

10
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,166
[CHARLOTTE]
There's always been someone

11
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,166
in your life who puts you first.

12
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,833
That's how it
seems to me, anyhow.

13
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,208
Now then, back to the twit.

14
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,791
[FREY] Raishin? Where did he go?

15
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,625
[CHARLOTTE]
Unless his plan's changed,

16
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,125
he's most likely nickin' pooches
from a certain orphanage.

17
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,583
Huh?! Why would he do that?

18
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,625
'Cause he's
nobler than he is smart.

19
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,291
He cannot bear to stand idly by

20
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,541
when there's a damsel
in distress somewhere.

21
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,833
It's his greatest weakness.

22
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,583
I could just strangle the git.

23
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,500
Honestly, if Professor
Kimberley found out--

24
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,875
[KIMBERLEY] As it happens,
I am already aware.

25
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,541
[KIMBERLEY]
No need for hysterics.

26
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,666
I'm not going to interfere
with his big plan--

27
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,500
quite the opposite, in fact.

28
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,208
[KIMBERLEY] If you will
abide by a few conditions,

29
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,875
I shall take you to him.

30
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,833
[KIMBERLEY]
What do you say, Charlotte?

31
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,125
You are worried about
your good friend, yes?

32
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,583
Uh, don't be daft!

33
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,000
That knobhead and
I aren't friends!

34
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,500
Really, of all the nonsense.

35
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,625
[KIMBERLEY] Not coming, then?

36
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:12,125
[CHARLOTTE]
He can handle this. I trust him.

37
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,000
Frey? How about you then?

38
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,958
Yes, I'll come.

39
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,750
What the bloody hell?

40
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,750
[GUARD 8A] Stop this!
We're on your side!

41
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,666
Okay, what are you doing here?

42
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,625
It doesn't make sense!
Make up your mind.

43
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,041
Are you my enemy or ally?

44
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,208
Does your stupidity
know no bounds?

45
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,583
The penalty for academy students
who attack civilians is death.

46
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,708
Yes, I'm well
aware of that, thank you;

47
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,041
but it doesn't matter.

48
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,375
I can prove they've been
doing illegal experiments.

49
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,791
So we can add naïvety
to your list of flaws.

50
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,416
Your so-called proof will
never see a courtroom!

51
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,750
The Church'll
hold a witch trial,

52
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,416
and you'll be
burned at the stake!

53
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Y'think so?

54
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,875
Only a moron would
underestimate me.

55
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,958
Whatever happens,
I'll never stop fighting.

56
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,166
Even if they do kill me.

57
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:30,208
Heh. Ever the noble fool.
Makes me sick.

58
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,125
[RAISHIN] Who the hell are
you to lecture me, anyway?

59
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,166
How many guards did
you just take out?

60
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,291
Police, quick!

61
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,916
A vicious criminal's
lurking over here!

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,583
[LOKI] Oh, that's how
you want to play it?

63
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,333
Inspector!
You'll wanna see this!

64
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,208
I've found their ringleader!

65
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,541
[RAISHIN] You're one
of the almighty Rounds.

66
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,000
Isn't aiding and abetting
a criminal beneath you?

67
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,583
[LOKI] Sod the Rounds.

68
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,541
I'd much rather vent my spleen
on these bastards in our way.

69
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,708
[BOTH] Well, I guess
we're both idiots!

70
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,916
[YAYA] Something wrong?

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,375
[RAISHIN] Looks like--

72
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,958
[LOKI] Lucifer.

73
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,458
[BRONSON]
This would seem my lucky day.

74
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:40,166
Procuring parts of your
calibre. And so easily.

75
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,916
I didn't even have
to lift a finger.

76
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,416
[BRONSON] Good god, son.

77
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,125
Have you taken
leave of your senses?

78
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,166
[RAISHIN] "Son?"
Then that must be Bronson.

79
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,791
[LOKI]
No, I've returned to them.

80
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,833
I've spent so long
licking your boots.

81
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,458
Obeying you without
so much as a question.

82
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,916
[LOKI] But all that
ends here and now!

83
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,166
[RAISHIN] Havin' some trouble?

84
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,416
You almost died there.

85
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
[LOKI] I'm fine.

86
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,666
Just thought I'd
leave you an opening,

87
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,416
should you wish to attack.
I'm considerate.

88
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,375
It repelled her kick?

89
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,708
This series of automatons
are very powerful.

90
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,458
Lucifer has a Jet
magic circuit, like Cherubim.

91
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,833
[KIMBERLEY] Ah.

92
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,208
So it hit her with a
high-density blast of hot air.

93
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,041
Cherubim! Spin!

94
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,708
You are an utter fool.

95
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,500
To ensure a win
in a real battle,

96
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,208
one must target the mage.

97
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:22,916
[RAISHIN]
So true!

98
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,500
Haha!

99
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:29,666
[RAISHIN screams in pain]

100
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,291
Ah! Raishin!

101
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,416
I am gravely disappointed.

102
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,833
Is there any beast more wretched

103
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,333
than the dog who
bites its master?

104
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,166
[LOKI] I obeyed. We obeyed.

105
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,625
We always did as we were told.

106
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,166
Even when our friends began
disappearing out of the blue.

107
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,833
Even after you made us
your test subjects.

108
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,791
Therefore I don't understand
why you've betrayed me now.

109
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,583
Have I not rewarded
you both amply

110
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,625
for services performed?

111
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,666
I am a humble,
tolerant person, Father.

112
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,958
However, there are three things

113
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,041
in this world I'm
afraid I cannot forgive.

114
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,583
People who think they
can order me around.

115
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,916
People who stand against me.

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,708
And, of course,

117
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,083
bastards who dare
betray my sister!

118
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,000
[CHARLOTTE]
There's always been someone

119
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,166
in your life who puts you first.

120
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,333
That's how it
seems to me, anyhow.

121
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,625
[BRONSON] It's a shame, really.

122
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,166
I went to some
trouble acquiring you

123
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,541
and your sister
for my experiments.

124
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,708
[BRONSON] I journeyed
all the way to the States.

125
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,166
And even then,

126
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,541
spiriting you away required
more than one cheap trick.

127
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,416
Just lie here quietly.
I won't kill you.

128
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,666
Not here--I'd much rather
disassemble you alive.

129
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,916
So. Still up
and about, are you?

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,125
Remarkable,
for an Oriental specimen.

131
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,708
Are you a special model?

132
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,916
You still strong
enough to fight?

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,916
Do you truly have to ask?

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,375
Give me a hand then?

135
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,958
Suppose I can.

136
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,958
Don't get used
to it, though.

137
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,541
[BRONSON]
Come up

138
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,958
with some ridiculous
little trick, have you?

139
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,166
[RAISHIN] Yeah.

140
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,208
A ridiculous little
trick that will end you.

141
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,291
But first things first;

142
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,000
I want to know why
you lied to Frey.

143
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,750
You never planned
to let the Garms live.

144
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,958
So why did you
force her to fight?

145
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,916
Why did you try to make
her something she's not?

146
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,125
Why did you pollute her heart?

147
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,791
[BRONSON] Because that
is the way of the world.

148
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,500
[RAISHIN]
What are you talking about?

149
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,291
[BRONSON] Scientific
advancement occurs only

150
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,333
when there is
continual progress.

151
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,875
Forward motion.

152
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,666
We can allow neither
stasis nor regression.

153
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,916
For mankind, the absence
of progress leads

154
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,541
to only one thing--
Rapid decline and extinction.

155
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,250
Probing life's mysteries,
seeking its truths.

156
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,916
That is what humans
were created to do.

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,625
It is our proper path.

158
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,666
Because of our gifts,

159
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,000
we magi are
especially responsible.

160
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,791
That is the academy's purpose,

161
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,208
and the entire reason the
title of Wise Man exists.

162
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,250
It's a fact of life.

163
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,416
Oft times the ends
do justify the means.

164
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,000
[thinking] "Advancement?"
"Progress?" That's why?

165
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,541
That's the reason?

166
00:11:55,625 --> 00:12:00,208
Why my mother and father,
and Loki, and I...?

167
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,791
[RAISHIN]
If murdering children's families

168
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,708
is considered progress.

169
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,541
Then mankind can
go straight to hell!

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,208
Their combined
heat welded them together?

171
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,958
Not good enough.

172
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,500
What was--?

173
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,416
[KIMBERLEY thinking]
She repelled the blast

174
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,208
of hot air with a shockwave.

175
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,916
Did Second Last know the
Jet Circuit's secret all along?

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,833
In order to block
Lucifer's blow,

177
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,416
he would need to dispel its heat

178
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,458
with a jet of the
same temperature.

179
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,041
He must have deduced as much,

180
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,916
hid explosives
in Yaya's sleeves,

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,125
and then saved them
for this very moment.

182
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,291
The lad has nerves of steel.

183
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,833
Well, look who's
not all talk.

184
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,041
I'd originally
planned to use

185
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,916
that as my trump
card against you.

186
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,958
Yaya, Final Whistle.

187
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,583
Hisagi Sword Glint!

188
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,041
Hey, Second Last,
you still alive over there?

189
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,125
[RAISHIN] You're not looking
so good yourself, Blade Emperor.

190
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,000
Think you can even stand up?

191
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,333
Don't be absurd.

192
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,208
I'm only taking a short
break to catch my breath.

193
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,250
You're the one who looks
like he'll never walk again.

194
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,083
[RAISHIN] I'll be fine.
I'm just looking at the stars.

195
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,416
They're nice tonight.

196
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,666
Stargazing happens
to be a hobby of mine.

197
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,708
You do a lot of
face-down stargazing?

198
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,416
Because I'd think it would be
rather tough in that position.

199
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,416
Why not simply admit
that you're half-dead?

200
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,083
I promise I won't
mock you for it.

201
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,708
[RAISHIN] Like I said, I'm fine.

202
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,000
<i>You</i> must be in pretty
terrible shape, though.

203
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,500
You oughtta get to a hospital

204
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,041
and have the doctors see to
your scrapes and scratches.

205
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,500
I can carry you there
if you need me to.

206
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,041
[LOKI] You're the one
who should be there,

207
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,583
having nurses hand-feeding you

208
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,750
and giving you blanket-baths
while you regain your strength.

209
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,791
[RAISHIN] How stupid are you?

210
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,333
That would be
awful for my health!

211
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,458
You know why?

212
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,041
Because Yaya would murder me!

213
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,458
[YAYA] No talking, Raishin.
Please, take it easy.

214
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,541
[LOKI] You are a
complete imbecile.

215
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,291
[RAISHIN] Am not! You are!

216
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,250
[BRONSON thinking]
A shame to sacrifice Lucifer,

217
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,250
but at least Cherubim survived.

218
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,041
I'll still have something
to showcase in the festival.

219
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,541
Raishin! Raishin!

220
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,875
This infuriating one, however.

221
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,458
I think I shall have to
put down. Then I still win.

222
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,250
Though I'd prefer
a less dull ending.

223
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,541
[gunshot]

224
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,208
[KIMBERLEY]
Dreadfully sorry, Bronson.

225
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,791
Does this liven it up?

226
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,375
[BRONSON] What is the
meaning of this intrusion?

227
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,458
Explain yourselves at once!

228
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,041
[KIMBERLEY] We are Crusaders.

229
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,208
You may know us better

230
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,791
as the Brotherhood
of the Magi's Watchdogs.

231
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,250
So you're with Nectar.

232
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,458
Doing background checks on
your students now, are you?

233
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,875
[KIMBERLEY] Sort of.

234
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,083
There's a bit of trouble over
this year's festival.

235
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,083
Leading us to this
enlightening home visit.

236
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,583
Divine Works.

237
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,500
Arrogant enough to claim
you're touched by God's hand.

238
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,583
Now you're under arrest
for practicing forbidden arts.

239
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,000
[BRONSON] Beg pardon?

240
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,958
[KIMBERLEY]
I have evidence: Modification,

241
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,041
experimentation, and
abandonment of human subjects.

242
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,375
Additional charges will
now be filed, of course,

243
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,291
for the heinous crimes
of kidnapping and murder.

244
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,750
From what I observed,

245
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,291
your automaton seemed more
high-precision than Loki's.

246
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,625
Yet you couldn't even manage

247
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,083
to beat a pair of teenaged boys.

248
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,416
So the former pretty boy,

249
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,958
once hailed as an angel,
crashes into middle age.

250
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,291
Instead of wielding
swords with telekinesis,

251
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,833
you rely on a machine.

252
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,041
Calling it Lucifer only made
your bitterness more apparent.

253
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,000
You were "Sword Angel."

254
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,291
And now look at you.

255
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,708
I've regrets, perhaps.

256
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,291
But I harbor no bitterness.

257
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,833
[KIMBERLEY] No?

258
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,125
I should have been
Wise Man all those years ago.

259
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,750
I would not now
be facing charges

260
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,416
for a few little experiments.

261
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,000
Your ignorance surprises me.

262
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,833
I truly believed you
were more intelligent.

263
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,458
And what does that mean?

264
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,833
While the Wise Man is not bound

265
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,916
by the Mage Code of Ethics,
as the rest of us are.

266
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,541
He or she is still
bound by the law.

267
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,833
All human experimentation

268
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,375
requires consent of the subject.

269
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,375
[KIMBERLEY] Children, like
those who you preyed upon,

270
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,541
cannot give their consent.

271
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:48,916
Even the Wise Man
is not allowed to do that.

272
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,958
[sighs]

273
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,208
[KIMBERLEY thinking]
Blind fool.

274
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,208
So consumed by the
idea of playing God,

275
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,333
and in the end, God played you.

276
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:04,416
The gallows suit you far better
than the Wise Man's throne.

277
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,166
Good Lord.

278
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,791
These children will turn
my hair gray before its time.

279
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:19,666
[bells tolling]

280
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,333
Tee hee! Be a good boy!
Time to undress!

281
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,333
If you don't
remove your underpants,

282
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,666
Yaya won't be able
to make you better!

283
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,625
This is not how a
nurse is supposed to behave!

284
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,125
It's unprofessional!

285
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,375
I am a humble, tolerant person.

286
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,416
However, there are three
things I simply cannot abide.

287
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,875
People who order me around.

288
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,916
People who stand against me.

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,166
And no-good foreigners

290
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,125
who take advantage of
nurses in the infirmary!

291
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,416
If you hate it so much,
help me make her stop!

292
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,458
Why do you need my help?
She's your automaton!

293
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,000
That's right,
Yaya is Raishin's beloved doll.

294
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,500
Now ignore him and pet
Yaya like you always do.

295
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,583
[LOKI] Unbelievable!

296
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,541
[RAISHIN]
Nothing she says is true!

297
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,458
She's lying, I swear!

298
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,625
[RAISHIN] Uh, Frey!
Good to see you!

299
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,625
I hear you've won
all your battles so far.

300
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,625
Yes, thanks to
Rabbi and Riviera.

301
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,666
Oh, and Ruby, too.
And Reveena and Robin.

302
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,166
They all work so hard.
I'm quite proud of them.

303
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,458
[RAISHIN] Riviera.
Ruby. Reveen--Um.

304
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,125
Can I just call 'em the Five Rs?

305
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,916
Huh?

306
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,291
Loki.

307
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,833
It's because of you that
they're still here with me.

308
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,333
Please, I didn't
do anything.

309
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,125
You should be thanking
this idiot instead.

310
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah, don't believe
a word he says.

311
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,208
You shoulda seen
the look on his face

312
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,125
when you almost died.

313
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,958
Do you want to die?

314
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,291
Think you can defeat me?

315
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,916
Let's go. I'll rip
that pretty face off.

316
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,708
[FREY] Stop it!
Loki! No fighting!

317
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,916
C'mon, Raishin might be
part of our family soon!

318
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:47,166
[FREY]
Uh... um... eh...

319
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,916
[FREY shrieks]

320
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,541
[RAISHIN] Yeah um,
what did she say?

321
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,958
I must not have heard her right.

322
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,291
So you are in a
relationship with that vixen?

323
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,791
Just when did you
start dating my sister?

324
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,875
Never, that's when!
You two are nuts!

325
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,208
[YAYA] Where did that coward go?

326
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,375
Coward.

327
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,916
[sighs]

328
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,125
[RAISHIN] Oh, it's you. Hi.

329
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,583
[FREY] Sorry about all this.

330
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,000
Loki's temper gets out
of control sometimes.

331
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,500
[RAISHIN] Don't worry.

332
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,583
He and I will settle things
eventually, at the festival.

333
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,000
[FREY] You could report
him to administration.

334
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,291
Well, I don't want to
get him expelled or anything.

335
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,416
He beat me once.

336
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,000
I just want a chance
to even the score.

337
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,875
So, are you gonna
continue competing?

338
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,291
Yeah.

339
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,000
I need to be Wise Man
so I can use forbidden arts.

340
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,583
What for?

341
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,875
[FREY] So I can put Loki's and
my hearts back to normal again.

342
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,458
[RAISHIN] Hell of a plan.

343
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,833
Though Loki's probably intending
to try the same thing, you know.

344
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,000
I've never done the things

345
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,791
for him that a
big sister's supposed to.

346
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,125
So it has to be me.

347
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,375
I won't even lose
to you, Raishin.

348
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,041
Yeah, we'll see.

349
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,833
Sigmund?

350
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,333
No, just a dove.

351
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,291
[thinking] I haven't
seen Char in a while.

352
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,541
Not since that night.

353
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,541
I can always count
on your stupidity.

354
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,416
It's as reliable as Big Ben!

355
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,166
Didn't realize I'd made
her that angry with me.

356
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,166
Char? No, that's not her.

357
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,708
Hey.

358
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,500
Yaya!

359
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,333
Great timing, Yaya!
If it wasn't for you--

360
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,500
[YAYA] You're an idiot.
You scared Yaya!

361
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,375
How could you?

362
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,041
She just jumped;

363
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,916
I didn't exactly
have time to think.

364
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,083
Hey, are you all right?

365
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,000
You're not hurt too badly?

366
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,958
Ahhh!!

367
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,958
A man touched me!

368
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,916
I just saved
your life here!

369
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,166
Hmph! That's
exactly the problem!

370
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,500
Did I look like
I wanted help?

371
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,708
Did I ask to be rescued?

372
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,750
Why did you
save me, you cad?

373
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,291
As recompense, I ask
that you now kill me.

374
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,250
Or, at the very least, you
must give me a sound beating.

375
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,750
What the hell
are you saying?

376
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,250
Ravage my body
in whatever way

377
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,333
your basest instincts desire.

378
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,875
Do with me what you will.
I shan't object.

379
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,041
Make me an outlet for
your animal passions.

380
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,125
Disgusting!

381
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,833
What kind of freak
do you think I am?

382
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,791
Since the vixen asked so
nicely, Yaya will beat her.

383
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,750
No, Yaya, you will not.

384
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,833
[RAISHIN] Hey! Come back!

385
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,458
[YAYA] You want to
have your way with her!

386
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,500
And use her for your
carnal animal passions!

387
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,541
For once, could you
read the social cues here?

388
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,916
You deny Yaya when
she throws herself at you.

389
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,750
So tell me what makes
this vixen so special!

390
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,958
[YAYA] What is that?

391
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,250
[RAISHIN] Char!
