1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,458
[RAISHIN] "Machine-doll"?
What is that?

2
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,875
How's it different from
a regular automaton?

3
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,833
Your ignorance
disappoints me, Master Akabane.

4
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:57,166
But I'll wager your
friend knows. Don't you?

5
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,791
That noble education
you received

6
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,458
must be worth something.

7
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,541
He's saying
he's a perfect doll.

8
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,583
As in, one which can
operate with complete,

9
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,958
perfect independence.

10
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,583
Quite right, dear.

11
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,625
I am both machine and doll.

12
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,958
]And yet, I am far
different from any doll

13
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,333
or any machine
you've ever known.

14
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,666
I truly am a divine creation.

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,750
[RAISHIN] Do you have a point?

16
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,833
'Cause so far,
I haven't heard one.

17
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,083
[SHIN] Apologies.

18
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,666
Talented as I am, I am
not without my failings.

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,958
If I had to name but
one flaw, it would be...

20
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,375
[RAISHIN] ...that your
explanations ramble on and on?

21
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,833
Precisely.

22
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:34,250
To sum up: as an individual,
I am complete unto myself.

23
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,500
And imperfect beings,
like you children,

24
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,125
stand no chance
against me whatsoever.

25
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,833
You shall not win.

26
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,541
[SHOKO] You've come
to a crossroads.

27
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,166
You can take one of
two paths tonight.

28
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,625
You can die of exposure
here, sad and alone,

29
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,708
or you can die when you
finally battle Tenzen Akabane.

30
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,875
[RAISHIN] Are you saying you'll
give me a chance to fight 'im?

31
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:04,708
If such is your wish,
I'm saying exactly that.

32
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,250
[RAISHIN] Then as of
this moment, I'm yours.

33
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,583
[SHOKO] Clever boy. Let us
clarify the terms of our deal.

34
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:11,666
[RAISHIN] Our deal?

35
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,125
[SHOKO] I am not
utterly bereft of mercy.

36
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:18,791
I may revere no deity, but
neither am I some sort of demon.

37
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,666
I'll give you a sporting chance.

38
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,041
Who knows, perhaps you'll
die a natural death after all.

39
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,291
Depends on you.

40
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,541
And what
does that mean?

41
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,208
[SHOKO] If you can defeat
Tenzen, you've succeeded.

42
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:34,291
If you cannot then
I will take your body.

43
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,916
[RAISHIN] N' what the
hell makes me so special?

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,416
I have a rather difficult
goal to achieve.

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,250
To do so, I need living
Crimson-Wing blood.

46
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,083
Meaning Akabane.

47
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,000
Fine, then.
I agree to your terms.

48
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,583
If this body's what you
need, you can have it.

49
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,666
[IRORI] Master?

50
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,875
[SHOKO] I was thinking about
my troublesome wretch of a boy.

51
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,416
Such a naughty child;
off doing whatever he pleases,

52
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,958
heedless of the fact
that he agreed to be mine.

53
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,291
It's not like you
to complain, Master.

54
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,666
Surely it will be fine.

55
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,958
You know Raishin's
heart better than anyone.

56
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,958
[SHOKO chuckles] Impressive.

57
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,250
Normally you'd be
expending mountains

58
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,166
of energy fretting
over Yaya's well-being.

59
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,750
I do nothing of the sort!
I am always perfectly calm.

60
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,208
[KOMURASAKI] C'mon, as
long as she's with Raishin,

61
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,958
we don't need to worry
about Yaya, right?

62
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,166
Yes, yes.
Yaya will be fine.

63
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,500
Better than fine, in fact.

64
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,416
She'll eat the boy
and grow ever closer.

65
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:34,375
And then someone's dream
will finally come true.

66
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,583
Give it back! I don't
deserve to live!

67
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,083
Why can't you
just let me die?

68
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,416
To be perfectly honest,

69
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,333
it doesn't matter to me
whether you die or not.

70
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,666
Then why on Earth are
you trying to stop me?

71
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,208
Because Raishin
will be sad if you do.

72
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,916
Think about Tyrant Rex.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,583
She cares about you, too.

74
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,708
She's doing something horrible
so you don't have to be killed.

75
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,041
Raishin said as much, too,

76
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,291
but it's still hard
to bear. I can't!

77
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,750
Tyrant Rex, uh, Charlotte,
explained the situation to me,

78
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,666
so I understand
better than you think.

79
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,875
[FREY] Why would
you tell me all this?

80
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,000
[CHARLOTTE] I can handle
the twit if it's just him,

81
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,375
but if you get involved, too,

82
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,083
it'll make things much
more difficult on me.

83
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,625
If he knows
I've been threatened,

84
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,750
he'll try to help.

85
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,083
He'll insist on
playing the hero.

86
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,750
Then why not tell him?

87
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,000
You dumb cow!

88
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,708
Neither of us will tell
him because if we do,

89
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,916
he'll put himself in danger.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,750
[FREY] Raishin risks his life
for people, simple as that.

91
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,375
If someone's in
trouble, he helps.

92
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,958
It's just who he is.

93
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,208
The least we can do is not make
it any more difficult on him.

94
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,041
So no more
suicide attempts.

95
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,250
Raishin deserves better.

96
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,750
I'll leave most of the
dogs here with you,

97
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,291
and Loki's around
if you need him.

98
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,291
[FREY] Rabbi!

99
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,791
Frey, where are you going?

100
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,791
I'm going to
go help Raishin.

101
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,125
After all he's done for me,
I owe him that much.

102
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,000
[FREY] Do you want to come?

103
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,791
Bastard, hold still!

104
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,958
[CHARLOTTE] Sigmund!
Are you all right?

105
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,083
[SIGMUND] Yes.
Don't you worry about me.

106
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,875
[CHARLOTTE] Pathetic
showing on our part.

107
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:10,416
Only one man and he's got us
completely at his mercy.

108
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,041
You think you
can keep going?

109
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,291
I'm nearly drained
of magic energy.

110
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,166
And you don't have
some kinda backup plan?

111
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,625
What kind of
plan would I have?

112
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,041
I can't do much of
anything without energy!

113
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,208
How about you?

114
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,875
Mister "Always-Has-a-
Trick-Up-His-Sleeve!"

115
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,541
Sorry.

116
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:28,875
[RAISHIN thinking]
With our lack of magic,

117
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,791
brute force is the best bet.

118
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,916
But he dodges all our big moves,

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,958
and lots of small strikes
won't do enough damage.

120
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,250
Wait! Can you handle one
more shot if I need it?

121
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,375
[CHARLOTTE] Please.
I could vaporize Big Ben

122
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,791
if you asked me to.

123
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,791
[RAISHIN] That's our Char.

124
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,583
[HENRIETTE] There's Charlotte!

125
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,375
And Raishin!

126
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,333
Here we go.

127
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,708
Ready!

128
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,000
What was that?
Why did he--?

129
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,375
Did Raishin turn
his back on purpose?

130
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,708
I'm confused.

131
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,333
If he had been attacked
from the front, then what?

132
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,208
It was risky, I admit,
but it turned out all right.

133
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,958
Sorry, I'm afraid
that's where you're wrong.

134
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,041
It matters little how
strong your doll is,

135
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,583
she cannot harm me.

136
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,208
I do respect your gamble,
but it didn't pay off.

137
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,625
It shan't take me
long to dispatch her!

138
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,833
You gave us the
solution yourself, y'know.

139
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,125
You may be a
"machine-doll" or whatever,

140
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,041
but you're still
"not without your failings."

141
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,833
Final Flare, Yaya.

142
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,208
[RAISHIN] Swirling
Night Blossoms!

143
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,250
[breathing heavily]

144
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,250
We just had to
think logically.

145
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,833
If her punches have
no effect on him,

146
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,750
why would he even bother
dodging Yaya's attacks?

147
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,875
Obviously, he's hurt
more than he's letting on.

148
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,000
[RAISHIN] Whatever this
Machine-Doll's all about,

149
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,541
it doesn't matter.

150
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,416
If you're alive, using magical
power will wear you out.

151
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,333
[loud crash]

152
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,458
Your turn, Char! Go now!

153
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,541
Lustre Cannon!

154
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,916
Can't be.

155
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,041
There--just as I thought.
His puppeteer's nearby.

156
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,250
Riviera!

157
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,625
[barks]

158
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,750
Oh my, what a surprise.

159
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,708
How ever were you so certain
I was close at hand?

160
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,375
Doesn't matter, now listen up.

161
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,041
Your butler
explained what he is,

162
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,541
but I need you to fill
in some of the gaps.

163
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,791
Continue.

164
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,541
Given what little
I do know about him,

165
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,083
I've just been treating
him like an automaton.

166
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,958
What a fascinating
thought process.

167
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,666
And not far off the mark.

168
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,750
Even a "machine-doll"
needs his puppeteer

169
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,166
when he runs out of energy.

170
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,083
And since you're lucky enough
to have a dog around,

171
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,875
you can track the
magic by smell. Huh.

172
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,875
And now here we are,
Cedric Granville.

173
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,541
Head Festival Administrator.

174
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,958
You're gonna tell me everything.

175
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,708
\You're a clever one,
I'll give you that.

176
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,416
Always seeming two
or three moves ahead

177
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,000
of where I expect you to be.

178
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,791
I was impressed when you brought
in Sacred Blaze like you did.

179
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,750
And then to use
Silent Roar to corner me!

180
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,208
Why, that was a
stroke of pure genius!

181
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,833
Still, if you think
this is checkmate,

182
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,500
you're sorely mistaken.

183
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,083
Raishin, behind you!

184
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,083
I'm afraid
you're one move short.

185
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,000
Raishin!

186
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,083
[RAISHIN] What in the world?

187
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,083
[CEDRIC]
You're in a sorry state, Shin.

188
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,875
Yes, master.

189
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,166
Let's return home.
You can make tea.

190
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,708
[SHIN] I would be happy to.

191
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,833
[CEDRIC] The fight
was not without its merits.

192
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,916
At the least, we learned
something interesting.

193
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,541
Apologies, I failed you.

194
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,916
No.

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,208
You overwhelmed two
Rounds-level opponents, Shin.

196
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,833
And better, you accomplished it
without the aid of a puppeteer.

197
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,583
I imagine that's
more than enough

198
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,750
to make the machine-doll's
presence felt.

199
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,291
Nevertheless, I am
sorry I lost the battle.

200
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,666
Though I'm curious about
that doll called "Yaya."

201
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,666
Could she be--?

202
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,875
Hah hah...

203
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,208
Set aside the
disappointments of the day.

204
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,916
I'm in a wonderful mood.

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,666
I'm fairly bouncing;
like a child with a new toy!

206
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,083
[CEDRIC]
It's all so brilliant!

207
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,541
They shall dance delightfully
in the palm of my hand!

208
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,500
[SHIN] I am talented,
as befits a Bernstein butler,

209
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,208
but I'm not without my failings.

210
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,666
If I had to name one flaw,
it's that I'm a tad cowardly.

211
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,375
Whatever do you have
to be afraid of, Shin?

212
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,916
Those dancers in your palm.

213
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,375
I fear they may
one day leap free

214
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,208
of your hand, young mistress.

215
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,000
Then where would we be?

216
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,208
You don't get it.

217
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,416
That's precisely
why I'm excited.

218
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,875
I'm looking even more forward to
the festival than I already was.

219
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,458
Is that so?

220
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,375
Could it be you're having those
wicked thoughts again, Mistress?

221
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,291
Why do you think
I accepted this wretched rank

222
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,333
in the first place?

223
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,583
It certainly wasn't

224
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,750
because I deserve to be
in eighty-seventh place.

225
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,500
For I am Elf Speeder.

226
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,000
I am the unstoppable
Alice Bernstein!

227
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,958
Such a pleasure meeting you

228
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,958
and that machine-doll
of yours, Second Last.

229
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,625
I so look forward

230
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,583
to renewing our acquaintance
on Festival Grounds.

231
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,000
Glad I wasn't all that
worried about you, twit.

232
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,416
I knew you'd
be just as hard

233
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,541
to kill as you are hard-headed.

234
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,375
I'm so sorry, Charlotte.

235
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,791
[CHARLOTTE] I'm sorry as well.

236
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,833
[HENRIETTE] What?

237
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,375
[CHARLOTTE]
When we were growing up,

238
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,708
I suppose I wasn't always the
easiest person to live with.

239
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,041
I felt so comfortable with you,

240
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,208
but perhaps it
seemed like arrogance.

241
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,583
I doubt this makes
things easier,

242
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,666
but there are times when
I feel inferior to you, too.

243
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,750
[HENRIETTE] To me? Truly?

244
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,208
Is it that surprising?

245
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,541
You're more than a full
inch bigger than me.

246
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,250
That's not true.

247
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,208
We're still almost
the same height.

248
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,333
Not that.

249
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,333
[HENRIETTE] Huh?

250
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,750
D'aw! Blast it!
Bosoms, all right?

251
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:04,458
I meant to carry that
secret to the grave!

252
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,208
What are you
looking at, deviant?

253
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,375
This is personal!

254
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,083
No more hitting!
I got broken bones, here!

255
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,833
[CHARLOTTE] I can't risk it!
I'm now forced to kill you!

256
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,041
Sigmund, melt this twit!

257
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,000
[SIGMUND] Now, now, Char.
Calm down.

258
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,333
[CHARLOTTE] What?

259
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,541
[SIGMUND] I hate to be
the one to tell you this,

260
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,125
but your secret, er,
padding, shall we say?

261
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,125
It's not as secret
as you might think.

262
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:25,791
[CHARLOTTE gasps]

263
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,125
I understand now.

264
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,458
You should have said something!

265
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:33,708
[CHARLOTTE] You wipe that
smile off your face! Heifer!

266
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,791
[KIMBERLEY] Burning the
midnight oil again, eh Magnus?

267
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,458
Awake all night, were you?

268
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,833
[MAGNUS] Just as you were.

269
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,500
It would be a shame to ruin
such beauty, Professor.

270
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,500
[KIMBERLEY] Roped into playing

271
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,333
the headmaster's
bodyguard, I see.

272
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,125
Being talented can
have its disadvantages.

273
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,625
Sometimes it is wiser
to hide your talons.

274
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,833
Isn't that how your
Japanese proverb goes?

275
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,791
It is a bit of a laugh,
though, yeah?

276
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:02,041
That hack had the temerity to
call himself a Machine-Doll.

277
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,041
Certainly you can't have
believed a word of his nonsense.

278
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,458
This is your area of expertise.

279
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,583
There's a story
I wonder if you've heard.

280
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,916
Apparently some fool

281
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,333
from a backwater village
in the Far East attempted

282
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,875
to make a machine-doll out
of a living girl's body.

283
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,250
This happened
just two years ago.

284
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,041
Using living creatures
results in a Banned Doll,

285
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,583
not a Machine-Doll.

286
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,000
Initially, yes.

287
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,458
But developing any
new technology requires

288
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,125
some research and
experimentation.

289
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,541
It would make a
certain amount of sense

290
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,250
for someone to begin
mass-producing Banned Dolls

291
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,958
in an effort to create
a full machine-doll.

292
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,458
[MAGNUS] What exactly
are you suggesting?

293
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,958
[KIMBERLEY]
I am suggesting that Nectar

294
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,458
is keeping an eye on you,
Tenzen Akabane.

295
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,666
Nothing?
You don't deny it?

296
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,958
[MAGNUS] Nor do I confirm it.

297
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,125
My identity is of
no real consequence.

298
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,250
Either way,
I <i>shall</i> stay my course,

299
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,583
and Raishin <i>will</i> try to kill me.

300
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,375
So what difference
could it possibly make?

301
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,541
[KIMBERLEY] One warning.
Not as your professor,

302
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,208
but simply as someone
who's lived longer.

303
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,583
Go ahead,
I'm listening.

304
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,791
Keep one thing at the
forefront of your mind:

305
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,791
the manufacture of human life
is magic's greatest taboo.

306
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,708
[MAGNUS] I appreciate
your guidance.

307
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,083
Now then.

308
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,875
I am rather curious to
learn who will be the first

309
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,958
to accept the poisoned
fruit and take a bite.

310
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:36,458
[construction sounds]

311
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,666
[HENRIETTE] All right. Time
to eat. "Ah!" Here it comes!

312
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,750
Look, it's not that I don't
appreciate the gesture--

313
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,666
Just one bite!

314
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,083
[RAISHIN] Yaya.

315
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,791
[HENRIETTE] You need food
to get your strength back!

316
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,208
[HENRIETTE] If you don't eat,
you'll never get better!

317
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,375
I dunno why you're so
concerned about that fool.

318
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,000
I hope he doesn't get better!

319
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,166
If he's gonna re-break bones
I mended, he doesn't deserve to.

320
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,666
No, sir!

321
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,000
That's a horrible
thing to say!

322
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,625
Surely you don't mean it!

323
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,083
Please heal him again, doctor!

324
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,708
He'll be a much better
patient this time.

325
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,375
I'll make certain!

326
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,000
Lovely. I've not
seen you before.

327
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,625
You must be new.

328
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:21,166
[HENRIETTE] A man!
Get away from me!

329
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,458
A pretty girl
such as you is welcome

330
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,083
in the infirmary any time.

331
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,791
Come and visit
whenever you'd like.

332
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,125
Now, what're you called, love?

333
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,458
Henriette. Who happens
to be my younger sister.

334
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:42,666
[CRUEL] Tyrant Rex's sister?
Criminy, just what I need.

335
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,541
I'm-- eh. I'm sorry
for the inconvenience.

336
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,583
Forget about it,

337
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,916
I just did what
I thought was right.

338
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,125
Anyway, it's nice having
you both in the same room;

339
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,875
now I can see the resemblance.
Seriously, it--

340
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,291
[CHARLOTTE] You cad!

341
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,791
I saw where you were
lookin' when you said that!

342
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,708
What? What'd I say to
piss you off this time?

343
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,375
Just stay calm, okay?

344
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,750
Calm?

345
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,208
Why don't you just admit
you're a bosom-obsessed git

346
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,541
who judges a woman's worth
by what's under her blouse?

347
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,333
I have had enough, you twit!

348
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,416
Leave me be and make friends
with Miss Mammaries over there!

349
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:36,875
[CHARLOTTE] What's wrong, Frey?

350
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,125
Do you take issue with that?

351
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,333
You may not realize it,

352
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,500
but bigger doesn't
necessarily mean better!

353
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,666
[CHARLOTTE] I'm sure it
must be simply awful for you!

354
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,916
It can be, yes!
Bathing's the worst!

355
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,750
My back and arms
get so exhausted!

356
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,791
[CHARLOTTE]
Are you puttin' me on?

357
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,666
Oh, sure, I'm just fine then!

358
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,708
All because mine
are so easy to wash!

359
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,458
[bawls]

360
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,500
[CHARLOTTE] Oh, Henri!

361
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,666
[HENRIETTE]
There, there, Charlotte.

362
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,000
Don't worry, it'll
be fine, Henri's here.

363
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,000
Anyway, I'm sure Raishin
likes the small ones, too.

364
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,333
He doesn't strike me as the type

365
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,583
who's terribly picky about
the ladies he's with.

366
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,333
That doesn't make
me sound any better!

367
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,125
I'm not some kinda animal,
thank you very much!

368
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,333
You don't appreciate
a smaller bosom?

369
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,708
I was so sure you would.

370
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,958
Stop assuming things!

371
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,583
You two certainly
have your problems,

372
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,583
but it has nothing to do
with the size of your chests!

373
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,083
What a mean thing to say
after all we've been through!

374
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,708
You said you felt
like you knew me!

375
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,333
Like we had a connection!

376
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:32,541
Felt like you knew her?
What's going on here?

377
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:37,208
Raishin's a sick, filthy,
deviant. Just ask my dogs.

378
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,125
[RAISHIN] Your dogs?
Aren't we past that?

379
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,291
I'm the only not-sick one here!

380
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:49,000
Hey, uh, Loki? I think you
dropped somethin' here.

381
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,583
I am a humble and
tolerant person,

382
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,375
but one thing
I simply cannot abide

383
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,208
is idiots who
interrupt my studies!

384
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,750
Wait, this
isn't my fault!

385
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,791
You know how these
dingbats can be!

386
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,208
Stop making excuses!

387
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,541
This kind of thing happens

388
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,583
because you're careless
with women's feelings, jerk!

389
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,875
You're the jerk, jerk!
Were you even listening?

390
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,541
At no point did I say anything
that was disrespectful to women!

391
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,041
[chuckling]

392
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,083
[YAYA] Naughty Raishin.

393
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:18,375
Disrespecting women again?
That will not do.

394
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,208
Funny, how I expect the
infirmary to be a quiet place.

395
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,166
[KIMBERLEY] You seem to be
enjoying some popularity

396
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,458
with the ladies.

397
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,708
[RAISHIN] Not you, too!

398
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,250
I'm tired of being made
out to be the bad guy.

399
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,541
I've done nothing wrong!

400
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,833
Well, it is convenient
you're all here.

401
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,541
We've just about sorted
out this whole mess.

402
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,833
I assume you want to know

403
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,958
what Headmaster
Rutherford has decided?

404
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,916
First off, the clock tower
is going to be rebuilt.

405
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,875
Naturally, doing so
will cost a fortune.

406
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,166
However, we'll use assets
from the Belew earldom.

407
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,791
The ones that were
frozen by the crown

408
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,083
following the unfortunate
automaton incident.

409
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,583
In other words,
the government will pay

410
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:06,208
for it with funds
confiscated from our family.

411
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,833
You're certain of this?

412
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,291
How'd you manage those
financial acrobatics?

413
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,333
I'm not privy
to all the details.

414
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,166
But according to the headmaster,

415
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,125
a certain wealthy
party put in a good word

416
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,791
with Parliament on our behalf.

417
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,125
[RAISHIN]
Wealthy party?

418
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,875
[KIMBERLEY] Someone with
a daughter at the academy.

419
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,416
So, mind your manners
with your fellow students.

420
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,708
Hmm?

421
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,125
The next situation you may
already be aware of.

422
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,041
The admissions board has
found some inconsistencies--

423
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,250
no, let's be honest--

424
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,666
some blatant lies in
Henriette's application.

425
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,625
Her enrollment here is
being revoked, but--

426
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,708
Wha--?

427
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,166
And this is the
reason for her outfit,

428
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,458
I've decided to let her stay
on campus as my lab maid.

429
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,750
So, don't worry
about your sister;

430
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,125
under my wing,
I'm sure she'll flourish.

431
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,291
Wonderful news!

432
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,666
[HENRIETTE]
Yes, thank you so much!

433
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,833
No, need for all that.

434
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,750
It actually works out
quite well for me.

435
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,583
The rest of you children
were already deep in my debt.

436
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,791
And now I have a marker

437
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,416
with Tyrant Rex's
name on it, as well.

438
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,208
[KIMBERLEY]
That's all I came to say.

439
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:06,083
Heal swiftly, boys;
and do take it easy.

440
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,583
[thinking] This isn't
over yet. Not by a longshot.

441
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:15,083
That so-called machine-doll,
and his puppeteer.

442
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,875
What are they after?

443
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,958
[thinking]
And what do I do next?

444
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,708
[YAYA] Raishin? Are you awake?

445
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,125
[RAISHIN] No.

446
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,416
[YAYA] Your new friends--

447
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,541
They're good people,
aren't they?

448
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,875
[RAISHIN] I'm not in love
with any of them. Let it go.

449
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,250
[YAYA] Denying it
is very suspicious.

450
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,083
[YAYA] Yaya just means,
before all is said and done,

451
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,458
we'll have to
fight them, won't we?

452
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:04,625
[RAISHIN] Yeah.

453
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,416
[YAYA] Yaya has to
fight Sigmund and Rabbi.

454
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,000
[RAISHIN] There's
nothing to worry about.

455
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,250
You know you're the best
automaton in the whole world.

456
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,500
That's not what
Yaya is afraid of.

457
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,291
[RAISHIN] I'll become
more powerful, too.

458
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:19,791
Make myself a puppeteer
worthy of you. All right?

459
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,750
We'll fight our way
through this stupid-ass war,

460
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,458
and we'll do it together!

461
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,541
Right!

462
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,500
But then you know
what that means.

463
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,250
What?

464
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,458
You just made
a solemn vow

465
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,916
to become a man worthy of Yaya!

466
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,291
No, I did not.

467
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,875
That's just how your
twisted brain interpreted it!

468
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,833
Whatever, Yaya likes
you just the way you are.

469
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:51,833
So, you see-- You can make
Yaya your wife immediately!

470
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,166
[RAISHIN] Not a chance!

471
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,125
[YAYA] At the very least,
you can propose!

472
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,250
[RAISHIN] No! And you
realize that's the same thing!

473
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,708
[YAYA] How about a kiss?

474
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:02,250
[RAISHIN] I'm tired, Yaya!
Please just leave me alone!
