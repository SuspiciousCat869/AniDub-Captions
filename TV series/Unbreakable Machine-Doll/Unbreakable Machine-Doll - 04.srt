1
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,625
[CHARLOTTE] I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!

2
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,000
[RAISHIN] I already
told you not to apologize.

3
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,125
It doesn't suit you,
Dinosaur Girl.

4
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,916
[CHARLOTTE] But both of
you were badly injured.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,125
Who's to blame
for that, if not me?

6
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,333
[RAISHIN] You're the
one who's been hurt most.

7
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,041
[gasps]

8
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,708
[RAISHIN]
We'll defeat him.

9
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,708
And this Cannibal Candy
mess will be done for good.

10
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,250
[YAYA] Raishin! Are you
sure you're up for this?

11
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,583
[RAISHIN] I'll be fine.

12
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,541
Just tell me everything
you learned, all right?

13
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,125
[YAYA] Okay. Sigmund told Yaya
what Charlotte's really up to.

14
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,666
Apparently she's
trying to find a way

15
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,375
to get back the family
she lost years ago.

16
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,416
[RAISHIN] Lost how?

17
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,541
[YAYA] Sigmund said the
House of Belew was once

18
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,250
the pride of England for
its prowess in machinart.

19
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,541
Their estate was
filled with automatons,

20
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:10,375
who they considered to be
true members of the family.

21
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,083
But one day, something
terrible happened,

22
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,500
something none of the
Belews had expected.

23
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,083
A dog automaton
Charlotte loved injured

24
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,750
a boy of very
high social status.

25
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,750
[YAYA] Because of
that one incident,

26
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,916
the family was
stripped of its title.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,750
Their lands were taken away,

28
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,750
and almost all of their
automatons were dismantled.

29
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,791
[YAYA] It seemed things
couldn't get worse,

30
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,000
but while Charlotte was
away at boarding school,

31
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,708
her parents and younger
sister went missing.

32
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,041
Not long after that,
Charlotte herself

33
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,875
was kicked out of school.

34
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,708
She's still racked with
guilt over the whole situation.

35
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:52,000
She blames herself because
the automaton was hers.

36
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,583
Charlotte holds
herself responsible

37
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,166
for her family's disappearance.

38
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,458
[RAISHIN] How terrible for her.

39
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,791
[YAYA] She's been
scrimping and saving

40
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,416
whatever scholarship
money she can

41
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,166
to buy back the hearts
of her automaton family.

42
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,416
Her hope is to restore them

43
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,541
and the House of Belew.

44
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,333
[RAISHIN] That's why Cannibal
Candy upset her so much.

45
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,916
Because she considers automatons

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,291
to be more than just
puppets on a string.

47
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,000
[YAYA] Yes, and her
dream is to have

48
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,208
her whole family reunited,
automatons and all.

49
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,791
[RAISHIN] That's her plan?
Seriously?

50
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,125
That's why she wants
to win the festival?

51
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,458
So her family can
live together again?

52
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,541
If that's true, she's a
bigger idiot than I am!

53
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,625
[RAISHIN] We will defeat him.

54
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,166
And this Cannibal Candy
mess will be done!

55
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,291
[FELIX] You don't
want to do this.

56
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,833
Char is the real Cannibal Candy.

57
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,208
We found proof in her room.

58
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,416
[RAISHIN] She doesn't kill.

59
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,833
No matter how
outnumbered she is,

60
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,000
she never resorts to that.

61
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,333
Everyone knows how difficult

62
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,708
Sigmund's attacks
are to control.

63
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,125
Keeping them
non-lethal requires work.

64
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,041
Char will always
preserve others' lives,

65
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,166
even when her own is in danger.

66
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,291
Sorry, Felix, but that
doesn't sound like

67
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,416
a serial killer to me.

68
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,208
[FELIX] You're really
gonna turn against me?

69
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:14,208
You, and your
automaton, AKA Lisette!

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,041
Yeah, you heard me.

71
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,625
Now sit back and
watch while I bust

72
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,291
that mask open
and show you her face.

73
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,125
[RAISHIN]
Whistle! Forty-Eight Sho!

74
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,083
[YAYA] Right!

75
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,583
[SIGMUND] Easy, Char. Easy.

76
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,041
[CHARLOTTE] But it is her!

77
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,250
[SIGMUND] I very much doubt

78
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,750
that is the original
Lisette Norden.

79
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,666
That Lisette was human.

80
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,041
I imagine they killed her

81
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,458
and replaced her
with an automaton.

82
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,791
[RAISHIN] That's a mask, too,

83
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,458
but at least it's prettier
than the other one was.

84
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,791
So, "Lisette,"
what's your real name?

85
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,750
My, you do
like to prattle on.

86
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,541
However, I have no reason
to give you that information.

87
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,750
[RAISHIN] Well it's a good thing
I wasn't asking you, isn't it?

88
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,791
I'm talking to her.

89
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,500
Eliza.

90
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,708
[RAISHIN] Okay, Eliza.
Another question.

91
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,250
Would you be willing
to stand down?

92
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,166
[RAISHIN] Tools don't get
to choose their wielders,

93
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,750
which means <i>you've</i>
done nothing wrong.

94
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,250
Please stand down.

95
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,458
[LISETTE] What a bunch o' tosh.

96
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,041
Do you actually
expect that to work?

97
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,458
[RAISHIN] Are you saying
that of your own volition?

98
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,291
[LISETTE]
Blimey, you are fuddled.

99
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:46,625
Thing is when I come
off peckish, I eat.

100
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,750
Glad to hear that,
it'll make this easier.

101
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,000
Do it, Yaya.
Flare Thirty-Six Sho!

102
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:53,875
[YAYA] Right!

103
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,833
Water magic?

104
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,500
I've seen that used before.
When we fought together.

105
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,458
Yeah. That was
Undine magic.

106
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,000
[RAISHIN thinking]
What does this mean?

107
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,375
Does Cannibal Candy acquire
magic from the dolls it eats?

108
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,166
[FELIX] Your fighting style
is woefully simple.

109
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,791
Relying on brute strength
to wrestle your enemy down.

110
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:32,916
But--

111
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,666
[CHARLOTTE] Raishin!

112
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,833
[FELIX] There, see?

113
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,416
Strong fighter,
slow reaction time.

114
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,625
You stand no chance
of defeating me.

115
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,791
Raishin, no!

116
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,083
Don't take your
eyes off the enemy!

117
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,000
Flare Twenty-Four Sho!

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's been fun. Ta!

119
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:26,875
Sorry! Yaya will not
let you harm Raishin!

120
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,208
[FELIX] No worries. I've plenty
of tricks up my sleeve.

121
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,041
[MAGNUS] Who's there?

122
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,041
[KIMBERLEY]
Watching the situation unfold

123
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,583
from on high, are you?

124
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,458
How lordly, Magnus.

125
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,958
Though I suppose
I'm up here as well,

126
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,958
so who am I to talk, right?

127
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,000
[KIMBERLEY] Second Last already
has one foot in the grave.

128
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,041
I wonder where he finds the
energy to continue fighting.

129
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,458
[MAGNUS] This battle
is as good as over.

130
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,041
Is it?

131
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,833
[MAGNUS] Once you see
through a magic trick,

132
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,708
it's no more than a game.

133
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,125
[KIMBERLEY] My, how cryptic.

134
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,458
[MAGNUS] He gave too much away

135
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,750
for the charade
to continue for long.

136
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,750
When you leave
too many clues behind,

137
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,416
it's only a matter of
time until you're found out.

138
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,541
It may interfere with your
investigation, too, Professor.

139
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,125
Thanks, I'll bear that in mind.

140
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,708
Now it's got boule magic?

141
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,291
[CHARLOTTE] Absurd!

142
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,541
Does this mean Cannibal Candy

143
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,625
is somehow able to wield
multiple types of magic?

144
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,250
It shouldn't be possible.

145
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,750
It violates the Principle of
Discordant Magical Activity!

146
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,916
Stop this!

147
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,666
[CHARLOTTE thinking]
There's nothing I can do.

148
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,458
Sigmund still can't fight.

149
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,791
You don't have to do this!

150
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,166
Please, Raishin,
they'll kill you!

151
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,625
It'll be okay, Char.

152
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,625
Stay calm. This'll be over soon.

153
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,708
[CHARLOTTE] But you still
have the festival to compete in!

154
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,083
Don't toss it all
away because of me!

155
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,666
[RAISHIN] You're accused of
crimes you didn't commit.

156
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,958
How is it wrong to defend you?

157
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,541
I can't prove my innocence;
it will be for nothing!

158
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,250
They'll drag you down with me--
claim you're an accomplice.

159
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,666
And it won't stop
at the academy!

160
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,750
England, the Brotherhood
of Magi, everyone!

161
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,333
The entire world
will turn against you!

162
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,666
This whining
doesn't become you.

163
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,958
This is my choice.

164
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,791
If it's me against
the world, so be it!

165
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,166
You're an idiot.

166
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,041
Still going for
the jugular, I see.

167
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,416
It is so gratifying to know

168
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,625
you're every bit the man
I thought you were.

169
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,625
[FELIX] Shall we strike
another bargain, Raishin?

170
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,125
If you agree to fight as
my ally in the festival,

171
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,583
we'll pretend this
unpleasantness never happened.

172
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,750
There's really no need for you

173
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,750
to be destroyed
along with dear Char.

174
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,500
[RAISHIN] No deal, Felix.

175
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,458
[FELIX]
Perhaps you'd like to give it

176
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,250
a bit more consideration.

177
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,458
[RAISHIN] I'd never go
along with your dirty scheme.

178
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,166
Not even if my
mother herself asked me.

179
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,166
See, now that's
part of your problem.

180
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,041
You ought to show
your mother more respect.

181
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,583
I paid my respects
to her when she died.

182
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,291
[FELIX] You have my sympathies.

183
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,250
But now, Raishin, we must part.

184
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,750
You'll rejoin your mother soon!

185
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,041
[RAISHIN] Stronghold
Forty-Eight Sho!

186
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,708
[RAISHIN]
I thought as much.

187
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,166
Why didn't Eliza turn herself

188
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,875
to liquid this time
and escape our attack?

189
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,750
'Cause she can absorb magics

190
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,958
but can't use 'em all at once.

191
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,708
Seems when you
wanna switch powers,

192
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,833
you gotta get rid
of the previous one.

193
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,041
And once you
eject a magic circuit,

194
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,458
you can't ever reequip it.

195
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,708
So your solution?

196
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,375
Build up a big enough
collection of circuits,

197
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,958
and it wouldn't matter.

198
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,125
Sound about right?

199
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,666
Brilliant deduction.

200
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,708
I now withdraw my invitation
for you to fight beside me.

201
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,708
You're far too dangerous!

202
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,500
[CHARLOTTE] What is this?

203
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,708
Did Eliza turn
herself into mist?

204
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,625
[SIGMUND]
That's no ordinary mist.

205
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,250
It seems to be
corrodin' Yaya's body.

206
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,541
Have you deduced yet
that you're going to lose?

207
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,208
When this fight began,
Eliza was equipped

208
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,750
with forty-seven
different magics.

209
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,125
Your magic is extraordinary.

210
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,916
I won't argue that.

211
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,791
However, you cannot fight
what you cannot touch!

212
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,291
Yes. This is my White Mist!

213
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,250
I had meant to save
it for my trump card

214
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,791
against Magnus in the festival.

215
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,375
Yaya. Knock 'em
on their asses.

216
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,375
It's time to admit
defeat, old chap.

217
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,125
How did you--?

218
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,041
Did those fluids come
from your automaton?

219
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,750
[RAISHIN]
"Brilliant deduction."

220
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes, her blood was the
key to making this work.

221
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,791
Oh, I see what he did.

222
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,208
Rather clever, actually.

223
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,875
While Eliza's body was mist,

224
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,000
she absorbed Yaya's blood
and, with it, her magic.

225
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,208
As we know, two magics
cannot coexist within one body.

226
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,666
[KIMBERLEY]
Machinart's fundamental law.

227
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,125
The Principle of
Discordant Magical Activity.

228
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,458
Neat trick.

229
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,291
[SIGMUND] If two magics
cause mutual interference

230
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,583
within a body,

231
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:02,041
one cannot utilize
either to full effect.

232
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,291
I assure you.

233
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,916
What we are seeing now
is no happy accident.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Raishin did all
that on purpose?

235
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,500
You're saying he planned
it this way from the start?

236
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,291
[SIGMUND] I have little
doubt he allowed Yaya

237
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,458
to sustain that
damage so her wounds

238
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,541
would reopen in the
grip of Eliza's magic.

239
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,541
[RAISHIN] Yaya's circuit
may not be complex.

240
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,875
I may not have talent,

241
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,083
and everyone knows
I'm an awful student.

242
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,916
But in the end,
it doesn't matter.

243
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,458
Because my partner is the best
damn automaton in the world.

244
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,291
[RAISHIN] Final Stronghold
Razing Moon Reflection.

245
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,750
[RAISHIN] Bye, Eliza.

246
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,750
Done in by you.

247
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:09,000
It is too much to bear.
Farewell. You worm.

248
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:19,833
[RAISHIN] Now.

249
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,083
What do you
intend to do with me?

250
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,041
As a son of the honorable
Kingsfort family,

251
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,333
I am untouchable.

252
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,458
If you harm me, there
will be consequences.

253
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,083
The royal family
will not be pleased.

254
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,875
Now, wait. Let's talk
about this, shall we?

255
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,916
That's it! Far enough!

256
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,708
[bang]

257
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,625
[RAISHIN] Yaya. I'm so sorry.

258
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,750
[YAYA] What do you
have to apologize for?

259
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,333
[RAISHIN] You were hurt.

260
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:03,166
I let you keep getting wounded,
watched you shed so much blood.

261
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,333
I'm sorry.

262
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,208
No, Raishin,
it was nothing!

263
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,500
Yaya can be fixed
quickly enough.

264
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,833
Yaya is unbreakable.

265
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,041
She can't ever be truly hurt.

266
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,125
Besides, you're the one

267
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,000
who always gets
wounded when we fight.

268
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,708
That's what frightens Ya--

269
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,958
[RAISHIN] Thank you.

270
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,500
[RAISHIN]
I owe you an apology, too.

271
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,875
[CHARLOTTE] What?

272
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,333
I shoulda let
the great Tyrant Rex

273
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,500
have the first turn
punchin' his face.

274
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,750
Sorry, guess I got
a little carried away.

275
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,916
[RAISHIN] Come on,
Dinosaur Girl.

276
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,625
On your feet. Or did
your legs stop working?

277
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,041
My legs work
well enough, thank you.

278
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:46,458
You cad. Though you might
at least offer your hand.

279
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,791
[KIMBERLEY] Second Last
is an interesting one.

280
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,750
Don't you think?

281
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,208
After I gave him his
entrance exam marks--

282
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,958
low marks--the
first thing he did

283
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,708
was ask about
entering the festival.

284
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,416
[KIMBERLEY]
You're not laughing.

285
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,958
[MAGNUS] Of course not.

286
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:16,250
If anyone here can stage an
upset, I imagine he is that one.

287
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,583
IIndeed?

288
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:21,000
A man of your exalted rank
thinks so highly of him?

289
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,833
Hm? What is that?

290
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,125
[MAGNUS] A token he
gave me when we met.

291
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,541
I can't be completely
certain without analyzing it,

292
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,166
but I believe this jar
contains someone's ashes.

293
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,208
[KIMBERLEY] Ashes?

294
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,916
You English
have an old custom.

295
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,125
Throwing a glove
to propose a duel.

296
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,375
From what I've heard,
this is similar.

297
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,875
There are clans in the Far East

298
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,416
who throw the
ashes of their dead

299
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,750
before exacting their vengeance.

300
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,708
Sounds like you've made
yourself a mortal enemy.

301
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,583
Oh, and by the way,

302
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,625
I heard the most
interesting rumor.

303
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,666
Allegedly, your automatons
are all Banned Dolls.

304
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,083
Care to comment, Magnus?

305
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,250
[MAGNUS] There is no clause
in the festival regulations

306
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,875
prohibiting the
use of Banned Dolls.

307
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,666
Not of which I'm aware.

308
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,083
Always talking
around the subject.

309
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,000
All right. I'll take
that as your answer, then.

310
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,958
[MAGNUS] Do as you please.

311
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,000
[KIMBERLEY]
It's truly a fearsome man

312
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,916
who can do what he's done.

313
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,208
Successfully creating Banned
Dolls at such a young age.

314
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:26,416
But I wonder, whose parts
did he use to make them?

315
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,583
[MALE INSTRUCTOR 4A]
Attention students and faculty.

316
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,166
The Walpurgis Royal
Academy of Machinart

317
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,750
will now formally award an entry

318
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,916
to the prestigious
Walpurgis Night festival.

319
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,458
[HEADMASTER]
Raishin Akabane,

320
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,000
step forward and
receive your due.

321
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,750
As headmaster,
I, Edward Rutherford,

322
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,250
hereby recognize you
as an official candidate

323
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,375
for the title of Wise Man.

324
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:52,416
You are now authorized to
participate in Walpurgis Night.

325
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,041
Congratulations. From this

326
00:19:56,125 --> 00:20:00,416
moment forward, son, you
shall be known as a Gauntlet.

327
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,958
You shall fulfill your
duty to the academy.

328
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,583
Grow as a puppeteer
with honour and grace.

329
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,708
Prove that you are worthy
of the glove you bear.

330
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,958
Sir.

331
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,625
[RAISHIN] What was the purpose
of such a large ceremony?

332
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,541
[KIMBERLEY] The headmaster
did some backroom lobbying.

333
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,500
The chief of our
Disciplinary Board

334
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,791
has just been proven a criminal.

335
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,958
As you might imagine,
that doesn't inspire much

336
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,750
confidence in the
school's performance.

337
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,125
Headmaster Rutherford
hopes to divert attention

338
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:33,750
from the embarrassment by
celebrating you as our new hero.

339
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,041
[KIMBERLEY]
The glove suits you,

340
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,666
and now everyone will know your
official title, Second Last.

341
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,500
[RAISHIN] And who should
I thank for coming up

342
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,041
with such an excellent
registration code for me?

343
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,416
Who do you think, genius?

344
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,791
[KIMBERLEY] Be a sport.

345
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,875
If not for me, things would have
turned out quite differently.

346
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,666
After all, it was
my eyewitness testimony

347
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,375
that proved your innocence.

348
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,958
In fact, you might even say
I'm your benefactress.

349
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,625
Don't keep the
masses waiting now.

350
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,291
Go on, Hero Boy, make
a spectacle of yourself.

351
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,000
Seems everyone's
standards are slipping.

352
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,708
The world's come to
a pretty pass, indeed,

353
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,208
if you're a Gauntlet now.

354
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,791
Um... What's that?

355
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:30,916
You complete knobhead!

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,041
It's a thank you
gift, obviously!

357
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,833
Er, you did give
me some assistance.

358
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,333
Though I would have
been fine without you,

359
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,333
so it was incidental, at best.

360
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,666
Still, I am a lady,

361
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,541
and feel it's only proper
to show my appreciation.

362
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,958
[RAISHIN] Oh wow, an amulet.

363
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,791
I've never seen one
quite like this before.

364
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,791
And is that a rune
inscribed on it?

365
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,166
It's a defensive spell.

366
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,291
Intended to complement your
barbaric fighting style.

367
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,541
Please do accept.
Char thought this over

368
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,958
so hard I was afraid
she would hurt herself.

369
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,958
One more word from you,
blasted reptile,

370
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,416
and you'll dine
on salad tonight!

371
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,541
Thank you, Char.
It's keen.

372
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,541
Yes, well, this
doesn't mean a thing.

373
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,750
Not when it comes
to the festival.

374
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,250
Where we'll be enemies.

375
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,000
To the bitter end.

376
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,375
Sigmund and I won't hold back.

377
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,291
We'll come on with
everything we've got.

378
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,500
I'm not sure

379
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,958
I can make the same
threat, unfortunately.

380
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,875
But you can't
take it easy on me.

381
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,041
Yaya sure won't!

382
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,958
Yaya will gladly
fight you to the death!

383
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,958
We shall go at it until
only one is left standing.

384
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,875
[YAYA] Yaya will not
let you touch him!

385
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:33,166
As Raishin's wife,
touching him is Yaya's job!

386
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,458
[RAISHIN] Hey! Y'wanna
rephrase that? Now?
