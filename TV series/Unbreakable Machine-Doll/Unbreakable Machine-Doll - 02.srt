1
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,958
Hnmph...

2
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,541
[gasps]

3
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,208
[RAISHIN] Nadeshiko!
Where are you? Nadeshiko!

4
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,000
[RAISHIN] Dad, no!

5
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,708
[RAISHIN] Nadeshiko!

6
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,583
[screams]

7
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Can't be her.

8
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:04,083
[RAISHIN] Wait right there,
Mask Boy. Sorry. Magnus.

9
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,125
"The Great One?" Y'really
make people call you that?

10
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,166
[MAGNUS] Who are you?

11
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,083
Well, that's a
rather icy greeting.

12
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,125
Considering I traveled
across half the globe

13
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,208
for the express
purpose of seeing you.

14
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,375
[MAGNUS] I believe you've
mistaken me for someone else.

15
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,375
[RAISHIN] Very well.
I won't keep you much longer.

16
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,083
But before you go,
I want you to have this!

17
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,333
Raishin!

18
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,875
[CHARLOTTE] Magnus is the

19
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,833
highest-ranked
student at Walpurgis.

20
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,291
He's the most
brilliant puppeteer

21
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,333
the school has ever seen.

22
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,166
One bloke who deploys
six automatons at one time.

23
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,166
It's unheard of!

24
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,458
He is the obvious favorite

25
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,041
to win the title of
Wise Man this year.

26
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,625
These young ladies
of yours are so touchy.

27
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,125
I only wanted to give you
a token of our acquaintance.

28
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,666
They surely wouldn't
object to that.

29
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,000
What'd he give him? A jar?

30
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,916
[MAGNUS] I accept your
token with gratitude.

31
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,458
Yaya let you down!
She is sorry!

32
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,000
Yaya should have
fought those dolls off!

33
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,416
[RAISHIN] Much as I hate to
admit it, Charlotte was right.

34
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,666
At my current level,
I couldn't defeat him.

35
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,750
[RAISHIN] Will I be
strong enough? Ever?

36
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:59,458
[YAYA] Raishin! Yaya is
happy to wash your back.

37
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,791
You've had such
a long, tiring day.

38
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,041
And it is a wife's duty

39
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,791
to soothe her husband's
tension and weariness.

40
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,875
Ah! Yaya!
Hands off! Stop!

41
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,875
[YAYA] It'll be all right.

42
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,166
[RAISHIN] What are you
even talking about?

43
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,791
[YAYA] You will win. Yaya knows.

44
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:34,083
[YAYA] Don't doubt yourself.
Today doesn't matter.

45
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,208
The festival does.

46
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,958
[RAISHIN] Yeah, you're right.

47
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,041
Thank you.
I needed to hear that.

48
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,916
[YAYA] You're welcome!

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,791
But there is a better way
to thank Yaya. Yes, yes!

50
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,333
[RAISHIN] Stop rubbing
yourself on me like that!

51
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,750
[YAYA] Right this way!
Yaya loves it when you squirm!

52
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,458
[RAISHIN]
I mean it, Yaya! Get off of me!

53
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,416
[FELIX] Cheers! Good morning.

54
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,833
[RAISHIN]
Hmm?

55
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,500
You're confused.

56
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,666
Sorry. Introductions first.
I'm Feli--

57
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,166
Felix Kingsfort.

58
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,458
One of the Rounds, and the
head of the Disciplinary Board.

59
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,500
Which is the linchpin of the
academy's student government.

60
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,333
So what do you want with me?

61
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,333
[FELIX] I believe we
can strike a bargain.

62
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,041
There's an important matter
I'd like to discuss.

63
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,500
[RAISHIN] Don't care.

64
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,166
You haven't heard
what I'm offering yet.

65
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,000
A guaranteed festival entry.

66
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,250
[gasps]

67
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,083
[FELIX] Thought as much.
Shall we speak later?

68
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,750
A magic circuit
is an alternative

69
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,666
to performing a magic ritual.

70
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,583
Think of it as a type of engine.

71
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,083
Just as we use
steam to turn gears,

72
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,750
so, too, can we use magic power
to produce a magical effect.

73
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,416
[RAISHIN] I don't know how I can
trust that one, but his offer.

74
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,583
[YAYA] What happened?
Are you okay?

75
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,083
[KIMBERLEY] The fact
you're ignoring my lecture,

76
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,666
Second Last, makes clear
how little you value your life.

77
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,000
Why do you suppose I'm
spending my precious time

78
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,958
on such basic material?

79
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,166
For new students
like me, I s'pose?

80
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,916
And others who might
be failing the course.

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,333
[KIMBERLEY] Or for a student
who is both new and failing.

82
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,000
Now, answer this, if you can.

83
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,541
Which magic circuit is
currently the most widely used?

84
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,458
Mm. Heat, right?

85
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,791
No, wait. Power, isn't it?
Light maybe?

86
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,458
[KIMBERLEY] Charlotte,
enlighten your classmate.

87
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,708
The answer is Eve's Heart.

88
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,250
[KIMBERLEY] Correct.

89
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,125
All automatons contain magic
circuits known as Eve's Hearts,

90
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,916
which are responsible
for their animation.

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,625
These circuits are
what allow automatons

92
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,875
to function independently.

93
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,625
The Eve's Heart is vital,
giving a doll its intelligence.

94
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,958
With it, skilled craftsmen
can do great work.

95
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:46,125
Even producing automatons nearly
identical to human beings.

96
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,083
Though, if you ask me,

97
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,000
imitating humans is a
rather pointless endeavor.

98
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,833
I have no idea what would

99
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,500
make you say something
like that, Professor.

100
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,625
But Yaya is the best
automaton in the world!

101
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,458
Aw, Raishin!

102
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,041
She <i>was</i> built by Shoko,
after all!

103
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,750
[YAYA] Shoko? Shoko again?
It's always her, isn't it?

104
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:15,666
[bell tolling]

105
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,125
What's Felix up to?
He's talking to that new twit.

106
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,583
[SIGMUND]
Interested in him, are we?

107
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,625
[CHARLOTTE] No!
That's rubbish! Pure drivel!

108
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,291
One more word and
you're on a green pea diet!

109
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,625
I'll admit.

110
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,416
He has always behaved
in a most gentlemanly way.

111
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,083
[SIGMUND] No. It's not Felix
I was speaking about.

112
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,791
I meant the new lad, Raishin.

113
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,083
He may be worth getting
better acquainted with.

114
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,125
[SIGMUND]
I'm certainly impressed.

115
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,291
We were having lunch,

116
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,208
and he inquired as
to how I was feeling.

117
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,000
Do you not recall that, Char?

118
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,500
Yes. Your point?

119
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,250
He treated me
as an individual,

120
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,208
an entity separate from you.

121
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,875
Most puppeteers would have
spoken quite differently.

122
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,625
The question would be directed
at you, rather than me.

123
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:04,500
"How is your puppet?" is what
anyone else would have asked.

124
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,375
[CHARLOTTE] I-I suppose
I see what you're gettin' at.

125
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,916
[SIGMUND] Char.
I want to ask you something.

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,291
Raishin and Yaya fought for
you when you were outnumbered.

127
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:17,125
Are you prepared to face 'em
in battle when the time comes?

128
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,916
[CHARLOTTE] I am Charlotte,
of the House of Belew.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,541
Her Majesty granted my family
the noble unicorn crest.

130
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,208
She bestowed upon us
the northern earldom.

131
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,041
I shall eliminate anyone
who stands in my path.

132
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,708
Anyone at all.

133
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,416
[FELIX] Now, then.

134
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,125
Shall we discuss our
bargain in greater detail?

135
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,375
Well, I know what
you're offering;

136
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,250
so what do you want from me?

137
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,166
Take a look at
these photographs.

138
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,458
I doubt you're aware, but
twenty-six academy students

139
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,583
have gone missing
since October last.

140
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,125
If that weren't bad enough,

141
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,333
we've also discovered twelve
gruesomely destroyed automatons.

142
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,375
The methods,
as you can see,

143
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,500
are reminiscent
of Jack the Ripper.

144
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,875
[RAISHIN]
Who would do such a thing?

145
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,875
A fellow student.

146
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,250
One we are calling
Cannibal Candy.

147
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,958
I would like you to identify
him, and then defeat him.

148
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,666
Okay, so why me?

149
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,958
[FELIX] I have two reasons.

150
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,541
First, I don't
consider you a suspect.

151
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,291
Given you only just
arrived at the academy.

152
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:20,125
As for the second,
I saw you sparring yesterday.

153
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,458
You're quite strong.

154
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,250
Gives you a sporting chance.

155
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,625
[LISETTE] There you are!

156
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,875
Pardon the intrusion.

157
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,416
I'm Lisette Norden,
Disciplinary Board Vice-Chief.

158
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,625
[FELIX] My goodness, love.

159
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,750
You're not easily flustered.
What's wrong?

160
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,583
Has there been another
Cannibal Candy incident?

161
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,041
Aye. Another doll was found.

162
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,041
The crime scene's behind
the Technology Department.

163
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,375
[RAISHIN] Hi, Charlotte.
Hello, Sigmund.

164
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,333
[FELIX] Didn't expect
to see you here. 'lo, Char.

165
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,375
[CHARLOTTE] I was curious
what the commotion was about.

166
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,875
[RAISHIN]
Oh, you know each other?

167
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,208
Rather well, in fact.

168
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,666
I've been trying
to call on her for ages.

169
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,208
Alas, she turns me
down every time.

170
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,000
[FELIX] Excuse me,
I need to see to this mess.

171
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,958
Perhaps we'll speak again later.

172
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,166
[FELIX] Raishin, come along.

173
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,250
Her magic circuit is missing.

174
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,250
[FELIX] That's his
modus operandi.

175
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,416
The automatons always look

176
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,583
as if he's eaten out
their Eve's Hearts.

177
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,916
Do you know
yet whose it is?

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,625
We're still investigatin'.

179
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,750
From what we've been
able to determine so far,

180
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,083
the automaton was a boule user.

181
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,583
[RAISHIN] Yes, that's right.

182
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,250
We fought her
yesterday. Except--

183
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,250
[RAISHIN]
Is something wrong, Char?

184
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,250
[RAISHIN] Hold on a second.

185
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,625
[CHARLOTTE] Let me go.

186
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,250
[FELIX]
I can certainly empathize.

187
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,333
Seeing that must've made
her itch for immediate action.

188
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,625
My blood's boiling, too.

189
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,083
We must apprehend
this monster, and soon.

190
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,791
You'll help me track
him down, won't you?

191
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,375
Yes, I'll help.

192
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:10,208
But just be forewarned,
I'll be doing it my way.

193
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,291
[LISETTE] Sorry!

194
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,583
If I could have one more
moment of your time?

195
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,791
I'd appreciate it if
we might speak in private.

196
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,333
Shan't take long.

197
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,125
In private, huh?
Sounds like it's serious.

198
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,833
Very.

199
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,041
Nothing of a
romantic nature, I hope?

200
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,875
Please, I am Vice-Chief
of the Disciplinary Board.

201
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,708
I've a solemn duty
to this academy.

202
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,500
And no time for such thoughts.

203
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,666
[RAISHIN] All right, all right,
I was only busting your chops.

204
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,500
How can you even say
such lecherous things?

205
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,750
You ought to be ashamed!

206
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,583
That's the pot callin'
the kettle black!

207
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,083
Yaya will stay
to make sure

208
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,250
this girl doesn't try anythi--

209
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,041
I'm fine on my own.
Go back to the room.

210
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,791
[whines]

211
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,541
Come back as soon as
your "conversation" is done.

212
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,041
Unless you want the
dorm reduced to rubble.

213
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,291
[RAISHIN] Don't you dare!

214
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,208
No rubble! You hear me?

215
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,291
[RAISHIN] Well? What did
you want to talk about?

216
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,375
[LISETTE] I regret the
necessity of doin' this,

217
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,541
but I'm afraid I must
warn you 'bout somethin'.

218
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,291
Charlotte may be your friend,
but please be wary of her.

219
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,541
Her automaton is
not what he seems.

220
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,833
He is a Banned Doll.

221
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,375
Hm?

222
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,416
[LISETTE] I'm sure you know
what constitutes a Banned Doll.

223
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,791
Their parts include
livin' tissue.

224
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,958
Their existence violates
the Mage Code of Ethics.

225
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,125
According to
Belew family tradition,

226
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,791
Sigmund has committed countless
atrocities for generations.

227
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,916
Burning entire villages.
Devouring innocent people.

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,958
I hear even now he
can't maintain his form

229
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:44,250
unless he feasts on
a steady diet of meat.

230
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,833
[RAISHIN] What are
you trying to say?

231
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,458
[LISETTE] To get right to it,
we suspect Cannibal Candy has

232
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,791
been usin' a Banned Doll
to commit these murders.

233
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,416
[YAYA] Raishin.

234
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,666
You're thinking about

235
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,000
that pink-haired vixen
right now, aren't you?

236
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,083
I am.

237
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,375
How do you always
know these things?

238
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,791
Hand over your undergarments
right this minute!

239
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,708
Yaya will thoroughly
inspect them to ascertain

240
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,375
whether you had
relations this afternoon!

241
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,250
Like hell you will!

242
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,375
Seriously, Yaya; you have no
concept of how people work!

243
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,708
[YAYA] But-- but that vixen!

244
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,125
At any rate,

245
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,166
tomorrow I plan to start
really looking into this case.

246
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,666
Given everything I've seen and
heard about Cannibal Candy, I--

247
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,666
No, we have
to find this killer.

248
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,458
Are you with me?

249
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,208
Yes!

250
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,666
[RAISHIN] Charlotte?

251
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,208
What're you doing
over here so late?

252
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,458
Guh--!

253
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,166
[RAISHIN] Yes?

254
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,833
Go out with me!

255
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,541
[CHARLOTTE] Rather,
I'll allow you to take me out.

256
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,833
Tomorrow perhaps.
After lessons are finished.

257
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:55,625
Huh?

258
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,916
[YAYA]
Wha--? Nuh-- No!

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,583
Thank you for the lovely offer,
but no, no, no, no!

260
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,458
[RAISHIN] Yeah sure.

261
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,000
Sounds good. I'll see you then.

262
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,791
Excellent, I shall
hold you to it.

263
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,958
[YAYA] How could you?

264
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,916
You're so cruel to Yaya
after all she's done for you!

265
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,625
Interesting spot
to choose for a date.

266
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,791
Hmph!

267
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,916
Poor, blind fool.

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,666
This isn't a date. It's a trap.

269
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,750
[RAISHIN] Actually,
I had assumed as much.

270
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:30,833
Don't be alarmed.

271
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,583
You're perfectly safe,
I assure you.

272
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,500
Should the villain appear,
I'll handle it.

273
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,500
You just stand there
looking helpless.

274
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,500
Now I see.

275
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,875
You don't have any
friends, do you?

276
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,750
[CHARLOTTE]
Why would you say that?

277
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,750
[RAISHIN] You needed help
with this plan of yours,

278
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:44,958
and you came to me.

279
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,375
The guy you just met.

280
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,333
I-- No! Y-You've
misread the situation!

281
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,875
I'm helping you!
Ungrateful lout that you are.

282
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,583
Okay, I get it.

283
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,458
You heard Felix offered
me a festival entry

284
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,041
if I could solve this case.

285
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,166
Which means you must've
been eavesdropping.

286
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,416
[CHARLOTTE] Wha--
and if I was? What of it?

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,791
I think I'm done with this.

288
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,208
Enough of playing detective.

289
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's go on that date instead.

290
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,083
Wha-- What?

291
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,750
How unbelievably forward of you!

292
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,750
[RAISHIN] You're the
one who asked me out.

293
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,000
Or does the daughter

294
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,125
of the great Belew family
not keep her word?

295
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,583
How dare you, sir!

296
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,125
Fine then; name the place,
and I shall take you there.

297
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,416
No, sirree!
Absolutely not!

298
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,708
Yaya will chaperone you!

299
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,750
I know.
Let's go into town.

300
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,875
Into town?
Then Sigmund can't come.

301
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:32,958
Correct.

302
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,125
It's considered normal practice

303
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,208
to not bring one's
automaton on dates.

304
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,666
Ah... I wouldn't be so
boorish as to ruin your fun.

305
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,416
Have a good time.

306
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,916
What're you--?
That's my hand!

307
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,875
And this is a date.

308
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,541
[CHARLOTTE]
Let me go this instant!

309
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,166
[RAISHIN] Quit flailing.

310
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,166
Y'might try having a bit
more faith in your master.

311
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,416
Does he even deserve it?

312
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,916
Trust me when I say
I am an accurate judge

313
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,750
of a person's character.

314
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,333
I have had a hundred-fifty years
on this earth to figure it out.

315
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,500
There was no lust in
his eyes when they left.

316
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,166
None? Really?

317
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,416
[SIGMUND] Really.
Though I must admit,

318
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,375
boys his age are
unpredictable at best.

319
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,041
No denyin' that.

320
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,541
So I suppose
it's always possible

321
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,625
something may
happen between 'em.

322
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,500
[YAYA] Yaya knew it!

323
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,583
[SIGMUND] We are not
human, you and I.

324
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,750
You may be more or less
human both in appearance

325
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,250
and functionality,
but you mustn't forget

326
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,041
that you will never
actually be one of them.

327
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,416
Yaya knows
that already too!

328
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,416
Automatons operate
on magical power supplied

329
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,208
to us by our puppeteers.

330
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,541
Given that, it's natural to feel
great affection for your master,

331
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,916
but I do not understand how
you came to be so obsessed.

332
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,625
Yaya cares for
Raishin, that's all.

333
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,708
Yaya won't say more out loud.

334
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,166
[SIGMUND] At any rate, our
masters aren't here right now,

335
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,416
and Cannibal Candy
is still on the loose.

336
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,375
We must be careful.

337
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,666
[CHARLOTTE] I don't know
about you, but I'm famished.

338
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,833
Let's go back.

339
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,125
Why? We can eat here.

340
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,416
Come on, I'll even treat.

341
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,041
[CHARLOTTE] I don't take
charity from lechers!

342
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,708
[stomach growls]

343
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,666
[CHARLOTTE] Oh, fine, let's eat!
But I'll have you know,

344
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,500
I will never forgive you
for this embarrassment!

345
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,500
[CHARLOTTE]
It looks divine.

346
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,375
Out of curiosity,
the other day,

347
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,291
why did you eat
lunch at my table?

348
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,208
Just seemed like the
natural progression.

349
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,583
Of what?
We were hardly friends.

350
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,875
First, I yelled at you,

351
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,458
then you challenged
me to a duel,

352
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,666
then you insist
we dine together?

353
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,000
That could only make
sense to a blithering idiot.

354
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,791
I believe I'll take
that as a compliment.

355
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,250
[CHARLOTTE] But why so
intent on my entry, anyway?

356
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,875
There are a hundred of us
who qualified to compete.

357
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,416
You could easily have picked
a lower-ranked target.

358
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,083
[RAISHIN] Victory against
easy prey wouldn't mean as much.

359
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,458
I tried to take
an entry by force,

360
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,333
but at the expense
of another person.

361
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,708
That'd be inexcusable without
also taking a personal risk.

362
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:22,416
And even then it's
still inexcusable. Sorry.

363
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,250
Yeah. I'm not explaining
myself very well.

364
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,583
When we first met,

365
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,125
my impression was you were
a tough person to read.

366
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,958
But I've come to
realize you're just daft.

367
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,708
So, any more
questions for me?

368
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,666
Only one for now, I think.

369
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,208
About your fighting style.

370
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,666
What is it called?

371
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,208
I noticed you were fighting
alongside your puppet.

372
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,250
Technically, that
was me cheating.

373
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,125
I was creating a formation.

374
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:53,083
It's my family's fighting
specialty, using group tactics.

375
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,250
That's us.

376
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,750
Pulling the strings
of a team of dolls.

377
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,833
However, my training
was kind of rushed.

378
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,833
I got my hands full
with just Yaya.

379
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,041
The other day, I was
just using my own body

380
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,000
in place of another doll.

381
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,125
So it's a good thing I know

382
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,000
a little something
about martial arts.

383
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,083
What do you mean,
your training was "rushed"?

384
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,875
[RAISHIN] Well,
I didn't start really studying

385
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,916
until just over two years ago.

386
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,666
[CHARLOTTE] Huh? What?

387
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,708
And you already want
to compete for Wise Man?

388
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,541
I have my reasons.
Let's leave it at that.

389
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,625
[RAISHIN] My turn.
Do you have a crush on Felix?

390
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,375
[CHARLOTTE] Wha--? You--!

391
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,708
Don't make me sound so common!

392
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,000
My relationship with Felix
is nothing so vulgar as that!

393
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,333
[RAISHIN] I don't see
anything vulgar about it.

394
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,375
It's no big deal.

395
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,208
That sort of thing
is human nature.

396
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,416
[CHARLOTTE] I'm telling
you to drop it right now.

397
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,375
Or I shall be forced to
cause you grievous bodily harm.

398
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:53,208
Only sometimes, I make enemies
without realizing or meaning to.

399
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,750
So, as head of the disciplinary
board, Felix worries about me.

400
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,375
That's all.

401
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,125
[RAISHIN] He's asked you
to go out with him, hasn't he?

402
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,625
Why not accept?

403
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,000
I can't do that!

404
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,416
Don't you know how
popular Felix is?

405
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,666
With girls, I mean.

406
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,708
The chits are practically
rabid about him.

407
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,208
[RAISHIN] So you'd wind up
with even more enemies.

408
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,291
Is that it?

409
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,625
[CHARLOTTE] Precisely.

410
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,041
[RAISHIN] What about you?

411
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,666
Why do you want
to be the Wise Man?

412
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,083
[CHARLOTTE] I have a dream.

413
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,750
Something important.

414
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,416
Something I'm willing to
get blood on my hands for.

415
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,291
[RAISHIN] Fair enough.

416
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,250
[RAISHIN] Thank you for
coming shopping with me.

417
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,708
You were a big help.

418
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,666
[CHARLOTTE]
To be honest,

419
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,166
I'm surprised buying her
a gift even occurred to you.

420
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,041
What is it?

421
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,291
Is she so terrifying you have

422
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,708
to buy her presents
to placate her?

423
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,333
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

424
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,541
Not where she can hear me.

425
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,666
You're pitiful.
You know that?

426
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,916
Ordered around by
your own automaton.

427
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,625
That's plain backwards.

428
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,916
[CHARLOTTE] Look, about
what you said before,

429
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,500
the reason you chose
to challenge my entry.

430
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,666
[RAISHIN] Yeah?

431
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,083
[CHARLOTTE] I want you
to know, I get it.

432
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,166
You're still daft,

433
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,416
but I understand
wanting to be punished.

434
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,958
There are things in my past
I'm not proud of, either.

435
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,166
Huh?

436
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:19,625
No.

437
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,708
Cannibal Candy!

438
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,541
[RAISHIN] Didn't think
he'd strike again so soon!

439
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:27,875
[RAISHIN] Yaya!

440
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,083
[CHARLOTTE] Raishin!
