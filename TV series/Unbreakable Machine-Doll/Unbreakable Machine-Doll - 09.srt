00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,000
[bell tolling]

2
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,708
[ANNOUNCER 9A]
Hello and welcome.

3
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,250
Today's celebration
marks one hundred years

4
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,708
since the completion of the

5
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,916
Walpurgis Royal Academy
of Machinart's clock tower.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,166
To begin the festivities,
we have a few opening remarks.

7
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,458
Headmaster Edward Rutherford.

8
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,875
[clapping]

9
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,791
[frightened screams]

10
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,250
[grumbles]

11
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,583
[FREY] She just jumped?

12
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,750
[RAISHIN] Yeah, right off
the roof, earlier today.

13
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,375
[FREY] Wow.
What did she look like?

14
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,041
[RAISHIN] She had
light-colored hair.

15
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,708
And was wearing a floppy hat.

16
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,000
[FREY] Um. Raishin?

17
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,875
Oh, sorry.
Got distracted.

18
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,083
It's weird, though.

19
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,125
The girl actually kind
of looked like Char.

20
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,666
I think I know who that is.

21
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,583
It's Henri. You hadn't
met Henriette Belew?

22
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,875
[RAISHIN] Belew?

23
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,916
[FREY] Yes. Tyrant Rex's
younger sister.

24
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,833
She transferred here.

25
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,833
[RAISHIN]
Oh. Well, that explains it.

26
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,208
[FREY] So sad.

27
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,000
That makes six suicide
attempts since she arrived.

28
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,458
Obviously, she's
never been successful.

29
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,416
The rope would break or
someone would find her.

30
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,625
[RAISHIN] Huh.

31
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,083
Wonder if that makes
her lucky or unlucky.

32
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,416
Oh. And speaking
of Tyrant Rex.

33
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,041
It seems she may
have gone missing.

34
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,458
She never came back to
the dormitory last night.

35
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,250
[RAISHIN] She didn't?

36
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,625
[door opening]

37
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,666
So. You've gotten dressed.

38
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,875
I hope you're not gonna tell me

39
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,416
you're planning to leave
the infirmary today.

40
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,541
[RAISHIN] I'm sorry
to be so predictable.

41
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,625
Are you quite certain
you've thought this through?

42
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,583
You are aware what'll happen
once I've discharged you?

43
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,583
Yeah, I'll have to
rejoin the festival.

44
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,291
[sighs] By the way, I heard
something interesting

45
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,625
about the clock tower explosion.

46
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:47,916
Hm?

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,166
Rumor has it, Tyrant Rex
was the responsible party.

48
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,791
[gasps]

49
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,541
Your face
betrays you, lad.

50
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,333
So, you and Dinosaur Girl
are something of an item, yeah?

51
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,458
[gasps]

52
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,000
And if I told you we were?

53
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,166
Ah!!

54
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,458
Would you be more
likely to discharge me?

55
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,583
We're not, but if it
helps me get out of here.

56
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,125
Do whatever you please.
It's your neck.

57
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,583
[door opening]

58
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,375
[YAYA] Yaya doesn't understand
why you're so insistent.

59
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,666
What's the matter?

60
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,083
[YAYA] You know you'll
have to face Charlotte

61
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,583
as an enemy one day.

62
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,208
Yaya doesn't want you
losing sight of your goal,

63
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,875
or your position, either.

64
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,166
[barking and growling]

65
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,500
You're going
to look for her.

66
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,583
For Tyrant Rex, aren't you?

67
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,125
[RAISHIN] That's my plan, yes.

68
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,208
[FREY] Then please, let me help.

69
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,666
They can help, too. Dogs are
excellent at tracking people.

70
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,208
That would be great.
Thank you.

71
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,291
[opening door]

72
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,916
Lavenna, excellent,
you've returned.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,583
I've news that might be
of some interest to you.

74
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,833
Despite his injuries,
it seems Second Last

75
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,416
is determined to search
for Charlotte Belew.

76
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,041
A noble gesture, certainly,

77
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,833
but I never knew
Tyrant Rex was so popular.

78
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,458
I'd like you to visit him.

79
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,666
I don't fancy him

80
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,083
and his rag-tag search
party nosing about,

81
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,916
and I should think you
would feel the same.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,208
You've less
than forty hours

83
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,166
until the appointed time.
Do make haste.

84
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,041
[YAYA] Raishin, why are
we at the girls' dormitory?

85
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,375
[RAISHIN] Because we need
to question Char's sister.

86
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,375
You saw how strangely
she was acting.

87
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,875
There must be a reason.

88
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,416
I'm guessing she
knows something.

89
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
We're too late.

90
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,916
Seems Henriette has
disappeared again.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,791
We know she's
a danger to herself.

92
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,458
Let's find her quickly.

93
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,875
[FREY] Also, look at these.

94
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,333
Pant--Why do you--?
Where did you get those?

95
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,333
Henri's room, obviously.

96
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,875
And just what do you
intend to do with them?

97
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,375
[sniffing]

98
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,875
[barks]

99
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,416
[loud whistle]

100
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,791
[barking dogs]

101
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,750
[YAYA] Raishin!
If you really want

102
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:05,625
to smell underpants
so badly, you smell Yaya's!

103
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,541
[RAISHIN] Not what
I was thinking about!

104
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,166
You're the only one
here who's <i>that</i> perverted!

105
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,916
[dog howling in distance]

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,708
[FREY] Hear that?
They found Henriette.

107
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,291
[RAISHIN] Already?

108
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:21,041
[HENRIETTE] No! Bad dogs!
Shoo! All of you!

109
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,416
Somebody help me!

110
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,000
[HENRIETTE] Bugger off! Shoo!

111
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,375
[screams]

112
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,083
Get off!

113
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,708
Listen. I know who
you are, Henriette.

114
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,083
Now, where's Char?

115
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,750
Is it true she didn't return
to the dorm last night?

116
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,208
Does her disappearance
have something

117
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,083
to do with the clock tower?

118
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,666
And why are you
so eager to die?

119
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,166
Well, what are you waiting for?

120
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,083
You know something, don't you?

121
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,541
Maybe try to not ask her a
million questions at once.

122
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,291
We're sorry about
this, Henriette,

123
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,958
but would you please
tell us the truth?

124
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,875
These suicide
attempts of yours.

125
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,125
They're your pathetic way

126
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,041
of getting Raishin's
attention, aren't they?

127
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,458
Yeah, this isn't working.

128
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,166
Maybe you can try, Frey.

129
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,583
[FREY] Henri. Are you staging
these suicide attempts

130
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,958
just to get
Raishin's attent-- Ah!

131
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,208
Oh, dear! This cad is
clearly a barbarian!

132
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,583
[RAISHIN] Just hurry and tell
me where Char is, all right?

133
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,000
If you don't,
I'll have no choice

134
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,458
but to set the dogs on you.

135
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,333
[woof]

136
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,875
Aaaa!!

137
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,583
You'll have the dogs
do what to me?

138
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,583
You deviant!
You're absolutely despicable!

139
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:30,666
What would my mother say

140
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,083
if she knew her
daughter was set upon

141
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,208
by beasts and
their beastly master?

142
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,875
She would be horrified!

143
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,875
[YAYA] How horrible!

144
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,541
Yaya knew nothing
of this fetish.

145
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,541
[sighs]

146
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,916
[YAYA] You won't
even kiss Yaya,

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,041
but you will participate
in an unholy union

148
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,333
with that trollop
and an animal?

149
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,083
Yaya would sooner
kill you and herself

150
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,625
than allow another
woman to have you!

151
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,083
Is that what you want?

152
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,041
Damn! She's gettin' away.

153
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,458
Frey, will you follow her?

154
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,583
You're terrible.

155
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,791
The absolute worst
pervert I know.

156
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,583
[RAISHIN] For cryin' out loud,
Frey, not you, too!

157
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,333
[RAISHIN]
Are we on the same page?

158
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,291
This was all just
a misunderstanding.

159
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,541
[FREY] I never doubted you.

160
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,708
[RAISHIN] You liar!

161
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,791
You just finished
calling me a pervert.

162
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:13,791
[FREY] Yeah.

163
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,875
The festival
starts back up soon.

164
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,500
You should head
back to the field.

165
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,875
[FREY] What are
you gonna do?

166
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,291
Well, I'm gonna see
if I can't track Char down.

167
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,375
I'll get there in time,
though, don't worry.

168
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,833
Are you sure?

169
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,083
[RAISHIN] Yeah, it's fine.

170
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,666
I'm sorry I dragged
you along with me.

171
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,791
[panting]

172
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,708
Back to the beginning.

173
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,541
Let's try the
girls' dorm again.

174
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,791
[YAYA] Yaya assumes

175
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,458
you'll be stealing
Charlotte's knickers now?

176
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,541
[RAISHIN] I'm real tired
of these insinuations.

177
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,541
I just want to see what
I can find out about Henri.

178
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,708
Hold up!

179
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,541
Bad enough
you're playing hooky,

180
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,208
but now you're skulking
around the grounds at night?

181
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,583
Boy, do I have some
questions for you.

182
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,666
That's a pity.

183
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,625
I've no answers for you.
Only a warning.

184
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:01,125
Leave Henri be or there
will be consequences.

185
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,791
Sorry, no can do.

186
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,208
Although, if you
come along quietly,

187
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,958
I will give it some thought.

188
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,916
You twit. Foolish,
hopeless twit.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,375
I see you're still as
wonderfully obtuse as ever.

190
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,500
I'll say it one more time:
Stay away from my sister.

191
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,583
If you don't,
I shall have to kill you.

192
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,916
Okay, I'm confused.

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,958
Just the other day you
promised to protect me.

194
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,500
Quiet! I will kill you.
I mean it!

195
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,125
Please, Raishin,
just keep out of this!

196
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,208
[RAISHIN] You're the
twit this time, Char.

197
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,625
That look on your face
means something's wrong,

198
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,125
and I won't give up
'til I find out what.

199
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,125
If you're that worried,
the solution's simple enough:

200
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,416
go to the infirmary
and visit him.

201
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,166
I am not
going to visit him.

202
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,375
I'm not worried in
the slightest about

203
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,250
that great bumbling buffoon.

204
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,833
His noggin's as
thick as a tree trunk,

205
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,500
so I'm sure he'll be fine.

206
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,041
[SIGMUND] The lady
doth protest too much.

207
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,083
The more obstinate you are,

208
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,666
the clearer your
true feelings become.

209
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,041
What feelings?

210
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,666
[SIGMUND]
For Raishin, of course.

211
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,583
You are attracted to him, yes?

212
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,083
I am nothing of the sort!

213
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,625
How could you even think of
something so absurd as that?

214
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,916
Instead of chicken for lunch,

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,416
you get herring from a tin.

216
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,291
Really smelly herring.

217
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,666
You seem to be trying a
bit too hard to deny it, Char.

218
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,375
Why is that, now?

219
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,875
I'm not denying a thing!

220
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,416
What I mean is I can't let
myself have feelings for him.

221
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
It would be inconvenient.

222
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,541
Emotions make
things too complicated.

223
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,750
[sighs]

224
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,458
You humans seem to
live for "complicated."

225
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,750
But, if you want
my advice, I--

226
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,250
[knock, knock]

227
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,583
Who's there?

228
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,583
[CHARLOTTE] Henri?

229
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,416
I can't believe it's really you!

230
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,125
Are you all right?

231
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,041
Where have you
been all this time?

232
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,208
Where's Mother?

233
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,125
What are you doing
at the academy?

234
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,791
Enough questions.

235
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,166
You'll have ample chance to
interrogate your sister later.

236
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,875
[SIGMUND] It's been
a long time, Henri.

237
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,666
Well, as you humans
mark it, anyhow.

238
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,125
It's good to
see you, Sigmund.

239
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,458
I hope you're well.

240
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,291
[SIGMUND] I'm glad
to know you're safe.

241
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,958
As you can imagine, Char's
been quite worried about you.

242
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:23,750
[HENRIETTE] I'm sorry, Char.

243
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,291
Please don't cry.

244
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,125
[CHARLOTTE] Why shouldn't
I have a good cry?

245
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,541
Seems perfectly natural to me!

246
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,666
[CHARLOTTE]
What's happened, Henri?

247
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,291
Please. You can tell me.

248
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,458
[HENRIETTE] I've been
given a dreadful task.

249
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,083
[CHARLOTTE] I'm confused.
What sort of task?

250
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,500
And what does it have
to do with the academy?

251
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,666
I'm so sorry, sister!
I've come here to hurt you!

252
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,000
[gasps]

253
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,041
[YAYA] It's getting late.
Shouldn't we stop?

254
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,791
[RAISHIN]
Are you tired?

255
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,000
No, of course not.

256
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,041
Yaya's tougher and
more tireless than you are!

257
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,125
[RAISHIN sighs]

258
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,791
Guess I should
head to the festival.

259
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,791
I'm sorry, but I have to
ask even more of you.

260
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,791
[YAYA] Don't worry!
Yaya lives to serve.

261
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,000
[YAYA] What is it, Raishin?
Is something wrong?

262
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,416
[RAISHIN] I could
have sworn I heard--

263
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,708
Never mind. Let's go.

264
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,708
[MALE STUDENT 9A]
Silent Roar left,

265
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,833
so I guess that's the end
of competition for tonight.

266
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:34,875
[MALE STUDENT 9B]
Doesn't seem like

267
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,000
number eighty-seven's
gonna show.

268
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,375
Frey's not here.

269
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,666
She must've gone home
for the night already, huh?

270
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,166
Yeah, looks like
she put her time

271
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,708
in first to avoid
having to face us.

272
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,458
But on the schedule
it says we're supposed

273
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,708
to battle number
eighty-seven tonight.

274
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,791
Do you know who that is?

275
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,541
You're thinking about her.

276
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,375
You're standing there right now,
thinking about Charlotte.

277
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,625
[RAISHIN] How did
you know that?

278
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:06,958
[ringing bell]

279
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,666
[CHARLOTTE] Don't you dare!

280
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,791
[HENRIETTE] Ch-- Charlotte!

281
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,125
[CHARLOTTE]
Don't do anything stupid!

282
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,000
[CHARLOTTE] Whatever you think,
it's not for the best!

283
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,083
I know you're
terrified of hurting me.

284
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,208
But seeing my sister again,

285
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,875
knowing our mother is
still alive somewhere,

286
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,375
that's worth any
amount of pain to me.

287
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:51,166
[HENRIETTE] I'm sorry,
Charlotte! So very sorry.

288
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,875
[CHARLOTTE] You don't need
to worry about it anymore.

289
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,166
Tomorrow, I shall put
an end to all of it.

290
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,875
[HENRIETTE] Please forgive me!

291
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,500
[CHARLOTTE] Don't apologize!

292
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,000
When all this is over, we'll
be together again. Understand?

293
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,750
[HENRIETTE] Yes.

294
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,166
[KIMBERLEY] Come.

295
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,458
Ah, Second Last;

296
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,458
I assumed you'd come
calling before long.

297
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,500
Yaya dear.
Make us a spot of tea.

298
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,500
Oh, of course!

299
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,500
So, what would
you like to know?

300
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,166
Since you're an
academy professor

301
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,125
and a part of Nectar,
I know you're well-connected.

302
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,083
That's how you were able to
hush it up when I snuck out.

303
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,291
And it's also the reason
Frey and Loki didn't have

304
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,041
their automatons
confiscated, isn't it?

305
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,250
[KIMBERLEY] At this point, I see
no reason to hide that from you.

306
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,541
However, it should not be
a matter of public knowledge.

307
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,208
Should anyone learn
of this from you--

308
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,083
The debt
I owe you is huge.

309
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,916
I promise I'll take
your secret to the grave.

310
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,541
[KIMBERLEY] How very noble.
See that you do.

311
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,875
But I'd like to know
who's manipulating Char.

312
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,416
Oh?
You're certain someone

313
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,250
behind the scenes
is pulling her strings?

314
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,916
That she isn't acting
of her own free will?

315
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,125
[RAISHIN]
Come on, you know Char.

316
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,458
She's not a violent person.

317
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,041
She would never use
Sigmund's power to kill.

318
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,541
[KIMBERLEY]
She destroyed the clock tower.

319
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,166
That seems awfully violent.

320
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,583
[RAISHIN] And how
many deaths were there?

321
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,916
Zero fatalities.
Several injuries, however.

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,750
[RAISHIN] Point made.
So who was she after?

323
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,250
[KIMBERLEY] You're unusually
sharp today, aren't you?

324
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,375
I'm still investigating,

325
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,000
but I do know the
most likely target.

326
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,208
I believe she is after

327
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,875
our esteemed headmaster,
Edward Rutherford.

328
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,458
[gasps]

329
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,541
[RAISHIN] Why? Does she have a
grudge against him or something?

330
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,625
Not that I'm aware.

331
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,250
I assume she's being used.

332
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,791
As you surmised, I don't think
she's acting on her own.

333
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,583
But by whom?

334
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,500
By whom do you think, lad?

335
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,583
Must be someone with reason
to be angry with the headmaster.

336
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,625
Only one I can think
who fits the bill is Felix.

337
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,333
Or, really any of
the Kingsfort family.

338
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,958
[KIMBERLEY]
What a compelling theory.

339
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,083
[RAISHIN] But that's stupid.

340
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,291
Why wouldn't they
be targeting me?

341
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,541
Oh, I'm sure they'd find

342
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,041
it highly satisfying
to kill you, as well.

343
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,291
But your death offers
no profit, so it's unlikely.

344
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,958
What do you suppose
the Kingsforts want more

345
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,291
than anything else right now?

346
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,583
Restored status?

347
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:08,750
Precisely.

348
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,125
Sir Walter wants to
reclaim their lost honor

349
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,500
and return the family
to political prominence.

350
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,250
The best way to do
that is to cast doubt

351
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,166
upon the situation that
resulted in their downfall.

352
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,791
That doesn't
make sense either.

353
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,333
Wouldn't assassinating
the headmaster

354
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,375
basically be an
admission of their guilt?

355
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,583
[KIMBERLEY] The point here
is to turn black and white

356
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,666
into shades of gray.

357
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,750
The Kingsforts are famous for
their philanthropic endeavors.

358
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,583
The Belews, however, well,
the Belews are famous

359
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:37,000
for the scandal which led
to their utter disgrace.

360
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,750
[RAISHIN] What scandal?

361
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,166
[KIMBERLEY] You don't know?

362
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,291
The Belews' prized dog
automaton went berserk during

363
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,166
the Prince of Wales'
hunting party

364
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,583
and began savagely
attacking Prince Edmund.

365
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,041
The young prince
was nearly mauled

366
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,166
to death before
anybody could stop it.

367
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,083
The house of Belew is
now an enemy of the Crown.

368
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,875
Public opinion will
follow Crown favor.

369
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,708
[RAISHIN] So if they
trick Char into killing

370
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,583
and make her their patsy.

371
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,208
[KIMBERLEY] How easy
will it be to let her take

372
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:06,291
the fall for the crimes
of which Felix is accused?

373
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,583
You should back out
of this before it's too late.

374
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,000
Not gonna happen!

375
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,625
Especially if the Kingsforts
are really behind all this.

376
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,166
[KIMBERLEY]
You don't get it, do you?

377
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,666
There's not so much
as a shred of proof.

378
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,625
All of what
I've shared with you is

379
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,333
pure speculation,
and nothing more.

380
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,291
If you let your emotions
get the better of you,

381
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,791
and cause an incident,

382
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,750
the Belew sisters
will be even worse off.

383
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,625
[RAISHIN] So what we
need is hard evidence.

384
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,250
That is correct.

385
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,041
Honest-to-God proof
would solve everything.

386
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,333
[YAYA] It's much too late
for you to be awake.

387
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,916
You should get some sleep.

388
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,208
[RAISHIN] Oh, I will.

389
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,666
Just as soon as
you get out of my bed.

390
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,625
Yaya. About the question
you asked this afternoon.

391
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,125
Why I'm so dead-set
on helping Char.

392
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:04,208
Why I refuse to abandon her even
after Shoko laid down the law.

393
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,458
Truth is, I don't know, either.

394
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,375
Despite what you think,
I'm not in love with Charlotte.

395
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,416
She and Sigmund are some of the

396
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,250
toughest competitors
in the festival,

397
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,166
so I might be better off
if they were gone.

398
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,458
But if they're in trouble,
I have to help them.

399
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,208
Yes, but why?

400
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,500
It's not about Char;
I'd help Frey, too.

401
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:27,958
And you, obviously.
Loki'd probably just get mad.

402
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:28,958
But what can I say?

403
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,250
I'd help him if
he needed it, too.

404
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,416
And now we have Henri
to worry about, as well.

405
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,583
Yaya understands.

406
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,000
She'll always do
whatever you say.

407
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,833
I really am sorry I'm always
causing trouble for you.

408
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,416
[YAYA] No, please.
Never apologize for that.

409
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,833
Yaya is happy just
to be by your side.

410
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,000
Tell you what.

411
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,833
One of these days,
I'll make it up to you.

412
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,958
Oh? Really, Raishin?
You promise?

413
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,958
So does that mean you're
going to marry Yaya?

414
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,125
[RAISHIN]
Why would it mean that?

415
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,625
[YAYA] Because!
You just said you promise

416
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,416
to do anything Yaya wanted,
no matter what!

417
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,000
That's not what I said at all!

418
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,416
I just told you
I'd make it up to you!

419
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,958
Fine. Yaya will settle
for being your wife!

420
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,208
[RAISHIN]
How is that settling?

421
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,750
You just said the same
thing a different way!

422
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,541
[YAYA] If you want to pay Yaya
back for causing her trouble,

423
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,833
then let her do things
to you right now!

424
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,000
[RAISHIN] I can't breathe!

425
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,166
Not sure how many more
sleepless nights I can take.

426
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,500
That must be
because you were

427
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,000
even more passionate
than usual last night.

428
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,375
Twisting the facts as always.

429
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,458
Let's be clear: I was
passionate in my resistance.

430
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,000
[MALE STUDENT 9C]
Hey, did you hear?

431
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,458
Rumor has it Tyrant Rex is the
one who destroyed the tower.

432
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,625
Hard to believe a noble

433
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,291
would attack a
school monument.

434
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,708
That's serious stuff.

435
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,041
Maybe they were wrong
to clear her name before.

436
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,333
Perhaps she is a bad seed.

437
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,666
Makes me wonder
about Cannibal Candy.

438
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,583
I never quite believed Felix
Kingsfort would kill anyone.

439
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,166
[MALE STUDENT 9E]
If Tyrant Rex is rotten,

440
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,791
that casts doubt on
Second Last as well.

441
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:56,916
[MALE STUDENT 9C]
He only just arrived,

442
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,125
and he slithered
right into the festival.

443
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,208
Seems awfully convenient to me--

444
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,166
[RAISHIN]
Don't let 'em get to you.

445
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,666
Anyway, lessons are
suspended for the day.

446
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,333
Let's start by
looking for Henri,

447
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,250
then we'll see
if we can find Char...

448
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,958
Why did you stop?
Is something the matter?

449
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,208
Henri's right there.

450
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,250
And she's in a hurry.

451
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,083
Sure wish I knew
what she was up to.

452
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,500
[YAYA] Raishin!

453
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,000
[RAISHIN] Headmaster Rutherford!

454
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,166
What's he doing down there?

455
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,333
Oh, I see.
He's inspecting the damage.

456
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,166
[KIMBERLEY] I assume
she's being used.

457
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,083
As you surmised, I don't
think she's acting on her own.

458
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,250
I believe she is after

459
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,458
our esteemed headmaster,
Edward Rutherford.

460
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,666
[RAISHIN] Oh no!

461
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,000
[YAYA] What?

462
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,875
[RAISHIN] I need you to
get ahold of Shoko, fast!

463
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,500
[YAYA]
No! Yaya's coming with you!

464
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,500
Hurry! I'm counting on you!

465
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,833
Oh man,
she's really gonna do it!

466
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,916
No, Char! Hold your fire!

467
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,125
Please listen to me!

468
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,791
Dammit! Henri's in
the line of fire!
