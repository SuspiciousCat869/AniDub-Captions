1
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,083
[YAYA] Raishin!

2
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:47,125
Please don't go!
Raishin! Please!

3
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,916
[RAISHIN] Wh-- Nadeshiko?

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,166
[NADESHIKO]
Please don't go, Raishin!

5
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,916
You know I don't
have any choice.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,916
Dad's making me.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,208
You can't!

8
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,833
You said we'd watch the
Ryogoku Bridge fireworks

9
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,375
together again next year,
or was that a lie?

10
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,791
You told me you
would stay right here

11
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:07,208
by my side until I find
a husband, remember?

12
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,583
You promised!
But you lied to me!

13
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,666
How can I forgive you?

14
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,083
It's time to grow up.

15
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,625
If you're so helpless without
your big brother around,

16
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,458
it's good that I'm going.

17
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,583
[sobs]

18
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,750
Just open your eyes!

19
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,875
Please, Raishin! Wake up!

20
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,375
Cherubim. We're done here.

21
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,000
[CHERUBIM]
Yes, sir. Why, sir?

22
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,708
Wouldn't want
him to die on me.

23
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,875
That'd result in
my disqualification.

24
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,125
[CHERUBIM] Yes, sir.

25
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,291
[YAYA sobs]

26
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,791
[BRONSON] Why did you not
take his glove when he was down?

27
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,291
I could have
made the attempt,

28
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,500
but the automaton would've
fought back most strenuously.

29
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,250
What should you
care if it did?

30
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,000
You think <i>my</i> Cherubim
would be bested

31
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,500
by a doll with an
unconscious puppeteer?

32
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,333
It was a Banned Doll, sir.

33
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,750
If we'd kept on, its puppeteer
would've died before long.

34
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,250
Contestants who
cause the death of

35
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:12,291
an opponent are disqualified--
regardless of the reason.

36
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,541
Very well.

37
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,750
You've one more thing
still to explain, boy.

38
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:19,041
Why did you forfeit seventh
place and drop to ninety-ninth?

39
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,916
I had to keep
Frey out of that fight.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,166
There was no chance
that she would win.

41
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,666
We want to compare the Garms'
and Angels' performance.

42
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,791
To do that, we must
eliminate Second Las--

43
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,416
[BRONSON] That
won't be called for.

44
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,541
If you do not stop
acting without my leave,

45
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,333
I shall be forced
to stop your heart.

46
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,791
Now, when you
face Rabbi tomorrow,

47
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,458
endeavour to destroy it.

48
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,708
It will be best
for Frey, as well.

49
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,333
As you wish, Father.
I understand.

50
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:49,958
[YAYA] Yaya is his puppet!

51
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,708
Let her come in
with him! Please!

52
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,958
[CHARLOTTE thinking]
Idiot girl!

53
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,666
They'll find out she's
a Banned Doll for sure!

54
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,875
Sister, why are you here?

55
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,041
[CHARLOTTE thinking]
"Sister"?

56
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,666
You need to
calm down, Yaya.

57
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,125
But Raishin
won't wake up!

58
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:08,333
It was just like that other
time! He shielded Yaya!

59
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,000
All that blood!
It was Yaya's fault!

60
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,041
She's a bad doll! She--

61
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,375
Now, take a breath.

62
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,666
How do you think panicking
will help the situation?

63
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,791
[IRORI] You know
how strong Raishin is;

64
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,208
you need to believe in him.

65
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,833
Show him some patience.

66
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,333
If nothing else,

67
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,291
you know he'll refuse to die
until he's defeated Tenzen.

68
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,833
[CHARLOTTE]
Has there been any change?

69
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,666
[SIGMUND] None. He's still
unconscious, apparently.

70
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,500
Keep resting. I shall
alert you if he wakes.

71
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,791
[CHARLOTTE] Mm.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,875
[CHARLOTTE] He is such an idiot.

73
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,916
A prize idiot.
A boundless idiot!

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,333
No human could
withstand an attack like

75
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,750
that without sustaining
life-threatening damage.

76
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,958
[SIGMUND]
About that...

77
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,500
Huh?

78
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,750
It sounds strange,

79
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,333
but I think Loki
may have held back.

80
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,833
I don't see how
that would be possible.

81
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,916
Cherubim was in the
middle of his attack,

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,416
and Loki could only ease
off at that point if--

83
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,083
Wait, could there
be a magic circuit

84
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,750
that allows for
such precise control?

85
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,916
I cannot be certain,

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,333
but the answer to
that may hold the key

87
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,083
to the Blade Emperor's defeat.

88
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,583
We must be
sure to tell the idiot

89
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,875
about this when
he awakens.

90
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,125
Must we?

91
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,375
The more Raishin wins,
the stronger he'll become.

92
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,583
Imagine just how powerful
he'll be once he's worked

93
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,500
his way through the ranks
and he finally has to face you.

94
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,125
Don't get carried
away, Sigmund.

95
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,541
I am still Charlotte
of the House of Belew!

96
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,083
No matter how
powerful he becomes,

97
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,083
I shall face him on the
battlefield and crush him.

98
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,041
[thinking] You had
better not die, Raishin.

99
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,458
After all, you
should be honored just

100
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,625
to have me worrying about you!

101
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,666
[YAYA] If there are any
gods out there listening,

102
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,791
please save Raishin's life.
Yaya begs you.

103
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,333
She promises not to
be selfish anymore.

104
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,291
Even if Raishin flirts
with a human girl,

105
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,250
Yaya will not be
angry or jealous.

106
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,958
Even if he rejects
Yaya's attention

107
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,583
and comes home
smelling of another girl.

108
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,958
Or spurns Yaya for
one of those vixens.

109
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,166
Even if one day

110
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,083
he suddenly declares
he's found a girlfriend.

111
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,958
[rumbling]

112
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,916
N-n-no wait!
That was an accident!

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,333
Yaya will be good! She promises!

114
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,291
Yaya won't be jealous or
obsessive or violent ever again!

115
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,583
[KIMBERLEY] So. How is he?

116
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,958
[CRUEL] Lucky, that's how.

117
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,291
He was slashed
with a giant sword

118
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,583
and he's still breathing.

119
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,916
That's a good start.

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,041
A couple more millimeters

121
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,916
and it would have
punctured a lung.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,291
A centimeter would've
hit his heart.

123
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,833
[KIMBERLEY] It is likely he'll
survive, though?

124
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,166
[CRUEL] As far as this
wound, yeh. However.

125
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,375
His vital forces are
still being drained.

126
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,333
He could drop dead,
without any warning.

127
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,583
Thanks, Doc.

128
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,416
So, lad, do you
have enough fight left

129
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,958
in you to return
to the festival?

130
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,083
[MALE STUDENT 7A] See!

131
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,916
Blade Emperor's keen
for the fight to start.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,208
[MALE STUDENT 7B]
Well, I dunno why.

133
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,375
The bottom fifty together
couldn't match him.

134
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,291
This fight'll be a bore.

135
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,333
[MALE STUDENT 7C] Shh! Look!

136
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,750
Here comes Silent Roar!

137
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,875
[LOKI] I'm surprised
you're here, Frey.

138
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,708
Disappointed as well,
I might add.

139
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,625
I expected you to
back out of this bout.

140
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,166
No. I would never
run away from this, Loki.

141
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,500
[LOKI] Ever since
we were children,

142
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,541
you've been slow and
clumsy at everything.

143
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,416
Always so eager to give up
when things got hard.

144
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,833
How many hundreds
of times did you

145
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,333
get frightened and
run to me for protection?

146
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,666
Yet here you are now.

147
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,500
You don't actually
intend to fight me?

148
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,875
You don't get it.

149
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,083
My entire life,

150
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,958
I've always thought
you could do anything.

151
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,083
So bright and
brilliant and strong.

152
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,708
Good at everything you try.

153
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,458
Never letting fear take over.

154
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,416
Just calm and steady.

155
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,541
And that made
things easy for me.

156
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,916
All I had to do was stay near
you and keep out of sight.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,291
Now here we are.

158
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,750
You may despise me,
but it doesn't matter.

159
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,791
I am going to
fight you tonight!

160
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,833
I can't keep cowering
in your shadow.

161
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,750
I can't protect
anyone from there!

162
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,791
You foolish girl.

163
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,791
Who are you protecting?

164
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,625
Rabbi!

165
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,041
Feeble attempt.

166
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,333
Evade!

167
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,333
Go, Rabbi! Attack again!

168
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,666
You didn't learn
the first time?

169
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,083
Rabbi!

170
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,750
Rabbi. No!

171
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,416
You'll want to
close your eyes.

172
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,541
This will be its end.

173
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,041
[CHARLOTTE] Such strong magic!

174
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,000
How can a human even
put out that much power?

175
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,208
Rabbi? Are you--?

176
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,916
Something is wrong over there.

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,458
That's not Frey's magic
controlling him anymore.

178
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,833
[growls]

179
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,500
[FREY] Wha--?

180
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,791
[screams]

181
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,708
What the devil is going on?

182
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,833
[SIGMUND] Looks as
if Frey's magical power

183
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,750
is being forcibly
drained out of her.

184
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,666
What do you mean
"forcibly"? That shouldn't--!

185
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,333
If it doesn't stop,
she'll die!

186
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,125
[CHARLOTTE]
What's that around them?

187
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,208
Looks like some
kind of force field.

188
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,416
Her blood is being
transformed into magic.

189
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,291
Cherubim. Halt.

190
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,916
[CHERUBIM] Yes, sir.

191
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,291
No! Rabbi! Stop it!

192
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,916
We have to help them!

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,041
You will do no such thing!

194
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,750
Students may enter the festival
arena by invitation only.

195
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,250
Setting foot in there <i>now</i>

196
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,333
would be the very
definition of poor form!

197
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,583
[CHARLOTTE] Now is not the
time to worry about form!

198
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,458
Stand down, Tyrant Rex.

199
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,750
Someone is already on the job.

200
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,500
Huh?

201
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,833
That bloody idiot!

202
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,333
[RAISHIN] Mind if I cut in?

203
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,750
Think I'd like to
give this dance a try.

204
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,458
Now, Yaya!

205
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,291
Whistle Twenty-f--

206
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,666
Ugh! Wha'd you do that for?

207
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,125
[LOKI] For sticking
your nose in again!

208
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,833
Now buzz off and
annoy someone else.

209
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,541
Cherub--

210
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,500
What was that for?

211
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,125
For bein' an
arrogant ass!

212
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,208
Do you even know
what you're gonna do?

213
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,125
You are a complete
and total idiot.

214
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,041
Obviously, I'm going to
stop Rabbi from killing me.

215
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,500
No, you're the
idiot here.

216
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,250
Don't you see
what's going on?

217
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,916
If you attack now, you're
putting Frey's life in danger!

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,541
You don't
understand anything.

219
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,416
Now shut up and watch, while
<i>I</i> do what needs to be done.

220
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,041
[RAISHIN]
You shut up and watch me!

221
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,000
[LOKI] Not a chance, idiot!

222
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,666
You are determined
to interfere!

223
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,041
Sure am! I won't
let you kill Rabbi!

224
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,000
[LOKI] If he isn't put down,
spectators might get hurt,

225
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,625
and Frey will likely die.

226
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,750
[RAISHIN]
If that's your only plan,

227
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,583
back off and let me do this.

228
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,916
I'll stop him,
without killing him!

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,583
[thud]

230
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,250
Augh! Uhnn...

231
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,958
[LOKI] Give up.
You can barely stand as it is.

232
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,166
This is the only way
left to save my sister.

233
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,041
[LOKI] I'll destroy
its heart in one blow.

234
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,375
The monster must die,
so Frey may live.

235
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,958
[RAISHIN]
That's not good enough.

236
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,083
If this ends with Frey
alive and Rabbi dead,

237
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,708
do you think she'll thank you?

238
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,625
You'll still be
killing a part of her!

239
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,833
So what's your solution?

240
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,666
Save the dog and watch her die?

241
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,666
No, idiot.
I plan to save them both!

242
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,291
Yaya! Whistle 24 Sho!

243
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,708
Right!

244
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,416
[RAISHIN] Good job!

245
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,666
Now hold him back for me!

246
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,625
Don't hurt him!

247
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,250
[RAISHIN] Loki?

248
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,750
I am a humble,
tolerant person.

249
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,708
However, what I cannot abide
is someone who is all talk.

250
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,875
You say you can handle this,

251
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,208
so hurry and do it
so I can kill you.

252
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,375
Dream on, pretty boy.

253
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,791
I'm gonna kill you first!

254
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,458
All talk!

255
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,166
[RAISHIN] Sorry for this.

256
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,541
Behold: a goddess!

257
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,875
Thank you for coming.
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,541
It's just that-- I have
no one else to turn to.

259
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,916
Now's not the time, boy,
but there will be a lecture.

260
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,458
I wouldn't want to intrude
without your permission.

261
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,916
Granted, of course.

262
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,875
In fact, I'd be honored.

263
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,083
It's not often I get to see
the great Karyusai at work.

264
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:34,791
I'll need insulated forceps
and a conductance catheter.

265
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,000
Ethanol and
distilled water, too.

266
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,625
Plus salt, and plenty of it;

267
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,958
the last thing
I want is to run out.

268
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,833
Irori, go and fetch

269
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,041
me a washbasin
full of ice, won't you?

270
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,541
[IRORI] Yes, ma'am.

271
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,416
[SHOKO] If it's not too
much trouble, Professor.

272
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,083
Would you locate
a pair of shears,

273
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,291
and snip a lock
of the girl's hair?

274
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
About Rabbi.

275
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,166
[SHOKO] Save it.
You owe me dearly, boy.

276
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,250
A magic circuit.

277
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,166
You just removed
it from him?

278
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,833
[SHOKO] The Army will receive
the specimen they requested.

279
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,458
They should have
no reason to complain

280
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,750
that I left the
poor dog alive.

281
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,041
Thank you, ma'am.

282
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,458
You're getting
ahead of yourself.

283
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,791
Don't thank me yet.

284
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,625
His chances of survival
are still quite slim.

285
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,666
So, what exactly
happened out there?

286
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,666
Why did Rabbi
suddenly lose control?

287
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,208
Silly boy, you
have it backwards.

288
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,333
Frey was the one
who lost control.

289
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,875
What?

290
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,833
[SHOKO] The amount of power Frey

291
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,291
sent Rahbi exceeded safe levels.

292
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:51,000
It overwhelmed his reason,
turning him into a monster.

293
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,708
Clearly you didn't know there's

294
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,041
a magic circuit
installed in Frey's heart.

295
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,583
In her heart?

296
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,750
[SHOKO] Like a parasite designed

297
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,791
to forcibly extract
power from its host.

298
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,083
While it increases
her magical affinity,

299
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,250
it will, eventually,
reconfigure her entire body.

300
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,083
[SHOKO] Have you heard
of "White Mediums"?

301
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,500
In this country,

302
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,958
I understand they are
known as "Promised Children."

303
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,083
Young people born
incredibly rich in magic.

304
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,375
Can you imagine the benefits

305
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,875
if these kids could
be mass produced?

306
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,791
You're saying you
think Frey and Loki are--?

307
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,416
[SHOKO]
Synthetic White Mediums, yes.

308
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,458
Divine Works' most
important laboratory rats.

309
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,416
Frey's power is unnatural.

310
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,041
Its flow has been
artificially divided.

311
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,708
There can be no doubt,

312
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,416
her heart has definitely
been mechanized.

313
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,125
[RAISHIN] Divine Works installed
machines inside of humans?

314
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,291
[SHOKO]
The change in their coloring

315
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,333
is the most visible side effect.

316
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,958
The load on their bodies must
cause a breakdown in melanin.

317
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,875
[RAISHIN] That sort of
procedure can't be easy?

318
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,166
[SHOKO] Of course not.

319
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,875
Did you not see what
happened to those children

320
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,166
whose surgeries were
less than successful?

321
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,083
Not another step.

322
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,583
I forbid you from setting
one foot off campus.

323
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,083
Ugh! But, ma'am!

324
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,958
Do you remember our
discussion about arrogance?

325
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,750
You can do nothing about
this situation, boy.

326
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,166
How much more plainly
must I phrase it?

327
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,333
Any way you slice it,
you're simply no match for him.

328
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,666
Try as you might,
you would accomplish nothing.

329
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,750
[RAISHIN]
"Him," who?

330
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,125
The head of Divine
Works, naturally.

331
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,250
Named Bronson.

332
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,875
He was a student
here twenty years ago.

333
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,208
Even earned the Wise Man title.

334
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,708
Now, I hope you haven't
forgotten our agreement.

335
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,458
You don't get to
die a pointless death.

336
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,083
Are you sure
you're allowed out of bed?

337
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,375
Just so y'know,

338
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,125
Shoko's the
world's best doll maker.

339
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:02,625
So, uh, I'm sayin' there's
a good chance he'll make it.

340
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:08,791
When he's feeling up to it,

341
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,416
you should think about
letting Char visit.

342
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,833
She kinda has a
soft spot for dogs.

343
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,875
Doesn't sound
like Tyrant Rex.

344
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,916
Yeah, an intimidating nickname,

345
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,291
but not a bad person.

346
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,083
Tough to get to know, maybe.

347
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:25,583
She's not really unfriendly
though, just misunderstood.

348
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,958
She's kind of
like me in some ways.

349
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,250
I don't have many friends
either, but I wasn't lonely.

350
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:36,041
I had my family, and,
of course, I always had Rabbi.

351
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,625
And Yomi?
Was she like family, too?

352
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,875
Absolutely.
We were very close.

353
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,333
In fact, she was almost
like a second mother to me.

354
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,041
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.

355
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,291
Don't blame yourself.

356
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:56,291
It was me. It was
because I was so weak.

357
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,166
When my parents died,

358
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,708
I was supposed to
be the one on stage,

359
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,291
but I was too scared.

360
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,625
So my mom--
she went instead.

361
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,583
Loki, my own
brother, hates me,

362
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,666
because I'm weak and
frightened and worthless.

363
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,833
But he's strong, strong enough
to be Cherubim's operator.

364
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,791
[FREY] I'm sorry, Rabbi.

365
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,541
I'm sorry I didn't protect you.

366
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:27,291
I'm sorry everyone dies
because I'm so weak!

367
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,166
[RAISHIN] Don't say that.

368
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,708
It's not true!

369
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,416
None of it's your fault.

370
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,166
Understand? Not one bit.

371
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:50,916
[RAISHIN] Yaya.

372
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,958
[YAYA] Yes?

373
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,041
[RAISHIN] I'm an idiot, right?

374
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,833
Yes!

375
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,666
[CHARLOTTE]
And where do you think

376
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,083
you're off to at this hour?

377
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,666
[RAISHIN] Taking a stroll.

378
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,208
To the orphanage, I'd guess?

379
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,625
You're gonna steal
Rabbi's automaton siblings

380
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,375
before they're
demolished, aren't you?

381
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,041
[RAISHIN]
Nice girls don't eavesdrop.

382
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,791
And here I thought
you were a lady.

383
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,208
You can barely even walk,

384
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,041
and you want to put
your body through more?

385
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,083
Think this through.

386
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,541
You're half-dead already!

387
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,083
Are you hoping
to finish the job?

388
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,958
There's nothing
to worry about, Char.

389
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,916
I have the world's
best automaton at my side.

390
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,750
No one can touch me.

391
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,458
Besides, I thought this was the
kind of thing <i>you'd</i> understand.

392
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,458
Because family is sacred.

393
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,208
And you don't let it
go without a fight.

394
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,791
[CHARLOTTE]
I'll have to stop you, then.

395
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,416
You want to get yourself killed?

396
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,875
You'll have to fight
me for the privilege.

397
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,750
[RAISHIN] What are you
getting so worked up for?

398
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,375
So what if I die?
No loss to you, right?

399
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,125
[CHARLOTTE] It isn't about that!

400
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,875
Look, I owe you a
debt for saving me.

401
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,875
Well, assisting me, a little.

402
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,500
And as a proper English lady,
it is only right I return

403
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,125
the favor in kind by
rendering you assistance.

404
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,750
So there.
I shall do what's necessary.

405
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,000
Including protecting
you from yourself.

406
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,875
Even if it means you'll hate me
when all is said and done.

407
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,000
I think you're forgetting
about the amulet.

408
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,375
It's defensive
power saved my life.

409
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,833
So you owe me nothing.

410
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,750
We're even-steven, Char.

411
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,000
[CHARLOTTE] That was a
gift. It doesn't count.

412
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,625
[RAISHIN]
I'm asking for your trust.

413
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,166
You don't hafta trust in me.

414
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,791
But at least trust in the
magic strength of the amulet.

415
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,041
That is not fair.

416
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,333
It's downright tacky.

417
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,750
Using my gift
against me like that.

418
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,458
Hmph! Fine, you twit,

419
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,708
go die in a ditch somewhere!

420
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,041
And may wild dogs eat your body!

421
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,333
I can always
count on your stupidity.

422
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,250
It's as reliable as Big Ben!

423
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,708
[RAISHIN] Thanks to Komurasaki,

424
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,583
getting off campus
was simple enough.

425
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,166
But getting in there will
be a different matter.

426
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,000
[YAYA] They sure
have a lot of guards.

427
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,416
[RAISHIN]
What happened yesterday

428
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,208
must have made
them extra cautious.

429
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,708
You flirting
with Komurasaki?

430
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,625
Yaya's surprised it
didn't make them vomit.

431
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,916
Let it go Yaya, that's
not what happened.

432
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,500
And show some respect.
I almost died.

433
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,583
[YAYA]
They've already been scrapped?

434
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,750
[RAISHIN]
Dammit, I smell an ambush.

435
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,625
Time to get rowdy. Ready?

436
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,291
[YAYA] Yes. Yaya's always ready.

437
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,083
[RAISHIN] Flare 12 Ketsu!

438
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,458
[YAYA] Right!

439
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,750
[LOKI] I am a humble,
tolerant person.

440
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,208
However, there are three
things I simply cannot abide.

441
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,666
Those who order me around,
those who stand against me,

442
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,250
and, of course,
foolhardy idiots like you.
