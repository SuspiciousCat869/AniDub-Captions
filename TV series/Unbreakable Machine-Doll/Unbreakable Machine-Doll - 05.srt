1
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,791
[YAYA] You're amazing, Raishin!
That feels so--!

2
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,083
[YAYA moans]

3
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,666
[RAISHIN]
Quit yelling and moaning.

4
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,000
If anybody hears,

5
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,208
they'll think I'm doing
something untoward to you.

6
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,041
Well you don't
see that every day.

7
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,625
You've got a girl
hanging from a net?

8
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,916
What kinda sick
fetishes are you into?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,791
I've been with
you all morning.

10
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,708
[YAYA] Yaya looked away
for point-three seconds

11
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,291
in the changing room!

12
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,541
And you think in less than half
a second I could've done this?

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,708
[RAISHIN] All right, what
are you doing in my room?

14
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:22,125
Easy, puppy.
He's an automaton, right?

15
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,208
[RAISHIN] Don't tell me you
got caught in your own net.

16
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,708
Honeytrap! Honeytrap!

17
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,333
[RAISHIN] Oh yeah?
Then where's the honey?

18
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,500
Are you blind?

19
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:36,791
She dangled herself
in the air like that

20
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,875
to give you a look
at her undergarments!

21
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,708
If you want to see
knickers so badly,

22
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,083
then you look at Yaya's!

23
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,333
I don't wanna see that!

24
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,625
Pardon.

25
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:49,041
I appreciate your help.
That was so kind.

26
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,833
I have luncheon.

27
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:54,000
Please accept it as
a token of gratitude.

28
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,208
[YAYA] She brought you a meal?

29
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,958
You are dating this hussy!

30
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,500
She didn't make it to thank
me for something I just did.

31
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,541
Obviously it's a trap!

32
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,708
[FREY] It's quite tasty.
I am an excellent cook.

33
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,500
[RAISHIN] That seriously
isn't the issue here.

34
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,541
[sighs]

35
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,375
[RAISHIN] What's it spiked with?

36
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,083
Um. I'd wanted
sleeping potion,

37
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,000
but that proved rather
too difficult to obtain.

38
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,708
So instead just lots of salt.

39
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,000
That's a ridiculous
substitution!

40
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,708
What do you expect salt to...

41
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,083
a... ccom... plish...?

42
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,041
[YAYA]
Hmm?

43
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:47,333
[running shower]

44
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,625
[FREY] I have such a chill,
I shall catch my death!

45
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:01,416
Perhaps if you warm me
with your body heat.

46
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,833
Like Yaya said--
Honeytrap!

47
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,083
I give up.

48
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,958
Just tell me what
you're doing here.

49
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,083
Yeah. I'm here to...

50
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,666
...assass... inate you.

51
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,250
[CHARLOTTE] This is
beyond comprehension.

52
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,791
She was there to assassinate
you, and you let her go?

53
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,708
Anyways, the only
white-haired chit

54
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,750
with a pup at Walpurgis is Frey.

55
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,125
She's a third year.

56
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,500
Registration code: Silent Roar.

57
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,375
And she's ranked at ninety-nine.

58
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,000
Meaning she'll be
your first opponent.

59
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,375
Clearly she's decided
you're too much

60
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,708
of a threat, and wants
to eliminate you beforehand.

61
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,166
You may be
ranked one hundred.

62
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,416
But since defeating
Felix and Eliza,

63
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,958
people have gotten
nervous about you.

64
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,208
Well, speak of the devil
and he shall appear.

65
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,041
[RAISHIN] Frey again. What now?

66
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,416
[CHARLOTTE] I believe she's
building some sort of cage.

67
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,041
That must be the bait.
What's on that cover?

68
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,666
Wait. Is that what people here
actually think about me?

69
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,708
That I read that
sort of thing? Criminy.

70
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,833
[LOKI] What foolishness
are you up to now?

71
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,250
[CHARLOTTE] Blade Emperor Loki!

72
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:00,000
[RAISHIN] Huh. So that's the
guy they call Sacred Blaze?

73
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:00,875
[LOKI] Dammit, Frey.

74
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,625
Why are you still wearing those?

75
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,166
I told you:
you need to withdraw.

76
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,958
You'll be hurt.

77
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,166
Yes, but--

78
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,000
[CHARLOTTE] Loki is only
in his second year,

79
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,875
but he's already
one of the Rounds.

80
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,041
In fact, he's even seen

81
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,333
as a possible challenger
to the "Marshal."

82
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,208
[RAISHIN] He and
Frey kinda look alike.

83
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,208
Don'tcha think?

84
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,416
Yes, naturally.
They are siblings.

85
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,708
The weak shouldn't meddle
where they don't belong.

86
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,791
They should simply
obey the strong.

87
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:30,666
[growls]

88
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,291
[LOKI] Very well. Cherubim!

89
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,625
[CHERUBIM] Command.

90
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,375
He forgets I'm a
puppeteer, too.

91
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay, Rabbi. Let's go.

92
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,208
Attack.

93
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,333
[CHERUBIM] Ready.

94
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,166
Rabbi!

95
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,291
Festival starts
tomorrow, "Emperor."

96
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,125
You should save your energy.

97
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,166
[LOKI] Get stuffed.

98
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,083
No, thank you.

99
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,125
[LOKI] I'll kill you.

100
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,791
No to that one, too.

101
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,250
[LOKI] I am a humble,
tolerant person.

102
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:21,125
However, there are three
things I simply cannot abide.

103
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,791
People who order me around.

104
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,541
People who stand
against me. And, lastly--

105
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,500
Cocky Orientals
who stick their noses

106
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,416
where they don't belong!

107
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Hey, what a coincidence.

108
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,500
I hate arrogant Westerners who
start fights for no real reason.

109
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,833
[LOKI] You're a moron.

110
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,750
You shouldn't speak
to your betters like that.

111
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,250
[RAISHIN] I think
you're the moron.

112
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,375
People so quick to declare other
people morons usually are.

113
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,458
[LOKI] Absurd!

114
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,541
Do you even know
how high my marks are?

115
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,291
[RAISHIN] If you measure
your smarts by your marks,

116
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,208
that's further proof
you're a moron.

117
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,333
[LOKI] And you
preserve your pride

118
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,166
by insulting those
superior to you.

119
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,500
Now that is moronic.

120
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,833
[RAISHIN]
You're the moron, moron!

121
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:55,666
No, that's you!

122
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,500
Nuh-uh, you!

123
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,291
[CHARLOTTE] Oh, be quiet!

124
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,083
[CHARLOTTE] You're both morons.

125
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,666
If you keep this up any longer.

126
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,166
I'll be forced to
kill the two of you.

127
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,875
Back off, Tyrant Rex.

128
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,125
I suggest you withdraw from
the festival, Second Last.

129
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,500
And keep your distance
from me and my sister.

130
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,166
No chance.

131
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,041
Um. I must thank you again.

132
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,125
What were you
two fighting about?

133
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,208
Loki blames me.

134
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,000
Do excuse us;
it's hard to explain.

135
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,583
I must go.

136
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,250
Blames her?

137
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,166
[RAISHIN] Hey.
What department is she in?

138
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,166
History, if I'm not
mista--Wait, "hey"?

139
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,458
I'm not your wife, to be
addressed so familiarly!

140
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,541
Raishin's wife? His wife?

141
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,041
I think she might
be in trouble.

142
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,166
And you want to
come to her rescue.

143
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,666
Well, I am not helping you,
so don't even ask!

144
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,541
Raishin has one wife,
and that's Yaya!

145
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,333
Raishin has no wives!

146
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,333
[CHARLOTTE] Not so much as a
scrap of useful information!

147
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,083
Unless you wanna hear comments
on the size of her bosom.

148
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,416
Well, thanks anyway.

149
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,791
You were pretty adamant
about not helping before.

150
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:32,916
[CHARLOTTE]
Um... So... Uh...

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,291
Would you say that you
like a generous one, as well?

152
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,875
Generous what?

153
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,291
Are you kidding me?

154
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,916
Good lord, you're even stupider
than I thought you were.

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,958
[RAISHIN] Um?

156
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,875
[CHARLOTTE]
Bosom, you twit. Bosom!

157
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,500
Do you get it now,
or must I draw a picture?

158
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,875
[RAISHIN] If you really
care for someone,

159
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,083
that sort of thing
doesn't matter.

160
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,208
Hmm? You truly believe that?

161
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,166
[YAYA]
Of course not. He's lying!

162
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,041
Huh?

163
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,333
How naïve are you, Blondie?

164
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,750
Raishin likes an ample bosom,

165
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,083
one that bounces around,
like Frey's does.

166
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,333
Yaya.

167
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,041
"She's in trouble!
We need to help her!"

168
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,583
You're no gallant hero,
you want what's in her blouse!

169
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,708
You make me sick! Ugh!

170
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,583
How dare you treat women with
such little respect! You cad!

171
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,416
[slap]

172
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,625
[RAISHIN] Yaya.

173
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,458
[YAYA] Yes?

174
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,541
[RAISHIN] Guess what emotion
I'm feeling again.

175
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,833
Hint-hint:
it's bubbling out of control.

176
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,750
Once again, that little vixen
was clearly making eyes at you!

177
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,375
Now you're just being absurd!

178
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,541
She was only looking
for some friendly advice!

179
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,250
[YAYA] You're an idiot,
you know that?

180
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,541
A complete and utter idiot!

181
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,541
[KIMBERLEY] As you can see,

182
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,958
so long as a puppeteer
is unconscious,

183
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,875
he emits no magical power.

184
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,958
However, it is
possible to draw out

185
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,541
power using certain talismans.

186
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,125
Ow!

187
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,958
Are you okay?

188
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,875
I'm not tutoring
you for my benefit.

189
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,708
It would behoove you
to pay very close attention.

190
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,416
The festival starts tomorrow.

191
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,375
So why do <i>I</i> need the help?

192
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,750
We all fight on the
same terms anyway, right?

193
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,791
Not even a little bit.

194
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,791
Has nobody explained
the rules yet?

195
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,375
Your position is by
far the most difficult.

196
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,333
The festival is
essentially a melee.

197
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,541
Though it doesn't
start out as such.

198
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,583
On the first night,
those in the one hundredth

199
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,833
and ninety-ninth
slots do battle.

200
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,041
The contest is
suspended at midnight.

201
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,208
Anyone whose glove is taken
before then is eliminated.

202
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,000
The next day, number
ninety-eight takes the field,

203
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,250
even if ninety-nine and
one hundred are still standing.

204
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,541
[RAISHIN] Okay.
So at that point I relax

205
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,000
and watch the
rest of the fighting

206
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,708
until finally taking the
field against the Marshal.

207
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,500
Yes, that would
be easier, wouldn't it?

208
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,708
Too bad for you, only
those in the upper ranks

209
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,083
have the option
of sitting out a fight.

210
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,541
And worse, the
lower-ranked, like you,

211
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,000
must remain on
the field of battle

212
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,000
for the span of
at least one hour.

213
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,583
[KIMBERLEY] The textbook
approach would be...

214
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,208
[RAISHIN thinking] Is that
what Frey's after?

215
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,250
Does she want to be Wise Man
badly enough to kill for it?

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,833
Nothing ever changes.

217
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,750
This benighted
academy is exactly as

218
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,375
it was all those years ago.

219
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,291
So the festival
begins at last.

220
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,666
I hope you know,
I expect much of you.

221
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,458
Of me, sir?
You don't mean Loki?

222
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:19,583
Loki's situation differs a bit,
and don't be self-effacing.

223
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,166
Why bother when I understand
your particular talents

224
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,250
better than anyone else could?

225
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,541
I know how hard you apply
yourself to the task at hand.

226
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,333
Now then,
a small gift for you.

227
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:39,541
I-I'm sorry.
The promise you made.

228
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,416
You haven't forgotten?

229
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,666
No, child. I am
a man of my word.

230
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,125
Do your duty, and we shall
all live together again.

231
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,500
Yes, sir.

232
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,791
[MALE VOICE 5A] Amazing! Tenzen
is truly gifted at his craft.

233
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,208
[MALE VOICE 5B]
It is no exaggeration

234
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,875
to call the boy a prodigy!

235
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,208
[MALE VOICE 5C] Talent like his
you see once in a hundred years,

236
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,375
if you're lucky!

237
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,875
[MALE VOICE 5D]
There's no doubt about it.

238
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,250
He's going to make the Akabane
clan world-famous someday.

239
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,000
[MALE VOICE 5E] Raishin,
on the other hand.

240
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,125
He's a different story.

241
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,750
[NADESHIKO]
Raishin, wait! Don't go!

242
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,583
[NADESHIKO] You can't!

243
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,500
Please just say
this is a bad dream!

244
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,291
You'll become a great
puppet master, Nadeshiko.

245
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,583
Better than even Tenzen someday.

246
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,583
[RAISHIN] Yaya!

247
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,916
How many times
do I have to tell you?

248
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,791
[YAYA] What is it?
Are we being attacked?

249
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,958
[RAISHIN] You're not Yaya!
So, who--?

250
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,875
[YAYA] Would you care to
explain just what you're doing?

251
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,500
You won't even let
Yaya in your bed,

252
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,750
no matter how often she begs.

253
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,125
See?

254
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,541
It was an assassination
attempt, not--

255
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,958
[YAYA] Bouncy-bouncy!

256
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,916
[RAISHIN] No, don't look
there. Look here! Weapon!

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,666
[RAISHIN] Wait, please don't--!
Auuuughh!!

258
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,875
[RAISHIN]
Yeah. I need you

259
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,166
to dig into Frey's
background for me.

260
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,625
At this rate, I don't
know how many more

261
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,875
of these night
raids I'll survive.

262
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,000
[IRORI] I had no idea
she was so dangerous!

263
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,833
I'll tell Master
of this right away!

264
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,500
Actually, I meant--

265
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,416
[CHARLOTTE] It's awfully
early in the morning

266
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,125
to be looking so glum.

267
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,500
[CHARLOTTE] This business
with Frey reminded me

268
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,416
of something I'd heard before.

269
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,875
And I decided you would
benefit from knowing it.

270
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,500
You may express your gratitude.

271
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,250
[RAISHIN] Thank you so much.

272
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,791
[CHARLOTTE] Now, have you
heard of Divine Works?

273
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,166
[CHARLOTTE] They're a
machinart studio on the rise,

274
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,791
having received a
nomination to compete

275
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,083
for the English Army's next
generation weapons contract.

276
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,750
They hold the patent on
the "Sonic" magic circuit.

277
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,250
And, they sponsor
both Frey and Loki.

278
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,541
Which means what?

279
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,458
Well, Rabbi and
Cherubim might be

280
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,208
new prototypes they're
testing in the festival.

281
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,666
Thing is--

282
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,750
Divine Works has an
unsavory reputation.

283
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,291
Supposedly, they obtained some

284
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,541
of their patents
through outright bribery.

285
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,958
No need to hold back
with people like that.

286
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,125
Teach the bloomin'
prats a thing or two.

287
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,500
Oh yeah, tonight's when
the festival kicks off.

288
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,916
That's right.

289
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,333
I'm thrilled to see you're
taking this so seriously.

290
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,000
Whatever will be will be.

291
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:36,583
Idiot. Do one thing at least.
Don't forget the amulet.

292
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,375
Thanks for the reminder.

293
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,416
[RAISHIN] Sonic.

294
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,791
Down, boy! Rabbi! Heel!

295
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,041
Is his circuit
on the fritz?

296
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,125
Rabbi! Wake up!

297
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,833
[RAISHIN] Don't worry.
He'll be fine.

298
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,708
That was only meant to stun.

299
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,666
Thank goodness!

300
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,250
[RAISHIN] See?

301
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,208
[FREY] You're hurt. Hold on.

302
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,208
I appreciate it.

303
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,000
So, do you always
carry bandages with you?

304
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,958
Yes, I'm a bit accident prone.

305
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,250
I'm sure you've noticed.

306
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,916
Maybe a little clumsy.

307
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,791
[FREY] I know.

308
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,333
Um. What happened
with Rabbi?

309
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,916
Oh. I'm sorry about that.

310
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,375
Hey, no worries.
I'm not upset about it.

311
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,041
How could you not be?

312
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,625
Because I'm just not.

313
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,875
[RAISHIN] All right, come clean.

314
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,958
Why are you so desperately
trying to kill me?

315
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,750
[YAYA] She's had enough
chances. Let's kill her.

316
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,041
Please just give the order.
Tell Yaya to destroy her.

317
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,916
Yaya will crush her into
teeny tiny bouncy bits.

318
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,250
Ugh...

319
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,500
[YAYA] Do what needs
to be done, Raishin.

320
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,000
This situation is
growing dangerous.

321
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,333
Before long... Before long...

322
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,291
Her bosom will render
you completely powerless!

323
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,041
Hypnotized by
two big mounds of fat!

324
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,125
I don't think I'm
the one losing control.

325
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,791
Yaya will destroy
all the vixens!

326
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,166
How could you be
so cruel, Raishin?

327
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,000
Going behind Yaya's back.
Having a secret tryst with her!

328
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,250
In what way did that
look like a tryst to you?

329
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,041
I was nearly killed by
that dog of hers--

330
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,041
S'prise!
Long time no see!

331
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,958
[YAYA and RAISHIN]
Komurasaki!

332
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,208
[RAISHIN] You uh--look
like you've grown a little.

333
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:23,708
[KOMURASAKI] You noticed!
So, you wanna touch 'em?

334
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,041
[RAISHIN] Keep your shirt on!

335
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,916
I'm talking about your
height, not your chest.

336
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,375
[KOMURASAKI] Go on,
give 'em a li'l squeeze.

337
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,125
They might even be bigger
than my sister's now.

338
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,666
[RAISHIN] Let's just
change the subject.

339
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,250
I'm a grown up now.

340
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,250
So grown up in fact, you could
even marry me if you want to.

341
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,416
Hahahaha.

342
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,125
You always did like a
good joke, didn't you?

343
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,416
Now, come on over

344
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,625
and chat with your
big sister like a good girl.

345
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,583
Yaya even saved you a spot!

346
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,541
You can sit right here!

347
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,208
Careful, you might
hurt your hand.

348
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,750
You should be careful.

349
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,166
Raishin will stop liking you
if you behave so violently.

350
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:03,875
Raishin! You wouldn't!
Say it's not so!

351
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,750
So. If Shoko sent you,
I can probably guess the reason.

352
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,000
Time for some
reconnaissance work?

353
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,208
Clever as usual, I see!

354
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,458
The location we're infiltrating

355
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,416
should have many
secrets to reveal.

356
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,791
Let's go.

357
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,416
As an agent of the Army,
spywork is my official job.

358
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,875
So what will
Yaya be doing?

359
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,916
[KOMURASAKI]
Sorry, you're not invited.

360
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,333
[KOMURASAKI]
Really, it's true.

361
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,583
My instructions explicitly say
to bring only Raishin with me.

362
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,458
But-- No fair!

363
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,583
I'm sure we won't be long.

364
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,375
Fine. Go then.

365
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,458
[RAISHIN] Komurasaki?

366
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,791
[KOMURASAKI] Okay!
I'm excited. Let's do it!

367
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,125
Give me your magic, Raishin.

368
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,500
Pour it all into me! I'm ready.

369
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,083
Be careful.

370
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,083
[RAISHIN] Even though
I get why it's happening.

371
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,000
It always feels strange to
have people looking through me.

372
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,833
[KOMURASAKI]
Turbid Haze is so helpful.

373
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,916
When activated, it works as
sort of an "invisibility cloak."

374
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,583
It neutralizes the
observer's senses,

375
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,166
effectively putting
the user in stealth mode.

376
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,416
We could have a romp right here
and no one would even know.

377
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,625
[RAISHIN] You're starting
to sound like Yaya.

378
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,791
[KOMURASAKI] Aw, look!
So many puppies!

379
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,291
[RAISHIN] Here we go.

380
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,000
[jangle of keys]

381
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,500
[door creaking open]

382
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,416
[KOMURASAKI] Is it empty?

383
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,458
[RAISHIN] No. It's not.

384
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,916
[SIGMUND] This is a surprise.

385
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,125
You don't often come
out alone. Now then.

386
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,875
What did you wish
to speak with me about?

387
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,083
[YAYA] Yaya is
sorry to bother you.

388
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,666
But she wanted to know.

389
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,041
Have... Have you ever
wished you were human?

390
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,583
[SIGMUND] Hm. Would I be
correct in assuming that you do?

391
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,833
[YAYA] Human girls
have everything.

392
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,208
It isn't fair! Yaya wants more!

393
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:14,166
If only--if only
Yaya were human!

394
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,250
[SIGMUND] If you were,
I doubt you'd be

395
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,583
very good at protecting Raishin.

396
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,250
Is that really something
you'd be willing to sacrifice?

397
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,625
You are an extraordinarily
gifted automaton, Yaya.

398
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:30,458
What Raishin needs in his life
isn't an ordinary human girl.

399
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:34,166
No. The truth is,
he needs someone like you.

400
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,083
Think about it again.

401
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,000
Do you truly still
wish to be human?

402
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,291
[YAYA] Maybe you're right.

403
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,833
Maybe it is good Yaya's a doll.

404
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,166
Even if Raishin
doesn't return

405
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,708
the affection
Yaya feels for him.

406
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,916
She can still be there to
help him when he needs her most.

407
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,291
Even if Raishin develops
a pointless infatuation

408
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,916
with some fragile,
weak-willed, human girl.

409
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,166
Even if he stops
paying attention

410
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,541
to Yaya no matter
how hard she tries.

411
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,375
Even if he keeps company
with little vixens,

412
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,833
if he holds them
and kisses them.

413
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,833
Yaya cannot accept this!

414
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,833
Hmmm...
You've got the appearance

415
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,000
and behavior of
a real girl down.

416
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,041
And Raishin doesn't
distinguish between human

417
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,708
and doll as so many others do.

418
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,791
As much as it pains
me to suggest this.

419
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,958
Perhaps the problem
isn't that you're a doll,

420
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,083
but that your approximation
of human nature is a bit dodgy--

421
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,666
Huh? HUH?!

422
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,041
[YAYA screams]
