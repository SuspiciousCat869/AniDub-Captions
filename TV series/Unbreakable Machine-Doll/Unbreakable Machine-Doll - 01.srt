1
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:46,083
[YAYA] Yaya is beautiful.
Yaya is a very pretty girl.

2
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,666
[YAYA] Yaya is very beautiful.

3
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,291
Yaya is the prettiest
girl in the world.

4
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,916
Yaya is your everything.

5
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,625
[YAYA] You adore Yaya!
You love Yaya!

6
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,500
You wish to marry Yaya!

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,208
Yaya didn't
realize you were awake.

8
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,250
Yes, well
it's hard to sleep

9
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,125
with someone
chanting in your ear.

10
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,208
Yaya is sorry.

11
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,458
She was only reciting
a small charm.

12
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,875
Something to make you love her.

13
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,208
You say
"small charm" like

14
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,750
it's supposed to be harmless.

15
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:26,750
But I know you.

16
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,208
You were contaminating
my psyche.

17
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,500
[YAYA] We're almost
to the academy!

18
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,875
Are you excited yet? Yaya is!

19
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,458
[RAISHIN] We left
London half a day ago.

20
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,541
My butt's too
sore to be excited.

21
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,541
The academy
provides room and board.

22
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,541
Which means we'll spend
our nights together,

23
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,250
just you and Yaya.

24
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,541
S'pose we will.

25
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,750
Yaya predicts many sleepless
nights in our future.

26
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:46,833
[giggles]

27
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:49,333
[RAISHIN] No.
I'll be sleeping plenty.

28
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,458
And if you misbehave,
I'll evict you.

29
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,375
[YAYA whines]

30
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,041
[giggles]

31
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:55,958
We're nearly there.

32
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,041
Got all your
things, luv?

33
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,041
Sure do! Oh!

34
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,750
[RAISHIN] Here.

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,666
Thanks, Mister! You're so nice.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,583
Certainly.

37
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,041
[loud rumbling]

38
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,541
Ugh!

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,375
[RAISHIN] You all right?

40
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,791
Uh-huh!

41
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,416
Raishin,
something isn't right!

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,000
You think?

43
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,875
[train whistle]

44
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,166
[ENGINEER 1B] What's going on?

45
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,041
[MALE PASSENGER 1A]
Why aren't we stopping?

46
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,708
[MALE PASSENGER 1B]
We've already passed Edge Hill!

47
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,375
[MALE PASSENGER 1C]
Only one stop left on this line!

48
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,541
[MALE PASSENGER 1A] We're gonna
crash at Lime Street Station!

49
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,833
[train whistle]

50
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,416
[RAISHIN] How far
to the last stop?

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,625
[MALE PASSENGER 1C]
A mile or two, maybe!

52
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,666
Yaya! Find the brakes!

53
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,750
What's happening, Mister?

54
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,625
No need to worry.
We're all gonna be fine!

55
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,208
[loud squealing]

56
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:20,416
[train whistle]

[loud squealing]

58
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,833
It won't stop!

59
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,291
Then we do
somethin' else!

60
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,750
Maybe we can stop the engine!

61
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,416
[YAYA] Right. Let's try!

62
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,625
[YAYA] Raishin! Bridge!

63
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,791
[YAYA] Too close!
We'll never make it!

64
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,083
We can still
do this! Ya ready?

65
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,125
[YAYA] Yes!

66
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,458
[RAISHIN] Silence.
Forty-Eight Sho!

67
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,625
[releasing steam]

68
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,833
Nice, Yaya. I'm proud.

69
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,000
You regulated the power well.

70
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,833
Thank you, Raishin.

71
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,583
[murmuring crowd]

72
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,000
[RAISHIN] You both made it okay?

73
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,000
[BIG SISTER 1A] We did.
And I can't thank you enough!

74
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,208
You stopped the whole train!

75
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,333
Are you a magician?

76
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,916
Sort of. I'm what
they call a puppeteer.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,041
Oh! Does that mean
she's your automaton?

78
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,208
[YAYA] Yes!
Yaya is Raishin's doll.

79
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,291
He uses her well.
Especially under the sheets!

80
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,083
[BIG SISTER 1A]
Ahhh! Pervert!

81
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,791
[slap]

82
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,250
[RAISHIN] Yaya.

83
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,666
[YAYA] Yes, Raishin?

84
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,416
[RAISHIN] Guess what
I'm feeling right now.

85
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,916
Here's a hint:

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,875
it's an emotion so intense
it's bubbling out of control.

87
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,791
Sexual frustration?

88
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,125
Rage, Yaya!

89
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,458
Why do you always say things

90
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,333
that invite misunderstanding?

91
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,958
[YAYA] That little vixen was
clearly making eyes at you!

92
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,291
Yaya had to establish
a prior claim.

93
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,458
[RAISHIN]
"Little vixen"?

94
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,000
She couldn't have
been older than twelve!

95
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,958
[YAYA] No! She was
a hot-blooded woman!

96
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,916
[RAISHIN] The Walpurgis Royal
Academy of Machinart.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,916
The highest institution of
learning in the magical arts.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,708
It's also the location of
the Walpurgis Night Festival,

99
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,416
held to crown the Wise Man.

100
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,625
That's right.

101
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,666
Are you sure you're
ready for this, Yaya?

102
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,708
You won't see the
outside world for a while.

103
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,375
[YAYA] Wherever Raishin is,
that's where Yaya wants to be.

104
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,750
Dunno why you're
so attached to me.

105
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,125
Ultimately, I'm only gonna use
you as a tool for my revenge.

106
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,250
Yaya knows.

107
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,708
She is an automaton
created by Shoko.

108
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,125
Brought into this world
to be used as a tool.

109
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,166
But y'know, tools
perform their best

110
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,750
when used for a
specific purpose.

111
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,750
[YAYA] Yaya will
do whatever you ask.

112
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,416
In bed and out.

113
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,291
That won't be necessary.

114
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:31,416
However, I do appreciate
how determined you are.

115
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:38,666
[bell tolling]

116
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,583
[YAYA] How did the
entrance exam go?

117
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,500
You aced it, didn't you?
What's your rank?

118
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,416
[YAYA] One-thousand-two-
hundred-thirty-fifth?

119
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,208
Try not to be upset.
It isn't that bad!

120
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,708
You've nothing to
be ashamed about.

121
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,916
Yaya knows how
hard you've trained.

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,250
Forget their stupid test.
Battle is what counts.

123
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,500
And you're a match
for anyone here!

124
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,708
Don't you see?

125
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,583
You're the Karyusai
brand's top automaton.

126
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,708
For me to score so low is
nothing short of pathetic.

127
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,250
I don't deserve you.

128
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,541
[YAYA] No, Raishin! Never!

129
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,208
Yaya will always
be proud to be yours.

130
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,708
I don't know how I can
ever face Shoko after this.

131
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,541
[YAYA] Shoko. Shoko. Shoko!

132
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,166
You've really
got a one-track mind!

133
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,625
All you can think
about is Shoko?

134
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,708
[KIMBERLEY]
Beginning to see

135
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,416
where you stand in this
school, "Samurai Boy?"

136
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,000
Professor Kimberley,
Machinart Physics Department.

137
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:57,083
Unfortunately for us both,
I'm now your academic advisor.

138
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,916
[RAISHIN] Thank you
for the warm welcome.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,166
Pleasure to meet you, too.

140
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,625
[GIRL STUDENT 1A] I've not
seen that fellow before.

141
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,958
He must be new.

142
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,125
[GIRL STUDENT 1B]
He's got black hair. How exotic!

143
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,041
Do you suppose he's Oriental?

144
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,916
[KIMBERLEY] I know
you had a long journey

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,125
from your little backwater
village in the Far East,

146
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,375
but I assume you can count.

147
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,583
Given your current rank,
if you wish to graduate,

148
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,291
focus all your energy
on your studies.

149
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,291
[RAISHIN] No problem, Professor.
Just one question.

150
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,291
[KIMBERLEY] Which is?

151
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,916
The Walpurgis Night Festival.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,416
How do I get into it?

153
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,375
[KIMBERLEY] Dramatically
increase your rank.

154
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,291
Participation is limited
to the top one hundred pupils.

155
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,625
Frankly, you don't
stand a chance.

156
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,375
The Walpurgis
Night festivities amount

157
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,125
to a series of bloody battles
where magi vie for supremacy.

158
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,750
A war of puppeteers where
automatons are the weapons.

159
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,958
And it ends with only
one mage left standing.

160
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,291
Amateurs like you rarely,

161
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,458
if ever, come out of it alive.

162
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,125
Unless I'm that one mage
who's left standing.

163
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,791
Why are you so
set on competing?

164
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,041
Because I will
be named the Wise Man.

165
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,541
[KIMBERLEY] Ah. And why
do you want the title?

166
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:03,750
For the power? Fame perhaps?
The knowledge? Money?

167
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,125
[RAISHIN] It's kinda pointless
to ask that, isn't it?

168
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,208
When I become the Wise Man,
I'll have all of the above.

169
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,916
Yes, and more.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,666
The Wise Man receives
certain exemptions.

171
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,458
Forbidden books and arts are no
longer forbidden to him or her.

172
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,458
Not to mention the
military benefits.

173
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,750
Like a post as General
in any nation's army.

174
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,291
That said.

175
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,458
I suspect your objective is
not really any of those things.

176
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,875
[KIMBERLEY] As you
are no doubt aware,

177
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,916
our school was
founded when machinart,

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,125
or machine magic, was in
its earliest development.

179
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,916
[KIMBERLEY]
The academy's goal is to educate

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,375
and train skilled
puppeteers as military use

181
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,541
of machinart continues
to expand worldwide.

182
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,458
[KIMBERLEY] The festival is
the culmination of that purpose.

183
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,791
It identifies the students

184
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,125
who have emerged as
the most skilled puppeteers.

185
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,041
Although, in the highly
unlikely event a student

186
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,166
who has not gained entry
challenges to battle

187
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,375
and then defeats
a student who has...

188
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,291
Yeah, then what?

189
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,583
[KIMBERLEY] Work hard,
Mister Second Last. Work hard.

190
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,458
[RAISHIN]
Invigorating first lesson.

191
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,041
She seemed rather scary.
Maybe it's the glasses?

192
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,208
You think?

193
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,583
She told me everything
I wanted to know,

194
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:24,083
so--I may even
end up likin' her.

195
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,291
[YAYA] Raishin!
That is just scandalous!

196
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,666
An older woman?

197
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,250
How dare you look at her
when you already have Yaya?

198
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,125
[RAISHIN] Hey! Lemme go!

199
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,166
[CHARLOTTE] Stand aside.
You knobheads are in my way.

200
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,708
[CHARLOTTE]
This is the girls' dormitory.

201
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,208
Unless you have a reason
to be here, kindly move along.

202
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,333
[YAYA] Excuse you!

203
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,458
There's no need to
be so rude about it!

204
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,916
Right? Tell her!

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,291
[YAYA] Raishin? Raishin!

206
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,833
Just move out
of her way. C'mon.

207
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,250
[CHARLOTTE]
Hmph.

208
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,041
[YAYA] Why did you make
Yaya move for that girl?

209
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,750
Don't tell Yaya you're
interested in her!

210
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,291
[RAISHIN]
You know, I may be.

211
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,125
But for now, let's just
find the boys' dorm.

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,083
[YAYA] Raishin.
What are you thinking about?

213
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,000
Finding a way to
enter the festival.

214
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,333
I have to compete.

215
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,291
It's the shortest path
I have to getting revenge.

216
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,791
[YAYA] Oh. So, what
have you come up with?

217
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,375
[RAISHIN] It's seeming
like I'll have

218
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,458
to take Professor
Kimberly's advice.

219
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,833
I need to make a
big jump in the rankings.

220
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,875
I'll find someone

221
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,625
with an entry and
challenge 'em to battle.

222
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,541
[YAYA] Ah! So we
must resort to force!

223
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,458
[RAISHIN]
That's about the size of it.

224
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:50,458
[YAYA] Good plan.
Yaya will seize the day as well.

225
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,833
[RAISHIN]
Uh. What are you doing?

226
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,041
Yaya is resorting to force!

227
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,166
By any means necessary
for your success!

228
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,625
[RAISHIN] No, thanks.
Not necessary!

229
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,958
[YAYA giggles] Yaya wins!

230
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,791
[RAISHIN]
Get off of me! Now!

231
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,916
Why do those daft cows
find me so terrifying?

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,833
Perhaps because you are.

233
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,333
It's the first day of term,

234
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,958
and you've already put five
older students in hospital.

235
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,333
Makes an impression.

236
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,250
[CHARLOTTE]
Well.

237
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,708
They shouldn'ta
laid hands on me

238
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,875
when they were trying to recruit
me for their little club.

239
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,250
And the incident
in which you tried

240
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,208
to make your roommate exit
the dorm via the window?

241
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,250
[CHARLOTTE] That was a force
majeure and you know it!

242
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,541
It's hardly my
fault she decided

243
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,666
to break into the
bathroom as a lark.

244
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,166
Was it a force majeure
when you destroyed the lab?

245
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,083
Because you, and I quote, "won't
touch any blooming frogs"?

246
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,333
Oh, stuff it!

247
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,875
If you don't speak to
me with more respect,

248
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,583
you shall dine on chickpeas
instead of chicken this week!

249
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,833
Why don't you
try chumming it up

250
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,500
with some of your schoolmates?

251
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,041
But everyone is my enemy.

252
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,041
We'll be facing each
other at the festival.

253
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,083
There's no point
forming close ties.

254
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,625
[SIGMUND] You're in for a
lonely life with that attitude.

255
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,000
Never find a fellow
to call on you either.

256
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,541
You'll most likely
die an old maid.

257
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,791
What, me?
Die an old maid?

258
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,083
I'll have you know men
find me irresistible.

259
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,583
In fact they
practically flock to me.

260
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,708
[RAISHIN] Pardon me,
you're Charlotte Belew, right?

261
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,291
[CHARLOTTE] There, you see?

262
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,333
[RAISHIN] I hear you're
a second year student.

263
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,291
And also that you're
one of the Rounds.

264
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,250
The top-ranked contestants.

265
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,958
Registration code: Tyrant Rex.

266
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,250
[RAISHIN] Literally a
"brutal ruler." Intimidating.

267
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,708
[RAISHIN]
The dinosaur bit works, too.

268
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,166
Did you want somethin'?
I'm busy.

269
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,708
Yeah, I do, actually.
Your festival slot.

270
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,625
[BOY STUDENT 1A] Oi! I hear
a Japanese exchange student

271
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,500
is gonna challenge Tyrant Rex!

272
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,541
[BOY STUDENT 1B] Who?

273
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,958
That "Princess" girl
ranked number 8?

274
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,208
[BOY STUDENT 1C]
No, some new bloke

275
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,583
just got here two days ago.

276
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,916
You seen him?

277
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,916
[CHARLOTTE]
You do realize you're an idiot?

278
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,083
An idiot among idiots.
A blazing, towering idiot!

279
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,250
[RAISHIN] I know.

280
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,083
[CHARLOTTE]
Stupid and slow on the draw?

281
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,291
Not much of a
ladies' man, are you?

282
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,875
[RAISHIN] And you're
not much of a lady,

283
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,208
with a mouth like that!

284
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,333
Yeah, that's right!
Raishin is real fast!

285
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,208
Like so fast you
don't even know!

286
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,291
Stop talking.
You are not helping.

287
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,583
Every single
spring, like clockwork,

288
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,000
at least one chap needs
to be taught his place.

289
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,375
Yeah, my rank stinks.

290
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,208
I'm one-thousand-two-
hundred-thirty-fifth out of

291
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,000
one-thousand
two-hundred-thirty-six students.

292
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,333
But I know my "place" just fine.

293
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,791
Second to last
in the entire school?

294
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,958
You can laugh at my
expense all you want.

295
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,750
We <i>are</i> gonna fight,
I <i>am</i> gonna win,

296
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,416
and that's all that matters.

297
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,083
You're one of the biggest
idiots I've ever encountered.

298
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,250
But no one can doubt
your lack of commitment.

299
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,041
Let's get this
over with, shall we?

300
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,500
Crushing you shan't take
long at all! Now Sigmund!

301
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,791
[SIGMUND] Right!

302
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,708
[RAISHIN] Our turn now, Yaya!
Whistle 24--!

303
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,458
[YAYA] Look out!

304
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,166
[CHARLOTTE]
Seems a whole parade

305
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,208
of idiots came out
this afternoon.

306
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,041
[RAISHIN]
Hey! This is our fight.

307
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,708
[CHARLOTTE] You just
stand there and watch.

308
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:16,041
I can see to these gits easier
without you muckin' it up!

309
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,291
Sure, just don't lose.

310
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,166
Clearly you don't know
to whom you're speakin'.

311
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,791
Love how humble you are.

312
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,250
[CHARLOTTE]
Cheeky bastard!

313
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,875
[CHARLOTTE]
Above us!

314
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,666
[RAISHIN] Not bad.

315
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,041
She's got the skills to
back up her Rounds title.

316
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,625
Lustre Cannon!

317
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,875
I have to give
you some credit.

318
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,916
That cannon packs
a serious punch.

319
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,458
How dare you? Unhand me!

320
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,666
[MALE PUPPETEER 1A] Run
along now. This is our fight.

321
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,583
Hardly; I challenged her first.

322
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,041
So you jerks can back off.

323
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,208
You'll soon learn

324
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,666
how things work
around here, foreign boy.

325
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,250
We've been planning
this for weeks.

326
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,291
If anyone is a thief in
this situation, it's you.

327
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,458
Really?

328
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,958
Like you mentioned,
I'm new here. Sorry.

329
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,333
Showed you, frosh!

330
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,208
You let your guard down.
Big mistake!

331
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,666
[RAISHIN] Fellas.

332
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,416
I thought we weren't supposed
to go after other puppeteers.

333
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,083
However, if you want
to change the rules a bit,

334
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,958
I'm glad to oblige!

335
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,291
Flare 12 Ketsu!

336
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,666
[YAYA] Right!

337
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,958
[CHARLOTTE] Up, Sigmund.
Back into the fray!

338
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,875
[CHARLOTTE] Lustre Flare!

339
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,958
Please don't act
as if you rescued me.

340
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,583
Otherwise you're an even
bigger idiot than I thought.

341
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,125
[RAISHIN]
No.

342
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,125
I can tell you're not the type
of girl who needs rescuing.

343
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:24,083
Well! You may tell
me your name if you like.

344
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,333
[RAISHIN] Raishin Akabane.

345
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,416
I'm a puppeteer from Japan.

346
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,875
What he said. Ditto.

347
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,666
Actually, that
is not in any way correct.

348
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,833
Yaya is Yaya. His wife!

349
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,041
[RAISHIN] Also not correct.

350
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,125
We are not married. At all.

351
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,625
It's of little consequence.

352
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,833
Shall we continue our battle?

353
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:45,583
Mmm... Let's call it off.
It's not fun anymore.

354
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,791
You can't be serious!
You quit?

355
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,458
Yep. See you around!

356
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,833
Beastly boy!
What a coward!

357
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,958
[SIGMUND] I'd not be
so quick to judge.

358
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,500
I don't understand.

359
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,041
What are you talking about?

360
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,583
[SIGMUND]
I believe the boy noticed

361
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,166
I'd taken injury
during our battle.

362
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,375
[CHARLOTTE] Are you in pain?

363
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,208
[SIGMUND] I had best conserve
my strength for a few days.

364
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,041
[CHARLOTTE] Say what you will,

365
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,833
but I still maintain
he's a coward.

366
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,291
If he won't take advantage
of an enemy's weakness,

367
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,833
he's nothing but a milksop.

368
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,541
[SIGMUND] Well, you
seem quite interested

369
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,333
in this particular milksop.

370
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,750
You even asked for his name!

371
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,333
[CHARLOTTE] Get stuffed,
you great, overgrown lizard!

372
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,708
One more word and it's nothing
but vegetables for a week!

373
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,458
[YAYA] What do you think?

374
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,166
Are you going to challenge
somebody else tomorrow?

375
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,208
[RAISHIN] I'll figure
tomorrow out tomorrow.

376
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,000
[YAYA] That's understandable.

377
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,291
My, look at the time! G'night!

378
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,083
[RAISHIN] No. Nice try.
Not gonna work.

379
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,666
[YAYA] What's not gonna work?

380
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,958
[RAISHIN] You have your own bed.

381
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,291
On that side of the room.

382
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,083
Yeah, but fighting
three opponents was hard.

383
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,750
Yaya even got hurt.

384
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,708
Yeah, I'm sorry. Your point?

385
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,833
[YAYA] You know perfectly
well we automatons

386
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,583
rely on our puppeteer's
magic to survive!

387
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,291
[YAYA] When we're damaged,
proximity is important.

388
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,000
In fact, we heal
much more quickly

389
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,250
when we're closer
to our masters.

390
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,041
[RAISHIN] Fine. You win.

391
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,541
If that's what this is about,
you can share my bed.

392
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,416
Excellent!

393
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,625
[RAISHIN] Yes, it's great.

394
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,333
Just don't do anything weird.

395
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,333
[YAYA] Don't worry!
Yaya knows how shy you are.

396
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,375
[RAISHIN] I guess
I should be more explicit.

397
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,625
Do not touch me.

398
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,625
[YAYA] Poo.

399
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,625
[RAISHIN]
What's the problem now?

400
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,166
[YAYA]
Automatons recover quicker

401
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,125
when they maintain physical
contact with their puppeteers.

402
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,291
It's a proven fact!

403
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,000
[RAISHIN] Enough!

404
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,000
[YAYA]
No, listen!

405
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,583
[RAISHIN]
You're making this up!

406
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,375
Get in your own bed!

407
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,125
[CHARLOTTE] You're a
real twit, you know that?

408
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,958
Who forgets to bring
money when they go out?

409
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,791
This is a loan.
I expect to be repaid in full.

410
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,916
And I'll be charging
interest, obviously.

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,458
Yes, of course.
I do appreciate it.

412
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,916
I'm sure.

413
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,458
Wait! How dare
you eat at my table?

414
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,875
Get away from here! Now!

415
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,541
I don't want your company.

416
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,208
[RAISHIN] Now you're being rude.
I'm already eating.

417
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,750
[CHARLOTTE] I'm rude? For
wanting rid of a freak like you?

418
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,666
[RAISHIN] How are you, Sigmund?
Healing up well?

419
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,625
[SIGMUND] Indeed.
I've no cause for complaint.

420
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,958
[CHARLOTTE sighs]

421
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,166
[RAISHIN] What now?

422
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,916
[CHARLOTTE] Ugh.
If you must know, I'm bored.

423
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,666
Things are awfully
dull around here.

424
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,708
[RAISHIN] Oh-ho. You want things
livened up a little, do ya?

425
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,250
[CHARLOTTE] Sigmund,
I hope you are feeling better

426
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,333
because we're going
to destroy this idiot!

427
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,666
[SIGMUND]
Oh, do calm down, Char.

428
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,875
[YAYA] Is something wrong?

429
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,750
That puppeteer.

430
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,916
[CHARLOTTE] Oh, that's Magnus.

431
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,416
Why? Do you intend
to challenge him next?

432
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:18,583
[RAISHIN] Yaya!

433
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,833
[YAYA] Right!

434
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,166
[CHARLOTTE] Don't do it!
You'll never defeat him!

435
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,541
Auughh!!
