[panting]

00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,833
Raishin. Raishin!

5
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,750
[KIMBERLEY] Wait, Yaya.

6
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,333
You should know
you're being watched.

7
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,833
Yaya has to help him!

8
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,166
[GUARD 10A] What happened?

9
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,333
[GUARD 10B] Our priority
is finding the headmaster!

10
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,041
[KIMBERLEY] If you
make a wrong move,

11
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,916
they'll have Second Last
in their sights as well.

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,875
Yes, but--

13
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,375
Hmph. Besides,
I imagine he's fine.

14
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,125
You know his unholy
luck better than anyone.

15
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,750
[KIMBERLEY] Now, follow me.

16
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,958
Where are we going?

17
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,958
[KIMBERLEY] There is
a decision to be made.

18
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:04,416
One I cannot make alone.
I must consult my comrades.

19
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,916
It's awful. I actually
killed someone.

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,583
[SIGMUND] You need
to collect yourself.

21
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,583
[CHARLOTTE] I'm collected.

22
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,958
[SIGMUND] Then let's go.
We're being pursued.

23
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,708
Yes. Of course.

24
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,125
Automaton sentries!

25
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,125
[SHIN] You are
a troublesome one.

26
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,791
We're withdrawing.

27
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,708
[knock, knock]

28
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,750
I'm disappointed, Lavenna.

29
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,291
You're not demonstrating
the commitment I'd hoped for.

30
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,666
But I assassinated
the headmaster

31
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,458
just as you instructed!

32
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,333
Your roundabout methods are
what have given me pause.

33
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,250
Using Sigmund, you could have
killed Headmahster Rutherford

34
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,541
and his guards in a
much more direct fashion.

35
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,625
I still held up my
end of the bargain.

36
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,458
No, you haven't.

37
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,750
The target's death
has yet to be confirmed.

38
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,166
Now look here.

39
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,875
I've something
entertaining to show you.

40
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:25,791
[CHARLOTTE gasps]

41
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,250
Henri!

42
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,875
[CEDRIC] You nearly
killed her, you know.

43
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,208
Your own sister.

44
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,750
It's lucky for little Henriette

45
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,958
you chose the less
precise attack, isn't it?

46
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,541
She fell into an
underground cavern

47
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,541
when the earth collapsed.

48
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,916
Oh, my! And Second Last is
making an appearance, too.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,208
[gasps]

50
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:50,625
[RAISHIN] Come on! Wake up!
Henri! Open your eyes!

51
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,875
Are you all right?
You're not hurt, are you?

52
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,125
Ah! Dirty boy! No! No!

53
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,750
[RAISHIN] Hey!
Will you stop that?

54
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,875
No! No!

55
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,083
[RAISHIN] Stop! Haven't
you noticed where we are?

56
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,916
The ground's
beginning to crumble.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,458
We need to find an exit fast.

58
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,833
Do as you will,
just leave me be.

59
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:12,916
[sighs]

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,291
Yep, you're a
Belew girl all right.

61
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,666
What? Did I hear
the buzzing of a fly?

62
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,166
Believe me now?

63
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,291
[RAISHIN] This area used to be a
testing ground for taboo magic.

64
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,500
The story I heard's
pretty grisly.

65
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,666
Thousands buried
alive right below us.

66
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,250
The few who
survived had no choice

67
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,333
but to start eating each other.

68
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:41,833
Ripping out organs, drinking
blood, gnawing on bones.

69
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,541
They say there was
only a single survivor,

70
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,833
who still wanders
the maze to this day.

71
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,333
Bah! A ghost story!

72
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,000
I won't believe a
crib tale like that.

73
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,625
It's pure fiction!

74
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,208
[HENRIETTE]
Wh-What's the matter?

75
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,166
[RAISHIN] Listen.
Do you hear something?

76
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,500
[HENRIETTE]
What? No! Don't do this to me!

77
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:03,958
Ahh! He's here!

78
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,250
[HENRIETTE] No!
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

79
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,791
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

80
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:12,291
[RAISHIN] You can get up.
I was joking. Sorry.

81
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,166
So, no one's there?

82
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,875
[RAISHIN] I was borrowing from
an old Japanese ghost story.

83
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,041
I'm still pretty new here, too.

84
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,791
How would I know
anything about this place?

85
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:23,958
You cruel josser!

86
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,166
Really, how could you?

87
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,958
I thought I would
die of sheer terror!

88
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,041
I have no idea

89
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,541
if there's a world
beyond the grave.

90
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,875
But if there is,

91
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,500
I bet it has a lot in
common with this place.

92
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,041
Dark, moldy n' damp;

93
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,041
the perfect spot for the
dead to wander 'round.

94
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,125
I'm just trying to say,

95
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,458
if you're really
so afraid of ghosts,

96
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,333
maybe you shouldn't be
in such a hurry to die.

97
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,875
You don't understand.

98
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,125
It's not as though
I yearn for death.

99
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,875
We shouldn't be down
here too much longer.

100
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,083
Once my partner knows
I'm with another woman,

101
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,416
nothing will stop
her from finding me.

102
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,458
So it's gonna be okay.

103
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,166
Help will come.

104
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,041
[GUARD 10C] We still don't know
whether the headmaster is safe.

105
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,250
[GUARD 10D] Apparently
there were some students

106
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,750
who got mixed up in this, too.

107
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,333
[GUARD 10C] Yes, a girl
and some Oriental boy.

108
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,333
They're down in all
that rubble somewhere.

109
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,875
Ow, that one's
gonna leave a bruise.

110
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,916
"Oriental boy"?

111
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,750
[MALE DISCIPLINARY 10A]
This area's strictly off-limits.

112
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,916
Um, sorry 'bout that,

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,833
but if I could maybe
just take a quick peek?

114
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,791
[MALE DISCIPLINARY 10A] Sorry.

115
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,541

Crying won't help.

[LOKI]
Fresh out of the infirmary,

118
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,875
and already he's in trouble.

119
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,291
I swear, that imbecile
must have a curse on him.

120

Stay out of this, understand?
It's his mess, not yours.

[BROTHER TURTLEDOVE]
So. Sister Warbler.

123
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,958
What do you suggest we do?

124
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,250
[KIMBERLEY] I'm pondering that,
as well, Brother Turtledove.

125
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,791
It's why I came to you.

126
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,416
[BROTHER CROW] It's obvious
what the enemy's objective is.

127
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,291
Our best option is to go
and guard the headmaster.

128
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,708
It's also a fine chance to get

129
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,833
to the bottom of this
"Cathedral of Fools" business.

130
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,125
Although, should we
make a wrong move,

131
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,541
the Cathedral may be
destroyed along with him.

132
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,541
Our primary objective here
is limited to containment.

133
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,125
Therefore, we shall
only observe and monitor.

134
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,916
We must be careful not
to overstep ourselves.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,416
[BROTHER TURTLEDOVE]
Naturally.

136
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,208
Now, I believe you reported
Second Last is also missing?

137
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,375
Correct.

138
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,916
He's a quick-witted child,
and perceptive.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,125
And thus inevitably at
the center of any hubbub.

140
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,958
[BROTHER TURTLEDOVE] A surviving
Akabane in our midst.

141
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:48,125
Is it possible that he is the
one foreseen by Father Time?

142
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,541
[KIMBERLEY] That is
certainly a possibility.

143
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,708
[BROTHER TURTLEDOVE] Very well.

144
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,166
We shall seek the
Father's instructions.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,333
[sighs]

146
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,541
[YAYA] What now?

147
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,541
What do we do about
saving Raishin?

148
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,041
Nothing at the moment,

149
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:08,375
but I can assure you
he is still safe.

150
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,125
Listen.

151
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,916
If it's true, and he is
indeed the one Father foresaw,

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,458
then I highly doubt
a little fall

153
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,458
is going to be the end of him.

154
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,000
But we'll see.

155
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,375
Hm?

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,583
[RAISHIN] Whoa.

157
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,958
This chamber's
enormous, isn't it?

158
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,166
[screams]

159
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,416
[breathing heavily]

160
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,166
[RAISHIN] Are you all right?

161
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,791
No!
Don't you touch me!

162
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,250
[sighs]

163
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,166
What is it about me
that bothers you so much?

164
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,250
[HENRIETTE] It's not you;
I hate all men.

165
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,041
They're scary and mean
and violent and cruel.

166
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,083
And stupid, and really smelly.

167
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,166
[RAISHIN] Well, I'm still
glad you're not hurt.

168
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,375
Watch your step better
from now on, okay?

169
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,458
I... I will.

170
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,375
[cries in pain]

171
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,041
What's the matter?

172
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,666
Can I have a look?

173
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,166
[HENRIETTE] Careful, that hurts!

174
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,833
[thinking] Well, I guess
we'll need to rest for a while.

175
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,791
[RAISHIN] Here.

176
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,625
[RAISHIN] They're a little
smushed, but they're edible.

177
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,125
[RAISHIN] Yeah, you're
Char's sister, all right.

178
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,458
I know what
you're implying:

179
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,750
that she's
prettier than I am.

180
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,166
Everyone thinks so.

181
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,041
[laughs]

182
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,791
That's rude,
even for you!

183
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,791
You're just mocking me.

184
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,833
Calm down,
you got it all wrong.

185
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,458
Meanie!

186
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,041
Ow! The rock throwing
is really not necessary!

187
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,375
I wasn't laughing at you
or mocking you, I promise!

188
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,708
Stop it!

189
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,666
See, I had a talented
older sibling, too.

190
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,166
People compared us
all the time. Thing is...

191
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,166
...we really
couldn't have

192
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,375
been more different
from each other.

193
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,583
Unfortunately,
I was the lesser of the two.

194
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,708
When we were younger,

195
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,291
Charlotte had far
more friends than I.

196
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,875
Somehow I have a
difficult time imagining that.

197
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,708
Something about her just
drew everyone to her side.

198
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,875
Everyone here avoids
her like the plague.

199
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,041
And she was so kind
to everyone in return.

200
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,166
Now she's always
cross with everyone.

201
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,958
[FIREFLY]
Make your answer swift.

202
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,166
Are you my master's enemy?

203
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,083
[thinking] Nadeshiko?

204
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,083
[RAISHIN] Tenzen? You did this?

205
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,708
[TENZEN] I did.

206
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,666
[RAISHIN] And Nadeshiko?

207
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,291
[TENZEN] I had to dissect her.

208
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,166
[RAISHIN] But why?

209
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,625
It was an unfortunate necessity.

210
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,750
A necessity for what?

211
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,291
[TENZEN] For the
creation of a god.

212
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,166
[RAISHIN] I didn't expect
to run into you down here.

213
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,625
[RAISHIN] Hello, Magnus.

214
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,166
[HEADMASTER] Raishin Akabane,
if I'm not mistaken.

215
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,833
[RAISHIN] Headmaster!

216
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,083
[HEADMASTER]
Apologies if I startled you.

217
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,208
My bodyguard Magnus
can be quite protective.

218
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,291
Seems we're all in
the same predicament.

219
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,208
Best we wait for
rescue together, then.

220
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,625
And Raishin, lad.

221
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,000
I do fully expect you
to behave yourself.

222
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,958
Understood?

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,250
[FIREFLY] Master.

224
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,083
If it pleases you, I can
break through the ceiling

225
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,166
and locate assistance for us.

226
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,875
Don't interfere.
We have a job to do.

227
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,583
Keep your focus
on our protectee.

228
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,708
[FIREFLY] As you wish, Master.

229
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,458
In all things, I obey.

230
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,833
[exasperated noise]

231
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,458
[HENRIETTE] You all right?

232
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,750
I'm sorry. I was
too angry to stay.

233
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,708
Why does he
vex you so?

234
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:01,625
Magnus killed my family.
He killed my little sister.

235
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,875
He what?

236
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,750
He's the reason
I came to Walpurgis.

237
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,291
I fully intend to kill him.

238
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,333
Don't look at
me like that.

239
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,833
I'm not gonna do
it now or anything.

240
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,416
But do me a favor.
Keep it to yourself.

241
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,666
Even Char doesn't
all of this.

242
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,625
So, why tell me?
I hardly know you.

243
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:27,458
Sounds weird, but, I kinda
feel like <i>I</i> know you.

244
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,791
[HENRIETTE] Anyways.
Despite the uniform.

245
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,333
I'm not actually
enrolled at the academy.

246
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:37,416
You're not really...
Wait, what do you mean?

247
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,375
[HENRIETTE]
It's hard to explain, I--

248
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,666
[KIMBERLEY] Well hello,
Sacred Blaze.

249
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,541
You look lonely
without Second Last

250
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,041
here keeping you company.

251
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,291
Did you want
something, Professor?

252
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,125
As a matter of fact,
I have a proposal.

253
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,666
There is someone in
need of protection.

254
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,291
What makes you
think I'd help you?

255
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,625
All due respect.

256
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,125
[chuckles] Because I shall
reward you, silly boy.

257
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,750
Handsomely. Play along
and I'll give you

258
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,125
what you long for
most in this world.

259
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,958
That's <i>De Organum</i> !
Nice try.

260
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,875
Don't promise
what you can't deliver.

261
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,750
You'd never hand over
a work of such importance.

262
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,583
[KIMBERLEY] I'm certainly not
suggesting I'd let you <i>keep</i> it.

263
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,208
However, there
has been discussion

264
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,583
about making a copy of
it in the near future.

265
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,500
A task for which I'd require
a trustworthy assistant.

266
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,791
Heh.

267
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,000
Cunning, Professor.

268
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,083
Heh heh.

269
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,083
Good, Firefly.
Now restrain him.

270
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,666
[FIREFLY] As you wish, Master.

271
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,041
[thinking] No human
moves like that.

272
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,125
But I don't sense a
puppeteer anywhere.

273
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,458
[HEADMASTER] One of
the rebels out to get me?

274
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:24,458
[RAISHIN thinking] No, not
this time. He tried to kill me.

275
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,583
[GUARD 10E] There they are!

276
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,875
[AVRIL] Headmaster.
Are you all right?

277
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,166
Avril. It's good
to see you.

278
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,791
And, yes,
I'm safe and sound.

279
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:35,000
[AVRIL] What a shame.
Guards, take the brats up.

280
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,708
[YAYA] Raishin!

281
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,333
[sobs]

282
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,333
Yaya, calm down!

283
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,125
Yaya was so worried, Raishin!

284
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,833
She thought you were gone!

285
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,125
Never leave Yaya!

286
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,916
Sorry 'bout that.
You can stop crying.

287
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,875
It'll take more'n a
little fall to kill me.

288
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,916
[YAYA] Yaya knows.
She was just afraid

289
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,083
that you had run
off with that vixen!

290
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:06,875
[RAISHIN]
Okay, you coulda worried

291
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,833
about my life a tiny bit.

292
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,250
[YAYA] But Raishin!

293
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,541
[YAYA] Take off your underpants!

294
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,916
[RAISHIN] Not gonna do that.

295
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,125
[YAYA] Fine. Just pull out
what's inside, then.

296
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,583
[RAISHIN]
Not doing that, either.

297
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,291
Uh...

298
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,791
[YAYA] Why won't you
ever make love to Yaya?

299
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,958
[RAISHIN] Whoa, stop!
Keep your clothes on!

300
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,458
[YAYA] So, it's true.

301
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,166
You hate Yaya so much
you won't even touch her!

302
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,291
[RAISHIN] I don't hate you,
okay? Now get dressed!

303
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,791
[YAYA wails] Not even a
twitch in reaction!

304
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,000
[RAISHIN]
Where were you looking?

305
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,916
Clothes! Now! I mean it!

306
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,708
[YAYA] Raishin really
doesn't love Yaya!

307
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,458
WAAHHHH!

308
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,333
[RAISHIN] Hey! Take it easy!

309
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,416
You'll break right
through the floor!

310
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,208
You're the last person
I wanted to tell this to,

311
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,250
but I'm betrothed.

312
00:16:55,541 --> 00:17:00,625
Raishin is betrothed?

313
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,500
\You liar!
That can't be true.

314
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,458
You've been with Yaya two years.

315
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,416
Why'd you never tell her?

316
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,916
It just never felt like the
right time, and truthfully?

317
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,583
I was scared to.

318
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,666
[YAYA] Because you didn't want

319
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,458
to hurt your
relationship with Yaya?

320
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,125
No, 'cause I didn't want
you to hurt my skull.

321
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:23,666
[YAYA] How could you? You
tricked Yaya for so long!

322
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,166
I am going to kill you!

323
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,666
Wait, Yaya listen!
There's more to the story.

324
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,791
I'm not really
gonna... marry her!

325
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,000
You're not
going to marry her?

326
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,708
Please explain to Yaya.

327
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,375
It was an
arranged marriage.

328
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,875
Our parents set
it up without us.

329
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,083
But they're gone now,

330
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,291
along with the rest
of my family, so...

331
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:45,875
So...

332
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,041
Wait.

333
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,041
It's never been officially
cancelled though.

334
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,250
Which means,
even if I wanted to,

335
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,708
I can't see other people.

336
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,458
[YAYA] Shit. Always so proper.

337
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,916
[RAISHIN]
I heard that! Language!

338
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,083
Raishin is
already betrothed.

339
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,833
[FREY] T... Tyrant Rex!

340
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,583
Our opponents
didn't show.

341
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,208
Yaya wonders why.

342
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,333
Me, too. It's
weird, isn't it?

343
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,708
No 87 two days in a
row. And now tonight.

344
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,666
Number 86 didn't
show up either.

345
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,291
[YAYA]
Are they working together?

346
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,750
I couldn't say.

347
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,916
But there's something going
on here, that's for sure.

348
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,416
Going home, then?

349
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,083
[RAISHIN] No. We're not.

350
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,375
No, we're going
fishing for sharks.

351
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,166
[CEDRIC] Well, look at that.

352
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,041
[CEDRIC] Things are becoming
quite interesting, indeed.

353
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,583
Second Last took it upon
himself to kidnap Henriette.

354
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,250
[CHARLOTTE]
So, how did that feel, Cedric?

355
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,916
Being outwitted by
the very man you mocked.

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,833
[CEDRIC] I admit I'm rather
impressed by how fickle you are.

357
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,750
Opening your legs
for that yellow mongrel

358
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,708
so soon after
opening them for Felix.

359
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,166
You--

360
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,333
Don't be so vulgar!

361
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,416
[CEDRIC] You surprise me.

362
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,625
Don't tell me
you're still untouched?

363
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,833
In that case,
I might enjoy tossing

364
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,375
you naked into a den of rogues.

365
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,625
No, it would be far more fun

366
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,000
if I saved that for your sister.

367
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,208
If you do anything
to harm Henri,

368
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,125
I swear to God your
family line will end with y--

369
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,250
I hope you'll
pardon my presumption.

370
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,375
Consider it pardoned.

371
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,541
Now retrieve
Henriette for me.

372
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:45,333
I shall see to it at
once, and Second Last?

373
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,666
[CEDRIC] He need not survive.

374
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,375
In fact, you may take his head,

375
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,000
and we shall make it
a gift to this harlot.

376
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,458
Not the most
refined of tactics,

377
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,750
but if you wish it,
young master.

378
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,375
[CHARLOTTE] What foul
plot are you hatching?

379
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,416
Why use me and my sister?

380
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,833
[CEDRIC]
Well, that's a silly question.

381
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,208
Because it amuses me.

382
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,500
[CEDRIC] And I believe
tormenting you will give Felix

383
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,583
a certain amount
of satisfaction.

384
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,083
After all, we are cousins
and the dearest of friends.

385
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,625
[CHARLOTTE] I don't believe
you're Cedric Granville at all!

386
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,541
You're disguising
yourself with magic!

387
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,166
[CHARLOTTE]
But then who are you?

388
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,958
[CEDRIC] I am but a shadow.

389
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,041
A formless shadow,
and nothing more.

390
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,791
Help! Please!

391
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,833
I've been kidnapped
by a bad, bad man

392
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:38,500
who wants to have
his way with me!

393
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,708
Keep it down wouldja?

394
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,875
We're gonna get caught!

395
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,416
I'm not try'na hurt you.
I'm try'na help you!

396
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,541
Before, when you said
you were afraid of death.

397
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,541
You don't want to die. Right?

398
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,500
You just feel like you have to?

399
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,541
[RAISHIN]
Lemme venture a guess here.

400
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,208
Someone's threatening Char.

401
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,416
Saying unless she kills the
headmaster, they'll kill you.

402
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,791
[HENRIETTE]
It's hopeless, though!

403
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,083
I keep running away,
but they bring me back!

404
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,375
And when I try to just die,

405
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,041
someone always saves me!

406
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,125
It does me no good
to run and hide.

407
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,708
They'll find me!

408
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,291
[RAISHIN]
That's why I'm not hiding.

409
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,416
Huh?

410
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,541
In fact, I'm hoping
they'll notice me.

411
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,708
It's why I kidnapped
their hostage.

412
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:29,125
Real soon. They <i>are</i>
gonna take the bait.

413
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,458
[RAISHIN] And sooner
than I expected.

414
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,750
What a good hunting dog.

415
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,625
[SHIN]
I do possess certain skills.

416
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,375
My master deserves a
butler with enormous talent.

417
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,666
Loyalty, too.

418
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,208
Bet it'll take
more'n a few bruises

419
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,666
before you spill
your master's secrets.

420
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,458
Naturally.
What will you do?

421
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,208
"Naturally" whatever
I have to.

422
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,500
And then, I'll expose
your depraved master

423
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,875
for the monster he is.

424
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,583
[SHIN] You question
my master's sanity?

425
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,750
It's hard not to.

426
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,083
Anyone who'd dream up
this plan must be mad!

427
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,541
Not mad.

428
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,583
Although, I admit he is a
somewhat twisted individual

429
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,208
who schemes as
easily as he breathes.

430
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,000
Sad but true--'tis a
curse of the Granville line.

431
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,458
After boasting about being
such a talented butler,

432
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,208
I really didn't expect you
to give up your master's name.

433
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,500
Yes, well.

434
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,291
Talented as I am,
I'm not without my failings.

435
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,125
But if I had to name one flaw,

436
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,125
it would be my
incredibly short temper.

437
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,916
Yaya!

438
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,625
After we crush this man,
we save Char n' Henri.

439
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,250
Let's go!

440
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,833
Right!
