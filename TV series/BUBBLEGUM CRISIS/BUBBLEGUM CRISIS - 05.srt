(car whines)

8
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,432
- [Man] This is Unit 303.

9
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,666
They appear to be heading for the space port.

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,468
Call in Unit 401.

11
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,405
He's on patrol in the vicinity of Shaft G9.

12
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,974
- We'll box them in on the lighter highway.

13
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,676
(vehicles whine)

14
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:51,785
(vehicle whines) (high swoosh)

15
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,386
- Hang on, Anri.

16
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,656
Just a little bit longer and we'll be free.

17
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:00,827
- I'm sorry.

18
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,462
Now of all times.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,866
- Once we get through here, we'll be at the space port.

20
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,768
You suppose Nam's taken care of her part?

21
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,403
- If all's gone according to plan she has.

22
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,739
We can't turn back now.

23
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,442
No matter what happens, now if we don't get

24
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,844
to the planet, we won't have any future.

25
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,447
- Yes, I can't stand this place any longer.

26
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,848
Faster, Meg, faster, hurry, come on,

27
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,483
come on, step on it.

28
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:25,685
- Right. - Huh.

29
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,457
(engines whine) (groans)

30
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,526

(alarm blares) (engines whines)

34
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,040
- Number three, watch your front!

35
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:52,679
(screams) (explosion rumbles)

36

(fire crackles) (engines whine)

37
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:55,982
- Shit! (console cracks)

38
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,218
This is unit 10, I've lost sight

39
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,386
of unit seven, last seen in shaft F3

40
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,189
heading toward Ward Six, request to release Dobermans.

41
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,259
Repeat, request to release Dobermans.

42
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,329
- 10/4. (machine whines)

43

(metallic whine)

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,144
(engines whine) - It's the exit, we made it!

46
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,116
(grunts) (alarm whine)

47
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,117
A Doberman!

48
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,052
It's not use, damn.

49
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,754
We'll never make it.

50
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,993
- Set the car for auto cruise.

51
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,795
Meg, we'll just have to ditch on my signal.

52
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,598
Anri, you can do that, right?

53
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,432
- Yeah.

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,236

(engines whine)

62
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,324
- What could be keeping Sylvia and the others?

63
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,258
They're late.

64
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,429
- Nam!

65
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,366
- I thought you were done for.

66
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,001
- Is she ready? - Yeah, come on.

67
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,707
Hurry, Sylvie, the patrols are starting

68
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,108
to make their rounds now.

69
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,613
- Hang on Anri, it's okay, hang on.

70
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,582
- [Lou] It's a Doberman!

71
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,286
(women scream) - Get on board, quickly!

72
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,954
That door won't hold for long.

73
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,827
- Meg, Lou, hurry up, come on, let's go!

74
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,399
(women scream)

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,702
(metal cracks)

76
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,805
- Go on! (guns whine)

77
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,543
(Doberman growls) (gun rocks)

78
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:41,481
(explosion rumbles) - Look out!

79
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,686
- Nam, what are you doing?

80
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,289
- There's no hope for me now, go on,

81
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,024
get out of here, hurry!

82
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,495
- No, no, I just can't abandon you all!

83
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,696
(guns whine) (guns rumble)

84
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,531
- What are you doing standing there,

85
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,633
move it, (grunts)

86
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,434
- Lou!

87
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,504
- Hang on, Lou.

88
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,074
(gun whines)

89
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,344
- Meg, Lou!

90
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,250
- Sylvie, get freedom, get enough,

91
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,019
enough freedom for all of us too.

92
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,956
(grunts) (machine whines)

93
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:28,961
- No! (guns rumble)

94
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:33,933

We haven't had any sleep all night.

129
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,632
and I'll make a new man out of you.

- Not now, I've got a headache.

131
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,768
- You always have a headache.

132

- We'll arrive at the scene shortly.

133
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,972
Fasten your seat belts. (groans)

134
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,207
- Can it, now go on and set us down.

135
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,010
Right smack in the middle of those bastards.

136
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,511
- [Pilot] Ah, yes sir.

137
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,684
- [Officer] Given the results of our analysis

138
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,553
of the debris, we think it's connected

139
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,221
with the SDCP people.

140
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,090
- This is more than I can put up with.

141
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,026
This is the last straw, this is just too much.

142
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,527
Don't they have any better ways

143
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,663
of throwing their trash away?

144
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,833
- So, what about the pilot?

145
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,635
- We're searching for him right now, sir,

146
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,337
but under the circumstances, we think

147
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,873
he's probably. - Yeah there's no way

148
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,608
anyone could have survived this.

149
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,577
(sirens whine) - Captain.

150
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,545
The results of our inquiry into the model

151
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,447
registration number we found earlier

152
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,050
confirms that it is Orca Four, a shuttle

153
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,820
belonging to SDCP, no comment regarding its occupants.

154
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,256
- [Officer] If we're dealing with SDCP, we might

155
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,524
as well pack it in now.

156
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,227
- So what we have is over our heads

157
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,496
in more ways than one. - No, I'm not

158
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,899
so sure about that. (engines rumble)

159
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,170
Well speak of the devil, here they come now.

160
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,574
- [Reporter] At least according

161
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,643
to available reports, therefore

162
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,413
the SDCP, the Space Development Corporation

163
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,881
is embarking on a full inquiry

164
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,317
into the situation at the gaint Genaros staytion

165
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,419
which is the supply center for the moon base.

166
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,454
According to the SDCP, repairs

167
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,023
are being made to Genaros as quikcly as possible.

168
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,692
Projected date of completeion has not

169
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,860
been announced yet, but coprorate director.

170
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,863
(dramatic music)

171
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,299
(breathes)

172
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,268
- [Quincy] Something will have to be done on your end

173
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,869
about this latest fiasco!

174
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,007
- I understand, I did not mean to cause

175
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,309
you any inconvenience, Mr. Flint.

176
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:14,280
- This has nothing to do with me or my people.

177
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,382
- [Kaufman] Yes sir, I am considering the worst

178
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,184
case scenario, rest assured.

179
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,151
- [Quincy] Do that!

180
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,891
- It would seem that at least for now,

181
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,127
Kaufman is following our orders.

182
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,564
- He better, however our top priority

183
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,599
is to find the D.D. which was supposed

184
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,800
to be on that shuttle.

185
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,337
If the AD police or the Tower become

186
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,206
aware of its existence, then we will

187
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,274
be forced to temporarily cut the strings

188
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,511
between us and our puppet, SDPC.

189
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,912
- Oh really?

190
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,881
On the other hand it might be more expedient

191
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,218
to cut some other strings, for example,

192
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,220
the ones that make you dance.

193
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,590
- The Tower and the AD police will be

194
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,692
investigating this, but I know what

195
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,228
those girls want which gives me the edge.

196
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,263
Even so, shielding you is risky, Largo

197
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,832
and should I fall, I will not fall alone.

198
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,666
Well?

199
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,338
(laughs)

200
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,147
- The majority of workers on Generos

201
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,450
are F and G series space development Booomer.

202
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,319
There's a strong possibility that effective unit

203
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,989
caused some sort of screw up in operations.

204
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,624
You go and listen to what their people

205
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,559
have to say and put it on the record

206
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,462
as a formality. - Just a formality?

207
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,664
- Listen to me, don't you dare go half-cocked

208
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,534
on this one, this is SDCP we're up against

209
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,903
which is directly controlled by the government.

210
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,204
I don't wanna make a big fuss only

211
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,273
to get the evil eye from upstairs, okay?

212
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,874
- The only thing you're concerned about

213
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,043
is your retirement, you chicken shit.

214
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,745
(growls)

215
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,113
- You try dealing with officers

216
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,514
like you who go wild every time there's

217
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,982
a big case, and see if you don't end up

218
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,518
like me, my head is on the chopping block.

219
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,319
All the time!

220
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:06,258
- Whoa (laughs)

221
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,093
You S.O.

222
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,363
(engines whine)

223
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,304
Don't get too caught up in the nightlife.

224
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,506
- [Daley] There's almost all Boomers on that station.

225
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,241
I'm not looking forward to this at all.

226
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,076
- [Leon] Yeah, I know.

227
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,679
- Anyway, rumor has it that illegal arms sales

228
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,881
are being routed through Genaros.

229
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,283
Quite a coincidence, eh?

230
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,518
My gut feeling tells me there's

231
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,854
some kind of connection, call it

232
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,190
feminine intuition. - Coming from you,

233
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,859
I believe it, here catch.

234
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,498

00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,085
- [Nene] Linna, have you heard about that girl, Sylvie?

254
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,720
- [Linna] Yeah I heard about her, she's the girl

255
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,188
Priss is hanging around with, right?

256
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,590
- [Nene] Yeah, she comes into town just

257
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,592
the other day and in no time she's

258
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,228
causing a sensation, she's so gorgeous.

259
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,529
- Oh that's just because everyone finds

260
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,465
a fresh face exotic, I mean, she can't

261
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,500
hold a candle to me, right (laughs).

262
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,338
- Hi.

263
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,942
- Priss, you are your usual terrific self tonight.

264
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,811
- Thanks, Nene.

265
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,412
- How about I quit my job at Phoebe's

266
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,081
and become your manager, if you wanna

267
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,350
sign with EMI now's the time.

268
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,019
- Oh there you go again.

269
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,421
Hey, Priss, did you know that Linna

270
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:53,425
says her latest boyfriend is one of EMI's directors?

271
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,929
- I don't wanna know, I've had it

272
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,430
with you crying your heart out.

273
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,732
- [Linna] Oh, you're mean, it's serious

274
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,102
this time, and I deserve happiness too you know.

275
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,404
- [Nene] Being happy with Linna, what an awful thought.

276
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,705
- [Priss] You got that right.

277
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,508
- Oh, you're both picking on me.

278
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:14,413
- You look like you're having fun, I hope

279
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,615
I'm not interrupting anything.

280
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,651
- You're late, Sylvie, I already

281
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,819
finished my last set.

282
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,654
- Oh.

283
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,291
I'm sorry, I had a little business.

284
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,828
Hey, these are your friends, right?

285
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,997
- Yeah, Nene and Linna.

286
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,333
- You're Sylvie right, Priss has been

287
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,235
telling us all about you, about what

288
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,103
a terrific biker you are and she's right

289
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,905
you're so beautiful, I bet you've got

290
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:43,909
tons of boyfriends. - You're too kind.

291
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,044
Pleased to meet you.

292
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,648
- [Linna] Same here.

293
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,718
- [Priss] Okay, now that we're all here,

294
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,386
how's about we get going?

295
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,488
- Right. - Speaking of which.

296
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,866
(balls clack)

297
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,506
- [Fargo] Sorry about this, Sylia.

298
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,311
- Okay same as ever, eh Fargo, why

299
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,281
don't you at least wear a nicer suit for once.

300
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,250
- Hey, I'm sorry, I've got all kinds

301
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,686
of expenses, you know, plus, with

302
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,022
the cost of living today, that sort

303
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,391
of thing is out of my reach anyway.

304
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,361
Did you have a look at the report I sent you?

305
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,031
- Kaufman at SDPC is in the hot seat again, right?

306
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,466
- [Fargo] You got it.

307
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,535
He's risen very far, very fast, but apparently

308
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,704
he fell in with a Genom splinter group.

309
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,574
Secretly developed a next generation super weapon

310
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,975
and shipped it to a space station

311
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,510
with the intention of selling it to

312
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,512
an unfriendly power.

313
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,181
- The D.D airborne battle mover, right Fargo?

314
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,716
I've heard about it here and there.

315
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,551
Is it already finished then?

316
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,620
- They have a prototype.

317
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,355
Now what Kaufman wants is either

318
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,624
its recovery or its destruction.

319
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,626
Also find his girlfriend.

320
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,495
Seems she turned out to be a thief.

321
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,497
No leads on her identity though.

322
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,600
- Meaning the Genom Tower is behind all of this?

323
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,803
- As a matter of fact, our beloved Genom corporation

324
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,139
has nothing to do with this incident, hm.

325
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,040
- This is a messy job and it's not

326
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,976
going to come cheap, Fargo.

327
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,812
- I've already deposited half the fee.

328
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,649
I'm sure you'll find it more than acceptable.

329
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,186
- Fargo, I'm just no match for you.

330
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,590
Okay, I'll contact you in the usual manner.

331
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,493
Till then. (door whines)

332
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,635
(engines roar)

333
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,936
(lights snack)

334
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,971
- I tell ya, I can't get used to this place

335
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,973
no matter how many times I come in here.

336
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,811
- Leon, I'll show you the deceased.

337
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,549
- Forget about the guy, what a waste

338
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,951
this happened to such a good-looking girl.

339
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,353
Right, Nene? - Oh, yes sir,

340
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,022
very good looking.

341
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,790
- Since that's neither here nor there

342
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,258
would you mind just shutting up

343
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,359
for a minute? - Mm.

344
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,362
(laughs)

345
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,931
- [Examiner] Now there are more bodies waiting,

346
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,833
I'll tell you what I figured out.

347
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,301
Write this down.

348
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,403
First the woman was with the man

349
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,339
the cause of death was massive blood loss.

350
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,675
The main external wounds are this injury

351
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,911
to the left side of the neck as well as.

352
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,112
- This is the eighth accident in

353
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,415
the last two weeks with the circumstances

354
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,650
all the same, previous reports indicate

355
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,453
hardly any blood stains at the scenes, too.

356
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,790
Wonder if it isn't a vampire after all.

357
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,658
The newspapers are causing an uproar

358
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,061
with their constant vampire headlines.

359
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,029
- That's what I like about this town,

360
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,966
it's never dull. - I bet that the vampire

361
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,268
uses some kind of modern vehicles.

362
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,770
Since they were all freeway incidents.

363
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,772
- [Leon] I don't know, could be a Boomer.

364
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,542
- Boomer, you mean Boomers can drink blood?

365
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,378
- They might if they were type 33-S

366
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,280
which had an artificial blood supply.

367
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,448
But fortunately, there aren't any

368
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,283
of those around nowadays, since it was

369
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,851
the one Boomer that was banned.

370
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,988
- Then it is a vampire after all.

371
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,624
- Well whichever it is, unless we bring it in soon,

372
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,628
there won't be any cute girls left.

373
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,865
- That's true, then I must be careful too.

374
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,001
(groans)

375
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,502
The investigation section is working

376
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,204
on the angle that the culprit the vampire

377
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,207
serial killings is a 33-S, but the production

378
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,410
data states that the 33-S were all eliminated.

379
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,646
Tell me, why was this Boomer banned?

380
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,281
- They were initially designed to be

381
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,716
Sexaroid toys but they were augmented

382
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,553
so they could synchronize to advanced weapons systems.

383
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,255
That caused problems.

384
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,390
- A Sexaroid (screams).

385
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,994
So do they really exist?

386
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,429
- I thought you weren't interested

387
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,197
in perverted things like that?

388
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:00,032
- Why not?

389
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,735
Hey, I wonder if they're as pretty

390
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,837
as this girl I met yesterday.

391
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,839
- Who? - Oh, this biker friend

392
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,975
of Priss's, her name is Sylvie

393
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,145
and she's really hot, oh with a body

394
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,847
that you could just die for, and Priss

395
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,216
gets along with her unusually well.

396
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:21,587
- I see, sounds like someone I'd like to meet.

397
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:25,290
All right inform me if anything else happens.

398
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,295
- Okay. (screen whines)

399
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,900
- [Internal Voice] A super weapon and a 33-S?

400
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,302
When will they learn, as you sow

401
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,339
so shall you reap, the question now is

402
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,641
what is his lady friend after?

403
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,248
(engines roar)

404
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,991
(car engine roars)

405
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,668
(machines rumble)

406
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,536
- [Priss] Here you go.

407
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,437
- Oh, thank you.

408
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,208
- So, how do you like this town so far?

409
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,711
(groans)

410
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,081
Oh, talk about mixed blessings.

411
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,484
That's the Genom Corporate Research Center.

412
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,021
They're the source of all the boomer trouble.

413
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:29,855
Scary.

414
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,825
(cat meows) Aw.

415
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,266
Here you go. (cat meows)

416
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,243
(cat meows) Uh-uh, the rest is mine.

417
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,715
(laughs) (cat meows)

418
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,653
- Here kitty kitty. (cat growls)

419
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,796
- Hey, are you okay? - Yeah.

420
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,065
- Doesn't like beautiful women.

421
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,000
Must be a female cat.

422
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,834
- Oh, Priss.

423
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,603
Even that cat is free.

424
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:20,972
(car engine roars)

425
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:21,973
Freer than me.

426
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,444
- Come on, let's go, I've got a rehearsal

427
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,213
at the club. - Oh, thanks, but I'm

428
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,414
gonna stay here a little longer.

429
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:34,319
- Hmm? - I'm free, I'm free now.

430
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,955
Free. - Free?

431
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,560
- Right. - I don't know

432
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,730
what you're talking about, but I'll catch you later.

433
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,932
Call me. (engine roars)

434
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,033
- I will.

435
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:07,185
(explosion rumbles) (liquid squelches)

436
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,158
(sirens blare)

437
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,163
- [Quincy] The question is how much will

438
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,165
the little bitch teach the D.D?

439
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,101
- You must strike now, before the 33-S

440
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,670
fully trains it, is there nay possibility

441
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,339
that she will be able to synchronize

442
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,775
with the D.D's J-1 unit?

443
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,443
- There's no telling.

444
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,546
As long as they are fully active, the possibility exists.

445
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,781
And though its maintenance free,

446
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,749
the 33-S is an old model, it won't

447
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,284
stand a chance in the city.

448
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,687
- Knowing this, she will logically seek

449
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,258
to obtain the 33-S design data disk.

450
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,460
- And this vampire business has the city

451
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,996
in an uproar, we can no longer leave this

452
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,666
in Kaufman's hands, recapture it all costs

453
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,668
before either AD police or the Tower

454
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,437
focus their attentions on us.

455
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,340
And when you find the 33-S.

456
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,143
(dramatic whine)

457
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,711
After all, a fall from this height

458
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,613
could be dangerous to my health.

459
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,688
(somber music)

460
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,466
(gasps)

461
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,847
- Don't do it anymore, it's too dangerous now.

462
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,216
If you're caught, you'll be eliminated.

463
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,751
You've already done enough for me.

464
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,553
You've gotta live for your own sake

465
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,654
from now on (sobs).

466
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,061
- That's not true, Anri.

467
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,163
Right now, this is the only way I have

468
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,498
of maintaining your systems, but,

469
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,767
I've finally pinpointed the location

470
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,769
of the data disk, once we have that,

471
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,439
we won't have to do this anymore.

472
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:12,878
Soon, yes, in just a little while

473
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,513
we'll be able to live completely

474
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,147
under our own power.

475
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,664
(metal clacks)

476
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,672
(machine clicks)

477
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,619
(dramatic music)

478
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,303
(door clicks)

479
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,873
(growls)

480
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,808
- Who the hell are you?

481
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,812
- Why, I'll leave that up to your imagination.

482
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,481
(machine whines) - 33-S?

483
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,451
Where are the guards?

484
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:31,890
(groans) (body thumps)

485
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:33,625
- Real cute.

486
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:45,937
Here it is.

487
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,048
(gasps)

488
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,185
Still around, huh?

489
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,453
That was careless of me.

490
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,355
- [Guard] If it isn't the current hot topic

491
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,890
of conversation, thrilled to meet you.

492
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,059
- Well then, I'd like to make you even happier.

493
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,295
Why don't you take off those tacky sunglasses?

494
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,831
- Like this? (growls)

495
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:20,739
(gun roars) (gun clicks)

496
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,741
(gasps)

497
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,714
(glass tinkles) (metallic swooshing)

498
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:34,719
(explosion rumbles) (engine roars)

499
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,225
(engines rumble)

500
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,731
(wood bangs) - Dammit, I'm surrounded

501
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,068
by brainless bastards, hey McLeod,

502
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,636
have you tracked down the identity

503
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,271
of yesterday's victim yet?

504
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,773
- Hey, Leon! - What the hell's wrong

505
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,442
with you morons. - Call, Daley on three!

506
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,512
- [Captain] What, Daley, how long is that slacker

507
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,813
gonna hang around up there?

508
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,082
Tell him to get his butt back in here!

509
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,617
- Leon, sounds like he's in a good mood.

510
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,820
- Eh, he's just his usual charming self.

511
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,855
So tell me what you found out.

512
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,124
- Finally chased down Kaufman.

513
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,393
He was planning to do an illicit deal

514
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,162
with the super weapons, in cahoots

515
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,464
with the head of the GPCC.

516
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,400
I also managed to get a technical readout

517
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,436
on the stolen device, it's packing

518
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,472
some serious firepower. - Just another battle mover.

519
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,307
I'll bring it in with an armored trooper.

520
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,376
Daley, don't worry, I can handle it.

521
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,478
- (laughs) Don't underestimate it, Leon.

522
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,513
It's a next generation battle mover,

523
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,749
equipped with a J-1 auto control system

524
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,918
and highly intelligent on board automation.

525
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,921
And to top it all off, those idiots

526
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,890
installed a nuclear dead man destruct device.

527
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,726
- Before you go off hunting that battle mover,

528
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,727
we need prior authorization, you screw up

529
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,463
and my ass gets fried too.

530
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,998
(wood bangs) - Good work, Daley.

531
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,468
Now get your butt back here while you still can.

532
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:01,406
(phone whines) - Where are you going?

533
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:06,111
- On patrol, if I meet the vampire,

534
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,114
I'll break its fangs and bring em back as souvenirs.

535
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,452
- Oh listen, Leon, the patrol choppers

536
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,920
are each carrying an armored trooper

537
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,224
so don't use em to go patrolling.

538
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,393
- [Leon] Right, and thanks.

539
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,035
- Are you sure this is all right Leon?

540
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,171
I need flight authorization for an

541
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,607
emergency take off. - Don't worry about it.

542
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,509
I'll take the responsibility.

543
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,443
- [Pilot] Yes, Sir.

544
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,347
(engines whine)

545
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:47,352
(engine roars) (dramatic music)

546
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:59,030
(lazers whine) (explosions rumble)

547
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:05,103
(explosions rumble) (lazers whine)

548
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,672
(explosion rumbles)

549
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,407
- Fire fight spotted on highway five,

550
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,642
headed north, north east.

551
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,477
- All right, circle around and pursue.

552
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,311
- Roger.

553
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,950
(explosions rumble) (lazers whine)

554
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,419
(explosion rumbles) (groans)

555
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,290
- Ah! (metallic thump)

556
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,794
(metallic swooshing) (engine roars)

557
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:34,799
(screams) (metallic swooshing)

558
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,508
(water sloshes)

559
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,147
- [Boomer] Feeling gutsy, Bit, the 33-S

560
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,316
is finally at the end of a rope.

561
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,419
- [Boomer] Yeah, let's finish her off fore the cops come

562
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,055
(rocks shatter)

563
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,870
(metal whines) (roars)

564
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,542
(gun roars) (explosion rumbles)

565
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:22,547
(grunts) (explosion whines)

566
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,149
- Ah! (bullets whir)

567
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,152
(explosion rumbles)

568
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,492
- [Pilot] Combat machine unrecorded in data bank.

569
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,994
Should I contact headquarters?

570
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,299
- Contact them if anything happens to me.

571
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,205
Do it.

572
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,841
(metal rumbles)

573
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,012
(grunts)

574
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:01,686
(metal thumps) Okay, hold it right there.

575
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,488
I'm not gonna do anything.

576
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,622
Just come outta there.

577
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,727
(machine whines)

578
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,596
- What's happening?

579
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,430
What?

580
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,034
(screams)

581
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,603
(metal clangs)

582
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:24,509
(metal snaps) (metal grunts)

583
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:30,515
(high whine) (metal growls)

584
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,854
(high swoosh) - What the hell?

585
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,860
(metal grunts) - Don't underestimate

586
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,996
it, Leon, it's a next generation

587
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,931
battle mover, equipped with a J-1

588
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,167
auto control system and highly intelligent

589
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,337
on-board automation, and to top it all off,

590
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,672
those idiots installed a nuclear dead man

591
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,342
destruct device. (metal whirs)

592
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,244
(grunts) (rock rumbles)

593
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:05,183
(grunts) (metal clangs)

594
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:10,521
(metal thumps) (electric crackles)

595
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,432
I'm not finished, not, not yet.

596
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,336
(metal whirs) Here we go.

597
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:34,679
(electric crackles) (groans)

598
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,651
(grunts) (electric crackles)

599
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,489
What? (metallic thump)

600
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,826
(grunts) Unless I put this thing

601
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,230
down quickly, the city'll go up in smoke.

602
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,064
I've got to.

603
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,470
(metal cracks) (groans)

604
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,375
(metal whines) (explosion rumbles)

605
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,148
Over there, is it?

606
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,319
(metallic thump)

607
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,588
(metallic thump)

608
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,725
(metallic thump)

609
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,728
- [Sylia] Knight Sabers, it's show time!

610
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,966
(guns whine) (guns whir)

611
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:33,971
- Now! (explosions rumble)

612
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,782
(grunts)

613
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,252
- What's going on?

614
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,388
Oh no, the computer's gone onto

615
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:53,324
full auto mode, it's decided that I'm dead.

616
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,959
All that's left now is.

617
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,396
- (grunts) Destroy it quickly.

618
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,666
It'll self destruct once it runs out of power.

619
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,968
We'll be blown to pieces along

620
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,737
with the entire city (grunts)

621
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,475
- [Priss] What is that, Nene?

622
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,311
- [Nene] Ah, right, he means it.

623
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,913
It's got a micro-neutron bomb and it's only

624
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,449
180 seconds away from critical mass.

625
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,517
- [All] What?

626
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,589
(metallic swooshing)

627
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,563
- Sylvie! (gasps)

628
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,765
- It's you, Priss.

629
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,973
Kill, kill me, the D.D has fused to me

630
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,708
and if you kill me it should shut down.

631
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,544
Hurry! - Why, why you, Sylvie?

632
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,980
- Please, it's completely out of control now.

633
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,283
If you leave me like this, I'll take

634
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,784
you and Anri with me.

635
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,389
- [Priss] I can't.

636
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,193
(metal whines)

637
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,797
- [Sylia] What's wrong with you, Priss, do it!

638
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:09,433
- No, I can't shoot her.

639
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:13,738
(metal thumps) (metal roars)

640
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:14,906
- [All] Priss!

641
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:22,780
(metal cracks) (explosion rumbles)

642
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:27,852
(metal thumps) (lazers roar)

643
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,690
(screams) (metal whines))

644
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:37,695
(metal cracks) (metal whirs)

645
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:46,871
(screams) - Stop it, stop it, stop it.

646
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:55,012
(screams) Stop it, D.D (screams).

647
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:59,884
(whines) (explosion rumbles)

648
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,386
(metal thumps)

649
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,099
- Priss.

650
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:18,669
- Here I come!

651
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:23,674
(guns whine) (explosions burst)

652
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,580
- [All] Priss!

653
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:31,449
- Priss.

654
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,754
(gasps) - Sylvie!

655
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,061
(lazer whines) - Priss.

656
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:56,374
- Sylvie! (somber music)

657
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:02,780
Sylvie, I can't believe it's you.

658
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,217
- Priss, take this, there's a girl, Anri

659
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:09,353
waiting back in my apartment.

660
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,088
Please, give it to her, without it,

661
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,292
she'll become like me, forced to hurt people.

662
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,429
I beg you.

663
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,930
- Why'd you do it?

664
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,702
- I want to be free, like you, free.

665
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,443
- Sylvie?

666
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,012
Sylvie (sobs).

667
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:36,847
Oh, god.

668
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,517
- I understand the situation.

669
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,687
Priss, do you think you should hand over that data?

670
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:46,590
- I know, but Sylvie was a friend.

671
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,893
I can't betray my friends.

672
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:53,264
- All right then, but you must go soon.

673
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,999
The rest of us will disperse now.
