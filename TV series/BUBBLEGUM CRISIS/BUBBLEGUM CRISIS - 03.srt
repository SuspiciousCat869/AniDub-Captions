00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,668
It has arrived at Point K, Route 246,

00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,172
where it is engaging the Sixth AD Police Mobile Force.

10
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,742
(intense music)

11
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,818
(exploding)

12
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,321
(fire crackling)

13
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,524
(whirring)

14
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,731
(gun banging)

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,467
(laser blasting)

16
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,537
- [Policeman] A Combat Boomer's appeared at Point K,

17
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,205
Route 246, District Three.

18
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:15,742
The Sixth AD Police Mobile Force is currently engaging it.

19
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,110
(police sirens wailing)

20
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,646
(exploding)

21
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,148
(gun banging)

22
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,088
- [Pilot] HQ, this thing's kickin' all kinds of ass.

23
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,589
I'm engagin' the K-11s.

24
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,257
- [Dispatcher] 10-4.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,396
(rock music)

26
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,219
- [Man] How many times do I have to put up

27
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,720
with your standing me up?

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,389
You're due on stage any minute, Priss.

29
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,725
- [Priss] I told you, this can't wait!

30
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:06,860
- [Linna] Hurry up, Priss.

31
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,428
- [Priss] All right, all right.

32
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,763
- [Man] All right then, you'll never work here again.

33
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,365
You got that?

34
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,135
- [Priss] Terrific, now ask me if I give a damn.

35
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,069
- [Linna] I'm really sorry, sir,

36
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,670
but this is really an emergency!

37
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,773
- [Man] Shut the bloody door!

38
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:21,841
- Yes, sir.

39
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,011
- [Priss] Man, that Boomer's got a lot of nerve,

40
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,580
stomping around near Sylia's place.

41
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,249
- Apparently, it's a combat model.

42
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,651
The AD Police seem to be having a tough time of it.

43
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,852
- A combat type?

44
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,187
All right, I'll meet you there.

45
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,756
(bike revving)

46
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,459
- [Linna] Come on.

47
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,527
Oh, start!

48
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,363
(air whooshing)

49
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,265
(screaming)

50
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,966
(guns banging)

51
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,702
(laser blasting)

52
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,409
(cars honking)

53
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,079
- Wouldn't ya know it?

54
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,681
Just my luck to be on the early shift today.

55
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,783
(car honking)

56
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:04,784
Hey, you in that car!

57
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,153
Pipe it down, or else!

58
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,988
Ooh, they're about to drive me crazy.

59
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,491
- [Priss] Hey, officer, let me through!

60
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,325
- What is it?

61
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,526
Oh, Priss.

62
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,429
(bike revving)

63
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,730
- [Priss] Thanks, officer.

64
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,000
- [Motorcycle Cop] You idiot, why'd you let her through?

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,168
She's speeding.

66
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,270
- I'm sorry.

67
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,674
Oh, today just isn't my day.

68
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,810
(intense techno music)

69
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,313
(gun banging)

70
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,514
(gun banging)

71
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,649
(glass shattering)

72
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,252
(bike revving)

73
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,029
(guns banging)

74
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,565
(guns banging)

75
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,734

00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,436

00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,772
(guns banging)

78
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,709
(bike revving)

79
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,212
(gun banging) (gasping)

80
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,647
- Son of a bitch!

81
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,485
(tires screeching)

82
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,123
(gun banging)

83
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,192
(laser blasting)

84
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,460
(exploding)

85
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,796
(police sirens wailing)

86
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,272
(electronic beeping)

87
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,807
(engine revving)

88
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,143
(tires screeching)

89
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,746
(guns banging)

90
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,422
(guns banging)

91
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,231
(thudding)

92
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,975
(tires screeching)

93
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,010
- [Motorcycle cop] You were 50K over the limit!

94
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,345
- Leon.

95
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,781
- Hey, babe, the law's the law.

96
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,616
- Big help you are.

97
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,884
(scoffing)

98
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,419
Man, this boomer's made a real mess.

99
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,921
Thanks to him, my license is being suspended.

100
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,122
- [Nene] Well thanks to you,

101
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,991
I'm in hot water with the traffic cops.

102
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,459
I'm really having bad luck.

103
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,127
- [Linna] I'm the one who's having bad luck.

104
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,930
My car died, and I had to take a cab.

105
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,732
- We can't let this slide.

106
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,234
It's that bastard Mason who's behind all this,

107
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,469
I'm sure of it.

108
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,471
Let's get off our asses and nail him.

109
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,974
- No, it's best if we leave this to the AD Police.

110
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,410
Just forget about it Priss, and give us a hand.

111
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,846
- Linna, you know, I'm not into that kinda stuff.

112
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,548
- [Linna] Oh, give me a break.

113
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,149
- That's not fair.

114
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,517
(laughing)

115
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,186
- Hey Priss, come outside for a sec.

116
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,053
Gotta surprise.

117
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,991
(bike revving)

118
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,928
- Man, this is sweet.

119
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,933
Is it ready to ride?

120
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,301
- [Leon] It should be okay.

121
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,279
(bike revving)

122
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,793
(tires screeching)

123
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,961
- Sho.

124
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,395
- Oh, Priss.

125
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,165
- Your mom's not back from work yet?

126
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,900
- Uh-uh.

127
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,869
- Oh, you must be hungry.

128
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,837
Here, why don't you have some of this?

129
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,339
- Oh boy, thanks, Priss!

130
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,811
(footsteps)

131
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,312
- Sho?

132
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,781
- Hi, mom!

133
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,182
- Let's go have dinner.

134
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,251
- Okay, what are we having tonight?

135
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,085
- Hamburgers.

136
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,588
- Mom, Priss already gave me a burger.

137
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,894
Let's have pizza instead.

138
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,995
- [Sho's Mom] All right.

139
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:09,929
Now, let's go home.

140
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,305
(door opening)

141
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,574
(footsteps)

142
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,143
(door closing)

143
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,479
(light clicking on)

144
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,413
(suspenseful music)

145
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,948
- More over,

146
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,750
the Boomer which terrorized the city was a combat model.

147
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,653
This type of manufacturing is illegal in Japan.

148
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,021
Citizens' groups are demanding

149
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,956
stricter enforcement of the law.

150
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,624
In other news around the globe,

151
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,093
the widely expected merger of Uldo Enterprises.

152
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,030
- [Priss] Hey, Linna.

153
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,367
Why the hell won't Sylia take a shot at him?

154
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,202
- Huh?

155
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,736
At who?

156
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,905
- [Priss] At that son of a bitch, Mason, that's who!

157
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,140
- Huh?

158
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,776
No way, that would be against Article 2

159
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,144
of the Knight Saber's Code.

160
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,178
You know that.

161
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,380
Hey, Priss.

162
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,982
Get me a soda out of the fridge, okay?

163
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,318
- What the hell am I?

164
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,988
(fridge door opening)

165
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,789
Here.

166
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,991
(grunting)

167
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,825
(fridge door closing)

168
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,060
- How rude!

169
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,094
If you toss 'em around like that,

170
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,562
you can't open 'em right away.

171
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,064
- [Priss] So get it yourself.

172
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,233
- [Linna] What's gotten into you?

173
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,167
When you're done with that,

174
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,468
sweep the apartment, okay?

175
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,904
- The price I pay.

176
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,439
- [Linna] What's with you?

177
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,908
When someone feeds you, you naturally owe them a favor.

178
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,143
(intense music)

179
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,680
- The technologically integrated economic city project,

180
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,251
which GENOM has been advancing for some time now,

181
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,786
has finally received governmental approval.

182
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,490
GENOM will acquire all of District 3,

183
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,992
and present it to the world

184
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,327
as the leading edge business community.

185
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,733
Also, District 12, who's restoration has been delayed,

186
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,937
will become a single lodge GENOM industrial area.

187
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,340
In summary, we will move ahead with Stage 1

188
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,743
of the development of these two districts.

189
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,078
- The inhabitants of District 3 are most upset

190
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,680
about the lack of law and order,

191
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,515
so it should be only a matter of time

192
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,484
before they decide to sell their land.

193
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,621
- My hopes are riding on you, Mason.

194
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,857
Another failure would be distressing.

195
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,159
You had best not disappoint me.

196
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,361
- Yes, sir.

197
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,463
I completely understand, sir.

198
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,466
(machines whirring)

199
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,282
(machines whirring)

200
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,419
- [Priss] Happy birthday, Sho!

201
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,620
- Thanks!

202
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,356
- Okay, now blow out all the candles.

203
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,326
(blowing)

204
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,727
How old is he?

205
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,529
- 10 years old.

206
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,097
- 10 years old?

207
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,598
- Come on, let's eat.

208
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:02,068
Hey Priss, this is mama's own pizza,

209
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,703
and it really tastes great.

210
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,471
- Okay, here I go.

211
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,541
Yummy!

212
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,475
- Told ya!

213
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,409
- [Sho's Mom] Mind your manners!

214
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,477
We're in the middle of dinner.

215
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,712
- Oh, this isn't a dinner.

216
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,613
It's a party.

217
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,880
Right, Sho?

218
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,149
- Yeah, it's a party.

219
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,118
- It's wonderful to have Priss come over here.

220
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,353
Isn't it, Sho?

221
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,822
- I'm sorry to have you cut off so rudely.

222
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,156
- Oh, not at all.

223
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,325
When I'm at work, he's all alone.

224
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,728
I hate to think of him being that way.

225
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,363
Your looking out for him every now and then

226
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,164
is such a big help.

227
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:36,335
- I guess I'm just a really big hit with kids his age.

228
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,604
- I lost my husband, my home,

229
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,574
everything to the big earthquake seven years ago.

230
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,476
After that, we came to live here.

231
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,744
(game beeping)

232
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,212
But for Sho's sake, I've done what I can.

233
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,614
- [Priss] But it must be hard, always working so late.

234
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,616
- [Sho's Mom] I imagine it's the same for you.

235
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,419
- Well, in my case, it's more like a hobby.

236
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,554
- Well, I've just recently been able

237
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,189
to start saving some money.

238
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,060
Someday, I plan to live out in the country

239
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,728
where the air is clean.

240
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,898
But for now, it's just a dream.

241
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,369
(gentle music)

242
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,446
- [Priss] A dream.

243
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,681
(clinking)

244
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,288
(door closes)

245
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,157
(voices chattering)

246
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,492
(footsteps)

247
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,339
(intense music)

248
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,813
(electronic beeping)

249
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,217
(electronic beeping)

250
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,729
- [Mason Voiceover] Sylia Stringray.

251
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,799
(electronic beeping)

252
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,482
- Sis?

253
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,884
Hey sis, I'm coming in.

254
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,619
I'm done with the sales report.

255
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,855
Oh.

256
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,790
She must be in the data bank room.

257
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,727
And here I was, thinking I could catch her in her underwear.

258
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,932
(suspenseful techno music)

259
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,640
(water running)

260
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,496
(footsteps)

261
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,665
(yawning)

262
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,207
- Mason.

263
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,376
What's going on?

264
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,979
- Priss, they threw us all out.

265
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,314
We're gonna be evicted.

266
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,849
You've got to do something.

267
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,551
- I'll take care of this.

268
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,154
- GENOM Real Estate purchased this land from the government.

269
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,889
You're all trespassers.

270
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,358
So, you have no right to be here.

271
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,129
- You can't be serious.

272
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,730
(thudding)

273
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,598
- Wouldn't try that.

274
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,166
- Shut up!

275
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,134
- You're killin' me.

276
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,138
- Oh, come on, it's too early in the morning

277
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,272
to be having a riot.

278
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,209
What the?

279
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,944
Hey, hey, that's a little rough, isn't it?

280
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,545
Let her go.

281
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,047
You live around here?

282
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,716
How about I stop by your place later on, huh?

283
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:11,884
- Are you out of your mind?

284
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,519
I'm being evicted!

285
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,255
Now, do something about these bastards.

286
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,924
- I'm afraid what they're doing is completely legal.

287
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,163
(grunting)

288
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,364
- [Priss Voiceover] Shit.

289
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,099
You son of a bitch!

290
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,640
(grunting)

291
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,141
- It's a Boomer!

292
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,244
(grunting)

293
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,078
(gun banging)

294
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,447
- [Mason] That's enough.

295
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,448
(thudding)

296
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,550
(gasping)

297
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,551
- One of these days,

298
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,353
I'll uncover the truth about you.

299
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,990
- Be careful what you say, little puppy.

300
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,191
- Even a little puppy

301
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,360
can nibble a sleazebag like you to death.

302
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,930
(gasping)

303
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,012
(machines whirring)

304
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,480
(machine revving)

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,782
(creaking)

306
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:17,983
- Our home!

307
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:18,817
- Sho!

308
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,119
Stay back!

309
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,388
(rumbling)

310
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,633
(glass shattering)

311
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,567
- [Sho] Stop!

312
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,569
There's someone in there!

313
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,580
(dramatic techno music)

314
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,122
(thudding)

315
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,293
- [Sho's Mom Voiceover] Someday, I plan to live out

316
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,495
in the country, where the air is clean.

317
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,032
But for now, it's just a dream.

318
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:16,875
- Let's go.

319
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,535
- An eye for an eye.

320
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,471
- [Sylia] No operating on your own.

321
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,305
- [Priss] Sylia!

322
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,075
- Personal vengeance is a violation of Article 2.

323
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,944
- Solo actions are a no no.

324
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,647
Article 3 consent a full membership is required.

325
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,349
- So, what's with the suits?

326
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,650
- [Linna] Nene gaves us the information

327
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,586
as it came into AD Police,

328
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,022
including word about a boy who'd lost his mother.

329
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:07,559
- We're doing this preserve the Knight Sabers organization,

330
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,395
not just for you.

331
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,229
- Sylia.

332
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:16,335
(energetic techno music)
