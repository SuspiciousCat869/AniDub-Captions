A USSD orbital particle beam satellite

striking the Tokyo Bay Aqua City

the accidental particle beam satellite discharge

00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,572
We're with the appliances department.

73
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,241
And besides, a patrol section showed up right away

74
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,475
and kept us from entering.

75
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,743
- [Daley] If you're covering something up

76
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,778
it won't do any good.

77
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,981
- But it's under the jurisdiction of the research

00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,860
Hey, someone get the guys from the patrol section

84
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,129
and the research department down here.

85
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,198
And get everything in this room tagged.

87
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,613
- [Linna] Hey, that girl.

88
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,947
- [Priss] You know her, Linna?

89
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,882
- [Linna] Yeah, from the aerobics club.

90
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,619

91

You murdered him, I know you did!

(hand thwacks) (Irene screams)

93
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,124

94
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,461
Move it.

95
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,962
- Where do you think you're going, babe?

96
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:23,930
(knee thuds) (man groans)

97
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,932
- Hey, Carl, I bet that hurts.

98
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,103
- Damn you! (hand whacks)

99
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,138
Ow, shit.

100
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,175
(Priss groans)

101
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,885
You're a Boomer?

102
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,757
(Priss yells)

103
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,563
- Hold it right there, I'm Leon, AD Police.

104
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,667
Now, cut the crap or I'm taking all of you in.

105
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,402
- That's enough, let her go.

106
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,406
We don't welcome false accusations.

107
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,375
We consider our corporate image very important.

108
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,912
Now if you don't mind.

109
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,085
- Who was that?

110
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,687
- Brian Jane Mason.

111
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,922
He's the personal assistant to the chairman

112
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,091
of the Genom corporation.

113
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,492
A real snake.

114
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,261
- Hmm.

115
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,444
- [Man] Cynthia was a weapon we developed to synchronize

116
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,446
with the orbital satellites.

117
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,582
- [Sylia] She may have been just a weapon to you, but to us,

118
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,919
she was a little girl that needed to be rescued.

119
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,821
- [Man] During the design phase

120
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,991
we considered many possible shapes but--

121
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:02,762
- Do us all a favor and make the next one look like a dog

122
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,596
or a cat.

123
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,802
But we'll take the job, loose ends and all.

124
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,738
- [Man] We deeply appreciate it.

125
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,606
Here are the details of the assignment,

126
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,109
as well as data about Black Box,

127
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,545
the orbital satellite synchronization system.

128
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,417
- We will expect our 20 million fee upon completion.

129
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,291
So heartless.

130
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,961
(horns honking)

131
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,001
- Case closed?

132
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,138
(scoffs) It's more pressure from Genom, isn't it?

133
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,072
- Not at all.

134
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,707
Upstairs has already decided

135
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,376
that this was merely an accident.

136
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,112
There's absolutely no evidence of Boomer involvement.

137
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,381
- They haven't even been to the scene.

138
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,150
What the hell do they know?

139
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,519
- They know that your job is dealing with real Boomer crimes

140
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,787
so lay off this one!

141
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,522
- Come on, are you blind?

142
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,858
Genom is developing a monster Boomer.

143
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,859
- Bullshit!

144
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,494
That's just a hunch.

145
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,497
Anyway, nothing's really happened yet.

146
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,801
- What are you gonna do, just sit and wait for it?

147
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,702
- Get outta my face!

148
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,173
It's about time somebody starting reining you in!

149
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,743
- Listen, lard ass, any time you wanna consider disability,

150
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,977
just let me know.

151
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,212
- [Captain] Why you arrogant punk!

152
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,146
I'm gonna make you eat those words.

153
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:27,814
- (laughs) Are they at it again?

154
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:28,981
- [Cop] Yup.

155
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,417
- I swear it's all this political bullshit

156
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,085
that keeps us from doing our job.

157
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,321
- Oh, Leon, I can help you with that job,

158
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,689
but you're so tense.

159
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:37,957
I know just the thing,

160
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,359
there's this quiet little motel.

161
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,329
- Oh, yeah, Daley, someplace where we can be alone.

162
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,165
- [Daley] How 'bout your car?

163
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,901
- [Leon] Nah, an APC, it's roomier.

164
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,904
(officers laughing)

165
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,980
- [Sylia] Someone beat USSD to the Black Box

166
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,382
and recovered it from the wreckage of Aqua City.

167
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,652
I've got a hunch Genom's involved,

168
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,655
and that today's explosion is somehow related to it.

169
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,626
- (groans) Genom huh?

170
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,628
So we get another crack at 'em.

171
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,698
(grunts)

172
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,166
- But aren't they too big for us?

173
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,971
Besides, I'm not too keen on this payment on delivery stuff.

174
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,374
- I'm so sick of watching the AD Police screw up.

175
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,210
This is driving me totally insane.

176
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,714
- Well then the three of you should get started immediately.

177
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,717
Priss, you check out activities connected with Genom.

178
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,520
Nene, crack into the AD Police databases.

179
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,622
Mackie can help you with the passwords.

180
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,823
- [Priss and Nene] Okay.

181
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,843
- [Cop] Good morning, AD Police Investigation section.

182
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,077
Who?

183
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,012
Yeah, hang on a sec.

184
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,381
Hey, Leon, line two, pick it up.

185
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,683
- If it's a guy, tell him I'm not here.

186
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,485
- [Cop] It's a babe, name's Priss.

187
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,419
- Huh?

188
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,354
Hey, Priss, I can't believe it.

189
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,090
I feel so honored to get a phone call from ya.

190
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,092
- I'll go out with you.

191
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,394
- Huh, really?

192
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,295
When?

193
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,096
- [Priss] Today, at 11.

194
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,999
- If you wanna meet that late then let's meet a hotel,

195
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,201
and I know just the place.

196
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,904
- 11 in the morning, you jerk.

197
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,439
- [Leon] In the middle of the day?

198
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,408
I'm still on duty then.

199
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,643
- Make up something then sneak out.

200
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,012
Meet me at the Ragu Steakhouse on 26th.

201
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:40,846
Later.

202
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:41,681
- Huh?

203
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,850
Yesterday I'm scum,

204
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,854
today she can't wait to see me.

205
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,456
I must be cooler than I thought.

206
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,893
Boy, you can really put it away.

207
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,762
- [Priss] This is both breakfast and lunch for me.

208
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,030
Sure you won't have anything?

209
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,599
- [Leon] No, just being here with you is enough.

210
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,735
- Oh, come on, don't deprive yourself.

211
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,303
You're paying after all.

212
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,106
Delicious.

213
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,975
I saw on the morning news that you're investigating

214
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,977
last night's explosion.

215
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,945
- So did I look good or what?

216
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,180
- Not bad.

217
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,182
But what did they mean by case closed?

218
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,818
- Oh, that the brass have made up their minds.

219
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,152
But I disagree.

220
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,988
- Oh, you do?

221
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,523
- The way I see it there's something fishy going on

222
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,792
inside the Genom building.

223
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,595
Like the development of an advance Boomer, for example.

224
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,664
- An advanced Boomer?

225
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,498
- [Leon] Right.

226
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,866
- And that means.

227
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,168
- So, why are you so interested in all this anyway?

228
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,704
- Oh, I just kinda like this kind of stuff.

229
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,508
You know, it's like watching a science fiction movie.

230
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,978
So, the explosion was a project related accident?

231
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,481
- Uh-huh, some sort of screw up.

232
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,017
- Now that must mean that the development project

233
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,985
is still underway in the Genom building.

234
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,855
- When I was at the scene of the accident

235
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,490
one of their patrol guys told me

236
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,026
that a delivery truck left at the same time

237
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,396
as the explosion through a normally unused gate.

238
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,531
- You mean they moved to another location?

239
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,365
- Right.

240
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,202
- Would you look at the time?

241
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,172
This has been very interesting,

242
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,408
but I've got a show to do now.

243
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,242
- Hmm?

244
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,176
You can't do that.

245
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,744
So far all we've done is eat.

246
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,415
- Good luck hunting Boomers.

247
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,949
- Hey, hold on a second.

248
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,685
(register beeps)

249
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,887
Huh?

250
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,321
(groans)

251
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,058
(dramatic music)

252
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,683
(machine buzzing)

253
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,932
(monitor beeping)

254
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,269
(Sylia laughs)

255
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,708
(upbeat music)

256
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,931
- My boyfriend was an engineer

257
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,634
doing R and D on Boomers for use in space.

258
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,471
- It sounds like he must've been a really special guy.

259
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,673
- He always seemed happy

260
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,109
when he talked about his research projects,

261
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,245
but after he got involved with this project

262
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,715
he got very nervous about something.

263
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,717
- What was the project?

264
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,219
- He said it was some sort of a linkage system.

265
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,721
But he was scared.

266
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,957
Scared that if he said anymore he might be silenced.

267
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,791
- Oh no!

268
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,260
What about the police?

269
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,795
- We told them, but they wouldn't pay any attention.

270
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,568
If only I knew what really happened to him.

271
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,436
- [Linna] So that was why you did what you did?

272
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,971
- Yes.

273
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,040
It's just that as soon as this project was finished

274
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,642
we were going to be married.

275
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,016
Now this ring is all that I have left.

276
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,588
(light electronic music)

277
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,380
(tires screech)

278
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,818
(light electronic music)

279
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,712
I am feeling a little bit better.

280
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,546
- I'm glad.

281
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,380
You look better.

282
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,016
- Well, thanks.

283
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,684
But I'm still going to try to find out

284
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,953
what really happened to him.

285
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,288
- Find out?

286
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,124
(scanner beeping)

287
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,094
- What I discovered is that

288
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,829
because of the recent Boomer crimes

289
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,731
Genom will be a media target

290
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,599
since they produce the Boomers.

291
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:04,036
I'll try to expose what really happened.

292
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,606
- But, Irene, if you go to far it'll put you in danger too.

293
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,042
- Maybe so,

294
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,045
but I just wanna make some sense out of this.

295
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,614
Now if something does happen to me,

296
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,384
see that those vigilantes avenge me.

297
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,287
You will promise me that, won't you, Linna?

298
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,554
- Huh?

299
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,557
- [Irene] I'm only kidding. (laughs)

300
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,659
- That's not funny.

301
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,162
(Irene giggles)

302
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,835
I tell ya, that waitress really had an attitude problem.

303
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:37,670
What the?

304
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,538
My car!

305
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,146
- I'll walk home.

306
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,315
Besides, it's not that far.

307
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,017
And I'm kinda in the mood for it anyway.

308
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,419
- [Linna] Okay, be careful.

309
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,156
- Linna, I'm glad you're so concerned about me.

310
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,258
Thanks so much.

311
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,292
- See you tomorrow.

312
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,864
Oh, great, how do I get home?

313
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,908
(tires crunching)

314
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,814
(dramatic music) (engine revs)

315
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,249
(tires screech)

316
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,585
(car thuds)

317
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,356
Irene!

318
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,590
- Got it.

319
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,825
Mackie, contact Priss immediately.

320
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,859
We've got a problem.

321
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,327
- Okay, I've got it.

322
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,397
(communicator beeps)

323
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,167
(dramatic music)

324
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,143
- [Mackie] Priss, head for the Third Street corner

325
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,878
of Yokohama, Chinatown.

326
00:16:55,114 --> 00:17:00,119
(dramatic music) (car rumbles)

327
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,164
(Irene yelps)

328
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,233
(tires screech)

329
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,002
(dramatic music)

330
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,083
(Irene pants)

331
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,462
(Irene sobs)

332
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,567
- Irene!

333
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,705
(Irene sobbing)

334
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,212
(dramatic music)

- [Priss] Bitch!

346
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,025

in the Kawasaki factory zone.

366

But two of them have been closed down.

367
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,337
Activity has resumed at one of them since the explosion

368
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,606

the truck that left by gate R headed straight from that gate

for Kawasaki.

371
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,314
- The closed laboratory seems suspicious.

372
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,716
It was a terrible place

373
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,918
with a history of research accidents.

374
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,654
It was finally shut down after 12 people died.

375

That was six years ago.

376

- [Sylia] Boomers I'll bet.

377
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:01,493
- [Mackie] They were allegedly developing power sources

378
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,529
for a new resin based, biomechanical fusion system,

379
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,466

393
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,179
the third and fifth floors but I can't figure out where.

394
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,648

395
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,283

00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,313
Go for its head.

436
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,502
they lost target lock but they're still operational.

437
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,736
- [Priss] I don't believe it.
