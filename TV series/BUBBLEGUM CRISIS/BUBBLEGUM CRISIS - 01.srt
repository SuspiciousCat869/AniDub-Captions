who say the really love the police.

171
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,932
- Well, people might like you better

172
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,134
if you actually helped them out once in a while.

173
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,236
Here, throw this away.

174
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,039
- [Leon] If I do, will you have dinner with me sometime?

175
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,943
- [Priss] Go cuddle with your Boomers, cop.

176
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,045
Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky.

177
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,282
- Hmm.

178
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,138
- Commander, these are the Knight Sabers.

179
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,107
- [Commander] So are they mercenaries?

180
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,942
- [Man] At least partially.

181
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,312
Their goals are unknown, but our intelligence suggests

182
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,747
they do accept commissions.

183
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,885
- [Commander] To think that such suits actually exist.

184
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,856
I would very much like to acquire them for analysis.

185
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,027
- You mean you want to hire them, sir?

186
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,664
- We can't let it become public knowledge

187
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:23,402
that this latest fiasco involves a USSD military secret.

188
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,238
Let's offer them a job.

189
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,106
- [Man] Yes, sir.

190
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,242
- Trade friction, you say?

191
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,681
The international communities want GENOM's products so much

192
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,049
they're fighting over them.

193
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,719
That's true.

194
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:45,224
GENOM accounts for 68% of the world's cars for example.

195
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,862
Relax, military combat Boomers,

196
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,697
they are not subject to discussion.

197
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,602
The balance of trade depends on Boomer sales

198
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,104
to countries involved in the pull of war, you know.

199
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,809
They're contributing to our country's continuing prosperity,

200
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,110
and we're proud of it.

201
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:10,616
Now can I count on your support in this matter?

202
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,919
If so, I'll guarantee the prime minister's position.

203
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,891
Yes, he'll be secure, count on it.

204
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,764
- Regarding the collection you desired, sir.

205
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,034
My men have just obtained it from USSD.

206
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,772
- With those items in hand, GENOM's future is assured.

207
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,675
I would appreciate a timely delivery.

208
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,246
I trust you understand me.

209
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,916
- I believe I can make it available to you

210
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,818
within 24 hours, sir.

211
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,390
- Mason, I'll leave this in your hands.

212
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,793
But don't forget that GENOM is a respectable company.

213
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,563
It would be unfortunate if our name

214
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,965
were to surface even slightly.

215
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,134
- Yes, sir, I'm aware of that, sir.

216
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,915
(water splashing)

217
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,272
(phone ringing)

218
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,308
- [Man] Hello, Uisu Laboratory

219
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,177
- Good evening. - Oh, good evening.

220
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,912
Chief, it's your daughter.

221
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,449
- Hello, is that you, Daddy?

222
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,784
- What's the matter, Sylia?

223
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,887
It's the middle of the night.

224
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,156
Why are you still up?

225
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,291
- It's been a whole week, Daddy.

226
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,793
When are you coming home?

227
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,529
I'm all right, but Mackie's feeling kind of lonely.

228
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,231
- [Katsuhito] I understand, Sylia.

229
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,400
You know I'm doing some very important research

230
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,235
right now, don't you?

231
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,603
- [Sylia] Yes.

232
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,972
- [Katsuhito] Be patient just a little longer.

233
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,475
- Secondary power source is online, sir.

234
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,177
- [Katsuhito] Set output logging to 10 hertz

235
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,311
and inject power.

236
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,752
This is only a simple prototype, but it's clear

237
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,988
that this technology will have endless applications.

238
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,627
(sirens blaring)

239
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,697
(explosions booming)

240
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,937
(Sylia gasps)

241
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,282
- Sis, this just came for you.

242
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,352
- Hmm, a data unit.

243
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:04,656
For me?

244
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,065
(Sylia gasps)

245
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,623
(bird chirping)

246
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,301
(bird chirping)

247
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,003
All right already.

248
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,505
(Sylia yawns)

249
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,710
(tranquil music)

250
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,694
- [Mackie] Sis, ready or not, here I come.

251
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,464
- Quiet, it's still early.

252
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,998
- Which paper are you reading?

253
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,167
Here, get a load of this.

254
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,137
- [Sylia] A job offer.

255
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,672
- [Mackie] You betcha.

256
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,208
- To the Knight Sabers, a consultation is requested.

257
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:39,118
(blow thudding) (Mackie groans)

258
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,293
- Oh (giggles).

259
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,630
Wow, look at this, isn't it radical?

260
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,999
- Save it for later, work comes first.

261
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:54,833
- Huh?

262
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,907
- Good afternoon, ladies, may I help you?

263
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,275
- [Linna] Do we have a job?

264
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,377
- [Sylia] How about something like this?

265
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,645
- [Nene] Oh, let's see.

266
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,381
- [Linna] Wow, 20 million up front.

267
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,215
(Nene gasps)

268
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,617
- Quiet.

269
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,685
- I mean, do these panties go for 20 million?

270
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,020
- Brilliant recovery.

271
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,830
- Have you finished investigating the client?

272
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,831
- [Sylia] It's USSD.

273
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,067
- USSD, the space defense force?

274
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,037
- This is a bunch of bullshit.

275
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,339
There has got to be a catch somewhere.

276
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,174
- You're right.

277
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:37,643
- [Linna] But I think that since we have an offer,

278
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,810
we should take it.

279
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,512
It's work after all.

280
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,782
- On the other hand, it just might be a trap.

281
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,686
- [Linna] That's true.

282
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,054
- What do we do, Sylia?

283
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,857
- I think there's merit in both your viewpoints.

284
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,659
We need to know the details of the job

285
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,827
and what they're really after.

286
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,997
Anyway, let's contact them right away.

287
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,499
Nene. - Hm?

288
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,501
- You're through with work for the day, aren't you?

289
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,669
Come with me.

290
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,503
- Okay.

291
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,107
- Hey, what's this? - What's going on?

292
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,943
- [Passenger] Watch your heavy metal.

293
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,544
- [Nene] Was getting on the bus dressed like this

294
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,079
really a good idea?

295
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,815
- [Sylia] You know what they say, dress for success.

296
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,318
(Nene groans)

297
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,328
Good afternoon.

298
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,901
- Huh, who are you?

299
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,169
- [Nene] Good afternoon.

300
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,205
- Combat suits, what do you want?

301
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,740
- [Sylia] We're the Knight Sabers.

302
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,376
We're here at the commander's invitation.

303
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,611
- What?

304
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,046
Hang on a second, I'm checking this out.

305
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,315
Hello, this is gate two.

306
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,185
I've got people claiming to be the Knight Sabers.

307
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,287
Yes, yes, that's right.

308
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,789
Huh?

309
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,124
Yes, sir.

310
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,726
My apologies.

311
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,628
The commander is waiting for you.

312
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,962
- See. - Yup.

313
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,431
- [Man] Sir, the Knight Sabers are here.

314
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,433
- [Commander] Ah, send them in.

315
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,267
- Huh?

316
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,639
Do you always dress like that?

317
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,375
- [Sylia] Of course, it's a dangerous world we live in.

318
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:20,345
- What, a woman?

319
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,214
- [Nene] Well, not even wearing armor can hide

320
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,316
these measurements, see what I mean?

321
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,755
- Ah, but they perform so wonderfully, don't they?

322
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,790
And they're so beautiful.

323
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,258
Ah, pardon me.

324
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,361
Since we are tentatively offering you a job,

325
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,597
we did a little research first.

326
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,233
To be frank, your suits are superior

327
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,468
to our own K-12 armored troopers.

328
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:50,208
They provide superb protection at a low mass penalty

329
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,077
and augment your agility.

330
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,379
Now what guarantee do we have that you'll keep the details

331
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,782
of this job confidential?

332
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,785
- [Sylia] Discretion is an essential part of our service.

333
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,621
If you don't trust us, don't hire us.

334
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,523
(Commander laughs)

335
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,490
- Quite right.

336
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,324
Let me explain.

337
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,663
FG Frederick, age 25, a computer technician with USSD.

338
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,802
Name Cynthia, age six.

339
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,804
I want you to find these two for me.

340
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,739
- [Nene] Tracking down missing persons?

341
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,708
What's so special about this girl?

342
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,209
- Well, you see--

343
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,744
- [Sylia] Okay, fine.

344
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:29,715
But I can't believe this is a mere missing persons search.

345
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,483
- The girl was abducted yesterday,

346
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,352
and our investigation indicates that the abduction

347
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,322
was performed by a group of Boomers.

348
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,957
And Boomers are your specialty.

349
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,759
- [Sylia] What else do you know?

350
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,928
- [Man] Well, we think Frederick infiltrated us on some

351
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,731
unknown person's orders and, as a member of our staff,

352
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,033
was able to mastermind the operation.

353
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,369
- [Sylia] Then this Frederick is a Boomer too?

354
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,137
- [Man] That's something we can't confirm now.

355
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,638
- [Man] Bring up the temperature display.

356
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,640
- [Sylia] So what are they after?

357
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,845
- Well, they demand to know the secrets of an exotic weapon

358
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,913
which holds the key to our nation's defense.

359
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,415
- [Sylia] The ion particle beam platforms?

360
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,683
- You know of them?

361
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,184
- [Sylia] Range versus target alignment error

362
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,719
10 to the negative 10th.

363
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,156
Capable of destroying an area up to 1,000-kilometer radius.

364
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,657
- [Commander] You are good.

365
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,926
- [Sylia] It disgusts me to think that there are over 200

366
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,529
of those things floating over my head.

367
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:21,433
- Yes, but you certainly understand that they are necessary

368
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,802
for national security.

369
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,604
As you know, even third world countries

370
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,473
possess satellite weapons, so the IPBPs--

371
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,108
are a regrettable-- - Sylia, that's no ordinary

372
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,510
camera pointing at us, look. - But necessary evil.

373
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,378
Without them it'd be impossible to maintain

374
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,280
the balance of power. (gun zapping)

375
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,381
(static buzzing)

376
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,582
- Whoa, please, please, wait.

377
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,451
We apologize, honestly, you must forgive us.

378
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,086
We really do want to hire you for this.

379
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,555
- Yes, in fact if you can discover who is behind

380
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,425
the abduction, we'll pay you an additional 20 million.

381
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,465
- [Sylia] We're not being tailed, are we?

382
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,534
- [Nene] Looks safe, but heaven knows.

383
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,172
(ominous music)

384
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,148
- [Sylia] It's getting so you so can't

385
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,983
trust anybody these days.

386
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,385
(laser buzzing)

387
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,586
What are you doing?

388
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,889
- [Nene] Letting them know what I think.

389
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,229
(computer beeping)

390
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,311
- [Sylia] We add together last night's Boomer rampage

391
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:43,982
down 42nd Street and this new job, what do we get, Nene?

392
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,451
- [Nene] I wonder if that Boomer wasn't a decoy

393
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,687
meant to confuse the AD Police.

394
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,156
- [Sylia] Based on our analysis of the AD Police data

395
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,593
Nene's gathered and our quarry's movements last night,

396
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,495
for the time being we'll concentrate

397
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,164
on Districts 10, 11, and 12.

398
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,299
Okay, let's get started.

399
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,401
Remember to check in frequently,

400
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,805
and don't attempt any rescue alone.

401
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,740
- [Priss] All right, already.

402
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,343
(upbeat music)

403
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,017
- [Man] Never seen 'em before.

404
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,187
Did the old man and the brat run out on you? (laughs)

405
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,588
- It's not like that at all.

406
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,831
(dramatic music)

407
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,400
- Someone's looking for you and Cynthia.

408
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,835
- Thanks for the information.

409
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:42,908
- It was a woman, not a bad-looking woman either.

410
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,810
What, out of brew?

411
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,913
Who do you think she is, Bogey?

412
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,848
- [Bogey] I don't know.

413
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,685
How about we take her for a ride and let her tell us?

414
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,174
(door creaks) (Priss gasps)

415
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,776
- Just who the hell are you?

416
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,013
(Bogey laughs) Boomers.

417
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:26,851
(blow thuds) (Priss groans)

418
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,254
- Who the hell is she, AD Police?

419
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,657
- No, Bogey, I don't think that she's the police.

420
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,892
- [Bogey] Fine with me.

421
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:34,926
We'll get it out of her in due time

422
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,895
when we get to Aqua City.

423
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:37,729
- Aqua City.

424
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,937
- [Bogey] The others are probably there already.

425
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,974
- Yeah. (dramatic music)

426
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,713
(metal crunching)

427
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,849
(glass shattering)

428
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,552
(Priss groaning)

429
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,756
- Ow, shit.

430
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,359
Don't you assholes even know how to have an accident?

431
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,395
(explosions booming)

432
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,863
Thanks for the directions.

433
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,403
(Priss gasps)

434
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,604
I'll bring it back.

435
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,121
(jets humming)

436
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:51,236
(tires squealing) - Boomer.

437
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,972
(sirens blaring)

438
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,782
(engine revving)

439
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,555
- [Sylia] Here you go.

440
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,293
- Oh no, no more for me.

441
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,128
My stomach's gurgling.

442
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,998
- Do you think something's happened to Priss?

443
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,300
- [Sylia] She is a little late, isn't she?

444
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,935
- [Nene] That's typical.

445
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,172
- How many times have I told her to call in regularly?

446
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,009
She just doesn't listen.

447
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:31,943
(static buzzing)

448
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:35,380
- Nothing, just patrol messages.

449
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,716
Looks like the Boomers have the night off.

450
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,485
Hold on. (static buzzing)

451
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,886
- [Officer] Calling station one.

452
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,789
This is ADP 102 calling station one.

453
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,493
I'm in pursuit of a Boomer on route K-5 heading for R-51.

454
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,296
Subjects are a C-Class Boomer and a racing bike.

455
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,332
- A racing bike?

456
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,934
That must be Priss.

457
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:59,104
R-51, that's Aqua City.

458
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,605
Let's check it out.

459
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,974
- [Sylia] No, it could be anyone, not just Priss.

460
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,175
- That's true.

461
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,277
All we can is wait for her to contact us.

462
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,080
- [Nene] But if it is Priss, she won't have her suit.

463
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,483
- She could be in trouble.

464
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,351
Damn, this worries me. - Mhm.

465
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,820
- If only she'd hurry up and give us a call.

466
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,654
- Mhm.

467
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,693
- Sis?

468
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,196
Yeah. (girls laugh)

469
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:30,201
(tires squealing) (sirens blaring)

470
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,340
(ominous music)

471
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,847
(gun clicking)

472
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,209
(footsteps pattering)

473
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:42,207
- Hmm, a map of Tokyo.

474
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:46,911
Cynthia, don't be frightened.

475
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:47,912
Are you Cynthia?

476
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,615
- Mhm, who are you, lady?

477
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:55,553
- I'm Priss, I've come to rescue you.

478
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,423
Oh look, you've gotten your clothes all dirty.

479
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,458
Are you alone? - Uh huh.

480
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,961
- [Priss] Well, is anyone else here?

481
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,929
- Uh, I don't know.

482
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,467
Look at this, lady.

483
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,269
- [Priss] Huh, what the?

484
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,838
I've seen that drawing somewhere before.

485
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,373
- I did that.

486
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,374
- Oh, I see.

487
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,543
Well, you're very talented.

488
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,578
Come on, let's go home.

489
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,581
I'm sure your mom and papa must be worried about you.

490
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,650
- I have no such people.

491
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,851
- What the, huh?

492
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,321
What the hell's going on here?

493
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,760
(footstep echoing)

494
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,765
(Priss gasps) (dramatic music)

495
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,292
(engines revving)

496
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:12,297
(blow thudding) (Priss groans)

497
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:16,301
(Priss shouts)

498
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,805
(Priss groaning)

499
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,542
- (laughs) My, my you actually managed to scratch him.

500
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,277
We ought to make you pay for the repairs.

501
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,079
- How about I roast her?

502
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,150
- [Woman] Hold it, after she's told us who she works for.

503
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,151
- Why bother?

504
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,352
Let's just kill her now.

505
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,323
(gun clicking)

506
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,558
(gunshots banging)

507
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,061
(woman shouting)

508
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:48,066
(gunshots banging) (woman groaning)

509
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,444
(Priss gasps)

510
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,515
(woman retches)

511
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,918
- You've got one round left.

512
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,086
You gonna use it?

513
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,291
Looks like you're gonna have to foot the bill

514
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,627
for fixing me too. (laughs)

515
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,277
(Priss breathes heavily)

516
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,648
So you still don't wanna talk, eh?

517
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,852
Soon you won't be able to, even if you wanted to.

518
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,154
- We've shown you nothing but kindness,

519
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,556
but you still won't chat, eh?

520
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,424
- Oh, it's you.

521
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,194
- That's right, the man you've been looking for.

522
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:54,699
Seems they told you I was a computer technician, but--

523
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,234
- You're a Boomer too.

524
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,403
Why'd you choose that girl for this project?

525
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:00,872
- [Frederick] Apparently you know

526
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,173
nothing at all about Cynthia.

527
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:04,642
- What?

528
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,011
- [Frederick] I don't know which

529
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:07,979
intelligence agency sent you.

530
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,680
But if you don't intend to talk,

531
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,716
your usefulness is at an end.

532
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,051
(Priss groaning)

533
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:13,885
- Lady?

534
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,854
(woman laughs)

535
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,690
(gunshot booming)

536
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,133
(upbeat music)

537
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,170
- Who the hell are you?

538
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,971
- [Sylia] The Knight Sabers.

539
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,541
- So what, are we supposed to be impressed by that?

540
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:51,089
(explosion booming)

541
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,594
(explosion booming)

542
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,202
(metal clanging)

543
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,138
(Boomers thudding)

544
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,043
- Oh, not bad

545
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,244
I'd say you're superior

546
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,313
to the military's K-12 armored troopers.

547
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,215
You really did a number on my friends.

548
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,984
What do you hope to accomplish?

549
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,886
- [Sylia] To defend peace and justice

550
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,254
and rid the world of evil.

551
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,225
- A worthy objective,

552
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,027
but to achieve it you must first defeat me.

553
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,931
(dramatic music)

554
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,640
- [Sylia] Get the girl out of here, hurry.

555
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,142
- After them, don't let them get away.

556
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:48,045
(gunshots booming)

557
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,149
(Frederick laughs)

558
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:56,354
(gunshot banging) (Frederick shouts)

559
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,257
(Frederick laughs)

560
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:10,201
(gunshot banging)

561
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,408
- Well, Priss, I guess this means our date is on.

562
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,977
- Cut the crap, I just want to get the hell out of here.

563
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,345
Which way?

564
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,414
- Uh oh, go that way.

565
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,449
- Thanks. - Yeah.

566
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,419
(Boomer roaring)

567
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,322
(gunshots banging)

568
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,733
(ground rumbling)

569
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:51,976
- Oh, damn.

570
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,546
- Lady, oh, help!

571
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,515
- Cynthia!

572
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,484
Damn it!

573
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,387
(explosion booming)

574
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,188
- What the?

575
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,128
- [Sylia] This is a Boomer?

576
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,698
- [Nene] That's impossible!

577
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,800
- Priss, what happened?

578
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,102
Get in, I've got a med kit in front.

579
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,174
Priss, what are you...

580
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,008
Hey.

581
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,979
(Sylia groaning)

582
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:36,153
You won't stand a chance in your condition.

583
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,855
(dramatic music)

584
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,858
(explosion booming)

585
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,433
- I went to a lot of trouble to find her.

586
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,770
I will bring her back.

587
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,477
(ground rumbling)

588
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,049
- [Sylia] All of Aqua City is becoming part of his matrix.

589
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,183
It's hopeless.

590
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,227
(Boomer roaring)

591
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,898
- Looks like the Knight Sabers have bitten off

592
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,099
more than they can chew.

593
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,504
- [Priss] Sylia, did you miss me?

594
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,571
- [Sylia] Priss.

595
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,973
- [Priss] Here I go.

596
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:30,908
- [Sylia] Go for it.

597
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:40,384
(explosion booming)

598
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,968
(metal crunching)

599
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,013
(metal crunching)

600
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:16,020
(gunshot banging)

601
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,923
(gunshots banging)

602
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,661
(explosion booming)

603
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:27,298
(Boomer groaning)

604
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,666
- [Nene] We did it.

605
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,234
- [Sylia] You okay?

606
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,545
(Cynthia screams)

607
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,625
(computer beeping)

608
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,293
- [Linna] What's with that chopper?

609
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,229
- GENOM. - GENOM, hm?

610
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,065
- [Linna] It's Cynthia, she's a Boomer.

611
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,773
(dramatic music)

612
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,153
(laser zapping)

613
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,790
(explosion booming)

614
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,525
- [Sylia] The satellite weapons.

615
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,160
- Help me!

616
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,229
(explosions booming)

617
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,924
(water rushing)

618
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,842
- Hey hey, do you suppose we can collect the balance

619
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,076
under the circumstances?

620
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:21,912
- That's right.

621
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,315
- Don't you realize how serious this is?

622
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,583
- Oh, I realize.

623
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,518
20 million, 20.

624
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,987
- [Priss] That's not what I mean.

625
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,055
- [Linna] What do you mean then?

626
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,057
We're talking 20 million here.

627
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,226
- [Nene] I'm exhausted.

628
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,329
- Okay, let's get out of here.

629
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,853
(Leon breathing heavily)

630
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,556
- Priss!

631
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,364
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

632
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,234
I mean for our first date.

633
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,737
- I wasn't waiting for you.

634
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,238
- Say no more.

635
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,406
Let's go out to dinner.

636
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,675
How about it?

637
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:25,876
- You actually did something

638
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,811
that helped people for a change.

639
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:28,646
Thanks.

640
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,981
- Hey, where you going?

641
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,785
I wonder if she's a...

642
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:38,789
Oh well.

643
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,559
