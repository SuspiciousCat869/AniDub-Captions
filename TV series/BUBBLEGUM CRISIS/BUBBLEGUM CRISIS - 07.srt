It's time for today's spotlight corner.

Today we introduce a new record by Vision and her band,

00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,803
The Revengers, who are back on the scene

8
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,605
breaking a year long silence.

9
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,073
It's rocketing up the charts faster

10
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,207
than mercury in midsummer.

11
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,009
I'm telling you this one is hot.

12
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,544
It's the one you've been waiting for.

- Mr. Chairman, Genom and Gulf and Bradley

65
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,762
will each investigate 50% of the capital,

66
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,263
and the patents will all be

67
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,732
the joint property of both parties.

68
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,503
- This contract appears to be in order.

69
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,505
Continue, Mr. Yamada.

70
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,041
- As regards to the joint development,

71
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,376
Gulf and Bradley's development department

72
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,412
will have charge of the endoskeleton

73
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,981
and the mode of power systems.

74
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,950
And Genom will have charge of the defensive armor

75
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,119
and the offensive weapons systems.

76
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,623
Of course, the ultimate head of development

77
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,059
will be your own Dr. McLaren.

78
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,093
- Well, Doctor?

79
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,799
- Gentlemen, the research facilities

80
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,233
have already been completed.

81
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,135
If you will please observe.

82
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,140
We have assembled the very best

83
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,676
of Genom's scientific know-how.

84
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,647
The laboratory can be up and operational in one month.

85
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,050
- That's just fine, Mr. Yamada.

86
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,120
We have absolutely no objection.

87
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,755
- Thank you, sir.

88
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,759
We eagerly await your arrival in Japan, Doctor.

89
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,194
- I'm looking forward to it too,

90
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,897
so I can meet some beautiful geisha girls.

91
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,800
(chuckling loudly)

92
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,041
- Mr. Yamada, is he by any chance?

93
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,144
- Yes, sir, the Model 55-C boomer

94
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,246
is Genom's bestselling product.

95
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:24,317
- Our new modals should do even better once its finished.

96
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,991
(water splashing)

97
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,962
Give my regards to Mr. Quincy.

98
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,766
(electricity buzzing)

99
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,600
- What?

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,369
(dramatic music)

101
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,275
- Go.

102
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,548
(gun firing)

103
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,961
(gasps deeply)

104
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,142
(men gasping deeply)

105
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,482
(deep gasping)

106
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,766
(heavy breathing)

107
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,470
- What the?

108
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,106
Oh, hell!

109
00:07:59,078 --> 00:07:59,912
Help!

110
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,620
- Chopper three here.

111
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,722
Incident at the Gulf and Bradley building.

112
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:10,923
Emergency dispatch.

113
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,036
- Oh, god.

114
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,539
(tires screeching)

115
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,041
(guns firing)

116
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:49,495
(helicopter blades roaring)

117
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,769
(emergency siren blaring)

118
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,646
- [Officer] Let's see him through.

119
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,222
- Where is the assailant?

120
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,890
- It appears to have fled to the river.

121
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,393
We've extended the dragnet out to 20 miles.

122
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,496
- That's thinning it out, but we've got no choice.

123
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,264
What does our survivor have to say?

124
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,734
- He says he couldn't see the attacker's face at all.

125
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,904
Also, he has no idea who it could've been.

126
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,907
- Probably because there are too many possibilities.

127
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,309
- Huh?

128
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,611
- The victim was a chairman of a major concern.

129
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,713
There'd be as many people with scores to settle

130
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,648
as there are stars in the sky.

131
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,684
- [Detective] Then the other victims were just collateral?

132
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,052
- [Captain] Could be.

133
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,322
(plane engine roaring)

134
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,334
- [Kou] How about this, Madam?

135
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,401
- Thank you.

136
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,937
- Tokyo is only 30 minutes away.

137
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:05,771
- Oh.

138
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,383
- Is something worrying you?

139
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,654
- I'm scared, Kou.

140
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,392
I'm not afraid that I might die,

141
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:30,529
but I'm terrified of what I'm trying to do now.

142
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,432
- We can still turn back.

143
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:37,269
- Uh-uh, I decided on this myself.

144
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,739
I don't intend to turn back.

145
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,374
I don't intend to quit, but.

146
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,382
(plane engine roaring)

147
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,425
- Miss Vision, could you tell us

148
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,894
about your first impressions of Tokyo?

149
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,162
- I'm not really sure.

150
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,064
I just got here yesterday.

151
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,332
(reporters laughing)

152
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,167
I'll be able to give a more meaningful answer

153
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,602
when I finish this tour.

154
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:13,572
- Why did you come here a whole week before your concert?

155
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,108
- Because there are several places I want to visit.

156
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,444
- Miss Vision, may I inquire as to why

157
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,546
you've suddenly gone back on live tour?

158
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,884
- Because I want to present new emotions with my music.

159
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,752
- New emotions, ma'am?

160
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:31,490
- Yes, I want to sing about all kinds of human emotion,

161
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,495
laughter, despair, joy, grief, regret,

162
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:42,768
anger, malice all types of emotions.

163
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,771
- Word is that after her press conference,

164
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,573
Miss Vision disappeared as usual.

165
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,109
Let's switch briefly to Mrs. Nakamura in Shibuya.

166
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,511
Miss Nakamura? - Hi, this is Nakamura.

167
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,313
Will you take a look at this line?

168
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,015
Isn't it incredible?

169
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,484
It's made up of Vision's fans who are all here

170
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,553
to buy advanced tickets for her concert.

171
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,054
Some of them have been here all night.

172
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,790
Excuse me, Miss, how long have you been in this line?

173
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,158
- Since 3:00 a.m.

174
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,027
- Do you like Vision?

175
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,495
- Oh, you bet.

176
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,732
I've got all her CDs and LDs starting with her debut.

177
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,501
I'm a big, big, big, big fan.

178
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,136
- Give me a break.

179
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,138
You only buy them because she's popular.

180
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,339
- You don't like her?

181
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,342
- It's not her singing.

182
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,611
It's her marketing technique that gets me.

183
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,047
She's nothing more than a question mark.

184
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,149
Who's she supposed to be Batman?

185
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,186
- [Nene] Kind of takes after you, doesn't she, Priss.

186
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,254
- [Priss] Is that so?

187
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,125
- Earth to Linna are you with us?

188
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,295
- I feel like I've met this singer Vision somewhere before.

189
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,365
- No way, it must have been someone

190
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,200
who was just trying to look like her.

191
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,180
(boat whistle blowing)

192
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,220
(machine whirring)

193
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,524
- How much longer, Shin?

194
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,192
- Two more hours.

195
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,560
- We move out at midnight,

196
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,629
and listen if anything goes wrong,

197
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,932
put Miss Reika's personal safety first and act accordingly.

198
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,534
Protect her with your lives.

199
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,935
Don't worry about me at all.

200
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,908
(gentle music)

201
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,850
- Dear, Reika, how are you?

202
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,053
I think, I mentioned my engagement in my last letter.

203
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,890
Well, the top news this time is this.

204
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,425
He gave it to me.

205
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,394
Pretty nice design, don't you think?

206
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,463
I told him about you.

207
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,066
He says he'd really like to meet you.

208
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,835
Well, in other news.

209
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,839
Some friends through a bachelorette party for me.

210
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,307
Here are some snapshots.

211
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,311
Everyone picked on me,

212
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,613
and I got teased a lot.

213
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,783
But it was really a fun party.

214
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,920
It looks like we'll be postponing the wedding date.

215
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,523
But I'll let you know as soon as it's set,

216
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,760
so please attend even if you have to break a concert date.

217
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,631
I'm hoping grandfather, Kou, and all the rest will come too.

218
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,932
Well, that's all for now.

219
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,735
Goodbye, Sis, I love you.

220
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,570
(gun cocking)

221
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,139
(gasps deeply)

222
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,612
- You took three seconds, Madam.

223
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,514
In a real situation that would've been enough to kill you.

224
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,418
Well, first of all, not noticing my footsteps

225
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,287
showed a lack of attention.

226
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,725
- [Reika] Kou, if you were to give me a score for this,

227
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,730
what would it be, say 50 out of a possible hundred?

228
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,198
- [Kou] About a 20, I think.

229
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,102
(engine revving)

230
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,348
(dramatic music)

231
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,054
(yawns deeply)

232
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,744
- [Scientist] Dr. McLaren,

233
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,946
the rate of epidermal cell adhesion is tapering off.

234
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,916
- It's a sign that it's nearly complete.

235
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,153
Damn shame.

236
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,855
Looking at it makes me think that strength

237
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,091
and ugliness must go hand in hand.

238
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,830
- A regular modern day Frankenstein's monster, huh?

239
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,365
(alert beeping)

240
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,368
(suspenseful music)

241
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,938
- Emergency in Block 24!

242
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,873
All personnel evacuate the area.

243
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,049
- The outer wall is too think.

244
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,151
We'll use one of the walk ways to get in.

245
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:26,985
- Roger.

246
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,424
- The intruder is heading for walkway number two.

247
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,730
- Someone's in the walkway.

248
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,165
- Shoot could get him. - No.

249
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,400
- Miss Reika. - No, Kou.

250
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,936
I can't shoot him.

251
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,557
- I've seen enough.

252
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,728
Damage? - Nine boomers

253
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,997
and four areas of structural damage.

254
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,299
Fortunately, no serious injuries.

255
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,101
Test models also undamaged.

256
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,337
Intruder has escaped and disappeared.

257
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,874
- [Quincy] Is this machine the same as the one in Houston?

258
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,108
- Absolutely.

259
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,278
Mr. Quincy, I'm returning to Texas.

260
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,113
The boomer is nearly complete.

261
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,015
I'm no longer needed here!

262
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,483
- No you won't.

263
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,486
You'll remain here until all the tests are completed.

264
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,456
I have a general idea who it was.

265
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,324
It must be the Chang group.

266
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,127
- [Man In Blue] You mean, Hou Bang?

267
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,930
Could they be after the new boomer?

268
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,731
- Probably.

269
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,234
Dr. McLaren, not to worry.

270
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,236
You are not the target.

271
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,338
Take some R and R for a week or so.

272
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,648
- Get a load of this.

273
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,750
There's nothing left.

274
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,257
- Looks like a ceramic blast proof overlay.

275
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:17,229
- Wait a minute please!

276
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,864
I can't let you in here!

277
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,000
- A.D. Police let me check around.

278
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,172
- I trust you have a search warrant.

279
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,944
Our company does have its secrets.

280
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,247
Entry into this section is forbidden to outside personnel.

281
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:37,850
- Hmm?

282
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,688
Well, all I can see is you look like

283
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,022
you're trying to hide something.

284
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,591
You know what I mean?

285
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,226
- What might that be?

286
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,928
- Something in violation of the law

287
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,631
like maybe a new type of boomer?

288
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,233
- You can't be serious.

289
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,369
May I remind you that we're the victims.

290
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,470
- Victims, huh?

291
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,007
- Put me down.

292
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,085
- Looks like a little overkill, don't you think?

293
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,155
(scientist groaning)

294
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,226
(carnival goers screaming)

295
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,564
- [Sylia] You think you're Harry Lime

296
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,633
choosing a place like this for a meeting.

297
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,703
- Just a little change of atmosphere, Sylia.

298
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,207
Besides we won't have to worry about eavesdroppers up here.

299
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,776
- So what's the job?

300
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,414
- Complete details are on the data disk.

301
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,916
I'll just hit the highlights.

302
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,885
An executive of a certain corporation

303
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,321
came to Japan at Genom's invitation.

304
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,790
The job is body guarding that bigwig.

305
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,526
- Body guarding someone associated with Genom?

306
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,328
That doesn't sit well with me.

307
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,263
- The fee is 50 million,

308
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,364
30 in advance,

309
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,366
20 on successful completion.

310
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,135
- Alright, I suppose.

311
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:07,239
- [Male] Now whoever is after him is extremely tough.

312
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,841
I hear they took out a boomer with one shot.

313
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,178
It may be a body guarding job.

314
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,247
But you'll be risking your life.

315
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,982
Please be as careful as you can.

316
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,253
Your body guarding must be in secret nothing overt.

317
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,922
This is an insist request of the client Mr. McLaren.

318
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,596
- Drop the investigation!

319
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,699
What the hell does that mean?

320
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,167
Just tell me why?

321
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,870
- Upstairs said I had to remove you.

322
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,673
I don't know anymore than that either.

323
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,544
- Genom's putting on the pressure again, huh?

324
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,245
Look, Chief, there's more to this

325
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,281
than just some terrorist attack.

326
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,716
We've gotta check out Genom.

327
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,585
- Here brought you something. - What's your problem?

328
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,555
- Tickets to the Vision concert!

329
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,856
- [Naoko] Right.

330
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,326
- Wow, front row seats.

331
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,195
- These were not easy to get.

332
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,330
- [Nene] Thank you.

333
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,000
- Look I'm not dropping this case, you got that!

334
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,403
(door slamming)

335
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,237
- Daley.

336
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,576
I hereby place Detectives Daley Wong

337
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,812
and Leon McNichol on two weeks paid leave.

338
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,115
They are absolutely forbidden to work,

339
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,251
investigatively or otherwise.

340
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,422
- Yes, sir, Chief.

341
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,158
- And try not to let that hothead boil over.

342
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,126
Just be careful.

343
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,441
(engine sputtering)

344
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,417
- Here we are.

345
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,217
- Huh?

346
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,458
- [Daley] It's big isn't it?

347
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,928
- [Leon] Even a low ball estimate of its cost

348
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,897
would be about 700 billion.

349
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,238
- What the hell is Genom planning to build here?

350
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,841
Their answer to Disneyland maybe?

351
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,676
- Well, I don't see Mickey Mouse anywhere.

352
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,412
(Daley chuckles)

353
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,850
Well, well, well.

354
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,152
- What do you see Snow White?

355
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,353
- [Leon] No, more like someone who'd make her

356
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,022
eat the poisoned happen.

357
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,125
Chairman Quincy himself has come out to see the job site.

358
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,897
- So where to now, Leon?

359
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,399
- The St. Regis Hotel.

360
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,137
- There go our paychecks.

361
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,306
- We're not gonna check in.

362
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,540
- Makes no difference.

363
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,776
Even a cup of coffee there cost two or 3,000.

364
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,387
(Priss sighing)

365
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,323
- This is a drag it's like being in a steam bath.

366
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,624
- We had to get a room from which

367
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,826
we could monitor the hotel, Priss.

368
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,561
It's just for a little longer.

369
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,763
- I know that.

370
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,665
It's just not easy sitting in a hot room

371
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,869
watching people lounge around a pool having drinks.

372
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,638
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,640
- [Priss] He's just a dirty old pervert.

374
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,510
Be careful he doesn't jump you, Nene.

375
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,912
- Here you go, sir, one Blue Hawaii.

376
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,749
- [McLaren] Arigato, Little Miss.

377
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,850
- [Priss] Sylia, I should've gotten

378
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,552
to infiltrate the hotel too.

379
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,524
- What's this, 5th floor, coffee shop, window seat?

380
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,358
- What is it?

381
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,096
Leon what's he doing here?

382
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,765
- There seems to be more to this job than meets the eye.

383
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,467
Things are getting interesting.

384
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,504
- You figure it out? - Yeah.

385
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,840
When our expert analyzed the photos,

386
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,009
he said the tower was a production factory,

387
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,145
and the city-like area was a mock battle stage.

388
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,947
- For boomers? - Yep.

389
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,216
A performance testing round.

390
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,851
- Things are getting interesting.

391
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,328
- Room service I've brought the champagne you ordered.

392
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,936
Good evening, sir.

393
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,410
- Yes, this is St. Regis Hotel room 2011.

394
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,545
No, not another blonde.

395
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,648
I think an Oriental this evening.

396
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,649
Make sure she's young.

397
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,884
- Yes, sir.

398
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:49,120
We'll send you an incomparable beauty.

399
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,222
Oh, about 17.

400
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,924
(machine beeping)

401
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,826
- Sylia, do you read me?

402
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,262
Looks like he's ordered up another call girl for tonight.

403
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,530
Nothing else to report.

404
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,366
- [Sylia] Roger continue surveillance.

405
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,200
- Okay.

406
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,008
- [Priss] After we went to all the trouble,

407
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,310
to buy off the hotel manager.

408
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,080
We should've put concealed cameras and microphones in there.

409
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,550
- We couldn't intrude on the client's privacy now, could we?

410
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,519
- But just having him wear a transmitter isn't good enough.

411
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,524
- Priss, I don't think the enemy wants to assassinate him.

412
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,358
- Huh?

413
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,761
- There were plenty of opportunities to kill McLaren

414
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,463
during the Texas incident last March,

415
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,365
but the attackers didn't do so.

416
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,667
Now don't you think that's kind of strange?

417
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,937
Then there's this unofficial FBI report.

418
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,072
Last December the U.S. Department of Defense held

419
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,609
a competition for the purpose of introducing new weapons.

420
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,478
Six companies, including Genom

421
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,346
and Gulf and Bradley competed.

422
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,616
When it was over, the winner was a GD-42,

423
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,219
a combat robot build by Qusai Industries,

424
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,954
of which Chang is chairman.

425
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,526
Formed from a base of Asian American immigrants,

426
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:04,429
the Chang conglomerate has had a antagonistic relationship

427
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,599
with Gulf and Bradley for over a decade.

428
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,567
- Well, why is that?

429
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,837
- Chang's son and daughter-in-law died 15 years ago.

430
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,473
- It seems to have been a murder

431
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,342
made to look like a traffic accident.

432
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,545
Gulf and Bradley were thought to have been behind it,

433
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,014
but they were not found guilty due to lack of evidence.

434
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,150
According to reports, Genom and Gulf and Bradley,

435
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,286
entered into their partnership this past January.

436
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,855
- So the Chang group is responsible?

437
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:35,160
- Maybe, but if so why did they wait 15 years for revenge?

438
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,040
(door thuds)

439
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,915
- [McLaren] What's your name?

440
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,550
- My name is Irene.

441
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,085
- That's a nice name.

442
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,497
(McLaren chuckles)

443
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,599
- Pretty good for a man his age.

444
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,935
This is the fourth night in a row.

445
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:17,902
- Tell me about it.

446
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,842
(McLaren moans)

447
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,678
(dramatic music)

448
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,181
- He suddenly clutched his chest moaning in pain.

449
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:37,122
- That's why he should've been more concerned about his age.

450
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,490
(dramatic music)

451
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,924
- They just left the room.

452
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,960
Looks like they're taking him to the hospital.

453
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,628
One of the bodyguards is still in the room

454
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:44,863
along with the call girl.

455
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,336
(dramatic music)

456
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:59,077
(police siren wailing)

457
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:07,952
- [Sylia] Be careful, Priss,

458
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,088
there's something funny about that ambulance.

459
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,923
- [Priss] Roger, Sylia.

460
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,604
- Hey, where are we?

461
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,239
Hey.

462
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,675
(body thuds)

463
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,578
(tires screeching)

464
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,814
(dramatic music)

465
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,782
- [Priss] Get out of the ambulance now!

466
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,142
You asshole!

467
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,514
Shit.

468
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,221
(Priss screams)

469
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,096
(machine whirring)

470
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,499
- I must have contracted Miss Reika's condition.

471
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,436
- [Paramedic] What do you mean the patient's gone?

472
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,104
Is this some kind of a joke?

473
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,540
- Why no, you see the ambulance already came.

474
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,909
- [Paramedic] What the hell does that make me?

475
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,110
- Hey, where we going?

476
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,745
- We're going back to the office?

477
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:41,880
- Then what?

478
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,848
- We open a kidnapping investigation.

479
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,078
(Priss breathing deeply)

480
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,015
- Sylia, I got whipped.

481
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,385
- Priss.

482
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,459
(gasping deeply)

483
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,195
- Why that's Irene's.

484
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,410
(gasping deeply)

485
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,812
- Dr. McLaren is kidnapped.

486
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,013
Linna goes missing

487
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,449
and to top it off, Priss gets a broken arm.

488
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,320
Everything's going wrong.

489
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,288
- Whether Linna's transmission was cut off,

490
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,957
she was near Irene's grave,

491
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:02,093
and I have a feeling there's a connection.

492
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,895
Would you check the data on Irene?

493
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:10,368
- Mm-hmm, I hope Linna's not in danger.

494
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,284
(door thuds)

495
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,522
- I'm sorry we were so rough with you.

496
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,828
You were in Irene's letters, weren't you?

497
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,696
Were you a friend of hers?

498
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,001
- You're Reika, aren't you?

499
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,636
You're Irene's older sister.

500
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,806
Just what are you trying to do?

501
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,608
Tell me Vision.

502
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,876
(gasps deeply)

503
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,444
Irene told me her sister was a singer.

504
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:56,314
I didn't recognize you at first without your makeup.

505
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,583
But you're Vision there's no doubt about it.

506
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,522
- Mr. Kou, there's a phone call for you.

507
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,490
It's Mr. Chang.

508
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,161
- [Kou] It's been quite sometime Mr. Chang.

509
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,164
- How is it going, Kou.

510
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,899
- [Kou] We have McLaren,

511
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,534
and Miss Reika is still the same.

512
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,271
- Hmm?

513
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:24,642
Well, now how is Reika's fighting performance?

514
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,844
You must tell me the truth.

515
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,346
Speak frankly.

516
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,615
- Miss Reika is soft.

517
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,684
She can't bring herself to kill people.

518
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,287
Her hatred of Miss Irene's death

519
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,856
fuels her desire for revenge, but.

520
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:42,360
- It was my beloved granddaughter's wish.

521
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,796
Even I could not refuse her.

522
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,101
I didn't want to drag here into the shadow world, but.

523
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,470
- I understand how you feel, sir.

524
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,273
- Me, I am old, and you are the only one

525
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,208
upon whom I can rely now.

526
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,011
- We will protect Miss Reika

527
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,846
even if it costs us our lives.

528
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,716
- I am counting on you, Kou.

529
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,825
(dramatic music)

530
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,628
- [Reika] The Changs have led Hou Bang for generations.

531
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,230
- [Linna] Hou Bang?

532
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,066
- [Reika] A secret society, which was the basis

533
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,535
for my grandfather's success in the world.

534
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,172
After my father died,

535
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,842
there was a void in the Hou Bang successorship.

536
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,046
But I didn't particularly care

537
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:40,051
until she, Irene, was killed by Genom.

538
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:47,058
Then I was determined that I would have vengeance.

539
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,327
First on the chairman on Gulf and Bradley

540
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,662
for killing my parents and then--

541
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,731
- You think you're going to kill Quincy

542
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,767
with McLaren as your bait?

543
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,102
- [Reika] Yes, I'll kill him.

544
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:01,372
I'll teach him about the pain he has caused us.

545
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,141
- Look doing this for Irene's sake--

546
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,309
- Won't bring her back!

547
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,611
I know that.

548
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:11,616
I know it's pointless, but it hurts so much.

549
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,219
I can't let him get away with it.

550
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,158
- Reika, what will you do after you've killed Quincy?

551
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,562
You'll become the new head of Hou Bang.

552
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,830
What about your singing?

553
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,769
- I'll quit.

554
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,205
This tour was bogus from the beginning.

555
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,475
Strange, isn't it?

556
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:41,112
Time was I hated my own clan with a passion,

557
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,681
but now I think of it with great pride.

558
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,889
- [Scientist] Fluid temperature 23 degrees centigrade.

559
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,125
Ion concentration 75%.

560
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,027
Commencing armor plating.

561
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,863
(machine beeping)

562
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,632
- Mr. Quincy. - Yes.

563
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,072
The man who abducted McLaren.

564
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,708
- Is this Quincy?

565
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,878
- [Quincy] You people went to a lot of unnecessary trouble.

566
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,379
- Unnecessary?

567
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:19,383
- The boomer is finished, and McLaren is a closed subject.

568
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,019
You can boil him, roast him, do what you like with him.

569
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,387
- Are you sure? - Quite.

570
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,690
- No one knows the new type's weaknesses

571
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,025
and limitations better than McLaren.

572
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:31,095
Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa

573
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,531
lots of people will want McLaren.

574
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:36,033
Your new type will soon be unsalable.

575
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,401
No one will want a weapon

576
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,871
that's had all its secrets exposed.

577
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,441
- Then what are you demands?

578
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,877
- [Kou] I want to deal with you face-to-face.

579
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,979
I'll give you my demands at that time.

580
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,515
- You want to meet with me personally.

581
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,149
Will I be dealing with Mr. Chang?

582
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,886
- [Kou] That's right.

583
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,356
- Alright, suppose we meet at 1700 tomorrow

584
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,025
at artificial island D-35.

585
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:04,195
- Are you thinking of trying something underhanded.

586
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,029
- [Quincy] Is that an objection?

587
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,864
- No, tomorrow then.

588
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,604
- [Quincy] Prepare for testing.

589
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,039
Activate in two hours.

590
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:15,973
- [Scientists] Yes, sir.

591
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,042
- A public servant moonlighting.

592
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,978
Oh, I'd hate for anyone to find out, Nene.

593
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,915
(chuckling gently)

594
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,520
I want you to check the computer

595
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,422
for connections to this case.

596
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,291
Let me know as soon as you got anything.

597
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,862
(boat horn blowing)

598
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,765
- I understand you were a friend of Miss Irene.

599
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,867
I'm sorry about the cramped accommodations,

600
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,704
but I ask you to bear with them just a little longer.

601
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:50,007
That lock will automatically disengage in 24 hours.

602
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,743
Tomorrow night you will be free.

603
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,748
- Wait, are you gonna kill Quincy tomorrow?

604
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,818
Don't drag that girl into this.

605
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,955
Do you wanna make Reika, Vision a murderer?

606
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,591
Don't you realize she's just acting out of despair.

607
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,959
If you keep supporting her--

608
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,860
- What do you know?

609
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,530
You don't know how grief stricken Miss Reika was

610
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,932
when she lost Miss Irene!

611
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:19,136
To see Miss Reika smile again, I'd kill Quincy

612
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,305
even if he was a god.

613
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,712
- You're so wrong about this.

614
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,425
- Carl Baker's four o'clock piano concert

615
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,895
at the Yokohama Bayside Hall still has seats available.

616
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,333
Tickets for the (mumbles) combo go on sale

617
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,735
at the 20th of this month.

618
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,905
And, finally, the opening concert of Vision's tour

619
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:58,142
beginning tonight at the new Tokyo dome is sold out.

620
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,246
(copier whirring)

621
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,494
- [Sylia] Maybe I miss calculated.

622
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,768
- A chopper just left that lab.

623
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,770
Looks like it's heading for Genom tower.

624
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,482
(watch beeping)

625
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,316
- Linna?

626
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,257
Are you alright, Linna?

627
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,091
- [Linna] Priss.

628
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,465
- Hey, Nene, are you ready for tonight?

629
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,700
- What do you mean ready?

630
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,542
(gasping) The concert's tonight.

631
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:05,643
- You mean you forgot?

632
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,447
- [Nene And Naoko] Huh?

633
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,983
(gasping deeply)

634
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,653
(gentle music)

635
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,923
- Quincy's made his move.

636
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,725
Let's go. - I'll get the car, Leon.

637
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,928
- [Nene] Leon, I've got it.

638
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,129
- We'll talk in the car.

639
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:28,899
- [Priss] Come on, Linna.

640
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,770
(gentle music)

641
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,026
- So it's just you two after all.

642
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,429
Well, what are your demands?

643
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,097
- I demand your life.

644
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,031
(Quincy chuckling)

645
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,266
- [Quincy] For what reason?

646
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,236
- [Reika] Does the name Irene ring any bells?

647
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,070
- [Quincy] No.

648
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,607
- It's the name of my little sister who was killed

649
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:13,177
a year ago for the sake of your filthy rotten dreams.

650
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,945
- I know nothing about it.

651
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,815
I have far too many dreams, you see.

652
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,083
- Don't play innocent.

653
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,417
If you think I'm going to let you

654
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,553
get away with this, you're wrong.

655
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,190
- Well, then it just doesn't make any sense to me at all.

656
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:31,162
So a childlike you is going to take revenge.

657
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,797
(chucking sarcastically)

658
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,698
It's rather foolish of you to cause

659
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,968
such an uproar over just one little girl.

660
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,371
(gun firing)

661
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,950
- [Linna] You've got to stop this fighting now.

662
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,951
- [Reika] Linna!

663
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,353
- [Male] Shut up Genom agents.

664
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,422
- [Priss] A cold day in hell.

665
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,391
We're the-- - The Knight Sabers.

666
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,360
They and you are two of a kind.

667
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,863
Foolish rabble striking out at Genom.

668
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:07,798
- An android.

669
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,368
- Now that the components are assembled,

670
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:14,171
let's raise the curtain on the show.

671
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,941
(dramatic music)

672
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,133
- I'll shake it off.

673
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,871
- [Nene] This incident has its roots

674
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,706
in the murder of Irene Chang.

675
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,007
- [Leon] And the Texas incident?

676
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,909
- [Nene] It was for the killing of her parents.

677
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,177
- [Leon] And the culprit?

678
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,745
- It's Vision, I think.

679
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,881
Though I don't know if she's the principle one.

680
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:00,317
There are extenuating circumstances aren't there?

681
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,554
- Shit, this traffic we're not even moving.

682
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:24,041
(Priss yells)

683
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,777
- [Quincy] Let me give you some advice.

684
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:30,247
This town has a multitude of hidden surprises

685
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,317
and an inescapable surveillance network.

686
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:37,721
There is no place.

687
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,424
(Quincy laughing)

688
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,360
- [Priss] That sucker's mine.

689
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,130
(dramatic music)

690
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,165
- The monitor.

691
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,135
- [Priss] Can you see yet?

692
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,569
I'll be your eyes.

693
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,738
- [Linna] Reika, immobilize the thing.

694
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,806
- Linna, forget it.

695
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,942
Just get yourselves out of here.

696
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,109
- [Linna] It's too late.

697
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,685
(Kou grunts)

698
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,164
- [Linna] Disgusting.

699
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:23,033
- Kou, we'll blow it up with our self-destruct system.

700
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,169
- Did you copy that, Knight Saber?

701
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,071
- But what about you guys? - We've got an escape system.

702
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,305
Now get out of here.

703
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,578
- Arming self-destruct system.

704
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:39,917
- Reika!

705
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:48,625
- Reika! - Stay away.

706
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,861
- Get away there's no time.

707
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,533
- Let's get out of here.

708
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,722
(explosions echoing)

709
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,535
- [Linna] You better hurry or your concert's

710
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,570
going to start without you.

711
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,173
- It's okay, I'm not going to sing anymore.

712
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,077
Besides my revenge isn't finished yet.

713
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,879
Not until I kill Quincy.

714
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,886
- [Linna] How long are you gonna go on like that?

715
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,655
- But Irene won't rest in peace if I leave this undone.

716
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,500
What's this?

717
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:08,038
(gentle music)

718
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,374
- [Linna] Irene was a young girl in love.

719
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,343
She was so happy when she got this engagement ring.

720
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,378
It gave her hope.

721
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,682
Reika, I think there's another way besides revenge.

722
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:22,119
But only if you take Irene's hopes and see them through.

723
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:23,921
- Linna.

724
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,364
- A.D. Police.

725
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,933
- I'm glad you're here, officer.

726
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,868
Those are the people who kidnapped me.

727
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,574
- I'm the kidnapper.

728
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,842
She had nothing to do with it.

729
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:45,676
- Kou.

730
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,813
- Richard McLaren, you're under arrest.

731
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,583
On suspicion of violating the armaments construction laws.

732
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,750
- Wait a minute. - Not to mention

733
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,053
multiple counts of soliciting prostitution.

734
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,287
- [McLaren] Now come on.

735
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,723
- Miss Vision, we appreciate your help

736
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,525
in arresting this criminal.

737
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,993
Therefore, with your permission

738
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,862
we would very much like to escort you

739
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,997
to the concert grounds.

740
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:08,098
Would that be alright?

741
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:13,937
- Yes

742
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,142
