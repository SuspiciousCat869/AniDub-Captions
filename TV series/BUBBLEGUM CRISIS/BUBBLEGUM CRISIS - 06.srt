1
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,978
(electricity crackling) (loud crashing)

2
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,314
(loud thud)

3
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,353
(ominous music)

4
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,621
(alarm wailing)

5
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,357
(loud whooshing)

6
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,067
- What the hell? - How did you get in here?

7
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,068
(interface beeping)

8
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:39,072
(gun firing) (men groaning)

9
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,041
(metallic creaking)

10
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,218
- [Anri] Things are proceeding smoothly, Largo.

11
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,455
- [Largo] This is all to secure our passport

12
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,024
to a new world, Anri.

13
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:02,061
A new world where our people will be free.

14
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:05,832
However, before our dream can come true,

15
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,867
we must destroy them,

16
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,604
those bitches who confront us at every turn,

17
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:16,076
the Knight Sabers! (lightning crackles)

18
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,077
- [Man] Hey, hey!

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,545
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

20
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,949
(gun fires) (groans)

21
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,259
(high-pitched buzzing)

22
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,664
(device beeping)

23
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,001
(explosion booms)

24
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,763
(loud clunk)

25
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,276
(Leon groaning)

26
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,913
- [Leon Voiceover] What the hell happened to me?

27
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,081
What about DD?

28
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:38,791
What the?

29
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,462
What's that?

30
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,963
The Knight Sabers?!

31
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,797
So they...

32
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,468
What the?

33
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,938
(phone ringing) (groans loudly)

34
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,641
(panting loudly)

35
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,161
(phone clicks)

36
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,296
- [Daley] Morning, Leon.

37
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,130
(Leon groans)

38
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,264
(Daley chuckles)

39
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,133
Why are you so grumpy?

40
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,134
Hey, look here.

41
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,535
We've got a case.

42
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,305
- Oh, yeah?

43
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,739
So what's up?

44
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,710
- GENOM industrial complex number three on the waterfront.

45
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,145
(Daley chuckles)

46
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,247
Your darlings pulled a hell of a stunt,

47
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,516
turned the place upside down.

48
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,085
- [Leon] Yeah, just give me the highlights.

49
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,854
- Look here, we've got a live witness.

50
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:46,693
It looks like it was the genuine Knight Sabers, after all.

51
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,763
- All right, be right there.

52
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,766
(dramatic drumming)

53
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,248
(device clicking)

54
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,884
(device beeping)

55
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,420
(gun fires) (static crackles)

56
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,757
- A container full of combat boomers stolen.

57
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,525
What a fiasco.

58
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,094
Letting that gang do as they please

59
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,962
was the root of our problems.

60
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,964
What the hell kind of instructions

61
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,167
is security giving to the various concerned sections?

62
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,268
Well, Bouwer?

63
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,772
- I must agree.

64
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,440
Despite huge contributions,

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,076
neither the police nor the AD Police

66
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:41,314
have been of any use to us in this matter.

67
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:45,551
- I think we've had enough personal attacks, don't you?

68
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:50,056
I want you to think about this dispassionately.

69
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,059
It is not inconceivable for those suit configurations

70
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,795
to be an extension of combat suits

71
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,930
on which our company halted development.

72
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,968
Someone may very well be secretly assisting them.

73
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,805
- Is this your idea of a joke?

74
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,573
If anyone knew anything,

75
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:11,210
it would have been my predecessor, Flint, not me.

76
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,514
At any rate, combat suit and cyberdroid development

77
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,616
was supposedly halted ages ago.

78
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,652
(static crackling)

79
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,255
(loud buzzing)

80
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,629
- A grave situation, is it not?

81
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,231
So have you ascertained exactly

82
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,801
what the Knight Sabers are after?

83
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,302
- I am sorry, sir.

84
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,772
We are exerting ourselves to the fullest.

85
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,042
However, their intervention in this secret internal project,

86
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,912
which we are using Callahan to advance,

87
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,681
leads us to believe that someone who has access

88
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,852
to classified company information may be involved.

89
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,754
- Yes.

90
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,823
Have you found any proof?

91
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,891
- No.

92
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,561
We think it is a strong possibility.

93
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,731
- All right, then.

94
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,834
Send Madigan to my office immediately.

95
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,837
(loud buzzing)

96
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,439
- [Man In Blue] Certainly, sir.

97
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,784
(computer beeping)

98
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,620
- It appears to display a smooth expansion, doesn't it?

99
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,857
But we must act cautiously concerning Tanzaar and Zambique.

100
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,126
If it became known that we were directly involved

101
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,527
in these coup d'etat,

102
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,696
protests from other countries would come pouring in.

103
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,464
- [] No, you needn't worry on that score.

104
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,199
We're paying strict attention with regards

105
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,768
to establishing accounts.

106
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,536
For example, Tanzaar, as you observed,

107
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,338
it's a delicate situation-- - Who's that?

108
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,773
That face is unfamiliar.

109
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,274
Who is that?

110
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,010
- Oh, that's Milly Jackson.

111
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,712
She was transferred here four days ago.

112
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,281
I think she was at GPCC before that.

113
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,250
Is something wrong?

114
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,019
(heels clicking)

115
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,730
Miss Madigan.

116
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,431
The chairman wants to see you.

117
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,333
- Hm, the chairman?

118
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,268
Okay.

119
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,670
Inform him that I'm on my way.

120
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,384
(gun firing)

121
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,055
- Any way you look at it,

122
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,258
they sure put on a good show, didn't they?

123
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,528
Hey, but what about that stolen container?

124
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,530
What do you think was in it?

125
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,731
- I don't know.

126
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,333
The only thing I know for certain

127
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,602
is it couldn't have been anything good.

128
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,970
(gun fires) Ooh!

129
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,804
Damn.

130
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,842
- When all said and done, they do it for the money.

131
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:56,676
Hey, look here.

132
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,544
After all, Leon,

133
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,746
I've told you about getting involved with women.

134
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,649
- Look! (gun fires)

135
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,618
You don't need to tell me about women,

136
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,386
but this one's really got me.

137
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,789
(gun firing)

138
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,132
(bullets ricocheting)

139
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,068
Well, well.

140
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,474
Hm, look who's making all the racket down here.

141
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,644
Listen, when it comes to pistols, huh?

142
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:33,813
Hm.

143
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,994
(Nene groans)

144
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,595
- I can't stand it!

145
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:54,367
This makes us look like we're incredibly evil!

146
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,871
- We don't just look evil, we are evil, as far as they know.

147
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,206
- Who cares?

148
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,108
We can't just sit back like cowards

149
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,510
and let them get away with this.

150
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,245
- Let's go get them, Sylia.

151
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,981
This warning is a blatant challenge to us.

152
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:13,552
I say let's blow them away, just as soon as possible.

153
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,254
- [Priss] Wait a minute, Nene.

154
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,690
This could be a set-up.

155
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,659
No one would be dumb enough to use a code

156
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,662
that even the AD Police could break.

157
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,400
- The incident has made GENOM nervous.

158
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,868
Furthermore, from the evidence,

159
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,236
we can deduce that someone

160
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,806
who knows a lot about us is responsible.

161
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,643
Just consider for a moment what that could mean for us.

162
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,878
- Huh?

163
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,180
Aw, Sylia, they're giving us grief!

164
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,115
Let's trash 'em.

165
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,584
Right, Priss?

166
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,085
I mean, challenging us is-- - I'm sorry, but I quit.

167
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,386
- A really obnoxious thing to do.

168
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,654
Right, quit.

169
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,822
Huh?!

170
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:50,990
- What?! - Huh?

171
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,394
- [Mackie] What do you mean, Priss?

172
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,831
- I'm not going to lose any more friends.

173
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,067
- What?

174
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:01,901
Wait a second.

175
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,902
Priss, wait!

176
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,637
- Let her go, Mackie.

177
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,744
She's still in shock over the lost of Sylvie.

178
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,080
I can't blame her.

179
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,614
- [Linna] What will we do, Sylia?

180
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,750
With Priss, we were at a disadvantage.

181
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,318
Without her, it's not even a fight.

182
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,387
- [Sylia] At least our new suits are fully ready,

183
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,291
and their power enhancements may prove crucial.

184
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,636
- [Kate] Well?

185
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,637
Have you finished that check?

186
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,605
- Yes, ma'am.

187
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,474
Of the bearers of new ID cards

188
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,809
that the tower and its principal subsidiaries

189
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,878
have issued in the past six months,

190
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,748
a total of 126 men and women

191
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,816
have been marked for investigation.

192
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,518
- 126, huh?

193
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,719
All right.

194
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,221
Now check, as quickly as possible,

195
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,689
for people in that group

196
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,291
who can access top secret company information.

197
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,793
Well?

198
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,395
- [] Yes, ma'am.

199
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,696
- [Kate Voiceover] Sending me on this rat hunt

200
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,866
is just the chairman being capricious.

201
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,435
- [Anri] That's his schedule for the week.

202
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,336
Will it do?

203
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,040
- Well done, Anri.

204
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,244
Once we have Callahan, GENOM's bigshot defense minister,

205
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,845
along with the combat boomers

206
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,148
slated for military exportation,

207
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,551
our preparations will be complete.

208
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:30,222
Then, even Quincy will be forced to give me what I want.

209
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,024
(computer beeping)

210
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,493
(static crackles)

211
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,529
- [Man] Master Largo.

212
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,198
We bombarded the data network with the challenge

213
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,466
as you directed, sir.

214
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,434
- Make no mistake.

215
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,468
Now, finish them off.

216
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,436
Do not fail.

217
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,406
- [Man] Yes, sir.

218
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,812
- Now we can finally avenge Sylvie's death, right?

219
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,647
- [Largo] That's right, Anri.

220
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,482
We cannot allow those evil people

221
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,518
to get away with killing your dear Sylvie.

222
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,253
- [Anri] Thank you.

223
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,790
- Wait, just a little longer, Anri.

224
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,193
Soon, you will be truly free.

225
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,229
- Largo.

226
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:15,201
(high-pitched buzz) (mysterious music)

227
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,605
(siren wailing)

228
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,248
- This is Leon.

229
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,816
What's the situation over there?

230
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,485
- [Man] This is Point-01.

231
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,120
There's nothing to report right now.

232
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,387
Wait a second. - What is it?

233
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,756
- What the, what the hell?!

234
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:41,761
(explosion booms) (man screams)

235
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,098
- [Man] It's the Knight Sabers!

236
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,533
They took out our men!

237
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm going in!

238
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,736
Attack formation SW-01!

239
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,438
(gun firing)

240
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:57,409
(gun fires) (explosion booms)

241
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,214
(loud crash) (explosion booms)

242
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,584
- Shit, it's all going to hell!

243
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,286
Get the K-12s ready!

244
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,288
I'm going in now!

245
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,724
(man chuckles)

246
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,493
- [Man] Hurry up, Knight Sabers.

247
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:18,297
When you get here, it will be the end for you.

248
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,733
(man laughs)

249
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,602
(gentle music)

250
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,960
- Sure you want to throw this away?

251
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,731
It's the poster from your first live concert, isn't it?

252
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,565
- Sylia.

253
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,204
- There was no answer, so I let myself in.

254
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,007
Here.

255
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:36,976
- No.

256
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,479
I'm sorry about quitting.

257
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,580
I just can't.

258
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,585
- What happened wasn't your fault, Priss.

259
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,820
Truly.

260
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,588
- You're wrong!

261
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,457
It was my fault.

262
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:55,761
I let Sylvie die because I wasn't strong enough.

263
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,329
- Priss.

264
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,999
(phone beeping)

265
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,568
It's me.

266
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,902
- We got trouble.

267
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:06,505
The imposters have shown up at Tinsel City Bank,

268
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,274
just as their warning said.

269
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,676
AD Police were waiting for them.

270
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,810
What do we do?

271
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,245
- [Sylia] I see.

272
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,214
This one won't be a typical outing, after all.

273
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,115
- It won't?

274
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,618
- I mean, tonight will be special.

275
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,719
Call Linna.

276
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,388
Prepare to move out.

277
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,960
I have faith in you, Priss.

278
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,096
- I'm sorry.

279
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,734
(high-pitched buzz)

280
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:40,739
(loud crash) (upbeat music)

281
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,412
- Why?

282
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,548
Just tell me why, 'cause I don't buy it!

283
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,817
(loud whoosh)

284
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:56,522
(loud crash) (explosion booms)

285
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,559
- [Sylia] Knight Sabers, it's show time.

286
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:02,861
- What?

287
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,230
(loud boom)

288
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,865
(metallic creaking)

289
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,201
(loud boom)

290
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,179
So you've revealed your true selves.

291
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,814
Okay, you two, here we go!

292
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,816
- [Linna and Nene] Okay!

293
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:26,952
- Ha!

294
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,520
Looks like the real ones have shown up.

295
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,355
- Leon! (Leon groans)

296
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,656
Leon!

297
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,091
- What is it now, huh?

298
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,626
Ha, this is just starting to get good.

299
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:39,064
- [Daley] Someone's kidnapped Defense Minister Callahan!

300
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,499
- They what?!

301
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,368
- The kidnappers are escaping via the freeway.

302
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,535
What do we do now?!

303
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,903
- You idiot!

304
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:45,871
We got to go after them.

305
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:46,739
(explosion booms)

306
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,173
(groans loudly)

307
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,242
Looks like I'm gonna have to leave this fight.

308
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,411
It's yours, Knight Sabers.

309
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,681
(gun fires)

310
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,282
(explosion booms)

311
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,517
- Where are they? (interface beeping)

312
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,052
They're gone.

313
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:00,853
Huh?

314
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,554
Damn!

315
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,526
(loud thud) (Sylia groans)

316
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,928
(loud crash)

317
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,934
- [Sylia Voiceover] Oh, they're tough!

318
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,336
- [Man] You're weakest.

319
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,203
- [Linna and Nene] Sylia!

320
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,205
- [Man] Ah-ah.

321
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,640
Tonight, you die.

322
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,444
- [Linna] Come and get it!

323
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,946
(Nene grunts)

324
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,194
- Just who are you, anyway?

325
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,595
You think you're just gonna get away

326
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,063
with this sort of thing?

327
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:47,399
(punch thuds) (Callahan groans)

328
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,470
- Please, do be quiet for a while, Mr. Minister.

329
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,540
Soon, your usefulness will be at an end.

330
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,341
Anri, quickly.

331
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,342
- [Anri] Yes, sir.

332
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,379
(motorcycle roaring)

333
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,385
(dramatic music)

334
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,892
(tires screeching)

335
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,194
- [Priss Voiceover] She's got her hair different,

336
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,629
but that was definitely Anri.

337
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,099
What is she still doing in town?

338
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,001
Who was that guy with her?

339
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,503
Hm.

340
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,938
(computer clicking)

341
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,840
- [] I finished that data check, Miss Madigan.

342
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,541
- All right, put it onscreen.

343
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,609
- Yes, ma'am.

344
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,281
- [Kate Voiceover] Milly Jackson?

345
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,784
It is her, after all, but why?

346
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,958
- [] Miss Madigan.

347
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,960
There's a message from Boomer Omega-4,

348
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,362
in pursuit of the kidnappers.

349
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,198
- [Kate] Take them out, car and all.

350
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,067
It doesn't matter!

351
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,869
- But it's the minister.

352
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:57,870
(hand thuds) (Kate groans)

353
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,904
- It doesn't matter!

354
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,439
He's just a puppet!

355
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,876
If we don't seal his lips, there will be hell to pay!

356
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:04,710
- [] They're slowing down.

357
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,811
It's now or never!

358
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,080
- Strike! - Commencing attack!

359
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,484
- Here he comes!

360
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,486
- It's a GENOM operative.

361
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,821
It seems that Milly Jackson

362
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,257
has also outlived her usefulness, Anri.

363
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,092
- How did they find out about me?

364
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,260
- They probably put Bouwer

365
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,029
under the deep psychology scanner.

366
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,497
All right.

367
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,331
Pull over.

368
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,502
(aircraft whirring)

369
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,907
- We'll catch up to them in three minutes!

370
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,109
- What do you mean three minutes?!

371
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,944
You better do it in one!

372
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,112
- That's crazy! (laser zaps)

373
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:44,783
(explosion booms) (Leon gasps)

374
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,151
- What's that?

375
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:46,985
Not the...

376
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,156
(fire roaring)

377
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,732
(glasses crashes)

378
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:04,636
(electricity crackling)

379
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,071
- Huh? What is it?

380
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,372
Is something happening?

381
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,440
- [Largo] A woman.

382
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,542
- We're getting visual. (Kate gasps)

383
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,944
- Huh?

384
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:16,515
- I am Largo, and your precious minister is my guest.

385
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,183
I'll be with you shortly.

386
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,153
I'm of a mind to meet directly with the chairman.

387
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,821
- So that's how it is.

388
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,490
Sure of yourself, aren't you?

389
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,760
So what do you want in exchange for the minister?

390
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,329
- The OMS.

391
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,763
He'll understand.

392
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,467
- The Overmind Control System?

393
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,836
But how in the world?!

394
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,806
- Oh, so you know what it is.

395
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,342
You seem like a sharp one, indeed.

396
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,410
I look forward to meeting you.

397
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,579
(loud crash) - No, wait!

398
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,982
- [] Transmission terminated.

399
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,388
(gun fires)

400
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,923
- [Leon] AD Police.

401
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,592
You'll come quietly if you don't want to be blown away.

402
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,562
(aircraft whirring)

403
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:08,266
- Hey, good going, Leon.

404
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,639
- Now, open both hands slowly, and lie facedown.

405
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,276
Hey, hey, hey, What do you think you're doing?

406
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:19,544
I said facedown!

407
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,414
(high-pitched screeching)

408
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,248
- [] No!

409
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,653
(laser zaps) (explosion booms)

410
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,155
(Leon groans)

411
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,862
(fire roaring)

412
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,531
(Leon groaning)

413
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:45,003
- High-spirited as ever, aren't you, Leon McNichol?

414
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,441
- So you know who I am.

415
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,444
- Uh-huh.

416
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,914
I've heard your barking from time to time.

417
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,487
Goodbye, little puppy.

418
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,857
(gun fires)

419
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,360
(Leon groans)

420
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,243
- Anri!

421
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,180
- Why, that's...

422
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,782
No, Largo, wait!

423
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,455
(laser zaps) (Priss groans)

424
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,689
- [Priss] Anri.

425
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,092
- Priss.

426
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,895
(ominous music)

427
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,086
(door thuds) (gasps)

428
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,755
- All done.

429
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,256
Let's go.

430
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:15,093
(tires screeching) - Yes, sir.

431
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,330
Priss.

432
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,802
(Priss groaning)

433
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,636
- Ow.

434
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,610
(Priss sighs)

435
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,346
(Priss groaning)

436
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,583
Shit!

437
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,386
Leon, are you okay?

438
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,558
- Priss, what are you doing here?

439
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,594
- Just passing by.

440
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,063
Leon, who was that man?

441
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,165
- I don't know.

442
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,834
It all happened so fast.

443
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,035
Son of a bitch!

444
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,373
A monster should at least look like a monster.

445
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,375
(Leon groans)

446
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,343
- [Priss Voiceover] Could it have been a satellite attack?

447
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,178
But how?

448
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,181
- Priss.

449
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,253
Look, look, it's pretty dangerous this time.

450
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:18,089
This isn't like any of your previous enemies.

451
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,758
- What, what you talking about?

452
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,027
- Just listen to me!

453
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,696
Don't stick your neck out any further.

454
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,698
Leave this to AD Police.

455
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:31,002
I don't want you getting hurt.

456
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:31,837
Okay?

457
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,476
(aircraft whirring)

458
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,319
- [Priss] Looks like your friends are here.

459
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,521
Have them pick you up off the ground.

460
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,755
- [Leon] Priss!

461
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,225
Will you be all right, in the shape you're in?

462
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,192
- Leon, give it up.

463
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,795
I'm not gonna lick your wounds.

464
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,666
(aircraft whirring)

465
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,149
- What?

466
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,986
Madigan, it's out of the question.

467
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,021
Giving up the OMS would result

468
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:27,192
in him replacing GENOM as ruler of the world.

469
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,094
- But if word gets out from the minister

470
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,930
of our violations of international law,

471
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,800
there'll be protests from all over the world!

472
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,969
- Protests we can deal with,

473
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,471
but they can only occur

474
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,707
if the human species survives intact.

475
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,543
Now, he's coming here?

476
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,745
- Yes, sir.

477
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,781
He was bold enough to contact us.

478
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:50,849
- [Quincy] All right.

479
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,118
Send him to me without delay.

480
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,719
I'll see him.

481
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,489
- [Kate] But, sir, then you'll be--

482
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,292
- I want to see, with my own eyes,

483
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,063
the kind of man capable of something like this.

484
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:11,102
(water roaring) (fire crackling)

485
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,844
- [Nene] What do we do Sylia?

486
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:22,180
There's nowhere left to run.

487
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:28,019
- [Sylia] Linna, Nene, I'll draw their attention.

488
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,121
When I do, you two clear out.

489
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,790
You must get out of here.

490
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,658
- [Linna] Sylia, no.

491
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,694
- [Sylia] On my command.

492
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,095
That's an order.

493
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,197
- [Linna and Nene] Sylia.

494
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,533
(loud buzzing)

495
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,400
- Now!

496
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,403
(aircraft whirring)

497
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,706
- Look out, everyone.

498
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,874
Duck, duck! (cannons firing)

499
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,711
(explosions boom)

500
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,347
Climb on, quick!

501
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,122
(loud thud) (man groans)

502
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,459
(Nene panting)

503
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,293
- Saved.

504
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,028
That was a close one.

505
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,563
- We've got trouble.

506
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,499
Priss has taken her old suit and motoroid from the base.

507
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,333
- In her old suit?

508
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,135
She hasn't a chance.

509
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,803
We've got to help her out.

510
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,005
- [Largo] What?!

511
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,673
You let them slip through your fingers?!

512
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:25,610
- [Man] Master Largo, we're terribly sorry.

513
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,214
There was some unexpected interference.

514
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:32,050
- Well, then, all of you head over here.

515
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,718
I'm putting on a big show.

516
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,487
- [Man] Yes, sir.

517
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,124
- [Anri] We'll be arriving at the front entrance shortly.

518
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:39,958
- Hm?

519
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,835
(tires screech)

520
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,745
(door clacks)

521
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,918
I'm terribly sorry.

522
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,187
It was truly careless of me.

523
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,856
But you need not worry, ma'am.

524
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,892
I told them nothing concerning military secrets--

525
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:18,897
(gun fires) (Callahan groans)

526
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,668
- To sacrifice even a minister, that is the GENOM way.

527
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,837
- The chairman awaits.

528
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:26,671
This way!

529
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,412
- How lovely.

530
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,982
Having once attained these heights,

531
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:40,952
one would do anything rather than descend again.

532
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,521
Even the wisest of men would be beguiled.

533
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,390
(Anri gasps)

534
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,925
- It's lovely.

535
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:51,529
The light looks like it's swallowing everything up.

536
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,366
- Soon, Anri, all of this light will be ours.

537
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,669
- Optimistic, aren't ya?

538
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,604
Hm, burn this view into your eyes.

539
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,373
You may not get to see it ever again.

540
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,441
- [Largo] Hm.

541
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,482
(Quincy chuckles)

542
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:14,219
- Rather an impressive-looking sort, aren't you?

543
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:18,256
I've heard your demand from Madigan here.

544
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,059
Mind if I ask you something?

545
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:25,997
What could you possibly want to do with this technology?

546
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:29,801
- Cyberdroids are creatures which mankind created,

547
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:33,204
ones with the potential to be a new species.

548
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:37,408
You people treat them like nothing more than merchandise.

549
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,211
It's only right for me to have the OMS.

550
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,648
It burdens corrupt, ignoble GENOM,

551
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,751
and especially you, old man.

552
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,919
- Watch your mouth!

553
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,187
We won't have any of that!

554
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,021
- Hold it.

555
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,793
I'll tell you what, Largo, you said your name was?

556
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,194
Come work for me.

557
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,863
You've said enough about what you want to do.

558
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,533
I need a man of your talents.

559
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,367
Or else...

560
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,371
(guns clack)

561
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,973
(Largo laughs)

562
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:17,048
- [Kate] It seems you've slipped your moorings, Largo.

563
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:20,084
- Let me show you something interesting.

564
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:24,455
Put the GENOM towers around the world on the multivision.

565
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,324
- [Kate] So what are you leading up to now?

566
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,158
- Hold it.

567
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,929
Humor him, and do as he says.

568
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,675
- And now, on with the show!

569
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,544
For starters, the tower currently under construction

570
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,279
in Sydney, Australia.

571
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,716
(laser zaps)

572
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,519
(explosion booms)

573
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:56,788
(screams)

574
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,056
(gasps)

575
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,858
Next, Illinois, the USA, then Berlin.

576
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:05,830
(lasers zap) (explosions boom)

577
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,936
- What have you done?!

578
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,707
- I have engaged my will.

579
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,477
- [Quincy] You mean you have a direct link

580
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:23,047
with the orbital particle beam satellites?!

581
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,483
- [Largo] Precisely.

582
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,885
If I wish, my children will wipe all the GENOM towers

583
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:30,288
off the face of the earth!

584
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,990
- I can't believe this.

585
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,993
USSD was supposed to have stopped developing

586
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,929
the killer dolls after that incident.

587
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:41,165
- So you still find it hard to believe.

588
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,868
In that case, see for yourself!

589
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,237
(laser zaps)

590
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:48,706
(explosion booms)

591
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,209
(yelps)

592
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,210
(explosion booms)

593
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,779
(upbeat music)

594
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,350
- Are you a super boomer?!

595
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:04,122
- I'd prefer we stop using such crude language.

596
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,857
My name is Largo.

597
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,359
I am the maker of the new world.

598
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,094
Now, give me the OMS.

599
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,598
- You rotten son of a bitch.

600
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,432
Kill him!

601
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:25,076
(laser zaps) (explosion booms)

602
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:32,183
- Anri, I'm gonna rescue you from those monsters,

603
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,752
and I'm gonna do it for Sylvie.

604
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:36,988
Anri!

605
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,468
(interface clicking)

606
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,473
(loud clunk) - No!

607
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,876
Cyberdroids cannot possibly coexist with humans.

608
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,746
If we released them, they would become insanely destructive

609
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,349
and a powerful enemy of mankind.

610
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,552
- They are waiting, the multitudes of my people

611
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,355
whose hearts and souls you have bound.

612
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,190
And I shall lead them.

613
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,359
- Bastard.

614
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,761
Do you think you can become a god?

615
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,129
- I don't know.

616
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,765
That depends on human beings.

617
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,200
Hm?

618
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,402
(interface clicking)

619
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,304
You tricked me, Quincy!

620
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,843
(loud thud)

621
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,277
A double?

622
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,112
Can't be.

623
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:40,284
So far as I knew, the real Quincy had to be here.

624
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,053
- Oh, no, sir.

625
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:47,058
(Kate groans) (Quincy laughs)

626
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,628
- Well done.

627
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:54,432
Well done, Largo, or whatever your name is.

628
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,168
Alas, it was all for naught.

629
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,504
It'll be a long time before anyone gets

630
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,775
their hands on the OMS, especially you, you bastard.

631
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,677
(screens crashing)

632
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,647
- There's nothing more we can do here.

633
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,882
Come, Anri.

634
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,151
(glass crashes) - Anri, I'm here.

635
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:13,985
Let's go.

636
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,522
- I know that voice.

637
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,425
- [Largo] Allow me to introduce you, Anri.

638
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,428
This is the bitch who killed Sylvie.

639
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,766
- [Priss] You've been pumping her full of lies.

640
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:32,036
I will not let you drag her down into your dirt!

641
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,704
- Is that you, Priss?

642
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,541
I can't believe you're one of the Knight Sabers,

643
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,476
that you killed Sylvie.

644
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,481
- Anri, let me now show you the true face of the perpetrator

645
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,217
who trampled all over your dreams

646
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,419
under her feet.

647
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,456
(loud whoosh)

648
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:56,461
(glass crashing) (Priss groans)

649
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,329
- Priss.

650
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,198
It can't be.

651
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,501
- Here, Anri.

652
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,539
She killed your dear Sylvie.

653
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,075
She is your hated foe.

654
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,643
Now is the time.

655
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:13,845
Kill her.

656
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:14,679
Kill her!

657
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:24,422
(knife rasps) (Priss groans)

658
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,863
- Sylvie, I've finally been able to avenge you.

659
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,067
(Priss whimpering)

660
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,171
Why, Priss?

661
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,706
Why?

662
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,208
- Sylvie was beyond our help.

663
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,544
If I hadn't done what I did,

664
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:52,316
the DD would have exploded and wiped out the whole city.

665
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:54,552
I'm sorry.

666
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,687
I'm so sorry.

667
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,192
There was nothing I could do.

668
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,195
(knife rasps) (Priss groans)

669
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,097
I couldn't protect her.

670
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,233
- Oh, no.

671
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:10,902
Priss.

672
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,208
(Largo laughs)

673
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,344
- Looking to apologize, Priss?

674
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,213
It amazes me that you were actually able

675
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,415
to shoot that 33-S, Sylvie.

676
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,150
Had it continued on out of control,

677
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,053
it would have been quite amusing.

678
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,523
(knife clanging)

679
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,392
Still, after the existence of the DD

680
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:38,262
became public knowledge, that eyesore Flint fell from grace.

681
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,531
GPCC became completely mine,

682
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,501
and thus I accelerated development of the hyper boomers.

683
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,735
- [Anri] So, Sylvie was just--

684
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:48,205
- A cat's paw of mine, I suppose you might say.

685
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:51,943
And the poor thing didn't even know it.

686
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,912
But it was just one sexaroid, right?

687
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,148
Nothing of consequence, hm?

688
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,285
Why are you looking at me like that?

689
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,888
Oh, is this hurting you?

690
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,556
Well, it's not as if you can do anything

691
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,358
about it now, is it?

692
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,760
All right, step aside, Anri.

693
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,430
You, too, have now served your purpose.

694
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,934
Playtime is over. (loud whooshing)

695
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:21,038
(loud crackling) (screaming)

696
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:21,872
- Anri!

697
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,446
Anri.

698
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,280
No.

699
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:34,619
- Largo and I wanted to make a world of our kind,

700
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,256
but I didn't want to destroy the city,

701
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,324
or kill people either.

702
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,994
Sylvie felt the same, I'm sure.

703
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,996
- Please don't die.

704
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:45,830
Anri.

705
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,201
- Priss, I beg you, live.

706
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,705
Live for me and for Sylvie.

707
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:00,444
Thank you.

708
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:02,747
Priss.

709
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,018
- Don't leave me!

710
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:07,852
Come back!

711
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:12,657
If you die, what will Sylvie have died for?!

712
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,093
- Dead, eh?

713
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,462
(Largo chuckles)

714
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,998
Or rather, I imagine it would be more exact to say

715
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:23,034
that it has ceased functioning.

716
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,303
It is a machine, after all.

717
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,838
- You bastard!

718
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,908
(gun fires)

719
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,176
(high-pitched buzz)

720
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,577
(gasps)

721
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:36,580
- Is this all your anger amounts to?

722
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,416
(Largo chuckles) (loud whoosh)

723
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,184
(loud thud) (Priss groaning)

724
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:43,020
(footsteps pattering)

725
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,025

726
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,860
(laughs)

727
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,597
How stupid, to think you were a match for me!

728
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,636
You've come all this way only to die like a dog.

729
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,639
(Priss groans) (metal clanging)

730
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,641
- If you think you're gonna beat me,

731
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,444
you've got another thing coming, you scumbag!

732
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:09,013
(upbeat music)

733
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,650
- Allow me to pay homage to your admirable

734
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,919
yet useless bravery, Priss.

735
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,955
Here!

736
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,356
Take a good look.

737
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,226
(gasps)

738
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:29,300
Now, this is the look of the true victor.

739
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,803
And now, I will kill you with a thought.

740
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,004
- Never.

741
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,239
I won't let you.

742
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,808
(gasps)

743
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:40,978
(footsteps pattering)

744
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:44,648
Yes!

745
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,719
(loud clank) (gasps)

746
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,122

00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,628
(loud thud)

748
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:08,406
- Hm, it seems I won't need to dirty my hands, after all.

749
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,141
Kill her!

750
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,778
(grunts)

751
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,447

(Largo chuckles)

757
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,232
- I can't die this way.

758
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,501
Shit, this can't be it, no.

759
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:42,506
- You will carry this humiliation to your grave, worm!

760
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:47,478
(kick thuds) (Priss groans)

761
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,282
- Gotta keep going.

762
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,519
I can still waste these bastards!

763
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,455
(Priss gasps)

764
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,255

(upbeat music)

768
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,501
Go!

769
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,705
(loud crash)

770
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,041

No!

774
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,094
It can't be!

775
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:44,869
- [Priss] I'm gonna kick your ass, you evil bastard.

776
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,604
Outta my way, boomer!

That was close.

784
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,799
- So the worm is a worm, after all.

785
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:20,004
With my next blow, I'll send you to hell!

786
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,105
- Can't quit.

787
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,141
I won't quit.

788
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:27,244
Anri, Sylvie, give me all your power!

789
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,784
(Priss grunts) - Die, bitch!

790
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,387

Sylia.

797
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,010

- Human beings, how vulgar.

802
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,133
For the crime of injuring me, a god,

803
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,836
as atonement, I demand death!

804
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:26,804

are two of a kind because--

824

Leon's quite a guy, isn't he?

- We did it, but do you suppose he's really dead?

833
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,330
