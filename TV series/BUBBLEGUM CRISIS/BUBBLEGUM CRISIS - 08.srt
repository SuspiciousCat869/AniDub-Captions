2
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,961
(electricity whirring)

3
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,697
(loud explosion)

4
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,366
- [Green] ] That one's down.

5
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,734
The last one's yours, Priss.

6
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,138
(Bryce grunting)

7
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,105
- Eat this.

8
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:42,842
Hmm.

9
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,079
Sure not as tough as they look.

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,514
(camera clicking)

11
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,314
Hmm?

12
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,451
- Oh, no, I think she saw me.

13
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,020
(Lisa gasping)

14
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,397
My camera!

15
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,032
Oh, no!

16
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,935
(gasping deeply)

17
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:09,769
My camera.

18
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,077
You owe me a camera, you jerk!

19
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,116

- Nene Romanova reporting, sir.

40
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,001
Did you wanna see me?

41
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,036
- I'm glad you're here.

42
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,471
I know you're very busy,

43
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,173
but I have a special assignment I'd like for you to do.

44
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,409
- Now.

45
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,879
- Allow me to introduce my niece, Lisa Vanette.

46
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,814
She's an aspiring news photographer

47
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,050
that has been badgering me to let her follow

48
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,853
cases around here and to get a scoop.

49
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,555
Starting today I'd like you to look

50
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,523
after her for about a week.

51
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,724
(chuckling nervously)

52
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:12,725
- You mean me, sir?

53
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,498
- Hi, I'm Lisa Vanette.

54
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,066
How do you do?

55
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,368
(gasping nervously)

56
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,003
- Which is how I got saddled

57
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,672
with looking after the chief's niece,

58
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,408
Lisa Vanette, 18, high school student,

59
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,243
she's on winter break.

60
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,146
I feel so awkward because I'm an only child,

61
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,182
and now it's like I have a kid sister, well sort of.

62
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,551
You mentioned getting a scoop.

63
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,054
But our main job here is boomer crimes.

64
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,388
Now that being so--

65
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,157
- That's it I'm going to uncover

66
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,992
the identities of the Knight Sabers,

67
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,161
(tires screeching)

68
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,364
a serious armored band that haunts our orderly society.

69
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,599
They oppose Genom,

70
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,001
shake down the weak for huge amounts of money,

71
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,503
and even destroy helpless girls' cameras.

72
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,405
It's my duty as a photographer to expose

73
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,207
the world to their actions and goals.

74
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,844
(machine beeping) Huh, what is it?

75
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:05,678
- What do you know a speeder going

76
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,016
50 kilometers over the limit.

77
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,117
Hang on a sec.

78
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,819
I'll catch it in just a jiffy.

79
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,953
- [Lisa] Okay.

80
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,889
(tires screeching)

81
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,200
(engine revving)

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,869
- Okay, okay, hold it right there.

83
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,472
Did you have any idea how fast you were going?

84
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,040
Let's see your license.

85
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,544
- Hmm.

86
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,881
Okay, Miss. A.D. police officer,

87
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:45,752
surely you're not going to give me a ticket, huh?

88
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,253
Hmm?

89
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,189
- How dare you talk to a state authority like that.

90
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,393
Your attitude is inexcusable.

91
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,028
- You can't give me a ticket.

92
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:56,729
- Watch me.

93
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,401
Priscilla S. Asagiri.

94
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,003
50 kilometers over the limit.

95
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,806
(Priss sighing)

96
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,640
Here.

97
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,611
- Shit, you're gonna get it for this.

98
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,980
- [Nene] Thank you.

99
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,749
(camera clicking)

100
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,419
- Boring, I guess big cases don't happen around here.

101
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,997
(machines whirring)

102
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,932
- What's our delivery percentage for this month?

103
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,935
- We're currently at 80%, sir.

104
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,237
- Ah, Miriam, thanks to you

105
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,908
our company's performance is number one in all of Genom.

106
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,810
The new power booster you developed

107
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,846
is proving to be very popular indeed.

108
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,481
- Well, I'm always thinking of things like that

109
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,717
even as I'm brushing my teeth before breakfast.

110
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,185
(chuckling deeply)

111
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,653
- [Executive] I see.

112
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,054
Well, keep up the good work.

113
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:55,855
- Excuse me.

114
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,291
Don't worry about a thing.

115
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,060
Stupid old fool.

116
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,261
I'm doing all of the work,

117
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,530
and you're taking all the credit for it.

118
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,599
I have no intention of spending the rest of my life

119
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,167
in a place like this.

120
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,470
Just watch as I show the world my genius,

121
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,639
and take Genom's number one spot for myself.

122
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,808
- [Worker] Sir, what are you doing?

123
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,410
Is something wrong with those units?

124
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,211
- I'm getting rid of them.

125
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,278
They're all defective.

126
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,886
- Here you go. - Thank you.

127
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,057
- [Nene] So why do you wanna be a photograph ever?

128
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,025
- Well, my father's a press photographer,

129
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,560
a really, really good one,

130
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,563
so I've decided that I want to follow in his footsteps.

131
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,534
- Wow, but how are the true identities of the Knight Sabers

132
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,103
connected to you wanting to be a photographer?

133
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,605
- They're totally unrelated.

134
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,673
I've decided I'm going to make those Knight Sabers

135
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,776
pay for destroying my camera.

136
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,444
- Camera? - Yeah.

137
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,812
My father gave it to me.

138
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,580
It was my pride and joy.

139
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,150
Those Knight Sabers are really mean, aren't they?

140
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,584
- Uh, well.

141
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,187
(watch beeping)

142
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,526
Oh, no, I'm on first shift today.

143
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,895
I forgot something very important that I have to do.

144
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,030
Sorry but that's gonna be all for today.

145
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,331
So long.

146
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,332
- Huh?

147
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,201
- See you later.

148
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,937
(engine revving)

149
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,343
- This is no fun.

150
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,113
Now Nene's gone, and there's absolutely nothing happening.

151
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,648
(bright music) What's this?

152
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,082
An incident.

153
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,018
- [Officer] Boomer incident in area red wing.

154
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,252
Let's like they're demolishing

155
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,188
the roof of a building under construction.

156
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,590
Dispatch a mobile unit pronto.

157
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,091
- Where's Leon?

158
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,761
- He's on his way to another incident at Dream Island.

159
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,230
- Alright, dispatch Daley's unit at once.

160
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,431
- Yes, sir. - Daley here

161
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,667
heading out to the incident site.

162
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,802
- I'm going along for the ride, okay, Uncle?

163
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,038
- [Chief] No, what if something happens?

164
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,973
- I wanna go no matter what.

165
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,542
Besides if I don't, I'll miss a decisive moment.

166
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,712
- Oh, come on, Lisa, you'd better not go.

167
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:00,980
This will be dangerous.

168
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,914
- Don't worry.

169
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,182
Hey, you better move out,

170
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,051
or the whole city will be messed up.

171
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,053
Move out! - Okay!

172
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,623
(emergency sirens wailing)

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,028
- You sit tight right here, okay.

174
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,230
If anything happened to you,

175
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,931
my job would be the least I'd lose.

176
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,765
- Okay.

177
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,506
- Miss, this area is off limits to civilians.

178
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,975
Please stand back.

179
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,444
(Lisa gasping)

180
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,278
- Wow.

181
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,083
Over there.

182
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,488
A.D. Police. - Huh?

183
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,224
(dramatic music)

184
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,634
(elevator door chimes)

185
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,203
(Lisa gasping)

186
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,975
(wind blowing swiftly)

187
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,549
I'll never get any good shots from here.

188
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,785
(wind blowing swiftly)

189
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,624
(Lisa gasping)

190
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,231
Now there's no one to get in my way here.

191
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,601
There.

192
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,379
(mechanical suit whirring)

193
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,215
(monitor beeping)

194
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,568
- [Nene] That's it hang in there, guys.

195
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,071
- [Priss] Easy for you to say.

196
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,709
(Sylia grunts)

197
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,043
- [Priss] Sylia.

198
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:19,552
- [Nene] Who me? (giggling)

199
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,456
(Nene gasping)

200
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,498
- [Priss] Nene.

201
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,001
(Nene grunts)

202
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,380
- [Sylia] I got the other one!

203
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,688
- I gotcha.

204
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,695
(door thuds)

205
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,170
(machine whirring)

206
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,480
(gasping deeply)

207
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,314
Oh, no.

208
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,426
(gasping deeply)

209
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,260
Nene.

210
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,064
Hmm.

211
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,133
I might just be on to something here.

212
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,175
- Sorry I'm late.

213
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,409
- Lately you've been picking

214
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,811
some pretty strange meeting places.

215
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,112
- I thought it'd be harder

216
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,214
for anyone to notice us here.

217
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,215
You know what I mean?

218
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,620
You know, Sylia,

219
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,356
we've had quite a long relationship ourselves.

220
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,792
It all began on that cold winters (grunts).

221
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,095
- Don't talk stupid.

222
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,363
Just tell me what you're investigation turned up.

223
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,265
- Okay.

224
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,734
This business doesn't seem to be

225
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,970
connected with Genom proper.

226
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,840
Rather it seems to be a private individual,

227
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,508
and I can't find out who.

228
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,211
It's someone out there holding a grudge.

229
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,346
- [Sylia] I always settle grudges.

230
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,581
- [Male] Right.

231
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,350
Well, the same person seems to be behind

232
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,552
all the incidents you've had me check into.

233
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,354
- Well, continue your investigation.

234
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,156
- Okay.

235
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,728
(sighing deeply)

236
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,564
(gasping heavily)

237
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,033
- Morning.

238
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,301
- [Nene] Naoko.

239
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,569
- Once again just barely on time.

240
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,571
Is something keeping you up late at night?

241
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,107
I bet you had a date last night, you and your boyfriend?

242
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,776
- [Nene] Oh, no, I don't have one.

243
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,544
But I sure am in the market.

244
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,746
- [Naoko] Well, that's plenty strange, huh?

245
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,917
Hey, what's that?

246
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,988
- Oh, this I cut myself falling off my scooter yesterday.

247
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,023
- You know, a girl's face is her fortune.

248
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,058
It's disastrous to injure it.

249
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,326
(Nene giggling)

250
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,961
By the way, weren't you supposed to work

251
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,297
first shift today instead of yesterday?

252
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,633
- Oh, no, my scheduled changed at the last minute.

253
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,467
Didn't I tell you?

254
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,735
- Hmm, not a word.

255
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,004
- Anyway, did you get the concert tickets?

256
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,305
- [Naoko] All taken care of.

257
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,641
But that band just isn't selling I tell you.

258
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,042
- [Nene] Really, but their lead singer

259
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,111
Dekachen is to die for.

260
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,180
- Weirdo. - Oh, really.

261
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,081
- An injury, hmm.

262
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,419
(gentle music)

263
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,988
(Lisa gasping)

264
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,958
December.

265
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,160
She was first shift today.

266
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,994
What the?

267
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,701
That's funny.

268
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,542
- Huh, something unusual about Nene?

269
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,376
- Yeah.

270
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,247
- Well, you know, she's got a cute enough face,

271
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,915
but still no boyfriends.

272
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,183
I wonder.

273
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,418
Maybe we should fix her up with someone.

274
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,386
What do you think? - Never mind.

275
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,288
(Nene sneezing)

276
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,224
- Something unusual about Nene.

277
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,428
Well, she works hard and she's a nice girl.

278
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,363
But, you know, sometimes when she's on duty,

279
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,965
she just vanishes.

280
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,133
Like every time there's a boomer incident,

281
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,002
she seems to just disappear.

282
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:30,836
Funny thing is.

283
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,474
- I heard you got that cut from falling off your scooter.

284
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,875
Where was your helmet?

285
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,110
(Nene stammering)

286
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,912
- I wasn't wearing it for a little while.

287
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,614
But how did you know about that?

288
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,316
I don't recall telling you anything about it.

289
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,785
- Oh.

290
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,687
Oh, Naoko told me all about it.

291
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,622
- [Nene] Naoko told you.

292
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,357
- Will, Operator Nene Romanov

293
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,126
please report to the data control room at once.

294
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,494
- What's that all about?

295
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,229
- I don't know, but I've gotta go.

296
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,765
Oh, by the way, tomorrow is my day off,

297
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,935
so try to get Naoko to look after you, okay?

298
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,803
- Really, that's too bad.

299
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:05,671
- [Nene] Sorry.

300
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,106
Well, I'll be back soon.

301
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:09,742
- Hmm?

302
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,582
(engine revving)

303
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:22,521
Here we go.

304
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,824
(gasping deeply)

305
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,028
What?

306
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,964
This is the pits.

307
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,238
Hold it a second.

308
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,407
How far do you plan to go?

309
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,911
- Hello.

310
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,313
- [Mackie] Oh, Nene.

311
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,214
Priss and the others are already here.

312
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,751
- Alright, Linna, today you're at level eight.

313
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,054
If you clear that, which I'm sure you will,

314
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,656
you'll be able to get the most out of your new suit.

315
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,158
You have three minutes.

316
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,527
During that time, three attack points will appear.

317
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,028
Don't waste them.

318
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,264
Okay, here we go.

319
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,098
- Okay.

320
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,601
- Go.

321
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,543
- Look at her go.

322
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,278
Which level is this?

323
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,479
(gasping deeply)

324
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,381
Don't tell me she's fighting at level eight.

325
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,683
And as hard as I try,

326
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,952
I can't manage to clear level five.

327
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,287
- You're too slow, Nene.

328
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,055
That's why you keep getting clabbered,

329
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,790
and you better workout a little,

330
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,826
or else you won't be able to fit in your suit.

331
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,195
- Hmm, I contribute to the Knight Sabers

332
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,832
with my extreme good looks and amazing brain power.

333
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,535
Besides, I wouldn't wanna be an ape woman like you.

334
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,871
Come to think of it if you are so hot,

335
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,574
how come I managed to catch you, hmm?

336
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,476
(Priss grunts)

337
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,944
(Sylia chuckling)

338
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,579
- 60 seconds to go.

339
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:58,584
(electricity whirring) (Linna grunts)

340
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,652
- Almost.

341
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,931
- Clear, Linna.

342
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,268
We flex speed 8.25, excellent.

343
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,772
Okay, Nene, it's your turn now.

344
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,173
- Do you have to?

345
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,641
- Naturally.

346
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,744
I need the data to construct the programs for the new suits.

347
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,880
We'll do level five once more.

348
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,483
Even an ordinary girl can clear level five.

349
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,418
- Mm, okay.

350
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,989
(Nene groans)

351
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,592
- Come on, Nene, you've gotta be able to clear level five

352
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,895
sooner or later, right?

353
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,229
- This is your third try.

354
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,731
Ready?

355
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,565
Go.

356
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,679
(machine buzzing)

357
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,214
(women chuckling)

358
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,749
Elimination.

359
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:08,253
- [Priss] How can you get only a 4.8 on level five?

360
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,521
- [Linna] Come down to my club.

361
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,623
I'll give you special coaching.

362
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,625
(women chuckling)

363
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,461
- Thanks but no thanks.

364
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,729
- [Sylia] Too slow, increase your pitch.

365
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,631
(Nene breathing heavily) Okay, next.

366
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,434
- You mean there's more.

367
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,804
- 58, 32, 69, 17, 24.

368
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,473
On your mark, get set, jump.

369
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,177
- I'm beat. - Arm strength, 3.5.

370
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,479
Leg strength, 5.9.

371
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,713
Perception 7.2.

372
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,882
Reflex speed 4.8.

373
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,251
These are down a little from the last measurements.

374
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,153
Practice some more.

375
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,555
- So A.D. Police can just sit on their butts

376
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,123
while we do the work, huh?

377
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,126
- Hey, come on everybody at A.D. Police

378
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,962
is busy fighting just as hard as they can.

379
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,030
- Then how do you explain this?

380
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,865
- What!

381
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,435
What is it?

382
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,803
- Come here a sec.

383
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,540
Go on, get on?

384
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,110
- What, I'm not gaining weight.

385
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,645
I'm on a diet right now.

386
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,814
There's point in measuring me since.

387
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,482
- Yeah, right.

388
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,252
- Well, I'm just gonna weigh the same as last time.

389
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,854
Wait, wait don't do this.

390
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,960
( chuckling) - Your waste is a centimeter thicker!

391
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,762
- Let me see!

392
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,596
Oh, it is!

393
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,733
You eat too many sweets.

394
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,369
- [Priss] This is your idea of a diet.

395
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,604
(monitor beeping)

396
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,473
- Sis, I thought you should know.

397
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,975
There's a strange girl wondering around out front.

398
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:37,943
What should I do?

399
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,444
- [Sylia] A strange girl?

400
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,279
- Uh-huh.

401
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,150
(Nene gasping) - Oh, she's the one

402
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,453
who tried to take pictures of us just last night.

403
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,688
- [Nene] You know her?

404
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,390
- [Priss] Yeah, I trashed her camera.

405
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,493
- That explains it.

406
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,929
- So what do we do about her?

407
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,498
- She won't find us by looking around like that.

408
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,333
We'll leave her be.

409
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,969
- Say, Nene, do you know who she is?

410
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,539
- Yeah, her name is Lisa,

411
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,041
and she's the chief's niece.

412
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,043
She says she's going to expose the Knight Sabers'

413
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,679
true identities. - True identities?

414
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,781
- Hey, is this gonna be cool?

415
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,115
- It'll be fine.

416
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,217
I think.

417
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,854
- [Male] Hey there, Mackie, is my bike fixed?

418
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,556
- [Mackie] Yeah, just finished.

419
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,159
- [Male] I got caught because you freaked out.

420
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,827
Now don't let me down this time.

421
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,964
- [Mackie] The problem is that you drive like a maniac.

422
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,566
Try putting yourself in the bike's place.

423
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,101
- [Male] Later.

424
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,803
- [Mackie] Please don't be so hard on it this time.

425
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,539
(engine revving)

426
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,815
(door creaking)

427
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,216
- Excuse me.

428
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,085
Did you notice a red-headed woman wearing a

429
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,354
mustard yellow jumper driving a white scooter?

430
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,956
- Well, yeah, you cute thing.

431
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,057
But she already left.

432
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,926
- What, gone.

433
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:02,995
Excuse me.

434
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,199
(chuckling softly)

435
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,534
Damn.

436
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,337
She gave me the slip.

437
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:20,278
- Hmm, a shower and some cake

438
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,147
are just the thing after a workout.

439
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,352
- [Priss] Your waste is a centimeter thicker.

440
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,121
- [Linna] Let me see!

441
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,055
Oh, it is.

442
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,725
(Linna and Priss chuckling)

443
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,998
- I can't believe I ate the whole thing.

444
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,035
Well, it's not really my fault anyway.

445
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,605
I wonder what Lisa was doing over at Sylia's place.

446
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,443
- Why, Nene, you're here early.

447
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,577
- [Nene] You betcha.

448
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,748
- Nene, wait up a second.

449
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,050
Work's just been piling up

450
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,785
since you started watching over Lisa.

451
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:00,786
The section chief's been saying

452
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,121
you gotta do your job here too.

453
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,423
Here.

454
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,825
He wants it taken care of today.

455
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,226
Good luck.

456
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,228
- [Nene] Hey, give me a hand.

457
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,431
- I'm busy with my own workload.

458
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,732
- [Nene] You're heartless.

459
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,204
- Morning, Nene, are we going any place today?

460
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,439
- I am sorry.

461
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,907
I've got so much work to do today.

462
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,710
I'm not gonna be able to spend much time with you at all.

463
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,046
I've got to finish all of this paperwork by tonight.

464
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:28,880
- Huh?

465
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,682
Oh, that's no fun.

466
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,150
- Hey, I know.

467
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,086
Today's payday, so I'm gonna take you out to eat

468
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,554
at a really nice place.

469
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,789
So could you please just.

470
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,526
- Okay, what will I do today?

471
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,863
(sighing gently)

472
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,364
- Lisa, you dropped something.

473
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,102
(Nene gasping)

474
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,772
(women giggling)

475
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,340
What is it?

476
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,842
- Wow, isn't it great.

477
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,844
I shot it during that incident the other night.

478
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,979
It's pretty enlarged, so the image is grainy,

479
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,614
I can't say for sure.

480
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,550
But, I think, I've seen this person before.

481
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,653
- Really, I can't tell who it is at all from this photo.

482
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,990
- I suppose, though I have the feeling

483
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,892
it looks like someone I know.

484
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,360
Must be my imagination.

485
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,662
- Too bad, you might have been on the verge

486
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,065
of finding out the Knight Saber's identities.

487
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,234
Well, I've gotta do this work until tonight,

488
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,237
so you be a good girl and go play somewhere until then.

489
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,271
Okay, Lisa. - Okay.

490
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,143
(door thuds)

491
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,278
- [Nene Voiceover] When did she get that picture?

492
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,780
Oh, this is bad.

493
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,448
At this rate, she may expose

494
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,183
the Knight Saber's true identities.

495
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,919
But a photo like that is hardly concrete evidence.

496
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,855
Somehow I have got to avert her suspicions.

497
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,459
- Hey, Lisa.

498
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,028
What are you doing down there?

499
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:50,862
- Shh.

500
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,433
Well, see I just thought I'd spoke Nene, that all.

501
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,234
- Hmm.

502
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,005
Right, then you just leave that kind of thing

503
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,073
to your old Uncle Leon.

504
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:07,078
- Oh, no, Mr. McNichol, that's not it.

505
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,048
- [Leon] Boo!

506
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:15,053
(metal crashing) (Nene gasping)

507
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,028
(dramatic music) - I know have 80%

508
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,164
of the data I need to finish my project.

509
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,699
One more data collection period

510
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,969
and even the Knight Sabers capabilities will be surpassed.

511
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,240
(chuckling gently)

512
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,542
But who was it that built them?

513
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,377
They easily defeated the boomer's built

514
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:42,314
with Genom's newest technologies.

515
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,016
Ha, but I can overcome anything with the brilliance

516
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,519
of my metal capabilities even Genom

517
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,020
or the forces of the Knight Sabers.

518
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,857
They are doomed once I finish this.

519
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,328
(upbeat music)

520
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,258
(gun firing)

521
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,386
(gentle music)

522
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,460
- Is it good? - Mm-hmm.

523
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,764
But this place must be pretty expensive.

524
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,732
- It's all right I can handle it.

525
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,669
(watch beeps) Hmm?

526
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:16,875
I'm sorry, I just remembered an important engagement.

527
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,709
Forgive me.

528
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,412
I'll take care of the bill on the way out,

529
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,947
so you just take your time.

530
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,114
I'll make it up to you.

531
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,282
- You promise?

532
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:29,554
(soft music playing in restaurant)

533
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,222
Even food like this doesn't taste good

534
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,657
when you eat it alone.

535
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:36,161
(dramatic chord striking)

536
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,369
She'll probably come back here when the fighting's done.

537
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,006
It's after one o'clock.

538
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,278
(footsteps approaching)

539
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,646
- What are you doing there?

540
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,948
It's dangerous for a girl

541
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,783
to be out alone this late at night.

542
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:00,952
- Who are you?

543
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,587
- [Sylia] The owner of a lingerie shop.

544
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,389
I live around here.

545
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,890
Are you waiting for someone?

546
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,194
- Well, you see.

547
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,696
I heard there was a ghost around here.

548
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,199
I thought I'd see if I could get some pictures.

549
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,233
(Lisa chuckles)

550
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,402
- [Sylia] Well, it's news to me.

551
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,070
Mind if I join you?

552
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,904
- Okay.

553
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,578
Um?

554
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:27,412
- What is it?

555
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,116
- Do you know about the Knight Sabers?

556
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,752
- Uh-huh, I've heard about them.

557
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,421
- Well, why do you suppose they fight boomers?

558
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,057
I hear they take their clients for lots of money.

559
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:44,062
But I wonder are they supposed to be the good guys?

560
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,463
I don't get it.

561
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,134
- So what do you think?

562
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,869
- Well, I don't know.

563
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,172
But fighting boomers means taking on Genom, doesn't it?

564
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,108
For a mere four people to take on

565
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,544
such a large corporation it's just.

566
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,148
Well, Genom produces a lot of things

567
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,583
that makes wars possible, right?

568
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:09,454
But they also make boomers that are useful to society.

569
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,057
And if the Knight Sabers manage to defeat Genom,

570
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,392
the world would come to a halt.

571
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,995
What I want to know is just what are the Knight Sabers

572
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,397
trying to accomplish?

573
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,266
- Well, what do you think would happen

574
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,803
if a corporation like Genom were to take over the world?

575
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,338
- I guess the cities would be wall to wall boomers.

576
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,740
- And if that were the case,

577
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,042
there'd be no place for us humans, right?

578
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,679
For every good thing Genom does for the world

579
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,115
it also does something bad.

580
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,317
I don't think the Knight Sabers could keep fighting

581
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,753
if they only did nice, clean jobs.

582
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,924
The development of boomers for military applications

583
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,060
also led to boomers that were useful to society.

584
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,062
- I think, that the world would be thrown into chaos

585
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,731
if this balance weren't carefully maintained.

586
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,801
Maybe the Knight Sabers are a part of that balance,

587
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,803
and to continue such activities

588
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:02,173
would require a great deal of money as well

589
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,575
or so I would imagine.

590
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:05,677
- Oh.

591
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:11,149
- If you get any pictures, please show them to me, okay?

592
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,417
- Huh?

593
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,251
Okay.

594
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,489
What is your name?

595
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,757
- Sylia, Sylia Stingray.

596
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,138
- You sure took your time.

597
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:38,143
(Sylia laughs) (engine revving)

598
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,049
(birds chirping)

599
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,952
- Lisa! - Huh?

600
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,220
(heavy breathing)

601
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,788
- I'm sorry about last night.

602
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,423
- You're always disappearing.

603
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,858
I'm used to to it by now.

604
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,126
- Really? - Yeah.

605
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,294
- [Nene] Well, just so that you know

606
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,596
I'm on night shift today, so I'll stay put.

607
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,465
- Really? - Really.

608
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,600
(Miriam chuckles)

609
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,302
- Finished at last.

610
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,837
Their performance specifications

611
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,839
completely exceed the Knight Sabers,

612
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,141
and look at this wonderful exterior.

613
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,111
These are completely different from Genom's clumsy boomers,

614
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,780
and they're my ticket out of this rinky-dink company.

615
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,749
I'll attack the A. D. Police for starters.

616
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,684
That should bring the Knight Sabers running

617
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,187
by hitting their first.

618
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,957
(Miriam laughing sinisterly)

619
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,931
- [Lia] Well, it looks like tomorrow

620
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,266
it's goodbye to this place.

621
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,169
- So you couldn't get enough for a scoop after all, huh?

622
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,604
- A scoop.

623
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,007
- Hmm, what is it?

624
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,311
- I've been searching for the true identifies

625
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,579
of the Knight Sabers.

626
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,914
But, unfortunately, I don't have anything

627
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,617
solid enough for a scoop.

628
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,751
- Oh, really.

629
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,228
- Uh, sir, you can't come in here without an ID card.

630
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,564
- Hey, you can't go past this point.

631
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,174
(tires screeching)

632
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,712
Okay, Mister, come on show me some ID.

633
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,546
(car crashing) What was that?

634
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,550
What are you doing?

635
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,087
- So what all did you find?

636
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,521
- Well, let's see.

637
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:34,292
That person in the photograph visits a strange garage,

638
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,894
sneaks away from work to go who knows where,

639
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,396
and gets facial injuries.

640
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,532
Unfortunately, that's all I could figure out.

641
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,703
- So, you still don't know who they are, huh?

642
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:48,706
- That's why I wish I could stay a little longer.

643
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,275
(loud explosion)

644
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,310
(alarm blaring) - An S alarm.

645
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,078
Something's happened downstairs.

646
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,048
Wait here, Lisa, I'll go see what's going on.

647
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,216
- Well, I'm coming too.

648
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,585
- No, just sit tight right here.

649
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,293
(guns firing)

650
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,296
(suspenseful music)

651
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,074
(machine whirring)

652
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,735
(metal clanking)

653
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,905
(machines whirring)

654
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:54,706
- Nene!

655
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,456
- What's going on?

656
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,362
(gasping deeply)

657
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,199
- What's happening?

658
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,169
- (chucking) Look at them.

659
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,138
The A. D. Police are as helpless

660
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,107
as babes in the woods against me.

661
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,477
Tomorrow's front page will immortalize my name.

662
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,645
(police siren wailing)

663
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,913
- What the hell's going on?

664
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,815
- Sir, it seems someone is occupying

665
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,650
the A. D. Police building.

666
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,619
- Just what do you mean someone?

667
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,254
- We still haven't figured that out, sir.

668
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:46,391
But we think it's probably terrorists using boomers.

669
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,459
Most of the people managed to escape.

670
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,129
But we think a handful are trapped inside.

671
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,997
- Where's Leon? - Inspector McNichol's

672
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,199
on his way to an incident in the west area.

673
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,868
- Contact him immediately.

674
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,802
- Yes, sir.

675
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,405
(radio beeping)

676
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,673
- Daley here.

677
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,042
- [Officer] Wanted squadron here.

678
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,178
We're going to make a forced landing on the roof.

679
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,480
(helicopters blades roaring)

680
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,282
There's one helicopter on the roof.

681
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,351
It's probably the attackers base (screams).

682
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,689
- This isn't working.

683
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,258
(Miriam chuckling)

684
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,826
- [Miriam] So how does it feel to have your house

685
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,761
snatched out from under you?

686
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,096
- This is your doing, huh?

687
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,597
What's your objective?

688
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,832
- [Miriam] My objective?

689
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,901
Why to demonstrate my power, of course.

690
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,736
- If you have any demands, let's hear them.

691
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,604
- [Miriam] Demands, I have none.

692
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,740
I'm just going to destroy this building.

693
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,508
- Hold it, what will that get you?

694
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:38,943
You'll be sorry when you get caught.

695
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,645
- [Miriam] Well, there is just one thing.

696
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,146
- What?

697
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,249
- [Miriam] The Knight Sabers try sending for them, can you?

698
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,052
I bet you can't do something even that pathetic.

699
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,655
Well, even if you don't, they'll probably come on their own.

700
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,123
So who cares.

701
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,091
(Miriam chuckling)

702
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:54,926
- Shit!

703
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,162
- They're all worse than useless.

704
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,531
Alright destroy anything in your way.

705
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,902
- Help, is anyone in there?

706
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,816
(Nene gasping)

707
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,051
- An explosion.

708
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,755
No way.

709
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,758
(dramatic music)

710
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:28,593
No.

711
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,330
(gun firing)

712
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:43,708
(Nene gasping)

713
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,180
No ammo.

714
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,014
What now?

715
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:51,849
Oh, no.

716
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,456
(loud explosion)

717
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,227
Oh, Priss.

718
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,631
- Nene. - Mackie.

719
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,899
- [Mackie] I brought your hard suit.

720
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,700
- [Priss] Leave this to me suit up quick.

721
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,936
- Will you be okay?

722
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,405
- Just do it. - Here we go.

723
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,912
- How many boomer intruders are there.

724
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,880
- [Mackie] My sensor scan show four.

725
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,049
They're being controlled from the rooftop.

726
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,852
- Then that means there's one in the main computer room.

727
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,455
There's a sub-control room on this floor.

728
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,124
Let's make contact from there.

729
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,534
The sub-control room is two blocks down.

730
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,535
Let's hurry.

731
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,537
Mackie, blow the door.

732
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,473
- Uh, right.

733
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,708
(Miriam chuckling)

734
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,743
- It's about time the Knight Sabers showed up.

735
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,912
Now I'll teach you my power.

736
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,881
(suspenseful music)

737
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,749
- [Sylia] This boomer seems tough.

738
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,985
Should make a good exercise for this new suit.

739
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,024
[Linna] So the previous fights were leading up to this one.

740
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,392
Fine, let's do it.

741
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,065
(machine beeps)

742
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,343
- [Nene] So that's it.

743
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,279
It's already subverted a good portion of the system.

744
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,547
Operate through a backdoor

745
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,616
and interrupt the control pathways.

746
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:35,086
Mackie, you watch out for attacks against our software.

747
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,354
- [Mackie] Right.

748
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,588
- [Nene] Oh, no!

749
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,523
Lisa's still up on the 28th floor.

750
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,693
Lisa, Lisa!

751
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,395
- Nene, what in the world's going on?

752
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,864
- [Nene] The building is being occupied by boomers.

753
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,099
- Huh?

754
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,767
- You'll soon be in danger there as well.

755
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,235
Now please do as I tell you.

756
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,804
- What are you going to do?

757
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,172
- [Nene] Right now I'm going to evacuate you

758
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,575
to a safe place. - I can't get out of here.

759
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,377
- [Nene] Don't worry leave it to me.

760
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,612
Mackie, I'm gonna briefly block the boomer's control

761
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,680
Mackie, I'm gonna brief block the boomer's control

762
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,781
and open the shudders.

763
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,116
- [Mackie] Okay.

764
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,986
- [Nene] Block 38 gate six.

765
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,354
The elevator isn't working.

766
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,257
The only choice is the emergency staircase in block 37.

767
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,160
Mackie, guard lines S-21 and A-55.

768
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,828
- Right. - I'm gonna open the shudder

769
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,330
right behind you for two seconds, Lisa.

770
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,165
Go through it at time.

771
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,068
Now go straight to the left hand door.

772
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,437
I'm blocking the circuit, so open it manually.

773
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,707
Now go down the stairs.

774
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,912
- Huh, what's this?

775
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:38,015
The Knight Sabers are resisting my boomer's virus.

776
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,784
Hmm, interesting.

777
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:40,851
Get rid of them.

778
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,723
- [Nene] Well, are we making any progress?

779
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,625
- [Mackie] The boomers' programs are infiltrating

780
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,427
in a fairly complicated manner.

781
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,828
This is gonna take sometime.

782
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,663
- Nene.

783
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,031
(wind blowing swiftly)

784
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,766
I can't go down any further.

785
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:57,702
Now what do I do?

786
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,137
- [Nene] If the stairs are out, the only choice

787
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,772
is the elevator shaft ladder.

788
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:02,973
Lisa, go back.

789
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,241
I'll help with the nearest door.

790
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,277
Then climbed down the elevator shaft ladder.

791
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,014
(Lisa gasping)

792
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,082
You can do it.

793
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,216
It's the only way down.

794
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,222
(dramatic music)

795
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,359
Just a little further hang in there.

796
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,731
(elevator whirring)

797
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,999
Huh, it's supposed to be up.

798
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,101
The boomer.

799
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,335
Mackie, do something.

800
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,536
Block the circuit.

801
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,171
- [Mackie] I may not make it in time!

802
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,206
- No!

803
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,707
Nene, please help!

804
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,243
- [Nene] There should be an air vent near you.

805
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,077
Go for it.

806
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,247
Lisa, climb, hurry!

807
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,715
Hurry!

808
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,451
Hurry, hurry up, hurry, come on!

809
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,187
(Lisa screaming)

810
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:56,727
- No, Nene, help me open this gate!

811
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,463
- [Nene] Mackie, can't you stop it?

812
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,631
- [Mackie] No!

813
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,771
- [Nene] Lisa, are you okay?

814
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,107
- Just peachy. - Oh, good.

815
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,842
Now go straight ahead from here.

816
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:14,512
- Fine.

817
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,652
- [Nene] Now go through the left gate, go.

818
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,387
Whoops, the other left.

819
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:24,221
- Liar!

820
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,866
- Soon they'll reach their performance limits.

821
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,235
Now finish them all off.

822
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,205
And eliminate that skittering little girl along with them.

823
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,877
(dramatic music)

824
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:51,749
(gun firing) (Lisa gasping)

825
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,884
- Help me, enough already!

826
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:04,228
This won't open!

827
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,130
- [Nene] Nerve gas, Lisa, there's nerve gas.

828
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,531
Hold your breath!

829
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,042
My unit along doesn't have enough power.

830
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:18,876
Back me up.

831
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,917
- [Priss] Oh, shit.

832
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:30,154
- Don't you think that I know what you're capable of doing?

833
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,723
(Priss grunts)

834
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,796
These boomers aren't so fragile that would break them.

835
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,365
(Priss grunts)

836
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,304
No, no, it can't be.

837
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,743
- A while back a boomer broke my arm.

838
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,045
This is payback.

839
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,447
- I can't believe it.

840
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,249
They've been upgraded.

841
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,159
- Wanna see some more?

842
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:28,679
(electricity whirring)

843
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,948
- [Nene] Ah, still a spore.

844
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,285
(Nene breathing deeply)

845
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,257
- Nene!

846
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,637
Knight Sabers.

847
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,409
- [Priss] Jobs done, the others are on their way.

848
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,089
- Nene, you really are one of the Knight Sabers.

849
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,230
- It's unbelievable.

850
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,533
They've destroyed my masterpieces, unforgivable.

851
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,901
It's come to this.

852
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,402
I'll overload the buildings electrical system,

853
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,572
and blow the A. D. Police and the Knight Sabers sky high.

854
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,341
I leave that up to you.

855
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:35,879
(alert beeping)

856
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,649
- [Nene] What, an explosion.

857
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,317
Time is running out.

858
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,490
(suspenseful music) (officer gasping)

859
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,125
- My god.

860
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,094
- [Sylia] Can you do anything about it?

861
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,962
- [Nene] I don't know.

862
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,732
You take Lisa and get out of here.

863
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,800
- [Sylia] But what about you?

864
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,168
- [Nene] I'm gonna try and stop it.

865
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,470
- [Sylia] There isn't time.

866
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,506
- [Nene] I can't just runaway.

867
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,708
I don't wanna lose the A. D. Police.

868
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,642
I'll figure something out.

869
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:07,611
Now get yourselves out of here.

870
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:11,115
- [Priss] Well, for now let's get her someplace safe.

871
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:18,322
- Nene.

872
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,424
- [Nene] Mackie.

873
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,027
- [Mackie] I'll help you.

874
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,728
It's too much for just one person.

875
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,401
- [Nene] Seal off the boomer's circuits.

876
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,870
Meanwhile, I'll isolate the electrical system.

877
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,737
- [Mackie] Right.

878
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:39,276
- Blow all the Knight Sabers and the A. D. Police to pieces.

879
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,110
Huh?

880
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,047
- [Officer] A. D. Police give yourself up.

881
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,919
- Hey, do you think Nene is gonna be all right?

882
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,222
- Yeah. - She'll be okay.

883
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,190
Trust in here.

884
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:56,827
- Nene.

885
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,398
(dramatic music)

886
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,068
(Mackie typing)

887
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,976
(Lisa gasping)

888
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:13,811
Nene!

889
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,083
(officers grunting)

890
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,086
- [Nene] We did it.

891
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,321
By causing a power feedback along the boomer's circuits,

892
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,523
we managed to force it to self-destruct.

893
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:29,193
- [Sylia] Well done.

894
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:35,632
- Sylia, Priss, Linna, you all waited for me.

895
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,201
Thank you.

896
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,870
(gentle music)

897
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,609
- [Sylia] Let's go.

898
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,947
(gentle music)

899
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:10,134
- So, the star makes his entrance, huh?

900
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,835
- Yeah, right.

901
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:12,669
Boomers?

902
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,606
- All destroyed looks like the Knight Sabers

903
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,207
saved our ass again.

904
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,909
- Hey, Lisa, you made it out.

905
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,644
Are you doing okay?

906
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,147
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

907
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:23,981
Hmm?

908
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,987
(Lisa giggling)

909
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,162
(metal clanking)

910
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,463
- It's really trashed.

911
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,864
- Yeah.

912
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,399
- [Lisa] Good morning.

913
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,534
- Oh, Lisa, good morning.

914
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,601
I saw the paper.

915
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,503
You got your scoop after all.

916
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,673
- Uh-huh, though I did get a little scolding from my uncle.

917
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,475
Well, this is goodbye, Nene.

918
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,709
It's been fun.

919
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,578
I've got a farewell present for you.

920
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,480
- Hmm?

921
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,182
(dramatic music)

922
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,016
- So long.

923
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,352
- What is it?

924
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,687
Open it and see.

925
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,293
(Nene gasping)

926
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,794
Let me see.

927
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,629
- It's nothing.

928
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:13,964
- That means it's a man.

929
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,199
- It's not I tell you.

930
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,333
- Well, then let me see.

931
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,502
- No way. - Oh, Nene.

932
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,836
Give it to me. - Stop.

933
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,841
