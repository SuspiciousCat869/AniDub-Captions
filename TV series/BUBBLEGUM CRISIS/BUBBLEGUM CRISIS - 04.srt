(dramatic music)

6
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,904
- [Voice On Radio] That black car is at it again.

7
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,640
Heading west on Bayshore number three near Heneda.

8
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,043
All units in the vicinity, respond at once.

9
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,277
Don't lose him this time.

10
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,117
- [Leon] Hey David, what did he mean by that black car?

11
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,421
- You mean you didn't hear about it at today's meeting?

12
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,956
- Nah, I was asleep.

13
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,158
- [David] There's a rebuilt Griffon popping up

14
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,593
around here at night.

15
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,995
He keeps trashing outriders, but no fatalities yet

16
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,763
so it's being treated as horseplay

17
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,565
that's gotten out of hand.

18
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,367
The highway patrol can't cope.

19
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,704
- Ha, so someone's actually driving

20
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,472
one of those antique Griffons.

21
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,576
- Huh?

22
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,951
Oh look at that one go, it looks pretty souped up.

23
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,019
- Yeah, I know.

24
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,355
- What?

25
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,156
- She's my singing sweetheart.

26
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,566
- [Voice On Radio] Calling all AD police units,

27
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,534
TH video requests assistance.

28
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,335
Respond if you're nearby.

29
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,738
- Man, what a bunch of old ladies.

30
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,907

- Band sounds as good as ever.

36
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,424
Huh? This engine's a gas guzzler.

37
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,426
- [Radio DJ] We have another accident report this morning.

38
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:17,096
Let's get the details from Mr. Drinkwater in the newsroom.

39
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,698
- [Mr. Drinkwater] Outrider casualties are mounting

40
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,101
and there's something very unusual about the situation.

41
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,610
- Hey, did you spend all night on that?

42
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,512
You really work hard.

43
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,947
Doesn't Celia worry about you?

44
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,082
- I'm too old for that.

45
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,617
- [Priss] Oh no you're not.

46
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,118
Where's pops?

47
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,921
- If you mean Dr. Raven, I think he's in the back.

48
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,559
- Pops, yo pops, it's me, Priss, fill 'er up.

49
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,061
- Call me Doctor.

50
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,229
How many times do I have to tell you?

51
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,265
Call me Doctor!

52
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,967
- Oh, there you are, pops.

53
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,869
Give me a tank full of Raven special.

54
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,304
- (groans) Doctor!

55
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,408
- Oh what a beaut.

56
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:05,912
What's she got?

57
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,950
- It's a twin turbo 1500, so about 700 horsepower.

58
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,218
- Whoa.

59
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,686
- The drive train works with a shaft

60
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,455
that doesn't use viscous oil.

61
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,057
That way there's little lag time or loss.

62
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,960
The instrumentation comes from combat hardware,

63
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,529
the new HS-130 to be exact.

64
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,832
There was one buried in the junkyard out back.

65
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,166
Can you believe that?

66
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,337
- You've really put something incredible together here.

67
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,140
Let me ride her.

68
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,341
- Huh?

69
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,876
- She's all finished, right?

70
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,411
So start her up.

71
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,346
- But it's just something I've put together for fun.

72
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,981
It's not something you can really ride--

73
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:46,986
- Be a good boy, Mackie, and do what I tell you to do, okay?

74
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,155
- Okay.

75
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,825
(engine revs)

76
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,103
(screaming)

77
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,174
- Damn it!

78
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,008
- Strike one.

79
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,580
- [Priss] I swear, this bike shouldn't guzzle gas

80
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,515
like it does.

81
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,316
- [Doctor] Can't be helped.

82
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:19,652
To get the power output you ordered, it has to.

83
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,255
- Hey pops.

84
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,289
- [Doctor] Yeah.

85
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,957
- Who's in this picture, pops?

86
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,559
- [Doctor] Doctor.

87
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,960
- Huh?

88
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,462
- I told you to call me Doctor.

89
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,897
- Alright, okay.

90
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,805
Okay, thanks a lot pops.

91
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,139
- [Both] Doctor!

92
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,078
(children playing)

93
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,001
(groaning)

94
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,086
(engines revving)

95
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:35,328
(dramatic music) (screaming)

96
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,117
(upbeat music)

97
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,296
(gunshots)

98
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,571
(groans)

99
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,274
- Alright, that's far enough.

100
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,076
Thank you very much.

101
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,145
(gunshots)

102
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,581
I planted an anti-personnel mod.

103
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,950
Lift your foot, and it goes off.

104
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,885
- Great, we lost again?

105
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,221
- Leave it to Celia to sacrifice Nene.

106
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,191
- [Woman] Come on, a bet's a bet.

107
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,960
Linna, do you mind?

108
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,663
- If we're paying for this, I'm gonna get my money's worth.

109
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,831
Come on, eat.

110
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,704
- So anyway, suddenly the jobs have stopped coming,

111
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,005
haven't they?

112
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,506
- Precisely.

113
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,976
- Well, no jobs for us, you know what that means.

114
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,278
- Peace on earth, huh?

115
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,013
Yeah, right.

116
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,781
- But no work is no good you know,

117
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,751
I wanna buy new clothes and trade in my old car.

118
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,720
- On the other hand, it's nice to be able to make time

119
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,989
to see your boyfriend, right?

120
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:43,990
- What's that?

121
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,758
You've got a boyfriend?

122
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,093
- Who do you mean?

123
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:51,464
Oh, that guy's already ancient history.

124
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,698
- How depressing.

125
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,234
- Uh, someday I'll be a 3D artist.

126
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,903
Who cares about art?

127
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,938
He was always talking about his dreams.

128
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,641
It's like he had no sense of reality.

129
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,943
- Well if you ask me, that was a waste Linna.

130
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,413
Oh, if it were me, even if we were poor,

131
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,549
so long as we both loved each other.

132
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,418
I'd want to be with him forever.

133
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,055
Oh I want a passionate love too and soon!

134
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,760
- Oh give me a break, you and your dreams.

135
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,062
You have no sense of reality.

136
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,630
- Ooh, you're so mean!

137
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,866
(laughter)

138
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,636
What is so funny?

139
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,672
You're always making fun of me!

140
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,840
I could get myself a man if I wanted to,

141
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,776
anytime I felt like it!

142
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,722
(drill whirs)

143
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:54,560
- Hmm.

144
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,204
(engine starts)

145
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,258
(backfires)

146
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,001
(sighs)

147
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,437
(laughs)

148
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,420
(explosion)

149
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,089
(brakes screeching)

150
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,392
(explosion)

151
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,898
- I'm already broke this month and then this sets me back.

152
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,433
This is not funny.

153
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,439
Just thinking about it pisses me off, man.

154
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,207
Things couldn't get any worse.

155
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:22,948
Asshole!

156
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,054
Hey, you alright?

157
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,359
Real funny, you son of a bitch.

158
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,527
Just you wait!

159
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,473
(alarms sound)

160
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,015
(groaning)

161
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,821
- Linna, the waist on this skirt you lent me is too big.

162
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,156
- What? No way!

163
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,323
What's your size?

164
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,558
- Uh, what's yours?

165
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,028
- That is none of your business.

166
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,199
(giggles)

167
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,635
Hey come on, quit dragging your feet.

168
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,738
- This is so stupid.

169
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,574
I don't need to have a doctor examine me.

170
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,543
- Considering all the stupid things you do,

171
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,244
you most certainly do.

172
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,446
You're gonna have a complete checkup

173
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,849
and get all your old injuries fixed.

174
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:37,783
Let's see.

175
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,251
Surgery is the blue line.

176
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,921
- Which way?

177
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,422
- [Linna] Come on, come on.

178
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,491
I told you, the blue line.

179
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,726
- Slow down, will you?

180
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,028
I'm a casualty.

181
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,168
Ow, look where you're going.

182
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,171
- [Linna] Look, look, that one's not too bad.

183
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,740
- So what? He's got a girl.

184
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,410
Man, is that an obnoxious crew.

185
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,511
- Not like you at all.

186
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,381
(engines roaring)

187
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,968
(screaming)

188
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,135
- [Nene] What?

189
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,737
You should do that stuff at Celia's place.

190
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,540
You can access computers anywhere in the world from there.

191
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,008
- [Priss] No can do.

192
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,644
Celia won't let me use her system for personal business.

193
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,079
- [Nene] Same here.

194
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,814
What do you think would happen if somebody caught us?

195
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,949
- [Priss] It'll be all right, I tell you.

196
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,384
It will only take a moment, now get a move on.

197
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,486
- [Nene] Oh it's always something like this with you.

198
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,456
You can pay me back by taking me out to eat.

199
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,591
- [Priss] Girl, all you think about is eating.

200
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,892
- [Nene] Okay, here's a list

201
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,794
of Griffons registered in Tokyo.

202
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,330
The model all but disappeared five or six years ago.

203
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,800
Presently, there are, let's see, four left.

204
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,136
All the owners are pretty ancient.

205
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,671
Hey, look at this guy!

206
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,907
He's 74 years old, I wonder if he's even capable of driving.

207
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,744
- Hmm, an aging bunch of collectors, huh?

208
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,413
Well it was an import aimed at enthusiasts.

209
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,216
Think you can bring up the list from three years back?

210
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,350
- Sure, just a sec.

211
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,053
We're up two, to a total of six.

212
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,423
- [Priss] Okay, get me the full rundown on those two.

213
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,724
- [Nene] Okay.

214
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,593
This one changed hands two years ago.

215
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,529
The current owner is J.B. Gibson, age 28.

216
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,665
He had an accident six months ago

217
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,134
and the registration was purged this past spring

218
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,535
after it expired.

219
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,604
- What can you tell me about that accident?

220
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,139
- Hmm, let me see.

221
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,707
What the?

222
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,742
There's a protection block on this level.

223
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,613
Oh hold on, I know.

224
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,348
I've got the chief's voice on disc.

225
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,351
- [Chief Toto] Chief Toto.

226
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,887
- [Nene] There, now we're clear for level four.

227
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,689
- Damn, you're good.

228
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,490
A passenger vehicle driven by J.B. Gibson

229
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,827
was waylayed on the lower deck of highway three

230
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,030
by the outrider gang and collided with the guard rail.

231
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,932
He was seriously assaulted,

232
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,201
suffered five compound fractures.

233
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,905
His passenger, Naomi Anderson, was also hospitalized,

234
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,007
suffering from extreme shock.

235
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,110
Hmm, J.B. Gibson.

236
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,917
- Hey, who the hell's in here?

237
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,552
- (gasps) Get down!

238
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,686
- Oh, it's you Nene.

239
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,222
What are you doing?

240
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,592
- Oh, just running an inquiry into the data

241
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,428
on the McPherson case.

242
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,664
- So are you free after work?

243
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,633
- Oh, my mom will get mad if I don't go straight home.

244
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,568
Ciao!

245
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,103
- Well, say hi to mom for me.

246
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,614
- Hi.

247
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,448
- Hi.

248
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,019
I was beginning to think I'd been abandoned.

249
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,855
- You can't just sit in front of a police station

250
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,356
forever, you know.

251
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,126
I ended up circling the AD police complex seven times.

252
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,794
- Oops, sorry.

253
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,195
- Your chariot awaits.

254
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,598
Where to now m'lady?

255
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,200
- I want a beer and a burger, now.

256
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,707
(grinding)

257
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,782
- It's my last request.

258
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,284
Doc, you have to give me the MFS control unit

259
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,920
or I'll never be able to fully use the car.

260
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,689
- [Doctor] You fool, what are you talking about?

261
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,258
If I'd known what you were going to do,

262
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,160
I'd never have built the thing.

263
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,495
It's not that I don't understand how you feel

264
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,531
but that's all in the past now.

265
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,633
Forget it and think of the future.

266
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,134
Make Naomi happy!

267
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,936
- Don't talk to me about Naomi!

268
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,674
- Gibson.

269
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,583
(engine revs)

270
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,186
- So, who's Mr. Sunshine?

271
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,707
(gunshots)

272
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,084
- Cut that out or take it someplace else, asshole!

273
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,621
(gunshots)

274
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,671
(creepy music)

275
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,915
(explosion)

276
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,716
- Yo!

277
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,050
- Hello?

278
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,318
- Hey there, pops.

279
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,520
- If it's the bike you want, it's in the back.

280
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,222
Don't do anything reckless.

281
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,858
Lives and motorcycles don't last forever, you know.

282
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:01,860
- Yeah, sure.

283
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,694
What the?

284
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,099
- Hey, it's those two.

285
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,867
- I thought they looked suspicious

286
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,669
when we saw them at the hospital.

287
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,371
- [Doctor] Hospital you say?

288
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,007
- Yes, that woman was in a wheelchair.

289
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,309
- Yeah and she freaked out at the sound of motorcycles.

290
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,444
- She was out of her mind.

291
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,446
- [Doctor] So that's what Gibson meant, damn it.

292
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,015
- Gibson!

293
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:23,915
You know him?

294
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,350
- Well, kind of.

295
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,253
(phone rings)

296
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,255
- Hello Ravens, Doctor speaking.

297
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,957
Hello? Gibson?

298
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,293
Gibson, it's you, isn't it Gibson?

299
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,527
Answer me, Gibson!

300
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,463
Gibson, answer me.

301
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:40,999
- Pops.

302
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,702
- [Doctor] Where are you, you idiot?

303
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,972
I heard about Naomi, now don't do anything stupid.

304
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:55,147
Priss, uh, I mean...

305
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,816
I have a request to make of the Night Sabers.

306
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,352
Stop that fool Gibson.

307
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,287
- The Griffon, right?

308
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,122
- [Doctor] How did you know?

309
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,058
- So I'm right.

310
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,676
- Gibson!

311
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,610
J.B. Gibson!

312
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,186
J.B. Gibson!

313
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,391
(gunshots)

314
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,394
Hold it!

315
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,506
(engine starts)

316
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,858
(tires screech)

317
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,500
(gunshots)

318
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,369
- Anyway, he'll be a disaster unless we save them.

319
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,371
Celia, are you listening to me?

320
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,205
- I've got it.

321
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,740
So what about our fee?

322
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,343
- No problem, no problem.

323
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,613
Pops says he'll upgrade our motoroids for free.

324
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,947
- Hey, what are you talking about?

325
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,750
I didn't say word one about any such thing.

326
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,886
- Big deal, for you that's cheap.

327
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,354
- Well okay.

328
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,157
We can hardly refuse a request from Doctor Raven.

329
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,561
(exciting music)

330
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,902
- [Voice On Radio] This is Adam 13.

331
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,170
We have made contact with the Griffon.

332
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,338
He's on SK Avenue heading toward Takaito.

333
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,707
Requesting immediate assistance.

334
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,976
- Out of my way, move it you fool!

335
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,653
- [Voice On Radio] Calling all highway patrol units,

336
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,788
we have requested AD police assistance.

337
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,957
They have established a roadblock on Bayshore one.

338
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,359
Chase the bastard to them, do whatever it takes.

339
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,598
- [Linna] What kind of motorcycle is that?

340
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,266
- Mackie built it.

341
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,136
It's the only thing we've got that can catch the Griffon.

342
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,439
- Where's Nene?

343
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,308
- She'll be at AD police headquarters,

344
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,577
updating us on the situation.

345
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:39,911
Alright, let's go.

346
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,917
(sirens) (exciting music)

347
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,752
(explosion)

348
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,777
- Do you read me?

349
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,580
Listen, the Griffon's on the upper deck of highway four.

350
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,482
AD police is ready and waiting.

351
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,451
They set a trap on eastbound Bayshore one.

352
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,953
They're gonna chase him down the loop

353
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,321
of highway number nine.

354
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,890
- [Linna] Got it, thanks.

355
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,859
You heard her, Priss, Gibson's a goner

356
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,295
unless we stop him before he hits the Bayshore.

357
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,829
- [Priss] Okay, okay.

358
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,664
Let's do it.

359
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,181
- [Leon] Getting this hunk of scrap up here

360
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,449
must have really took some doing, huh?

361
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,184
- [David] Yeah, nobody's gonna just waltz up here

362
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,186
and punch through armor like this.

363
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,420
- No way.

364
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,923
Tonight's the end of the road for that bastard.

365
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,562
- [Voice On Radio] Report from Adam 12,

366
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:11,930
the Griffon has slipped into the loop

367
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,698
and is now on highway number nine.

368
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,351
- [Gibson] Nao, are you alright?

369
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,753
- Where are we?

370
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,821
Gib, what's going on?

371
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,056
- Naomi, are you--

372
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,758
- [Naomi] What have you done to yourself, Gib?

373
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,659
What have you done to this car?

374
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,094
- Nao, you're all right.

375
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,663
- Nevermind, just stop the car!

376
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,370
(screaming)

377
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,006
Gib!

378
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,588
- [Voice On Radio] Griffon sighted.

379
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,058
Something seems peculiar, I'm going to get closer.

380
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,126
Presently, 11 kilometers from the barricade.

Transmitting visuals.

384
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:31,876

Don't die!

Watch this.

There's no way I can fix it.
