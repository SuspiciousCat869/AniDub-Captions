00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:13.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHY] In every story
you hear about great heroes,

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:16.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
there is always a villain
they have to face.

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:21.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even in an age without war
or conflict.

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:24.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
The world still needs heroes.

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:28.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] Although the world
may be free of war,

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:31.534 position:7% line:83% align:start
there is a darkness that exists
in everyone's heart

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
that they do not wish
for anyone else to see.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
No matter who we are,
that shadow lives within us.

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:41.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
There are those
who shun the light

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:44.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
and take advantage
of the dark instead.

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:47.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
Shy, understand this.

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
The true duty of a hero,

00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:53.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
is to be a shining
beacon of hope for the people.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
And, to protect
the very heart of the world.

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:01.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Right now,
the world is facing

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:03.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
a being with the ability
to unlock a heart.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:06.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
By placing a mysterious ring
on their finger,

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:09.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
it releases the dark emotions
people hold inside them,

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:12.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
forcing them to change
into a monstrous form.

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
They even targeted my school.

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:17.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
And Iko Koishikawa
was their victim.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
[STIGMA] This world
is filled to the brim

00:01:19.334 --> 00:01:21.033 position:21% line:89% align:start
with so many hearts.

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:22.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
But they're all locked away,

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:26.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
confined deep within
their human-shaped prisons.

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:28.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
I will annihilate them all,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
each and every cage
you've created

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:32.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
to hide your hearts.

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:34.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
I mean, look!

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:39.200 position:7% line:89% align:start
A heart's true form, really is,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.200 position:10% line:89% align:start
a beautiful sight to behold.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
Stigma.

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:48.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
What does he stand to gain?

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's his motive?

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:51.868 position:27% line:89% align:start
And how about me?

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:53.801 position:10% line:89% align:start
Will I be able to fight him?

00:01:54.334 --> 00:01:57.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Can I really be a hero
people can rely on?

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
[STIGMA] Heroes have
destroyed countless hearts.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
They choose which feelings
are acceptable,

00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:10.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
then lock the rest away.

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:16.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now the hearts
that have been left behind,

00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:19.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
want nothing more than
to put an end to this world.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
But don't worry,

00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:25.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
we don't have to destroy
the world itself.

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:29.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
We just need to annihilate
the heroes.

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:42.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Now..

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:47.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
Together, we'll return
the world to its proper state.

00:04:24.734 --> 00:04:25.868 position:35% line:89% align:start
[IKO] Wow!

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
You really figured out
how to use

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
your heart's fire powers?

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.033 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Yeah.
Though I don't have

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:32.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
perfect control
over them just yet.

00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:34.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
Piltz gave me
a lot of encouragement,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I need to get better
so I can stop making

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:37.901 position:13% line:89% align:start
Pepesha worry all the time.

00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:40.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
I need to work even harder,

00:04:40.434 --> 00:04:42.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
so I can use them
to their fullest.

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:46.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're doing it for Piltz
and Pepesha.

00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:47.601 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:50.000 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Is everything all right?

00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:51.534 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:53.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, it's nothing,
I just got lost in thought,

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:54.501 position:35% line:89% align:start
that's all.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY] Teru.
[SHY] Yes, Shrimpy?

00:04:57.634 --> 00:04:59.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're being summoned
by Unilord.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:02.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
She wants you to head to
the space station immediately.

00:05:02.934 --> 00:05:04.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
Right. I'm coming.

00:05:04.334 --> 00:05:06.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm really sorry, Koishikawa.

00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:09.100 position:47% line:83% align:start
No.
Your hero work is important.

00:05:09.234 --> 00:05:10.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just know I'll be here
cheering you on

00:05:10.968 --> 00:05:12.434 position:19% line:89% align:start
every step of the way.

00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:14.067 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:23.634 position:35% line:83% align:start
Fight hard.
You can do this.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] We've received
an international request

00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:33.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
for emergency mobilization.

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
Though, we don't have
all the details

00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:36.868 position:27% line:89% align:start
of the situation,

00:05:37.534 --> 00:05:39.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
I need you both to head
to the source

00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:40.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
of the distress call

00:05:40.968 --> 00:05:43.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
and investigate
the situation on the ground.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, you only want Pepesha
and I to go?

00:05:46.467 --> 00:05:48.000 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
No. Another hero

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:50.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
has already been deployed
to the location

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
and will meet you two there.

00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:53.267 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Another hero's going?

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
I-I hope it's someone
I've met before.

00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:57.634 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
And dress warmly,

00:05:57.767 --> 00:05:59.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
as you're going
to the North Pole.

00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:01.968 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Shy gasps]
The-the North Pole?

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.567 position:30% line:89% align:start
But why there?

00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:06.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] Multiple nations
have research expedition teams

00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.000 position:10% line:89% align:start
stationed at the North Pole.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
We speculate that an accident
may have occurred

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:11.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
involving one of those teams,

00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:15.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
but the North Pole
isn't part of any one nation.

00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:17.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that's why you need
a few of us heroes

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:19.033 position:7% line:89% align:start
to go there and see what's up.

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:20.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did I get that right?

00:06:21.434 --> 00:06:23.801 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
Spirit. And Shy.

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:26.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
Your mission is to find out
what's happening,

00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:29.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
and resolve the issue
as swiftly as possible.

00:06:29.334 --> 00:06:31.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
If you don't succeed.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
You get no more snacks!

00:06:38.133 --> 00:06:39.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
That was a joke.

00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:41.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
I promise, you can have snacks.

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please, just laugh.

00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:55.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's freezing.

00:06:55.534 --> 00:06:58.033 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is this really the North Pole?

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:00.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
Right. Let's go
get the details, yeah?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.000 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Lookin' a bit cold there.

00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:04.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] You all right?
[SHY] Wait,

00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:06.534 position:35% line:83% align:start
do you mean
that you're not cold?

00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:09.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
[OLD MALE MEMBER 6A]
Hey! Wake up!

00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:11.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] Huh?
[SHY] Huh?

00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:12.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
[OLD MALE 6A] If you sleep
here, you'll freeze to death!

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:15.868 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on!

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
[MIANLONG] It's cold.
So tired.

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:21.701 position:24% line:89% align:start
Five more minutes.

00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:25.133 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sleeping?

00:07:25.801 --> 00:07:28.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Oh dear.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
[OLD MALE 6A]
Spirit! Thank goodness.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've got to do
something about this.

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:36.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wait, did you say "Spirit"?

00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:37.634 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:40.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
Time to wake up.

00:07:42.968 --> 00:07:44.200 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.467 position:33% line:83% align:start
Good morning,
it's nice to meet you!

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
Especially you, Shy!
It's a pleasure!

00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:52.601 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm Mianlong.
I'm China's hero.

00:07:55.734 --> 00:07:57.634 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MIANLONG]
This is a real pleasure.

00:07:57.834 --> 00:07:59.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, likewise.

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:02.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry this is how we're
meeting for the first time.

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:05.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
[exhales] I guess
this means the hero

00:08:05.634 --> 00:08:07.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
that was dispatched before us
was you, Mianlong.

00:08:08.567 --> 00:08:10.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know, I haven't had
any Shaoxing wine

00:08:10.734 --> 00:08:11.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
in a little while.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
I should stop by China
after this.

00:08:16.334 --> 00:08:17.701 position:33% line:83% align:start
[OLD MALE 6A]
Maybe I could debrief you

00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:19.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
before you start drinking?

00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:20.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
[SPIRIT] Ah.

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:23.133 position:33% line:83% align:start
[OLD MALE 6A]
The emergency signal

00:08:23.267 --> 00:08:25.000 position:35% line:83% align:start
we received
came from 200 kilometers

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:26.400 position:24% line:89% align:start
northeast of here.

00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:29.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
The research vessel,
Dimitri appears to have been

00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:31.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
damaged by a large ice floe,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.734 position:7% line:83% align:start
but we haven't heard from them
since the accident.

00:08:34.267 --> 00:08:36.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
[OLD MALE 6A] We can't
afford to waste any time.

00:08:36.467 --> 00:08:38.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please, accompany our team
to rescue them.

00:08:38.934 --> 00:08:39.968 position:41% line:89% align:start
Roger!

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.501 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
I'm impressed.

00:08:41.634 --> 00:08:43.501 position:7% line:89% align:start
Pepesha's usually pretty drunk,

00:08:43.634 --> 00:08:45.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I guess she sobers up
when it matters.

00:08:45.934 --> 00:08:49.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've gotta work extra hard
to be a great hero like her.

00:08:49.567 --> 00:08:52.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
We've got the rescue helicopter
prepped and ready to go, sir.

00:08:52.834 --> 00:08:54.167 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Right!
-Right!

00:09:01.901 --> 00:09:03.234 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:10.834 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:12.200 position:38% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Um.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
I need to say something.

00:09:15.234 --> 00:09:17.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
Maybe I should talk about
the mission?

00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:18.767 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, so..!

00:09:19.033 --> 00:09:21.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was really hoping
that I would get the chance

00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:23.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
-to talk to you two today.
-Huh?

00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:25.901 position:35% line:83% align:start
You're both
just so unbelievably amazing.

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:27.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, I was hoping
you would hear me out.

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:31.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's why I came
on this mission, actually.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
I need your help.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
I, I get asking Pepesha,

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I dunno how much help
I would be.

00:09:37.434 --> 00:09:39.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
What's with the serious tone,
kiddo?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
Did you not get
enough sleep earlier?

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, I didn't,
but that's not why.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.033 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MIANLONG]
You see, something happened.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.234 position:7% line:89% align:start
Stigma appeared in my country.

00:09:50.968 --> 00:09:53.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
I managed to get the situation
under control but I...

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:54.834 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:55.567 --> 00:09:57.300 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
I saw that on the news!

00:09:57.801 --> 00:10:00.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MIANLONG] Shy, I had heard
you were able to take care

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:03.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
of one of Stigma's victims
without fighting them.

00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:05.400 position:24% line:89% align:start
See, the truth is,

00:10:05.534 --> 00:10:07.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm not really the best
at fighting.

00:10:08.467 --> 00:10:10.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
[MIANLONG] I've heard
over and over that a hero

00:10:10.334 --> 00:10:11.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
needs to know how to battle.

00:10:12.467 --> 00:10:14.000 position:35% line:83% align:start
But I wish
that I could protect people

00:10:14.133 --> 00:10:16.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
without having to fight anyone,
you know?

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is it cowardly for me
to want that, though?

00:10:19.868 --> 00:10:22.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
Am I less manly
if I don't want to fight?

00:10:22.968 --> 00:10:24.234 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
The thing is,

00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:25.634 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm kinda like that, too,

00:10:25.767 --> 00:10:27.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
'cause I don't
really wanna fight.

00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:30.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
But you shouldn't be worried
about being manly.

00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:32.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
I mean, after all,

00:10:32.467 --> 00:10:34.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
you're a girl,
the same as I am!

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.567 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MIANLONG]
No way.

00:10:38.534 --> 00:10:39.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Huh?

00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:41.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Oh, Teru.

00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:44.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
Pepesha! I..
What did I do?

00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:47.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, it's rude to just
assume someone's gender.

00:10:47.434 --> 00:10:49.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
You need to be more
considerate than that.

00:10:49.834 --> 00:10:51.300 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
What do you mean?

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!

00:10:53.734 --> 00:10:56.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
I didn't mean it. You have
such a cute face so I...

00:10:56.934 --> 00:10:59.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] Now you're just
rubbing salt in the wound.

00:11:03.634 --> 00:11:04.901 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MALE PILOT 6A]
We're approaching the location

00:11:05.033 --> 00:11:06.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
of the signal.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
Rescue squad here!

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:11.934 position:21% line:89% align:start
Transmitting clearly.

00:11:12.067 --> 00:11:13.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
Come in, team Dimitri, come in.

00:11:13.734 --> 00:11:16.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
I repeat, come in,
team Dimitri over.

00:11:18.133 --> 00:11:19.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MALE PILOT 6B]
We've received no answer.

00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:21.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
Perhaps they're unable
to answer,

00:11:21.334 --> 00:11:23.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
or didn't receive the message?

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:26.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, something's wrong
with the ice down in the water.

00:11:26.767 --> 00:11:28.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MALE PILOT 6A] It's sprouting
upwards like spikes.

00:11:29.067 --> 00:11:30.868 position:30% line:89% align:start
[awe] So cool!

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
I didn't know ice grew like
that here in the North Pole!

00:11:33.767 --> 00:11:35.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MALE PILOT 6A] It doesn't.
This is the first time

00:11:35.667 --> 00:11:36.767 position:33% line:89% align:start
I've seen...

00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:39.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Teru! Mianlong!

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
Get everyone out of here!

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.501 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:11:48.968 --> 00:11:50.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
What happened?

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Did the helicopter
just malfunction?

00:11:56.467 --> 00:11:58.701 position:19% line:89% align:start
[TZVETA] Ah, it's cold.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.701 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so cold.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can feel that there are
warm hearts here.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who's there?

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.968 position:38% line:83% align:start
I wonder,
if I were to destroy them,

00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:13.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
would I be able to be
warm like them?

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.701 position:33% line:89% align:start
[SPIRIT] Huh?

00:12:25.767 --> 00:12:28.801 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:30.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TZVETA]
Oh, my.

00:12:34.133 --> 00:12:35.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
Caught you, little ice queen!

00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:38.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ah. You're one of
Stigma's victims, right?

00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:39.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't you worry, Hun.

00:12:39.834 --> 00:12:41.234 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'll just..

00:12:43.767 --> 00:12:46.400 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] Hey!
[TZVETA] His victim?

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't be so quick
to assume

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:51.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
the feelings and motivations
of other people,

00:12:51.367 --> 00:12:53.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
you'll destroy their hearts.

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:54.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
[SPIRIT] Huh?

00:12:54.734 --> 00:12:58.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
Didn't anyone bother
to teach you that as a child?

00:13:01.767 --> 00:13:03.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
No! Pepesha!

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:06.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
Aw, man, she ruined my hat.

00:13:06.601 --> 00:13:08.834 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm so glad
you didn't get hurt!

00:13:08.968 --> 00:13:10.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
Eyes front, little Teru.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
She's gonna be a tough one.

00:13:12.367 --> 00:13:13.634 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Look closely.

00:13:13.767 --> 00:13:15.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
She's not wearing a ring.

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:18.100 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Huh?

00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:27.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Shy.

00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:34.167 position:7% line:89% align:start
But if she doesn't have a ring,

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
where are her powers
coming from?

00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:37.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought this was
Stigma's doing?

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking, too.

00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:41.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] But it looks like
she's going to be

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
a lot more trouble
than we thought.

00:13:44.467 --> 00:13:46.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mianlong. You take care
of the rescue team.

00:13:46.968 --> 00:13:49.133 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh. Right!
Roger that, Spirit!

00:13:49.267 --> 00:13:51.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
And you, Teru,
will be providing support

00:13:51.267 --> 00:13:52.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
to me here, 'kay?

00:13:52.701 --> 00:13:54.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh. 'Kay.

00:13:55.434 --> 00:13:57.501 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Can I really be trusted?

00:13:57.901 --> 00:13:59.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is my first real battle.

00:14:00.467 --> 00:14:03.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
Will my powers,
be strong enough?

00:14:05.834 --> 00:14:07.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SPIRIT] Teru!

00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:09.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I don't have time
to doubt myself!

00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:12.234 position:41% line:83% align:start
Right!
I know I can do this!

00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:15.133 position:44% line:83% align:start
Wow.
You're really fired up, huh?

00:14:15.767 --> 00:14:17.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
Your fire.

00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:18.567 position:30% line:89% align:start
It feels warm.

00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:22.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Huh?
She fell into the water!

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:30.634 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TZVETA]
I'm so cold.

00:14:31.133 --> 00:14:34.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let me warm myself up
with your heart.

00:14:34.634 --> 00:14:37.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is that all right?

00:14:42.667 --> 00:14:43.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's enough, kid.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think it's about time
for you to settle down.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
You made me dizzy
with that spin.

00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:50.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
And it hurt.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] Uh-huh.
So who are you, anyway.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
And what are you doing
way out here?

00:14:59.467 --> 00:15:01.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
People refer to me as Tzveta.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was told to stay out here,
that's all.

00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:07.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
They said that heroes would
eventually show up to help.

00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:10.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
And if I were to destroy them,
I would finally be warm.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Huh?

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, I see.

00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:16.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, this was nothing more
than a trap.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] Teru!
Contact Unilord right away!

00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:21.400 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Sure! On it!
-[SPIRIT] Huh?

00:15:21.534 --> 00:15:22.801 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Wait! Hold on!

00:15:22.934 --> 00:15:24.701 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Um, I'm sorry to ask,

00:15:24.834 --> 00:15:26.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
but could I borrow your radio?

00:15:26.767 --> 00:15:29.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
Seeing as the helicopter
blew up, we don't have one.

00:15:29.434 --> 00:15:31.000 position:13% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Oh, no, that's right!

00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:34.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
But how do I contact Unilord
without a radio of some kind?

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:37.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
You should still be
able to reach her

00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:39.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
using your bracelets.

00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:40.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just like this.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.367 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Right! I forgot!

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.367 position:35% line:89% align:start
That girl.

00:15:44.834 --> 00:15:47.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TZVETA] She's been panicking
the entire time.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
And her face is so flushed.

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:52.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Tzveta chuckles]

00:15:53.968 --> 00:15:55.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
She reminds me a lot of you.

00:15:56.033 --> 00:15:57.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
Pesha.

00:15:57.767 --> 00:15:59.200 position:33% line:89% align:start
[SPIRIT] Huh?

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:08.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:16:12.834 --> 00:16:14.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
Pepesha, no!

00:16:14.968 --> 00:16:16.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
[TZVETA] Now.

00:16:24.033 --> 00:16:26.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
It feels so warm.

00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:27.734 position:38% line:89% align:start
How nice.

00:16:29.167 --> 00:16:31.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, I like you a lot.

00:16:31.734 --> 00:16:33.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let me feel your flames.

00:16:34.934 --> 00:16:37.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
Warm me up more, won't you?

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you gonna be
okay there, Shy?

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'm so sorry!

00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:48.767 position:35% line:89% align:start
Move aside.

00:16:49.501 --> 00:16:51.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you think Pepesha's okay?

00:16:51.601 --> 00:16:52.734 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:16:52.868 --> 00:16:55.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
But right now, we need
to focus on stopping her.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.901 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
That pattern on her cheek.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
It wasn't there
when she arrived.

00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:07.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
From the moment
that it appeared,

00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:09.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
her energy's felt
even more intense.

00:17:10.934 --> 00:17:13.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fine, then. I guess
I'll to have to kill you.

00:17:15.033 --> 00:17:16.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:20.934 --> 00:17:22.300 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, my.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TZVETA]
You're a lot more dangerous

00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:30.000 position:7% line:89% align:start
than you seem at first glance.

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:32.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm tired now.

00:17:34.033 --> 00:17:35.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
And it's all your fault.

00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:47.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now, all that's left is...

00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:49.701 position:33% line:89% align:start
[TZVETA] Huh?

00:17:51.868 --> 00:17:54.234 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:17:56.734 --> 00:17:58.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
Mianlong!
Go now!

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
Pointless.

00:18:02.767 --> 00:18:04.133 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MIANLONG]
Dragon's sleeping Fist.

00:18:04.267 --> 00:18:06.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
Heart-shift Style attack!

00:18:11.868 --> 00:18:13.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
Slumbering Claws!

00:18:17.567 --> 00:18:18.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
[TZVETA] Huh?

00:18:18.868 --> 00:18:20.000 position:30% line:89% align:start
What was that?

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:22.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
That attack didn't even hurt
one bit.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
[TZVETA] Huh?

00:18:26.734 --> 00:18:29.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
I don't understand why.

00:18:29.367 --> 00:18:31.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why am I getting sleepy?

00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:33.434 position:38% line:89% align:start
So tired.

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:36.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, that's because
my Slumbering Claws

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
aren't meant to do harm.

00:18:38.501 --> 00:18:41.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're just gonna take
a little nap is all.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.868 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Mianlong!
[MIANLONG] Huh?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
You were so amazing back there!

00:18:44.934 --> 00:18:47.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nah. There's no way I could've
done it without your help.

00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:50.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MIANLONG]
She was pretty tough.

00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:53.300 position:33% line:83% align:start
[OLD MALE 6A]
Hey! You all right?

00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:55.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, no. Pepesha.

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:56.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
She's trapped inside the ice!

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Go melt it! Quickly!
-Right.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
[MIANLONG] Hmm.

00:19:07.701 --> 00:19:09.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
What did she mean
she would "finally be warm"

00:19:10.067 --> 00:19:11.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
if she destroyed us heroes?

00:19:11.934 --> 00:19:13.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't get it.

00:19:13.234 --> 00:19:16.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is she affiliated
with Stigma or not?

00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:19.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:24.467 position:38% line:83% align:start
[STIGMA]
Looks like you fell asleep.

00:19:25.234 --> 00:19:27.167 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about that though,

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:29.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
because you've awoken at last.

00:19:30.868 --> 00:19:32.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're Stigma?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's right. I'm Stigma.

00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:38.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's the name
you all gave me.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Names are wonderful,
aren't they?

00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:44.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
When someone calls your name,
you feel so loved.

00:19:45.367 --> 00:19:48.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
Like you're being united
with your heart.

00:19:49.534 --> 00:19:51.567 position:38% line:83% align:start
[STIGMA]
She's called Tzveta.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
And over there is Weepy.

00:19:54.467 --> 00:19:56.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
I gave them both
their names, you see.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
And your name's Mianlong.

00:19:59.434 --> 00:20:01.767 position:35% line:83% align:start
I must say,
it's quite adorable.

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:03.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
I could just eat you up.

get away with this.

You've hurt too many.

Bye-bye, see you later.

Wait! Stigma!

00:20:24.501 --> 00:20:26.868 position:24% line:83% align:start

Who is she?

[STIGMA]
Oh, yeah.

00:20:28.334 --> 00:20:29.634 position:41% line:83% align:start
I guess
it would only be fitting

00:20:29.767 --> 00:20:31.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
to give our group a name.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
I wonder
what would be appropriate?

00:20:38.834 --> 00:20:41.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
Something easy to remember.

00:20:41.467 --> 00:20:43.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
But that has an air of mystery.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
No matter the era,

00:20:46.834 --> 00:20:48.934 position:13% line:89% align:start
we will always be the same.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
Forever unchanging.

00:20:51.801 --> 00:20:55.200 position:33% line:83% align:start
Say our name,
so we may feel loved,

00:20:55.567 --> 00:20:58.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
and live on inside your hearts.

Goodnight, dear heroes.
