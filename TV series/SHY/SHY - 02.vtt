Hey, Koishikawa,

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.016 position:10% line:83% align:start
what was Karen Middle school
like?

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.018 position:30% line:83% align:start
[IKO] It wasn't
all that different from here.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.320 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just a school like any other.

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:21.723 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:23.023 position:33% line:89% align:start
A boyfriend?

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.659 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, definitely not!

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:25.994 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NEKOGAWA]
But you're so pretty!

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.595 position:13% line:89% align:start
You must have been popular!

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.864 position:38% line:83% align:start
[laughs]
You're way off!

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:32.232 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm a mess. Like, honestly.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.234 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, why did you
transfer to our school

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:35.870 position:10% line:89% align:start
so late in the year, anyway?

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:37.204 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Huh? Oh.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.173 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's 'cause I hurt my leg
a little while ago.

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.276 position:33% line:83% align:start
So, commuting
to the next town over

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.443 position:30% line:89% align:start
got kinda hard.

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:45.580 position:13% line:83% align:start
Plus, this school's closer
to home.

00:00:45.713 --> 00:00:48.382 position:44% line:83% align:start
Aah!
Oh, I guess that makes sense.

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.552 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm really sorry about her,
Koishikawa!

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:52.554 position:27% line:83% align:start
She doesn't think
before speaking.

No, it's all good!

Sorry, but would you mind
coming to the office?

00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:01.295 position:24% line:83% align:start
We need to go over
some paperwork.

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:02.797 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sure thing!

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.933 position:16% line:83% align:start

of this.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:58.913 position:19% line:89% align:start
I can't help but wonder

how Koishikawa feels about Shy.

are you doing here?

that Shrimpy is right.

And she doesn't hold
a grudge against Shy.

But I dunno.

Oh. Yeah, I'm all good.

You're most definitely
not fine!

I'm gonna take you

to help me on the stairs,

it sorta reminded me of her.

So please,

00:21:35.696 --> 00:21:37.965 position:21% line:83% align:start
stop hurting yourself
like this.

Mo-Momijiyama!

00:21:41.135 --> 00:21:43.070 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:44.772 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's all my fault.

00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:48.475 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll be okay.
I promise.

[SHRIMPY] Teru, did you know
that would work?

00:21:54.816 --> 00:21:56.250 position:7% line:89% align:start
That the crystal would shatter?

00:21:56.551 --> 00:21:58.853 position:13% line:89% align:start
I didn't. How could I have?

00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:01.388 position:30% line:83% align:start
I just thought
I should get closer

00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:02.890 position:13% line:89% align:start
to what's inside her heart.

00:22:03.825 --> 00:22:05.993 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was only a feeling I had,
though.

[STIGMA]
Hmm.

Hey um.

00:22:26.446 --> 00:22:27.615 position:13% line:89% align:start
I really screwed up today,

00:22:27.748 --> 00:22:29.482 position:10% line:89% align:start
and you got hurt 'cause of me

00:22:30.218 --> 00:22:31.819 position:19% line:89% align:start
but you still saved me.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.486 position:35% line:83% align:start
-I'm sorry.

-[SHY] When I was little,
-Huh.

00:22:38.358 --> 00:22:39.760 position:10% line:89% align:start
my grandpa told me something.

00:22:40.127 --> 00:22:41.762 position:24% line:83% align:start
He said humans are
at their happiest

00:22:41.896 --> 00:22:44.031 position:24% line:83% align:start
when they're living
for the sake of other people.

00:22:44.832 --> 00:22:45.867 position:44% line:89% align:start
But--

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.935 position:21% line:89% align:start
So when you're kind,

00:22:48.202 --> 00:22:50.538 position:21% line:83% align:start
It will be passed on
to another person.

00:22:50.872 --> 00:22:52.206 position:35% line:83% align:start
And I think
that's a connection

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.141 position:10% line:89% align:start
worth risking your life for.

Koishikawa.

00:22:56.544 --> 00:22:57.845 position:16% line:89% align:start
If you're feeling guilty,

00:22:58.012 --> 00:22:59.180 position:33% line:83% align:start
then I think
you should pass on

00:22:59.313 --> 00:23:00.982 position:7% line:89% align:start
a little kindness to somebody.

00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:02.884 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh-huh.

00:23:03.618 --> 00:23:05.418 position:30% line:83% align:start
'Cause nothing
could make me happier,

00:23:05.653 --> 00:23:08.089 position:24% line:83% align:start
than giving people
a reason to smile.

00:23:09.857 --> 00:23:10.892 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:23:11.525 --> 00:23:12.760 position:44% line:89% align:start

Today, a crisis occurred
in Japan.

We made contact

Momijiyama,

I have something else
to tell you.

Ah? Wha-What is it?
