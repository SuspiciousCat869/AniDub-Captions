These are letters she wrote me.

00:08:15.997 --> 00:08:17.798 position:27% line:83% align:start
It wasn't often,
but she'd let us know

00:08:17.932 --> 00:08:19.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
how she was doing occasionally.

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:22.603 position:19% line:89% align:start
You mother wasn't good

00:08:22.737 --> 00:08:24.839 position:21% line:83% align:start
at letting her walls
down around others.

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:28.509 position:10% line:83% align:start
But very rarely, she'd allow
her emotions to shine through.

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:31.412 position:16% line:83% align:start
Frankly, she was probably
a little bit drunk

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:32.646 position:21% line:89% align:start
when she wrote these.

00:08:33.214 --> 00:08:35.516 position:27% line:83% align:start
Lenya was no good
at holding her liquor.

So, I have my doubts that she
could remember writing to us.

Huh? You can tell?

[SPIRIT]
Yeah, that's right.

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:18.692 position:30% line:83% align:start
When she drank,
she'd laugh like a kid,

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.828 position:27% line:83% align:start
and we could talk
to each other.

00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:24.165 position:16% line:83% align:start
She'd play around with me
like we were friends,

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:26.600 position:7% line:89% align:start
and we let ourselves act silly.

"Alcohol is magical."

00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:28.142 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TZVETA]
The fighting's over.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.478 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm ready
for this dream to end.

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:33.113 position:38% line:89% align:start
Not yet!

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:34.481 position:35% line:83% align:start
If you let
your dream fade away,

00:13:34.616 --> 00:13:36.216 position:19% line:89% align:start
you'll disappear, too!

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.384 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:39.420 position:24% line:89% align:start
And I accept that.

00:13:39.788 --> 00:13:40.954 position:24% line:89% align:start
We can't stay here.

00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:43.190 position:10% line:89% align:start
Go make your way back to him.

00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:46.193 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's time to say goodbye.

00:13:47.328 --> 00:13:48.362 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crying]

00:13:49.698 --> 00:13:50.765 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'll do that.

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:54.401 position:19% line:83% align:start
But still, I won't say
goodbye to you.

00:13:54.536 --> 00:14:01.576 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:14:01.909 --> 00:14:04.612 position:27% line:89% align:start
[wind whooshing]

00:14:04.746 --> 00:14:05.780 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hold on.

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:08.082 position:13% line:89% align:start
What she said, is it true?

00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:11.218 position:19% line:89% align:start
This space was my heart

00:14:11.352 --> 00:14:13.487 position:30% line:83% align:start
and everything
encompassed therein.

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:15.790 position:33% line:83% align:start
When you look
at the person before you,

00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:18.793 position:7% line:83% align:start
you're looking at a mere image
made from that heart.

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:22.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, after it's gone,
my body will also disappear.

00:14:22.764 --> 00:14:24.865 position:10% line:89% align:start
But why? Why can't you stay?

00:14:25.132 --> 00:14:28.302 position:19% line:83% align:start
After all these years,
we're finally together!

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:31.872 position:10% line:89% align:start
You know, because of you two,

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:33.407 position:13% line:89% align:start
I woke up from a nightmare

00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:35.677 position:27% line:83% align:start
that seemed like
it would go on forever.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.113 position:10% line:83% align:start
So please, there's something
you need to know.

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:40.280 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:42.717 position:13% line:89% align:start
The person who created us,

00:14:43.217 --> 00:14:45.386 position:24% line:83% align:start
the child you refer
to as Stigma?

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:47.287 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know his power.

00:14:47.488 --> 00:14:50.090 position:13% line:83% align:start
He can make other people's
dreams come true.

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:52.960 position:19% line:89% align:start
But how can he do that?

00:14:53.828 --> 00:14:54.829 position:41% line:89% align:start
Simple.

00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:56.096 position:7% line:89% align:start
He can look into others' hearts

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.699 position:33% line:83% align:start
and see what
they want the most.

00:14:58.165 --> 00:15:01.068 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then his power gives form
to that desire.

00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:04.972 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was because of his power
that we were reunited.

00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:07.007 position:19% line:89% align:start
It manifested me here.

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:10.944 position:41% line:83% align:start
He knew
your dearest wish of all

00:15:11.078 --> 00:15:12.479 position:21% line:89% align:start
was to see me again.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.314 position:19% line:89% align:start
And he took advantage,

00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:17.719 position:7% line:83% align:start
making a twisted version of me
meant to harm you.

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:19.754 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
He took it from me?

00:15:20.187 --> 00:15:21.422 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, he used his power

00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:23.858 position:27% line:83% align:start
to make Pepesha's
dream a reality?

00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:25.926 position:13% line:89% align:start
If he does that so easily,

00:15:26.093 --> 00:15:29.163 position:10% line:83% align:start
then what's the endgame that
Stigma's trying to bring about?

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:32.065 position:19% line:83% align:start
That ability of his has
limitless possibilities.

00:15:33.735 --> 00:15:35.068 position:38% line:89% align:start
It does.

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:37.971 position:19% line:83% align:start
And he wants to use it
to make a world without adults.

00:15:38.573 --> 00:15:40.742 position:7% line:89% align:start
A world made only for children.

00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:44.211 position:30% line:83% align:start
I followed him,
because I wanted the same.

00:15:45.747 --> 00:15:47.948 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course,
there are restrictions.

00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:50.785 position:33% line:83% align:start
He can't make
his own dreams come true.

00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:53.954 position:13% line:83% align:start
His powers are meaningless
when he's on his own.

00:15:54.689 --> 00:15:58.125 position:24% line:83% align:start
And so...he created
a group of friends.

00:15:59.193 --> 00:16:02.630 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's where we come in,
Amarariruku.

00:16:03.397 --> 00:16:05.633 position:21% line:83% align:start
To start, he gave us
unique powers

00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:08.168 position:16% line:83% align:start
derived from what he saw
inside our hearts.

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:12.540 position:19% line:83% align:start
We wanted to fight you,
but we needed equal footing.

00:16:13.708 --> 00:16:14.843 position:35% line:89% align:start
[shatters]

00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:16.744 position:30% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately,
that's all I know.

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:19.814 position:38% line:83% align:start
I wonder,
what does he plan to do

00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:21.181 position:13% line:89% align:start
after he's taken this world

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:23.450 position:24% line:83% align:start
and transfigured it
to fit his vision?

00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:26.521 position:35% line:83% align:start
That said,
one thing's for certain,

00:16:26.821 --> 00:16:28.989 position:19% line:83% align:start
his goal is to destroy
this world.

00:16:29.524 --> 00:16:32.192 position:21% line:83% align:start
As he warps one dream
after another.

00:16:33.193 --> 00:16:35.530 position:13% line:89% align:start
So please, I'm begging you.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.464 position:19% line:89% align:start
You have to stop them!

00:16:38.232 --> 00:16:41.401 position:30% line:83% align:start
They can't win!
Stigma can't take this world!

00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:45.105 position:27% line:83% align:start
This whole time,
I didn't notice.

00:16:45.807 --> 00:16:48.776 position:19% line:83% align:start
The fact that he warped
my heart past recognition,

00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:51.880 position:7% line:83% align:start
or the fact that I couldn't see
others around me.

00:16:52.112 --> 00:16:53.915 position:10% line:89% align:start
I was only looking at myself.

00:16:54.047 --> 00:16:55.282 position:35% line:89% align:start
Struggling.

00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:57.451 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:16:57.752 --> 00:16:59.954 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TZVETA] Excuse me,
please tell me your name again.

00:17:00.087 --> 00:17:03.525 position:24% line:83% align:start
Huh. Oh, I'm Teru.
Teru Momijiyama.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.062 position:16% line:89% align:start
Teru, dear, try to relax.

00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:10.497 position:21% line:89% align:start
You look so nervous.

00:17:10.932 --> 00:17:14.669 position:7% line:83% align:start
You know, your demeanor belies
the strength of your heart.

00:17:14.836 --> 00:17:18.272 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm impressed.
You're such a gentle soul.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.440 position:19% line:89% align:start
After all, without you,

00:17:20.575 --> 00:17:23.176 position:13% line:83% align:start
I would have never reunited
with my daughter.

00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:26.346 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was your kindness
that made it all possible.

00:17:27.281 --> 00:17:28.716 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, thank you, Teru.

00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:30.785 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! It was nothing.

00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:33.855 position:30% line:89% align:start
Listen, Pesha,

00:17:34.656 --> 00:17:36.925 position:21% line:83% align:start
I want you to become
a guiding light.

00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:39.661 position:19% line:83% align:start
So go to the children,
and guide them.

00:17:39.794 --> 00:17:41.228 position:19% line:89% align:start
Teach what you believe.

00:17:41.696 --> 00:17:44.331 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've realized,
of all the things we can give,

00:17:44.766 --> 00:17:48.168 position:7% line:83% align:start
that's the best thing we adults
can offer to the future.

00:17:48.903 --> 00:17:50.137 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:17:51.673 --> 00:17:53.007 position:27% line:89% align:start
I believe in you.

00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:56.511 position:33% line:83% align:start
Now, I leave
this world's safety to you.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.479 position:19% line:89% align:start
Make me proud, Heroes.

00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:02.182 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Right!
-Right!

00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:06.654 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh. No.

00:18:07.622 --> 00:18:08.856 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mama, wait.

00:18:09.724 --> 00:18:10.725 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's all right.

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.595 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have sinned,
and even if my crimes

00:18:13.728 --> 00:18:16.731 position:13% line:83% align:start
were through Stigma's will,
I still acted on it.

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:20.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm responsible for the damage
that I did to you two.

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:23.905 position:24% line:89% align:start
But hey, it's okay.

00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:26.741 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you still call me mama
after everything,

00:18:26.874 --> 00:18:28.009 position:27% line:89% align:start
I haven't failed.

00:18:29.043 --> 00:18:32.780 position:16% line:83% align:start
So dear, I have one final
wish to ask of you.

00:18:33.615 --> 00:18:34.649 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

This has been a long-standing

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.925 position:16% line:83% align:start
To drink with my daughter
when she's all grown up...

00:18:44.692 --> 00:18:47.494 position:19% line:83% align:start
and see the incredible

00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:09.149 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Huh? Of course, I have.

How do you think
I hold my liquor?

00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:13.121 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sure. I get it.

00:19:13.655 --> 00:19:15.823 position:19% line:83% align:start
Make sure to take care
and stay healthy,

00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:18.258 position:27% line:83% align:start
and pay attention
to your liver!

Hm.

00:19:19.694 --> 00:19:20.728 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

You know, now that

00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:26.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
we're finally
talking like this,

00:19:26.634 --> 00:19:28.301 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm a little bit embarrassed.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.638 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] I thought
the exact same thing.

00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:33.841 position:38% line:83% align:start

Is it hard to be a Hero?

Hm.

00:19:35.409 --> 00:19:37.277 position:16% line:89% align:start
It has its ups and downs,

00:19:37.612 --> 00:19:39.179 position:35% line:83% align:start
but I think
it's really wonderful

00:19:39.312 --> 00:19:41.949 position:13% line:83% align:start
that I'm allowed to connect
with people by rescuing them.

00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:45.153 position:16% line:83% align:start
It makes me happy to give
someone a helping hand.

I'm pretty sure I picked up
that trait from you, Mama.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.769 position:30% line:83% align:start
For being born,
and all that's come after.

00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:03.638 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm proud of you.

00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:07.642 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're more than any mother
could expect of her kid.

00:20:08.843 --> 00:20:09.877 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mama.

00:20:11.012 --> 00:20:13.881 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're alive,
and you seem happy.

00:20:14.749 --> 00:20:17.852 position:13% line:83% align:start
If nothing else, that alone
is enough for me.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.789 position:24% line:83% align:start
If my life amounted
to you being here,

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:23.758 position:10% line:89% align:start
then it was worth something.

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:25.793 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Yeah.

00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:27.762 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TZVETA]
This is long overdue.

00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:31.431 position:7% line:83% align:start
I should've said it more to you
when I had the chance.

00:20:32.767 --> 00:20:35.603 position:30% line:83% align:start
No matter what,
don't forget this.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.171 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
What?

00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:41.209 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:43.978 position:13% line:89% align:start
I love you, dear. So much.

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:48.448 position:21% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] More than
anything else, I love you.

00:20:48.583 --> 00:20:51.185 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:52.553 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:20:53.688 --> 00:20:54.689 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:20:54.889 --> 00:21:01.596 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:21:04.098 --> 00:21:05.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
I love you, too.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:12.472 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:21:13.007 --> 00:21:14.274 position:21% line:89% align:start
How are you feeling?

00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:17.310 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[sighs] It's so cruel.
-Huh?

00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:19.714 position:35% line:89% align:start
Like c'mon.

00:21:20.515 --> 00:21:23.017 position:21% line:83% align:start
I already had to say
goodbye to her once,

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.886 position:16% line:89% align:start
but wouldn't you know it?

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:26.419 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's just as hard.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.756 position:19% line:89% align:start
As she neared the end,

00:21:29.157 --> 00:21:33.094 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought she had a look
of real happiness on her face.

00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:37.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
Maybe because she finally
expressed her feelings,

00:21:38.032 --> 00:21:40.635 position:10% line:83% align:start
and she knew you'd pass them
on to the future.

00:21:41.434 --> 00:21:42.770 position:33% line:89% align:start
Which is why,

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.405 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sure that we need
to keep on moving forward!

00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:47.575 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:21:49.544 --> 00:21:50.578 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
You're right.

00:21:50.912 --> 00:21:53.014 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's okay to let it
stay with us.

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:54.849 position:13% line:89% align:start
We'll just carry this, too.

00:21:56.851 --> 00:21:57.885 position:33% line:89% align:start
[clattering]

00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:04.625 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:06.359 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh.
[gasps]

00:22:06.527 --> 00:22:08.229 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Check it out!
-Huh?

00:22:08.596 --> 00:22:09.831 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?
