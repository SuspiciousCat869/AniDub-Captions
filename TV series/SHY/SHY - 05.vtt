[SHY]
Oh, oh no.

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:31.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna have to call
an employee

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
to come help me.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.605 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'll be fine.

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.773 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can do this.

00:00:38.907 --> 00:00:41.009 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll just call for them
as loud as I can.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.677 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ready, and--

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.780 position:35% line:89% align:start
Excuse me.

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.485 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, um, excuse me.

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:52.620 position:35% line:89% align:start
Excuse me,

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:54.288 position:16% line:83% align:start
is there anybody around--
I don't know why,

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.223 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I always cry
when this happens.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:59.426 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe I should put
everything back and go home.

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:02.429 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ow. Sorry to keep you.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.331 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hope you weren't
waiting too long,

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
my back was giving me a...
What's this?

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:11.071 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] My, if it isn't
the Momijiyama's girl, Teru!

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:12.707 position:13% line:89% align:start
I haven't seen you in ages!

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.909 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Look how big you've gotten!
-Oh, yeah.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.778 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] I remember you
coming in here

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:18.312 position:19% line:89% align:start
with Mei all the time.

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.181 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh-huh. Looks like
you're doing well, Chihiro.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:23.851 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO]
Oo! Ow, ow, my back!

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:25.419 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Or maybe not.

00:02:57.745 --> 00:02:59.914 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Um, are you all right?

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.950 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO]
No, unfortunately I'm not.

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:04.852 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Chihiro groans]

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:06.420 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO]
I'm really sorry.

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:09.924 position:7% line:83% align:start
My lower back pain's giving me
a lot of trouble lately.

00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.125 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.861 position:16% line:83% align:start
It seems like it would be
a whole lot of work

00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:15.930 position:19% line:83% align:start
to be running this shop
all by yourself.

00:03:16.064 --> 00:03:19.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're quite right. Ever since
my husband passed away,

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
it's been just me.

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:22.503 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO]
Oh! You hadn't heard?

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.206 position:13% line:83% align:start
He got sick and passed away
about three years ago now.

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.842 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:30.812 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's been rather lonely
running this store by myself.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.048 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] He originally started
this little shop as a hobby,

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:35.315 position:19% line:89% align:start
but now that he's gone,

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.585 position:24% line:83% align:start
it's the only thing
I have left.

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:40.555 position:33% line:83% align:start
But nowadays,
we hardly get any customers

00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:42.857 position:16% line:83% align:start
coming to a little place
like this one.

00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:46.293 position:13% line:83% align:start
And that just makes it feel
all the lonelier.

00:03:47.028 --> 00:03:49.931 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's no wonder my back's
giving out on me, eh?

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:51.132 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.399 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.104 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, tell me, what was it
that brought you by today?

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:57.705 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just browsing?

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.239 position:33% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Ah, no.

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:00.708 position:30% line:89% align:start
[CHIHIRO] Huh?

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.546 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Honestly, it's that.

00:04:05.847 --> 00:04:09.517 position:16% line:83% align:start
I realized how beautiful
Mt. Tanpopo looked today.

00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:12.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then I remembered that
there was

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:14.956 position:7% line:83% align:start
a really pretty painting of it
here in this shop.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.693 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] Ah. My husband
painted that, you know.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:22.697 position:10% line:83% align:start
That man had a special place
in his heart for the mountains.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
Rain or shine, he and I
would go climbing every year.

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:29.737 position:16% line:83% align:start
I continued to go hiking
even after he passed away.

00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:31.172 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO]
However, I don't think

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.874 position:10% line:89% align:start
it's in the cards this year.

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:36.443 position:13% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] Ow, ow, ow! Ooh,
my back! [SHY] What's going on?

00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:39.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] It's seizing up again!
Ow! [SHY] Are you okay?

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.785 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:47.255 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I guess
I haven't been paying attention

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.489 position:7% line:89% align:start
to things outside of hero work.

00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.627 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wish there was something
I could do.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.496 position:10% line:83% align:start
But it's not as if I can cure
Chihiro's injury or anything.

00:04:56.631 --> 00:04:58.866 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY] Teru,
is something the matter?

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.433 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Shy sighs]

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:02.970 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I'm a complete
and total failure.

00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:05.338 position:13% line:83% align:start
I haven't been able to use
my fire powers

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.974 position:10% line:89% align:start
since my fight with Stardust.

00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:10.144 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY] You'll learn
to control them with time.

00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:11.279 position:35% line:89% align:start
[doorbell]

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.647 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Huh?
[SHRIMPY] Huh?

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.050 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Uh, yes?

00:05:16.184 --> 00:05:17.450 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:19.419 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, you're--!

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.523 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Who're you?
[LADY BLACK] Me! Stupid!

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.858 position:16% line:89% align:start
[SHY] That doesn't help.

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.226 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Even in the darkest abyss

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:26.493 position:19% line:89% align:start
where there's no light.

00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:28.428 position:33% line:83% align:start
Bet on Black
to be by your side.

00:05:28.563 --> 00:05:30.164 position:33% line:83% align:start
I am Earth's
shining black star!

00:05:30.298 --> 00:05:33.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
The light that shines
on the hearts of the word!

00:05:33.835 --> 00:05:35.468 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm the Black Cross Nurse.

00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:37.337 position:27% line:89% align:start
I am Lady Black!

00:05:37.672 --> 00:05:41.042 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll never give up on life,
remember that.

00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:42.810 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:46.214 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you stupid?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.815 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, Piltz, it's you!

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.051 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did you come all this way
from Switzerland?

00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:52.019 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
I'm the one who treated you,

00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:53.921 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I came to do a follow up
and see how you were doing!

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:55.388 position:21% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE NEIGHBOR 5A]
Who is that girl?

00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:57.124 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wonder if something happened.

00:05:57.892 --> 00:05:59.093 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Can I come in?

00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:00.695 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's getting weird out here.

00:06:00.828 --> 00:06:02.864 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Oh! Uh, sure!

00:06:03.998 --> 00:06:05.233 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
You feel any pain?

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.734 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
No, I'm fine.

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:09.270 position:13% line:89% align:start
All right. Any other pain?

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:10.771 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not really?

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:13.373 position:16% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Way to go, me!

00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:14.976 position:10% line:89% align:start
You made a perfect recovery.

00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:17.278 position:21% line:83% align:start
The power of healing
is awesome.

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:18.512 position:38% line:89% align:start
Healing.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.149 position:30% line:83% align:start
Huh? Excuse me.
I have a favor to ask!

00:06:22.283 --> 00:06:23.351 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Like what?

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:24.785 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Well, the thing is--.

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.088 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come to think of it,
it's not really a favor.

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:28.890 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's more like a request.

00:06:30.558 --> 00:06:33.127 position:19% line:83% align:start
Listen! I'm going home!
You got that?

00:06:33.294 --> 00:06:36.396 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why would I ever take a request
from a dummy like you?

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.799 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
How stupid can you get?

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:40.301 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hello there!

00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:41.736 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
My name's Piltz.

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.004 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm an acquaintance of Teru's,

00:06:43.137 --> 00:06:44.972 position:16% line:83% align:start
and I wanted to come see
if I could help.

00:06:45.172 --> 00:06:47.541 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whatever did you want
help with, dear?

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:50.111 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, I came to help you
with that back injury

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:51.478 position:10% line:89% align:start
since I'm a nursing student.

00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:53.547 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, really?
Well, that's very kind.

00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:55.482 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid
there's not very much room,

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:57.618 position:33% line:83% align:start
but feel free
to come on in, girls.

00:06:57.752 --> 00:06:59.387 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thanks, we appreciate it.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.622 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Piltz?
Thanks for doing this.

00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:02.957 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm not doing this for you,

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.192 position:10% line:83% align:start
so quit thanking me already,
stupid.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.030 position:7% line:83% align:start
Normally, we shouldn't even be
using our hero abilities

00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:10.531 position:16% line:89% align:start
for any personal reasons.

00:07:11.065 --> 00:07:13.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I can't just sit by
and ignore her pain.

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:24.679 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] I feel a bit guilty
having a young'un like you

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:26.647 position:19% line:89% align:start
help me out like this.

00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.382 position:19% line:89% align:start
No need to feel guilty!

00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:30.584 position:33% line:83% align:start
I really love
looking after people.

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:32.620 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO]
By the way, Miss Piltz?

00:07:32.753 --> 00:07:34.255 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Yes?

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:35.990 position:19% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] Do you think
it'll still be a problem for me

00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:38.559 position:19% line:83% align:start
to hike up the mountain
if the pain goes away?

00:07:38.693 --> 00:07:40.628 position:24% line:89% align:start
You wanna go hike?

00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:42.596 position:19% line:83% align:start
The mountain was a very
special place

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.098 position:21% line:89% align:start
for my husband and I.

00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:47.234 position:30% line:83% align:start
I hoped one day
I'd be able to climb it again.

00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:49.103 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO]
You think I can?

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.805 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hiking sounds great!

00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:53.708 position:24% line:83% align:start
A lack of exercise
is awful for your health.

00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.176 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
I'm a bit worried about you

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:56.944 position:24% line:83% align:start
climbing a mountain
by yourself, though.

00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:59.213 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, the two of us
will accompany you!

00:07:59.347 --> 00:08:00.581 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Huh?

00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:02.616 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.386 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:05.553 --> 00:08:07.221 position:19% line:89% align:start
Perfect hiking weather!

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:09.056 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's beautiful out!

00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:14.595 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's up? Why've you got
that dumb look on your face?

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:15.763 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Oh, it's just that I'm not

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.531 position:7% line:89% align:start
super good at outdoorsy stuff.

00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:19.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm sure it's kinda obvious,

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:21.669 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I usually prefer to just
stay inside, you know?

00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:23.237 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ugh. Whatever.

00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:25.439 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just come on.

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.775 position:7% line:89% align:start
No need to push yourself, Teru.

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:30.144 position:19% line:89% align:start
'Kay. I'll do my best.

00:08:31.612 --> 00:08:33.814 position:24% line:89% align:start
[breathing heavily]

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:42.556 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO]
Mm, oh.

00:08:42.757 --> 00:08:45.559 position:16% line:83% align:start
I swear, it's like magic
or something, Miss Piltz!

00:08:45.693 --> 00:08:47.728 position:27% line:83% align:start
Whatever you did,
my back's good as new!

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:50.297 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please make sure
you don't overdo it, all right?

00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:51.966 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey. Umm..

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.769 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, Piltz, so uh...

00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:59.306 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do, do you go hiking up
mountains a lot?

00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:00.775 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's just,

00:09:00.908 --> 00:09:03.244 position:21% line:83% align:start
you seem really used
to this is all.

00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:05.713 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I did.

00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:07.516 position:16% line:89% align:start
I used to hike every day.

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.016 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Oh, wow.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then I guess you really
love mountains, huh?

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:13.954 position:38% line:83% align:start
-I don't.
-Huh?

00:09:14.088 --> 00:09:16.657 position:10% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] I hate mountains
and climbing with a passion.

00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:18.626 position:19% line:83% align:start
There were these jerks
who made fun of me

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:20.094 position:13% line:89% align:start
and said I couldn't do it.

00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:22.663 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, I climbed every day
to prove them wrong.

00:09:22.997 --> 00:09:24.965 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHY] But why would
they laugh at you

00:09:25.099 --> 00:09:27.168 position:24% line:83% align:start
if you were trying
your best?

00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:32.206 position:13% line:89% align:start
You suck at sports, right?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.842 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, I guess so.

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.877 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
You like to go hiking?

00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:38.412 position:38% line:89% align:start
[SHY] No.

00:09:38.547 --> 00:09:39.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] Do you think you
can make it up to the summit?

00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:43.250 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHY] No, um,
I don't think I can.

00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:48.155 position:10% line:89% align:start
What do you say we get going?

00:09:49.123 --> 00:09:50.691 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
I'll answer your question

00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:53.327 position:19% line:83% align:start
if I see your dumb face
at the top, all right?

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.665 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Huh?

00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:03.370 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Shy breathing heavily]

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:07.675 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

00:10:08.142 --> 00:10:11.145 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, um, about what you said.

00:10:11.312 --> 00:10:12.780 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shhh!

00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:21.956 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's go talk someplace

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:23.691 position:19% line:83% align:start
where we won't disturb
Miss Nagata.

00:10:23.858 --> 00:10:25.359 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sure, okay.

00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:33.568 position:10% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] You took forever
getting up here.

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:35.369 position:33% line:83% align:start
What the heck
were you even doing?

00:10:35.504 --> 00:10:37.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Oh, thanks.

00:10:39.807 --> 00:10:40.975 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:43.244 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's better.
I was about to die.

00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:44.579 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, you weren't.

00:10:44.712 --> 00:10:46.881 position:33% line:83% align:start
This mountain
isn't very big at all.

00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:49.016 position:13% line:89% align:start
Since I made it to the top,

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.986 position:21% line:83% align:start
do you mind answerin'
my question from before?

00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:55.189 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sure, I guess,

00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:57.725 position:21% line:83% align:start
but it's not exactly
a fun story to hear.

00:10:57.858 --> 00:10:59.528 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's okay,
I just don't get

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.395 position:7% line:89% align:start
why people would laugh at you.

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:07.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Huh?

00:11:08.002 --> 00:11:09.703 position:24% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] I lost
both my legs in an accident

00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:11.172 position:27% line:89% align:start
when I was little

00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:13.642 position:7% line:83% align:start
But you climbed all the way up
like it was nothing.

00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:15.042 position:35% line:89% align:start
Darn right!

00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:17.411 position:13% line:83% align:start
I hiked every day to prove
that I could.

00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:20.381 position:13% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter where you
might go in the world.

00:11:20.515 --> 00:11:22.750 position:13% line:83% align:start
There will always be idiots
who laugh at people

00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:25.186 position:16% line:83% align:start
that they perceive to be
weaker than them.

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:28.689 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Where I'm from in Switzerland,

00:11:28.822 --> 00:11:30.758 position:10% line:89% align:start
there are a ton of mountains.

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:34.995 position:10% line:83% align:start
I always felt as if the world
was trying to trap me inside.

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:37.264 position:27% line:83% align:start
It pissed me off
'cause it felt like

00:11:37.398 --> 00:11:40.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
other people were deciding
what I could do.

00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:42.403 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, I chose to
take on the world

00:11:42.537 --> 00:11:44.038 position:21% line:89% align:start
with my own two legs.

00:11:44.438 --> 00:11:46.373 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's not a mountain
anywhere in the world

00:11:46.508 --> 00:11:47.708 position:21% line:89% align:start
that I can't conquer.

00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:50.711 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even someone like you
made it up here.

00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:52.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
You should believe
in yourself more.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.317 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] I'll admit.
I'm a little impressed.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.918 position:30% line:89% align:start
Really, Piltz?

00:11:58.553 --> 00:11:59.954 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, I only said "little".

00:12:00.087 --> 00:12:01.623 position:19% line:89% align:start
You need to train more!

00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:03.190 position:21% line:89% align:start
You stupid weakling!

00:12:04.992 --> 00:12:06.561 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO]
Hey, are you two ready?

00:12:06.695 --> 00:12:08.028 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH] Huh?

00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:09.730 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] What do you say
we start heading down?

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:11.899 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Oh, sure!

00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:19.373 position:24% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] It really
is beautiful today, isn't it?

00:12:19.507 --> 00:12:20.642 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Sure is!

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:22.409 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why're you just sitting there?

00:12:22.544 --> 00:12:23.645 position:19% line:89% align:start
We'll leave you behind!

00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:26.880 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Okay, coming!

00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.558 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] Thank you both
so much for today.

00:12:36.691 --> 00:12:38.192 position:27% line:83% align:start
Feel free to come
visit the shop

00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:39.293 position:27% line:89% align:start
any time, girls.

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.362 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Sure!
I'll come again soon.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.398 position:19% line:83% align:start
[CHIHIRO] Sounds nice.
Have a good night!

00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:47.968 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Hey, um,

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.170 position:7% line:89% align:start
thank you for helping Chihiro.

00:12:50.337 --> 00:12:52.273 position:10% line:89% align:start
I didn't do anything special

00:12:52.574 --> 00:12:56.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
You did. I got to see
that you're the kind of person

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.911 position:19% line:83% align:start
who can heal everybody
that you meet.

00:12:58.045 --> 00:13:00.214 position:16% line:89% align:start
Even without your powers.

00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:03.250 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] You're just
stating the obvious.

00:13:03.384 --> 00:13:04.519 position:41% line:89% align:start
Stupid.

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:06.755 position:38% line:89% align:start
But well,

00:13:07.021 --> 00:13:08.757 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess I wouldn't mind
helping you

00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:10.157 position:16% line:89% align:start
to become a better hero.

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:12.459 position:24% line:83% align:start
If that's something
you'd be open to.

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:14.295 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Huh?

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:16.397 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm mostly just worried about
Miss Nagata, though,

00:13:16.531 --> 00:13:18.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I'll just come by
every once in a while.

00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:20.502 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Smell ya later!

00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:21.835 position:38% line:89% align:start
[smiles]

00:13:22.704 --> 00:13:26.807 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Maybe someday,
I'll conquer my own mountain.

00:13:30.645 --> 00:13:31.945 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Shy!

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:46.860 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Fire!

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.268 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY] You'll be late
if you don't leave soon, Teru.

00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:57.971 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Please,
don't watch my secret training!

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.379 position:16% line:83% align:start
Piltz was able to use her
healing powers on Chihiro

00:14:05.513 --> 00:14:08.550 position:13% line:83% align:start
without her Heart-shifting
into her hero form.

00:14:09.116 --> 00:14:10.317 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wonder if I'll be able to use

00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:12.554 position:27% line:83% align:start
my heart's power
in a similar way.

00:14:13.087 --> 00:14:14.656 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hiya. Good morning!

00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:15.923 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Shy sighs]

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:17.491 position:35% line:89% align:start
Momijiyama?

00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:19.594 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, hey, Koishikawa,
good morning!

00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:20.894 position:19% line:89% align:start
I was just thinking...

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:22.664 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wait, what're you wearing?

00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:24.465 position:24% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Your uniform.

00:14:24.632 --> 00:14:26.066 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah, you mean this?

00:14:26.233 --> 00:14:29.036 position:21% line:83% align:start
They finally sent me
my school uniform!

00:14:30.404 --> 00:14:32.707 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's great! You're so cute!

00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:34.007 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:35.543 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
So, what's up, space cadet?

00:14:35.677 --> 00:14:38.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is something wrong?
I'm happy to help if I can.

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:40.447 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, I'm fine.

00:14:40.615 --> 00:14:42.650 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I can't talk
to Koishikawa about this.

00:14:42.784 --> 00:14:44.485 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not after I said
all that embarrassing stuff

00:14:44.619 --> 00:14:46.654 position:19% line:83% align:start
about getting stronger
the other day.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.523 position:16% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Koishikawa.

00:14:48.656 --> 00:14:49.691 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh? Mornin'!

00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:51.358 position:30% line:83% align:start
Good meowning,
Momijiyama!

00:14:51.492 --> 00:14:53.127 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Yeah, good morning.

00:14:53.394 --> 00:14:54.928 position:21% line:83% align:start
[INUYAMA] By the way,
you look super cute

00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:56.230 position:27% line:89% align:start
in that uniform.

00:14:56.363 --> 00:14:57.599 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NEKOGAWA]
Is your leg all better?

00:14:57.732 --> 00:15:00.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Oh! Yeah.
it's much better now.

00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:03.838 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHY] No matter what,
I have to figure out

00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:05.607 position:16% line:89% align:start
how to control my powers.

00:15:08.877 --> 00:15:10.310 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Fire.

00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:12.980 position:44% line:89% align:start
Fire.

00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:15.382 position:44% line:89% align:start
Fire!

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.753 position:27% line:89% align:start
Fire. Fire. Fire?

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:20.555 position:44% line:89% align:start
Fire.

00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:26.326 position:24% line:89% align:start
I was so distracted

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
that I couldn't concentrate
during any classes!

00:15:28.663 --> 00:15:30.832 position:13% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Not heading home yet,
Momijiyama?

00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:32.433 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, not yet.

00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:35.135 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I-I thought I'd stay
after school for a bit.

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:36.336 position:33% line:89% align:start
[IKO] Gotcha.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.405 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, I'll see ya tomorrow!

00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:44.945 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I don't wanna make
Koishikawa worry about me.

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.980 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have to figure out
my powers on my own.

00:15:47.114 --> 00:15:49.249 position:21% line:83% align:start
[WALLA: SPORTS TEAM]
Fight on!

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:51.920 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Fire.

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:54.221 position:24% line:89% align:start
Flames of passion?

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:56.423 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:05.600 position:21% line:83% align:start
The way the character
for "flame" is written

00:16:05.733 --> 00:16:07.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
feels warm somehow.

00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:08.603 position:16% line:89% align:start
I guess the word "flame"

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:10.672 position:33% line:83% align:start
feels hotter
than the word "fire".

00:16:11.673 --> 00:16:14.709 position:10% line:83% align:start
What's the difference between
flames and fire, anyway?

00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:16.310 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are they different sizes?

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:18.145 position:27% line:83% align:start
Or maybe they're
the same thing.

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:20.380 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NOPPO]
Hey, did you need something?

00:16:20.515 --> 00:16:22.216 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh? [gasps]

00:16:24.686 --> 00:16:25.620 position:33% line:89% align:start
[NOPPO] Huh?

00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:27.354 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, I was just..

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:29.323 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was thinking that I really
liked how the word

00:16:29.456 --> 00:16:31.492 position:16% line:83% align:start
"flame" was written here,
that's all!

00:16:32.827 --> 00:16:34.127 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is the one that I did.

00:16:34.261 --> 00:16:35.697 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm glad you like it.

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:37.966 position:27% line:83% align:start
Calligraphy club.
Do you wanna come?

00:16:38.098 --> 00:16:39.701 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, I...

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:43.571 position:24% line:89% align:start
Uh, sure. Let's go.

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:46.373 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Prez.

00:16:46.508 --> 00:16:48.475 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I can't be
wasting time like this.

00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:51.011 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait there a second.

00:16:51.946 --> 00:16:53.313 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Huh?

00:17:08.462 --> 00:17:09.531 position:44% line:89% align:start
Done.

00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:11.699 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:13.568 position:24% line:89% align:start
Who's your friend?

00:17:13.902 --> 00:17:15.102 position:24% line:89% align:start
She came to watch.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.272 position:35% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT]
To watch? But why our club?

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.708 position:33% line:83% align:start
She said that
she liked my calligraphy.

00:17:20.842 --> 00:17:21.809 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah.

00:17:21.943 --> 00:17:23.310 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, she ain't a bad person.

00:17:23.845 --> 00:17:26.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, everyone is welcome
at the calligraphy club,

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:27.982 position:35% line:83% align:start
so go ahead
and make yourself at home.

00:17:28.115 --> 00:17:29.651 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Huh?

00:17:30.018 --> 00:17:31.553 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:17:40.028 --> 00:17:42.964 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHY] She has such good posture
when she's about to write.

00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:44.398 position:35% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT]
I'm curious.

00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:46.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
What is it you like about
the "flame" calligraphy?

00:17:46.734 --> 00:17:48.068 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh. It, um.

00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:50.370 position:10% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT] I get the feeling
you're new to calligraphy.

00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:54.341 position:10% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I'm not really sure
what it was exactly.

00:17:54.474 --> 00:17:57.011 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHY] That one caught my eye
when I was walking past it,

00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:59.581 position:19% line:83% align:start
and maybe it's strange
to say this.

00:17:59.714 --> 00:18:01.248 position:30% line:83% align:start
But it was like
there was actual heat

00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:02.550 position:21% line:89% align:start
coming off the page.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.053 position:13% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT] That's a really
unique way of putting it.

00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:07.154 position:7% line:89% align:start
I sound really weird, don't I?

00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:09.057 position:19% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Not at all,

00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:10.324 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think it makes
a lot of sense,

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:11.893 position:19% line:89% align:start
it does to me at least.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:14.862 position:10% line:83% align:start
On the outside, she can seem
like the unmotivated type,

00:18:14.996 --> 00:18:17.297 position:24% line:83% align:start
but her calligraphy
is actually really delicate

00:18:17.699 --> 00:18:19.466 position:13% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT] It's got a lot
of passion in it.

00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:22.402 position:7% line:83% align:start
Whatever you're feeling inside
comes out in what you write.

00:18:24.072 --> 00:18:25.372 position:21% line:89% align:start
Could you quiet down?

00:18:26.139 --> 00:18:28.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT] You're the one
who invited her to observe.

00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:31.679 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sure, but you guys are still
bein' kinda distracting.

00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:35.717 position:21% line:89% align:start
Your thoughts on it?

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.185 position:35% line:83% align:start
Looks good!
Next time, aim for balance.

00:18:38.318 --> 00:18:39.386 position:44% line:89% align:start
'Kay.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.888 position:19% line:89% align:start
Mm, what do you think?

00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:45.125 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't know as much about
this stuff as you two do.

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:47.361 position:19% line:83% align:start
But your writing feels
warm to me.

00:18:47.695 --> 00:18:49.831 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
I mean, I like it a lot.

00:18:50.031 --> 00:18:51.699 position:13% line:89% align:start
Cool. I'm glad that you do.

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:52.934 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:18:53.067 --> 00:18:54.802 position:13% line:83% align:start
Looks to me like somebody's
pretty happy.

00:18:54.936 --> 00:18:56.838 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, just shut up already.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.307 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do you wanna give it a try?

00:19:00.675 --> 00:19:02.010 position:13% line:89% align:start
Since you're already here.

00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:04.078 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, I dunno if I..

00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:06.480 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Try everything.

00:19:06.614 --> 00:19:08.683 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NOPPO]
Even if you suck at first.

00:19:10.317 --> 00:19:11.686 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
What do I do?

00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:22.997 position:33% line:89% align:start
Um, I think..

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think that this one
turned out pretty well.

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:30.237 position:7% line:83% align:start
Mm-hmm. I see a lot of passion
in your calligraphy, too.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.807 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Yeah
-[SHY] You really think so?

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.408 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is just my theory,

00:19:34.542 --> 00:19:35.910 position:7% line:83% align:start
but I believe that calligraphy
connects to your heart

00:19:36.044 --> 00:19:38.079 position:24% line:83% align:start
more than any other
art form out there.

00:19:38.613 --> 00:19:41.181 position:7% line:89% align:start
Huh? You paint from your heart?

00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:42.884 position:27% line:89% align:start
[PRESIDENT] Yup.

00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:45.987 position:16% line:89% align:start
You only have one brush,

00:19:46.253 --> 00:19:47.622 position:13% line:89% align:start
and there are no do overs.

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:50.658 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, you have to focus carefully
on each movement.

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:53.127 position:7% line:83% align:start
The things you want to express
from your heart

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.829 position:19% line:89% align:start
pass through your arm.

00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:57.065 position:16% line:89% align:start
They move into the brush,

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
and eventually become
a character on the page.

00:20:00.267 --> 00:20:03.303 position:10% line:83% align:start
The piece is born out of each
careful flick of the wrist.

00:20:04.438 --> 00:20:06.607 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's like the very essence
of your heart.

00:20:11.045 --> 00:20:12.613 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's it!

00:20:13.648 --> 00:20:14.949 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
That's right!

00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:16.551 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I want to bring out
what's in my heart.

00:20:16.684 --> 00:20:19.153 position:24% line:83% align:start
This idea might be
the perfect way to do it.

00:20:19.352 --> 00:20:21.221 position:19% line:89% align:start
I, um, have to go home!

00:20:21.354 --> 00:20:22.657 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[PRESIDENT] Huh?
-Thank you both.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.826 position:24% line:83% align:start
I really appreciate
you helping me!

00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:26.326 position:27% line:89% align:start
[PRESIDENT] Sure.

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.997 position:7% line:89% align:start
What do you think got into her?

00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:31.833 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-What is it?

00:20:32.033 --> 00:20:34.301 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NOPPO] I forgot to ask her
for her name.

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:35.703 position:35% line:83% align:start
[PRESIDENT]
Come to think of it,

00:20:35.837 --> 00:20:37.739 position:16% line:83% align:start
we didn't tell her ours,
either.

00:20:46.981 --> 00:20:49.449 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY] Teru.
What are you doing?

00:20:49.951 --> 00:20:52.720 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm going to write
with my heart.

00:20:54.387 --> 00:20:56.924 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
All right. It can't be random.

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.326 position:7% line:89% align:start
I need to focus on each stroke.

00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:01.294 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have to take
what's in my heart

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.664 position:7% line:89% align:start
and let it flow onto the page.

00:21:04.464 --> 00:21:06.366 position:16% line:89% align:start
How do I feel right now?

00:21:06.968 --> 00:21:08.401 position:30% line:89% align:start
Am I panicking?

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.370 position:30% line:89% align:start
Or am I scared?

00:21:14.976 --> 00:21:18.311 position:35% line:83% align:start
Picture it.
Do it over, and over.

00:21:19.213 --> 00:21:21.182 position:10% line:89% align:start
It doesn't matter how I feel.

00:21:21.314 --> 00:21:22.817 position:30% line:89% align:start
I've got to...

00:21:23.718 --> 00:21:25.653 position:16% line:89% align:start
let it out in my writing.

00:21:34.829 --> 00:21:36.363 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow!

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:38.132 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SHY] I did it!

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.035 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even I can succeed
if I work at it!

00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:43.137 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm so glad I didn't give up!

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.605 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY]
Teru. Hey!

00:21:44.739 --> 00:21:46.707 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-[SHRIMPY] It's on fire!

00:21:47.108 --> 00:21:48.308 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:50.443 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Sh-Shrimpy! Get some water!

00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:51.879 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SHRIMPY] Huh?

00:23:29.476 --> 00:23:32.513 position:50% line:89% align:start
