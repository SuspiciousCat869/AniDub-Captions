Huh?!

00:18:32.547 --> 00:18:35.182 position:30% line:83% align:start
She's conscious
and will be just fine.

00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:38.720 position:13% line:89% align:start
No matter what anyone says,

00:18:38.853 --> 00:18:40.320 position:16% line:89% align:start
you saved precious lives,

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:42.222 position:13% line:89% align:start
and that makes you a Hero.

00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:45.793 position:13% line:83% align:start
But that's just my opinion
on the matter.

00:18:47.862 --> 00:18:48.963 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Right.

00:18:49.196 --> 00:18:50.632 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:18:51.933 --> 00:18:53.200 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:56.136 position:30% line:89% align:start
Aw, sweetheart!

00:18:56.269 --> 00:18:57.739 position:19% line:89% align:start
What're you crying for?

00:18:57.872 --> 00:19:00.675 position:27% line:83% align:start
You should smile
at a time like this!

00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:02.510 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:19:02.677 --> 00:19:03.678 position:38% line:89% align:start
Alrighty,

00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:05.345 position:30% line:83% align:start
what do you say
we get going, then?

00:19:05.513 --> 00:19:07.081 position:30% line:89% align:start
What? Go where?

00:19:07.247 --> 00:19:09.651 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why, to outer space, of course!

00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:11.052 position:30% line:89% align:start
I remembered...

00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:14.622 position:13% line:83% align:start
the real reason that I came
to see you the other day, Teru!

00:19:15.056 --> 00:19:16.289 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:19:17.224 --> 00:19:18.660 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:31.739 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:19:31.873 --> 00:19:32.874 position:35% line:89% align:start
[quivering]

00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:36.010 position:27% line:83% align:start
Beamed into space
in two seconds flat!

00:19:36.276 --> 00:19:38.980 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ahem! Where exactly are we?

00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:40.280 position:19% line:89% align:start
This place is basically

00:19:40.414 --> 00:19:42.517 position:27% line:83% align:start
a secret hideout
for Heroes like us.

00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:45.953 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
It's a pleasure to meet you,

00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:47.889 position:27% line:89% align:start
Teru Momijiyama.

00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:49.189 position:35% line:89% align:start
Or rather,

00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:51.859 position:24% line:89% align:start
the Hero of Japan.

00:19:52.627 --> 00:19:53.861 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shy.

00:19:55.429 --> 00:19:58.032 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's been three months
since you became a Hero.

00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:01.703 position:13% line:83% align:start
I truly wish that you and I
could have met sooner.

00:20:02.436 --> 00:20:03.871 position:30% line:89% align:start
But no matter.

00:20:05.973 --> 00:20:07.542 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Hold on.
-[gasps]

00:20:07.675 --> 00:20:08.710 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shy?

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.310 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you able to hear me?

00:20:10.444 --> 00:20:11.679 position:33% line:89% align:start
[whimpering]

00:20:15.348 --> 00:20:16.784 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is something the matter?

00:20:16.918 --> 00:20:18.619 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, she's shy, get it?

00:20:19.787 --> 00:20:22.355 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
She's just so beautiful!

00:20:22.924 --> 00:20:25.225 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, and who might you be?

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.360 position:16% line:89% align:start
I am the one charged with

00:20:27.494 --> 00:20:29.997 position:27% line:83% align:start
watching over all
the Heroes of Earth.

00:20:30.363 --> 00:20:33.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
The Heavenly Empress Unilord.

00:20:33.201 --> 00:20:34.468 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Empress?

00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:37.004 position:21% line:83% align:start
But there is no need
for such formality.

00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:38.305 position:41% line:89% align:start
Please,

00:20:38.438 --> 00:20:40.208 position:7% line:89% align:start
I prefer that those dear to me

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.275 position:30% line:83% align:start
refer to me by
a different name.

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:43.644 position:38% line:89% align:start
Call me,

00:20:43.778 --> 00:20:44.846 position:38% line:89% align:start
"Eunnie."

00:20:46.047 --> 00:20:47.081 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:47.481 --> 00:20:48.716 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:20:50.952 --> 00:20:52.053 position:27% line:89% align:start
That was a joke.

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:53.621 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
She's got jokes?

00:20:54.222 --> 00:20:55.322 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right then, Eunnie.

00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:56.657 position:30% line:83% align:start
Let's get right
down to business.

00:20:56.791 --> 00:20:59.359 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[SHY] She called her that?!
-Right.

00:20:59.493 --> 00:21:01.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
I suppose I'll get
straight to the point, then.

00:21:03.531 --> 00:21:05.432 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sometime in the future,

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:07.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
we will come to face a danger

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.703 position:10% line:89% align:start
that is utterly incomparable

00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:11.606 position:24% line:83% align:start
to anything we have
ever faced before.

00:21:11.739 --> 00:21:12.774 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:14.142 --> 00:21:15.475 position:24% line:89% align:start
And that, my dear,

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.246 position:19% line:83% align:start
is the very reason why
you heroes of Earth

00:21:18.378 --> 00:21:19.412 position:27% line:89% align:start
have come to be.

00:21:19.847 --> 00:21:22.183 position:24% line:83% align:start
Although the world
may be free of war,

00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:25.586 position:24% line:83% align:start
there is a darkness
that exists in everyone's heart

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.421 position:21% line:83% align:start
that they do not wish
for anyone else to see.

00:21:28.756 --> 00:21:30.323 position:21% line:89% align:start
No matter who we are,

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:32.860 position:10% line:89% align:start
that shadow lives within us.

00:21:33.528 --> 00:21:35.462 position:44% line:83% align:start
There
are those who shun the light

00:21:35.596 --> 00:21:38.298 position:24% line:83% align:start
and take advantage
of the dark instead.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:39.667 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shy,

00:21:40.134 --> 00:21:41.903 position:27% line:89% align:start
understand this.

00:21:42.236 --> 00:21:44.238 position:16% line:89% align:start
The true duty of a hero,

00:21:44.772 --> 00:21:47.708 position:24% line:83% align:start
is to be a shining
beacon of hope for the people

00:21:48.109 --> 00:21:52.046 position:30% line:83% align:start
and, to protect
the very heart of the world.

00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:55.448 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't understand,
what do you mean by the heart?

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.450 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:21:57.585 --> 00:21:59.787 position:24% line:83% align:start
I promise it'll all
make sense eventually.

00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:05.793 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHY] We live in an age
where war has ceased to exist.

00:22:06.727 --> 00:22:09.897 position:21% line:83% align:start
An age where everyone
dreams of lasting peace.

00:22:11.132 --> 00:22:12.533 position:38% line:89% align:start
This age,

00:22:12.667 --> 00:22:15.102 position:13% line:83% align:start
was a time in human history
when we'd understand

00:22:15.236 --> 00:22:17.404 position:10% line:89% align:start
why the heart mattered most.

00:22:25.445 --> 00:22:27.315 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
An incomparable threat.

00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:29.150 position:19% line:89% align:start
And the duty of heroes.

00:22:29.416 --> 00:22:32.920 position:7% line:83% align:start
There is so much going on that
it feels impossible to process.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.290 position:16% line:83% align:start
What even is this threat
they were talking about?

00:22:36.591 --> 00:22:38.259 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right, quiet down!

00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:39.560 position:16% line:89% align:start
As I told you last week,

00:22:39.694 --> 00:22:40.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
we're going to have
a new student

00:22:40.795 --> 00:22:42.163 position:16% line:89% align:start
joining our class today.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.966 position:27% line:83% align:start
[TEACHER] You can
come in now, Koishikawa.

00:22:45.266 --> 00:22:46.634 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Sure.

00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:49.503 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:22:51.305 --> 00:22:52.540 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:58.246 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hi there, my name's
Iko Koishikawa!

00:22:58.478 --> 00:22:59.881 position:24% line:83% align:start
Before coming here,
I used to attend

00:23:00.014 --> 00:23:01.849 position:24% line:83% align:start
Karen Middle School
in the next town over.

00:23:01.983 --> 00:23:03.684 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's so nice to meet you all!

00:23:03.818 --> 00:23:05.385 position:21% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE CLASSMATE 1A]
She's seriously gorgeous!

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:06.954 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MALE CLASSMATE 1A]
Karen Middle School?

00:23:07.088 --> 00:23:08.623 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MALE CLASSMATE 1B]
She's gotta be smart, then!

00:23:08.756 --> 00:23:10.091 position:21% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE CLASSMATE 1B]
Why is she on crutches?

00:23:10.358 --> 00:23:12.226 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TEACHER] Right. Your seat will
be right over there.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.594 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Right.

00:23:14.862 --> 00:23:16.898 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Iko Koishikawa.

00:23:17.231 --> 00:23:18.733 position:27% line:89% align:start
She's the one...

00:23:20.268 --> 00:23:21.769 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MALE CLASSMATE 1C]
Uh, need some help?

00:23:22.003 --> 00:23:24.505 position:24% line:83% align:start
I appreciate that,
but I'll be just fine.

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:28.509 position:33% line:83% align:start
She's the one
that Shy failed to save.

00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:31.078 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:23:34.515 --> 00:23:36.017 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet you.

00:23:36.651 --> 00:23:37.919 position:27% line:89% align:start
[nervous chuckle]

00:23:38.119 --> 00:23:41.656 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Yeah,
it's nice to meet you, too.
