00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.013 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's review the rules,
shall we?

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:16.316 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you manage to hit my face
even once in battle,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.720 position:13% line:89% align:start
we'll name you the victor.

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.523 position:19% line:89% align:start
Okay. That makes sense.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.192 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why are they doing this?

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.197 position:44% line:83% align:start
Shy.
When this coin hits the floor,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
that's when our fight begins.

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:34.034 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it?

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.402 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Yes.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.509 position:35% line:83% align:start
Momijiyama!
Don't push yourself!

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:49.082 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.810 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:29.316 position:16% line:89% align:start
What, what just happened?

00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:31.251 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.253 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
Why're you holding back?

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:40.828 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's evident that you have
no idea how to punch someone.

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:43.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHY] He, he's dodging
all my attacks.

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:44.932 position:33% line:89% align:start
Or rather...

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.769 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Take that! I can't hit him!

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:53.273 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
If you want to punch someone.

00:02:55.143 --> 00:02:56.711 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is how you do it.

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.783 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Shy coughs]

00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:03.918 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
I have been called "heartless"

00:03:04.052 --> 00:03:05.787 position:19% line:89% align:start
by many people in life.

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:09.524 position:16% line:83% align:start
I simply lack the ability
to empathize with people.

00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:11.458 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
I am not swayed by the feelings

00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:13.061 position:24% line:89% align:start
of those around me.

00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:16.597 position:19% line:83% align:start
Due to that, I can put
all I have into every blow.

00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:19.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
The pain of others
doesn't even register to me.

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
You however,

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.871 position:10% line:83% align:start
are an incredibly empathetic
kind of person.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.773 position:13% line:89% align:start
You care deeply for others,

00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:27.108 position:19% line:89% align:start
and take pity on them.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.309 position:21% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST] And you do
everything for their sake.

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:31.311 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's a wonderful thing.

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:34.247 position:33% line:83% align:start
But it's also
what makes you weak.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.783 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's why you fail.

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:38.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because your heart
won't allow you to win.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.253 position:24% line:89% align:start
It rejects victory.

00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:47.628 position:24% line:83% align:start
But why aren't any
of her attacks hitting him?

00:03:47.762 --> 00:03:50.397 position:21% line:83% align:start
Stardust hasn't moved
since the fight started.

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.299 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
The Heart-shift bracelets,

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:54.569 position:27% line:83% align:start
do not only grant
the users strength.

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:56.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
They also grant them
unique powers

00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.873 position:10% line:89% align:start
in response to their hearts.

00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:03.945 position:7% line:83% align:start
Stardust's heart, for example,
cannot be swayed by anyone.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:05.613 position:24% line:89% align:start
His immovable heart

00:04:05.747 --> 00:04:08.516 position:27% line:83% align:start
controls the flow
of everything around him.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:12.520 position:27% line:83% align:start
The air, energy,
even the heat in his vicinity.

00:04:12.754 --> 00:04:14.822 position:7% line:89% align:start
All of it is under his control.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.692 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
It's true, my power

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:19.359 position:27% line:89% align:start
is exactly that!

00:04:22.997 --> 00:04:25.700 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do everything
to find your own power.

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:29.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, you don't stand
a chance at survival.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.275 position:35% line:83% align:start
Get angry.
Think of why you hate me.

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:38.079 position:21% line:83% align:start
Imagine all the ways
to kill me.

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:41.481 position:41% line:83% align:start
To win,
you must wish for my death.

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:43.383 position:35% line:89% align:start
Or else...

00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:48.055 position:10% line:83% align:start
I won't hesitate to kill you
where you stand.

00:04:49.724 --> 00:04:51.458 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Teru!
-[STARDUST] Stay back!

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.829 position:10% line:89% align:start
Take one step and she loses.

00:04:55.663 --> 00:04:57.598 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] You're going
way too far with this!

00:04:57.732 --> 00:05:00.735 position:30% line:83% align:start
Going too far?
How do you mean?

00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:03.370 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
You really are the worst.

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:06.373 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've seen that look before.

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:09.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
It doesn't affect me
in the slightest.

00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:14.414 position:38% line:83% align:start
Well now,
is this it for you then?

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:16.316 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
You're a weakling.

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.719 position:24% line:83% align:start
And you got Spirit
all riled up.

00:05:19.587 --> 00:05:22.623 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, I won't give up.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.092 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh really?

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.661 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Shy groans]

00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:33.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please, Unilord!
Why won't you stop him?

00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:34.902 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's gone too far!

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:37.572 position:24% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] I cannot.
[SPIRIT] Why?

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.641 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
Because, you see,

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:43.311 position:27% line:83% align:start
Shy's Heart-shift
is still active.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.979 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:46.681 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
And that means.

00:05:47.148 --> 00:05:48.716 position:21% line:89% align:start
She hasn't given up.

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:53.453 position:19% line:83% align:start
Momijiyama! Stop this!
Let's go home!

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:55.488 position:21% line:83% align:start
[IKO] You don't have
to put yourself through this

00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:57.291 position:24% line:89% align:start
just to be a hero!

00:05:57.424 --> 00:05:59.327 position:30% line:83% align:start
I already know
how hard you've worked

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.494 position:10% line:89% align:start
to get to where you are now!

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:04.832 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Koishika... wa.

00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:11.105 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now, what do we have here?

00:06:13.274 --> 00:06:18.445 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I didn't understand
why I said it at first.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.681 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll do my best.

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:22.283 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll beat you!

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.518 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm weak like you said.

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:28.789 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm scared all the time,
and cry so easily.

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:32.727 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHY] So, I dunno
why I said I'd beat you.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST] What's this?
Something's different.

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.965 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Then I remembered.

00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:40.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
Whenever I wanted
to call it quits

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:42.036 position:21% line:89% align:start
or start complaining.

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:44.505 position:21% line:89% align:start
I would hear a voice.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.743 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was a voice calling out
my name.

00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:50.645 position:19% line:89% align:start
The warmth of kindness

00:06:50.778 --> 00:06:53.480 position:13% line:83% align:start
is what sparked the flames
of bravery within me.

00:06:55.116 --> 00:06:56.150 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:06:57.218 --> 00:06:58.586 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Flames.

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:00.855 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness.

00:07:01.856 --> 00:07:05.960 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I can stand, that means
I can still fight.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.562 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
It's beginning to awaken.

00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:14.101 position:30% line:83% align:start
The true power
within Shy's heart.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.469 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mm. Flames, huh?

00:07:16.938 --> 00:07:18.973 position:10% line:83% align:start
I guess we get a little peek
of your powers,

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:20.440 position:30% line:89% align:start
after all then.

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:23.077 position:13% line:83% align:start
But if this is all the fire
you've got,

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.645 position:24% line:89% align:start
you should give up.

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:26.714 position:44% line:89% align:start
Fine.

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:29.617 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHY] He's right.
I have to use my powers.

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:33.854 position:44% line:89% align:start
Woah!

00:07:34.088 --> 00:07:35.523 position:24% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST] The heat
of the flames she creates

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:38.059 position:7% line:89% align:start
reflects her life force itself.

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:40.194 position:27% line:83% align:start
-How interesting.
-[screams]

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:43.564 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
She draws forth her power

00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:45.800 position:41% line:83% align:start
in such
a straightforward manner.

00:07:46.334 --> 00:07:47.335 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:50.037 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
So, flames are your power?

00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:52.006 position:21% line:89% align:start
It doesn't suit you.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.308 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're far too meek for it.

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:56.476 position:16% line:83% align:start
While, while you might be
right to a point,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.681 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not that helpless because
I-I saw what just happened!

00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:04.185 position:13% line:83% align:start
You had to dodge my flames
just now.

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:06.687 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
And that tells me one thing,

00:08:07.188 --> 00:08:10.658 position:19% line:83% align:start
it means that my flames
are about to hit you!

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.194 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wait what?

00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:15.663 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're not that stupid,
are you?

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:18.666 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your naivetÃ© will ensure
your defeat.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.735 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
You'll never kill anyone,

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:22.136 position:24% line:89% align:start
thinking like that.

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:28.275 position:19% line:89% align:start
[STARDUST] Eventually,

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:30.411 position:19% line:83% align:start
you're going to wind up
dead somewhere.

00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:33.814 position:10% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST] Killed by someone
as heartless as I am.

00:08:36.584 --> 00:08:37.952 position:27% line:89% align:start
We're done here.

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:40.087 position:24% line:83% align:start
You'll probably be
a lot happier now

00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:42.723 position:13% line:83% align:start
that you get to quit being
a hero.

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.727 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
You're a liar.

00:08:47.428 --> 00:08:48.896 position:33% line:89% align:start
I mean that.

00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:51.732 position:35% line:89% align:start
Momijiyama.

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:55.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHY] You're lying
when you say you're heartless.

00:08:56.404 --> 00:08:57.838 position:19% line:89% align:start
You knew from the start

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:00.641 position:7% line:89% align:start
how fragile my heart really is.

00:09:01.075 --> 00:09:04.712 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that's why you didn't
hold back at all.

00:09:05.446 --> 00:09:08.983 position:13% line:83% align:start
So that I could attack you
with everything I had in me.

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.852 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
It was to make me hate you.

00:09:13.187 --> 00:09:14.523 position:30% line:89% align:start
And if that...

00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:18.592 position:7% line:83% align:start
if that kindness doesn't prove
you aren't heartless,

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:20.594 position:30% line:89% align:start
then what does?

00:09:21.462 --> 00:09:22.730 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
I see.

00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:25.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
I understand why something
felt strange before.

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:29.103 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHY] That's why I need
to respond to your kindness.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.639 position:16% line:89% align:start
With everything I've got.

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:34.475 position:13% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST] When I look into
this girl's eyes.

00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:36.777 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't find even
the faintest glimmer

00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:38.245 position:24% line:89% align:start
of hatred in them.

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:41.682 position:16% line:83% align:start
Normally, when something
precious to a person is harmed,

00:09:41.816 --> 00:09:43.417 position:19% line:89% align:start
you can see their hate.

00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:45.719 position:24% line:83% align:start
It reflects plainly
in their eyes.

00:09:45.853 --> 00:09:47.455 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just like with Spirit.

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:50.224 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's never bothered me
in the slightest.

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:54.261 position:21% line:89% align:start
And yet this girl...

00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:55.896 position:30% line:89% align:start
Now, get ready!

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.099 position:16% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST] She says that
I showed her kindness?

00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:00.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
What kind of rubbish
is she spouting?

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:03.704 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is this actually
making me angry?

00:10:06.774 --> 00:10:07.842 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE VOICE 4A]
You're heartless.

00:10:07.975 --> 00:10:08.876 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MALE VOICE 4A]
Psychopath.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.512 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MALE VOICE 4B]
You're the devil.

00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:11.712 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE VOICE 4B]
Hypocrite.

00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:12.980 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MALE VOICE 4C]
You monster!

00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:15.483 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
He's faltering.

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:18.752 position:7% line:83% align:start
Stardust's heart has never been
moved by anyone until now.

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.088 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
So, what if I am?

00:10:21.523 --> 00:10:23.357 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your words mean nothing to me!

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:27.027 position:10% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND]
Davie!

00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:28.796 position:21% line:89% align:start
What happened to you?

00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:30.331 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're all banged up.

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:34.301 position:7% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST (YOUNG)] I got jumped
by another gang of idiots.

00:10:34.536 --> 00:10:35.936 position:7% line:89% align:start
They kept running their mouths

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.405 position:13% line:83% align:start
and going on about my being
"heartless" or whatever.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.040 position:10% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND]
Oh, that again?

00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:42.276 position:16% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I didn't really
feel anything at all

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:43.844 position:16% line:83% align:start
when I was hitting them.
So, I guess

00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:46.080 position:13% line:83% align:start
they weren't wrong about me
after all.

00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:48.583 position:10% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND]
So, you got back at them, then?

00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:51.986 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but I got beat up
pretty good in the end.

00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:53.888 position:10% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND]
Why stoop to their level?

00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:56.357 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? What do you mean?
Because...

00:10:56.525 --> 00:10:59.894 position:7% line:83% align:start
When they called you heartless,
it made you mad, huh?

00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:02.096 position:10% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND]
But the fact that you got mad

00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:04.165 position:13% line:89% align:start
proves you do have a heart!

00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:06.333 position:16% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST (YOUNG)] That's
a weird way of putting it,

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:07.935 position:38% line:89% align:start
but sure.

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:10.171 position:10% line:83% align:start
See, getting angry when they
say you don't have a heart,

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.006 position:19% line:83% align:start
only goes to show that
you want to become

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.841 position:24% line:83% align:start
the kind of person
they say you're not.

00:11:13.974 --> 00:11:15.776 position:21% line:89% align:start
Does that make sense?

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:19.813 position:13% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST (YOUNG)] How can
you be so sure about that?

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:22.183 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't even know
what having a heart is like.

00:11:22.316 --> 00:11:23.751 position:10% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND]
I'm pretty sure there's nobody

00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:25.286 position:33% line:83% align:start
in the world
who really understands

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:26.754 position:19% line:89% align:start
what it means, either.

00:11:28.422 --> 00:11:29.456 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.192 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh! I've got it, Davie!

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:33.394 position:16% line:83% align:start
You should try to become
the nicest person

00:11:33.528 --> 00:11:35.229 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the whole entire world!

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
That'd really turn
things around, don't you think?

00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:40.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
It'd show those jerks,
and everyone else

00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:42.336 position:10% line:89% align:start
how wrong they are about you.

00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:45.472 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then you would be the one
getting to have the last laugh.

00:11:45.607 --> 00:11:47.542 position:13% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] That'd be great.

00:11:48.577 --> 00:11:49.710 position:24% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST (YOUNG)]
You're kind of messed up

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:51.045 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the head, too, you know.

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:52.913 position:10% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND]
I am not!

00:11:53.047 --> 00:11:55.249 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just like interesting things
is all!

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.124 position:16% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST] Why are those
memories coming back to me now?

00:12:07.127 --> 00:12:10.632 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHY] My body feels heavy.
I'm gonna pass out.

00:12:10.965 --> 00:12:12.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
But that doesn't matter.

00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:17.204 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have to make him see
the fire in my heart!

00:12:17.539 --> 00:12:18.973 position:35% line:89% align:start
Because...!

00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:20.307 position:10% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND]
Become the nicest person

00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:21.710 position:33% line:89% align:start
in the world!

00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:25.079 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Because I'm a hero.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.489 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Teru! No!
-Is she all right?

00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.995 position:27% line:83% align:start
Teru, why did you
push yourself so hard?

00:12:41.663 --> 00:12:43.030 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oi, Spirit.

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:46.433 position:27% line:83% align:start
She doesn't have
what it takes to be a hero.

00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:48.670 position:10% line:89% align:start
She's too naive to handle it.

00:12:48.902 --> 00:12:50.337 position:30% line:83% align:start
She can't fight
at full strength,

00:12:50.471 --> 00:12:53.007 position:24% line:83% align:start
even when her enemy
deserves her hatred.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.710 position:24% line:83% align:start
She is at the mercy
of her own emotions.

00:12:55.843 --> 00:12:58.112 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why her power
is so unstable.

00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:01.115 position:7% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST] She overused a power
she wasn't accustomed to,

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:03.851 position:19% line:83% align:start
and burned out the fire
her heart mustered.

00:13:04.385 --> 00:13:06.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's too reckless
for this life.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:11.091 position:30% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST] But,
I might be wrong.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.260 position:7% line:89% align:start
And it's maybe people like her,

00:13:13.394 --> 00:13:14.862 position:10% line:89% align:start
the naive fools of this world

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:17.031 position:19% line:83% align:start
that will change things
for the better.

00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:18.832 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you mean that?

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:20.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
I lost the match, by the way.

00:13:21.302 --> 00:13:22.803 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
With her final blow,

00:13:22.936 --> 00:13:24.171 position:13% line:89% align:start
she managed to hit my cheek

00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:27.041 position:19% line:83% align:start
before her Heart-shift
came undone.

00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:30.044 position:13% line:83% align:start
Be sure to congratulate her
for me.

00:13:30.712 --> 00:13:33.447 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've already called a doctor
to come check on her.

00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:35.249 position:30% line:89% align:start
Look after her.

00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:45.859 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
She also thinks I'm kind.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.595 position:41% line:89% align:start
Strange

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:51.832 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shy.

00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:07.047 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] Thanks a lot
for earlier, Stardust.

00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:08.982 position:16% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST] But that's not
what your eyes

00:14:09.116 --> 00:14:10.518 position:24% line:89% align:start
are saying at all.

00:14:11.018 --> 00:14:12.252 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just shut up.

00:14:12.386 --> 00:14:14.188 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't make me knock you
on your ass.

00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:16.390 position:21% line:83% align:start
Should you really be
out here with me?

00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:18.025 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nah, Iko's with her.

00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:20.160 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'd just get in the way.

00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:22.764 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
I don't like your methods,

00:14:22.896 --> 00:14:24.766 position:16% line:83% align:start
but Teru's prepared to go
into battle now,

00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:26.467 position:7% line:89% align:start
and that's all because of you.

00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:29.036 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, I guess I should thank you.

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:31.573 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, thanks. I guess.

00:14:31.706 --> 00:14:33.140 position:7% line:89% align:start
Then, you're welcome, I guess.

00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:37.545 position:19% line:83% align:start
But! I still hate your
stinking guts, you hear me?

00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:40.214 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] You really are
the worst, you know that?

00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:42.784 position:27% line:83% align:start
Who goes that far
against a young girl?

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:44.084 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:45.720 position:7% line:89% align:start
I have to say, I'm rather fond

00:14:45.854 --> 00:14:47.822 position:24% line:83% align:start
of the way you wear
your heart on your sleeve.

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:49.423 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's quite endearing.

00:14:49.557 --> 00:14:50.592 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hey!

00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:52.861 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're cruisin'
for a bruisin', buddy!

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.562 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right,
I'll be heading home now.

00:14:54.696 --> 00:14:57.231 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? Don't you run away
from me, coward!

00:14:57.364 --> 00:14:59.299 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Stop right there!

00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:07.742 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? Where, where am I?

00:15:08.108 --> 00:15:09.209 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
You're in the infirmary

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:10.745 position:19% line:89% align:start
on the hero spacecraft.

00:15:11.011 --> 00:15:13.414 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, you finally decided
to wake up.

00:15:13.815 --> 00:15:16.049 position:13% line:83% align:start
We finished your treatment
over two hours ago,

00:15:16.183 --> 00:15:18.051 position:16% line:83% align:start
but you kept on sleeping
like an idiot.

00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:19.453 position:24% line:89% align:start
And thanks to you,

00:15:19.587 --> 00:15:21.388 position:27% line:83% align:start
your friend there
cried herself to sleep.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.493 position:30% line:83% align:start
Um, I'm sorry.
Who are you?

00:15:26.895 --> 00:15:28.362 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
I know you're a newbie,

00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:29.764 position:10% line:89% align:start
but you don't know who I am?

00:15:29.898 --> 00:15:31.633 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you stupid or something?

00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:33.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
Stupid?

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:35.737 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wait. Sorry,
I think I need my glasses.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.406 position:16% line:83% align:start
Fine, you'll recognize me
if I do the thing, right?

00:15:39.808 --> 00:15:41.175 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Lady Black clears throat]

00:15:41.308 --> 00:15:43.410 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even in the darkest abyss
where there's no light,

00:15:43.545 --> 00:15:45.780 position:33% line:83% align:start
bet on Black
to be by your side.

00:15:46.447 --> 00:15:48.315 position:27% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] I am
Earth's shining black star!

00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:50.885 position:13% line:83% align:start
The light that shines upon
the hearts of the world!

00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:53.588 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm the Black Cross Nurse.

00:15:54.689 --> 00:15:56.423 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm Lady Black!

00:15:58.025 --> 00:15:59.960 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll never give up on life.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.062 position:30% line:89% align:start
Remember that.

00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:05.132 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:08.335 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't "wow" me!
You really don't know who I am?

00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:10.103 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SCHWARTZ]
All right, settle down.

00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:12.272 position:21% line:83% align:start
Keep your voices down
in the sick bay.

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:13.808 position:10% line:89% align:start
Didn't I tell you to be nice?

00:16:13.942 --> 00:16:15.075 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't be stupid, Doctor!

00:16:15.209 --> 00:16:17.044 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't get along
with this idiot!

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:19.279 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
She calls people stupid a lot.

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:20.815 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SCHWARTZ]
Sorry about her.

00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:22.316 position:27% line:89% align:start
Lady is all bark,

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:24.953 position:13% line:83% align:start
she really is a sweet girl
beneath all the yapping.

00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:26.821 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Don't treat me like a dog!

00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:28.690 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SCHWARTZ]
Pay her no mind.

00:16:28.823 --> 00:16:30.457 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Oh, thank you.

00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:33.193 position:13% line:89% align:start
Um, sorry, but who are you?

00:16:33.327 --> 00:16:34.863 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've just never
seen you before.

00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:38.131 position:13% line:83% align:start
This lively girl and I are
Black Cross Heroes.

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:39.901 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Black Cross?

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:41.870 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's a rescue organization.

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.938 position:10% line:89% align:start
Stardust created it actually.

00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:45.239 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm its representative

00:16:45.372 --> 00:16:47.509 position:16% line:83% align:start
and chief medical officer
Doctor Schwartz.

00:16:47.642 --> 00:16:48.710 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's a pleasure.

00:16:49.176 --> 00:16:50.377 position:7% line:89% align:start
And I'm here 'cause I'm working

00:16:50.512 --> 00:16:52.379 position:21% line:83% align:start
as one of the nurses
for Black Cross.

00:16:52.514 --> 00:16:55.517 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm the one who treated
your injuries, by the way.

00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:58.118 position:27% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] Wow.
You really hadn't noticed

00:16:58.252 --> 00:16:59.888 position:30% line:83% align:start
you didn't have
a scratch on you?

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.824 position:24% line:83% align:start
Huh? You're right!
That's amazing!

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:04.626 position:19% line:89% align:start
My power is "Healing".

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.596 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have a healing heart,
so I can actually save people.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.664 position:33% line:89% align:start
Healing, huh?

00:17:09.797 --> 00:17:11.398 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sounds like Stardust
acknowledged you

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:12.934 position:10% line:89% align:start
'cause of your flame powers.

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:15.803 position:10% line:83% align:start
But then, usually that stuff
just comes naturally

00:17:15.937 --> 00:17:17.371 position:7% line:89% align:start
when you're working as a hero.

00:17:17.605 --> 00:17:20.307 position:24% line:83% align:start
To put it bluntly,
you totally suck.

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:25.513 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Weren't you listening?

00:17:25.647 --> 00:17:29.049 position:30% line:83% align:start
I said Stardust
acknowledged you, dummy!

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.653 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? Did he really?

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:33.021 position:33% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Yes.

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:34.321 position:19% line:89% align:start
He left you a message.

00:17:34.454 --> 00:17:36.156 position:16% line:89% align:start
He said, "Congrats, kid."

00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:39.827 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then that means that I can
stay a hero after all.

00:17:41.829 --> 00:17:43.196 position:16% line:89% align:start
[SHY] But I don't get it.

00:17:43.598 --> 00:17:45.700 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wasn't even able to hit him.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.769 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is this really okay?

00:17:48.803 --> 00:17:49.871 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:17:50.203 --> 00:17:51.371 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let's get something straight.

00:17:51.506 --> 00:17:52.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't recognize you
as Japan's hero,

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.742 position:7% line:89% align:start
and at this rate, I never will!

00:17:55.877 --> 00:17:58.046 position:13% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] You shut down
after one mistake.

00:17:58.245 --> 00:18:00.147 position:24% line:83% align:start
You can barely use
your heart's power.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.149 position:21% line:89% align:start
And you're a crybaby!

00:18:02.584 --> 00:18:04.451 position:35% line:83% align:start
Listen up!
Heroes are supposed to make

00:18:04.586 --> 00:18:06.588 position:27% line:83% align:start
people feel safe
just by being around!

00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:08.355 position:7% line:89% align:start
We should make them feel calm!

00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:10.058 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
And what did you do?

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.793 position:16% line:83% align:start
You made an innocent girl
worry so much

00:18:11.926 --> 00:18:13.460 position:24% line:89% align:start
she started crying!

00:18:13.661 --> 00:18:15.697 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then you went and got yourself
knocked out in a mock battle!

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.231 position:7% line:83% align:start
Can you seriously call yourself
a hero?

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:20.068 position:21% line:89% align:start
Man, you're pathetic.

00:18:20.568 --> 00:18:22.971 position:21% line:83% align:start
I couldn't care less
if you're "shy" or whatever.

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna give it
to you straight.

00:18:24.806 --> 00:18:27.140 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you have any
sense of shame at all,

00:18:27.274 --> 00:18:29.176 position:13% line:83% align:start
you should just quit being
a hero right now

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:30.845 position:21% line:89% align:start
and be done with it.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.413 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're finished here, Doctor.

00:18:33.548 --> 00:18:35.282 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's just go home already.

00:18:35.415 --> 00:18:37.518 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're right. We should go.

00:18:37.652 --> 00:18:38.720 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:18:38.853 --> 00:18:40.855 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SCHWARTZ] Lady can have
a bit of a sharp tongue.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.958 position:10% line:83% align:start
But what she said was her way
of encouraging you.

00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:46.259 position:16% line:83% align:start
She's really telling you
to become someone

00:18:46.393 --> 00:18:47.662 position:21% line:89% align:start
you can be proud of.

00:18:47.962 --> 00:18:49.631 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SCHWARTZ] We'll see you
around, young lady.

00:18:49.764 --> 00:18:52.199 position:24% line:83% align:start
We hope your friend
feels better soon.

00:18:56.269 --> 00:18:57.739 position:41% line:89% align:start
A hero.

00:18:59.007 --> 00:19:00.340 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:02.076 --> 00:19:03.711 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Are you all right?

00:19:04.012 --> 00:19:05.178 position:24% line:89% align:start
[SHY] You're awake.

00:19:06.014 --> 00:19:09.050 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry I got you mixed up
in all of this, Koishikawa.

00:19:09.182 --> 00:19:10.685 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's not fair to you.

00:19:12.053 --> 00:19:15.590 position:7% line:83% align:start
[IKO] You worked so hard today!
I was so worried!

00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:16.691 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:19:16.824 --> 00:19:17.859 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Iko weeping]

00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:32.073 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, I'm headed this way now.

00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:33.875 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, I'll see ya later, okay?

00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:39.346 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait, Koishikawa!

00:19:40.213 --> 00:19:41.949 position:33% line:89% align:start
[SHY] I um...

00:19:42.517 --> 00:19:46.219 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry for causing you
to worry about me.

00:19:46.521 --> 00:19:48.388 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I'm weak.
And I know that.

00:19:48.523 --> 00:19:50.858 position:13% line:83% align:start
When I think about how much
it makes everyone worry,

00:19:50.992 --> 00:19:52.560 position:24% line:89% align:start
I feel so pathetic.

00:19:53.561 --> 00:19:56.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
The way I am now,
I barely count as a hero.

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:58.365 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:01.435 position:41% line:83% align:start
I swear
I'm going to get stronger!

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:04.237 position:10% line:83% align:start
That way, I'll never make you
cry like that again!

00:20:04.672 --> 00:20:07.008 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
So, that's why...huh?

00:20:07.407 --> 00:20:09.544 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sorry. Why?

00:20:09.944 --> 00:20:12.245 position:41% line:83% align:start
I said
I was going to be stronger.

00:20:12.747 --> 00:20:13.681 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, why...

00:20:13.815 --> 00:20:16.450 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, here.
Please, you can use this.

00:20:17.185 --> 00:20:18.318 position:27% line:89% align:start
[SHY] I'm sorry.

00:20:18.553 --> 00:20:21.055 position:19% line:89% align:start
[weeping] I'm so sorry!

00:20:21.656 --> 00:20:23.658 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
You know something, Momijiyama?

00:20:23.925 --> 00:20:25.526 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're pretty passionate.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
That must be why your
heart's power is flames.

00:20:28.629 --> 00:20:30.497 position:10% line:89% align:start
I think it really suits you.

00:20:30.932 --> 00:20:32.834 position:24% line:89% align:start
[SHY] But I'm not.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Oh! I just thought
of something else!

00:20:36.804 --> 00:20:39.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
See, when you get shy,
your face gets red.

00:20:40.074 --> 00:20:42.810 position:19% line:83% align:start
[IKO] And it looks like
you might spit fire!

00:20:43.878 --> 00:20:44.879 position:35% line:89% align:start
[SHY] Huh?

00:20:45.012 --> 00:20:46.379 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Iko giggles]

00:20:48.448 --> 00:20:49.884 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
That'd be so funny!

00:20:50.017 --> 00:20:52.987 position:13% line:83% align:start
It would be way too perfect
if that happened, huh?

[FEMALE REPORTER 1A] Next up,
we have received updates

00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:09.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
about the riots that
occurred in China.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.339 position:10% line:89% align:start
At around six o'clock PM JST,

00:21:12.472 --> 00:21:13.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
an incident occurred
where a man went

00:21:14.075 --> 00:21:16.343 position:21% line:83% align:start
on a violent rampage
throughout the city.

00:21:16.577 --> 00:21:18.546 position:24% line:83% align:start
Multiple civilians
were injured.

00:21:19.312 --> 00:21:21.682 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Shrimpy,
could that be...

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:23.751 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY]
Yes, this must be Stigma.

00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:25.920 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's become more active lately.

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:28.790 position:38% line:83% align:start
I believe
it's a sign of things to come.

00:21:29.891 --> 00:21:32.560 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll need to be
even more careful now.

00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:33.728 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:21:34.796 --> 00:21:37.330 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I can't forget the pain
that I went through today.

00:21:37.565 --> 00:21:39.867 position:13% line:83% align:start
Everything that's happening
is terrifying.

00:21:40.034 --> 00:21:42.837 position:24% line:83% align:start
But no matter what,
I have to stay strong.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.240 position:27% line:83% align:start
If I can do that,
I can be a true hero.

00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:48.475 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Shrimpy!

00:21:49.143 --> 00:21:50.443 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'd like some more, please!

00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:53.413 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY]
Yes! That's the spirit, Teru!
