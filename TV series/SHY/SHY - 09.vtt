Pesha.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.234 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do you know
what three components

00:12:35.368 --> 00:12:37.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
comprise a person's heart?

00:12:38.234 --> 00:12:39.967 position:21% line:89% align:start
First, is the world,

00:12:40.234 --> 00:12:42.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
second is emotions,

00:12:42.301 --> 00:12:44.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
and third, memories.

00:12:44.834 --> 00:12:47.567 position:35% line:83% align:start
This place
also has those parameters.

00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:50.201 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've provided the emotions.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.900 position:7% line:89% align:start

are all I'm missing.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.867 position:7% line:89% align:start
After I have that final piece,

00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:04.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll have everything
to make my heart complete.

00:13:05.167 --> 00:13:06.767 position:30% line:89% align:start
Your memories?

00:13:07.201 --> 00:13:09.468 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's why we met
at the North Pole

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.800 position:30% line:89% align:start
and again here.

there's a very good reason

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:23.201 position:16% line:83% align:start
I explained this concept
to you in such detail.

00:13:23.767 --> 00:13:25.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wanted to buy myself time.

00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:27.900 position:13% line:89% align:start
