00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.478 position:21% line:89% align:start
Call us Amarariruku.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.181 position:21% line:89% align:start
"The ones who dream."

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.084 position:13% line:89% align:start
We'll meet again very soon.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.121 position:16% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] So, Stigma was
building up his own forces

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.456 position:19% line:89% align:start
right under our noses.

00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:25.593 position:19% line:83% align:start
He said that their name
was "Amarariruku."

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.028 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then there's the little girl
we fought.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.396 position:10% line:89% align:start
She was able to control ice,

00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:31.198 position:35% line:83% align:start
even though
she wasn't wearing a ring.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] It is possible
that Stigma wanted to test

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:36.704 position:16% line:83% align:start
if those powers would be
effective against heroes.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:38.573 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why now?

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:42.075 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
If only I had realized

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
that you were walking
into their trap.

00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:48.583 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry
for endangering your lives.

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:50.317 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
N-No!

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
You don't have anything
to apologize for, Unilord!

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:54.154 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? Yes?

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:55.557 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
This is Lady Black.

00:00:55.757 --> 00:00:57.491 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've finished up
Spirit's treatment.

00:00:57.792 --> 00:00:59.961 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Right! Thanks! I'm on my way!

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:02.162 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
A person who is capable

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:04.364 position:24% line:83% align:start
of wielding powers
without a ring.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.569 position:19% line:83% align:start
I fear that we could be
headed straight for disaster.

00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:50.170 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.006 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Pepesha, are you all right?

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.273 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Teru!

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.643 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm fine! It's not a big deal.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.513 position:13% line:83% align:start
A little hole in my stomach
can't keep me down.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.914 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:01.716 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHY] "Little"?
[MIANLONG] "Little"?

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.316 position:7% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] You were punctured
through the stomach,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.218 position:27% line:83% align:start
got hypothermia,
and you lost a ton of blood!

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.521 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're not "fine".

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:08.188 position:13% line:83% align:start
We've got bigger problems,
though.

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:11.693 position:13% line:83% align:start
Our new enemies can hurt us
even in our Heart-shift forms.

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:13.293 position:13% line:89% align:start
Who do you think they are?

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:14.662 position:16% line:89% align:start
Like, what's their deal?

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.397 position:35% line:89% align:start
That girl,

00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:18.933 position:21% line:89% align:start
she called me "Pesha"

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:20.768 position:7% line:89% align:start
before she stabbed me with ice.

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.538 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Only the people closest to me

00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:25.238 position:21% line:89% align:start
refer to me as Pesha.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.340 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I don't remember
ever meeting her.

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:29.110 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MIANLONG]
Could that mean--?

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Could that mean
she knows you, though, Pepesha?

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.014 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
It's definitely possible.

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:36.684 position:7% line:89% align:start
But I have no idea who she is.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.921 position:19% line:89% align:start
Something isn't right.

00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:44.125 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's this sinking feeling
I have?

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.962 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's as if an old wound
is being opened again.

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.731 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's this dread?

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.632 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
[coughs]

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:55.302 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHY] You should lie down!
Don't push yourself!

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:57.237 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
No, I'm all right.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.006 position:27% line:89% align:start
More importantly.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.373 position:35% line:89% align:start
That group.

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:03.211 position:33% line:83% align:start
Amarariruku.
From what I could tell,

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.278 position:21% line:83% align:start
all of their members
are children.

00:04:06.147 --> 00:04:07.148 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah. You're right.

00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:08.549 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
Children.

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:11.219 position:19% line:83% align:start
Names like Amarariruku
and Weepy,

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:13.353 position:30% line:83% align:start
don't you think
they're pretty childish?

00:04:13.888 --> 00:04:15.590 position:13% line:83% align:start
It feels like there's more
to what's happening

00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:17.257 position:19% line:89% align:start
that we're not seeing.

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:20.061 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
What if,

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.029 position:10% line:89% align:start
it's all just a game for him?

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:26.466 position:16% line:83% align:start
Stigma could be treating
the world as his plaything.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.975 position:10% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] It is far too early
to come to that conclusion.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.276 position:19% line:83% align:start
Should we miscalculate
their motives,

00:04:36.544 --> 00:04:38.880 position:30% line:83% align:start
it will put us
at a severe disadvantage.

00:04:39.147 --> 00:04:40.114 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're right.

00:04:40.248 --> 00:04:41.481 position:19% line:89% align:start
But Stigma is elusive.

00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:44.252 position:24% line:83% align:start
So. we'll always be
one step behind.

00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:47.320 position:27% line:83% align:start
What exactly are
we supposed to do?

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:49.456 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
There are options.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.792 position:19% line:89% align:start
We simply need to adopt

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:52.693 position:30% line:83% align:start
a new strategy
to uncover the truth.

00:04:52.994 --> 00:04:54.962 position:30% line:83% align:start
[snaps fingers]
Bring her in, please.

00:04:55.163 --> 00:04:56.329 position:35% line:89% align:start
"Her" who?

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.032 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, maybe
there's another hero coming?

00:04:58.599 --> 00:04:59.634 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
With her help,

00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:02.036 position:33% line:83% align:start
we have hope
of finding answers.

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:05.072 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Shrimpy?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.309 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Hey, there!
-What? Koishikawa?

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.045 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you doing here?

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:14.414 position:13% line:89% align:start
Momijiyama! Thank goodness!

00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:16.416 position:16% line:83% align:start
I heard your last mission
went badly!

00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:19.452 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Are you okay?
-I'm, uh, fine.

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:20.922 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey Unilord,

00:05:21.055 --> 00:05:22.523 position:33% line:83% align:start
is this what
you meant by "hope"?

00:05:22.924 --> 00:05:24.926 position:30% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] Yes,
I summoned her here myself.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.061 position:13% line:83% align:start
But how did you get a hold
of her?

00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:29.864 position:16% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] Oh, I just used
this cheap little cell phone.

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:32.733 position:16% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] At this point,
she is the only one

00:05:32.867 --> 00:05:35.169 position:35% line:83% align:start
to not meet
Stigma's expectations.

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:38.039 position:16% line:83% align:start
Iko is an unknown factor
for both parties,

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:39.339 position:21% line:89% align:start
making her experience

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:41.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
incredibly valuable
in our fight.

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:46.747 position:10% line:83% align:start
There is something important
and somewhat alarming

00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:48.381 position:30% line:83% align:start
that I have to
report to you all.

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:50.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's regarding the ring
from before.

00:05:50.685 --> 00:05:52.086 position:30% line:89% align:start
The one I got?

00:05:52.253 --> 00:05:54.689 position:10% line:83% align:start
The ring that put Koishikawa
through so much trouble?

00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:58.391 position:7% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] Indeed, our analysis
has finally yielded results.

00:05:58.693 --> 00:06:00.962 position:24% line:83% align:start
And we've uncovered
a number of facts.

00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:03.931 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY] You see,
your friend was invited here

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:05.132 position:16% line:89% align:start
so that we could explain

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:06.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
what we've learned
about the ring so far.

00:06:06.968 --> 00:06:08.468 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
This frightful little thing,

00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:10.504 position:19% line:83% align:start
is actually a fragment
of Stigma's heart

00:06:10.638 --> 00:06:12.874 position:33% line:83% align:start
materialized
in crystalline form.

00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:15.142 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
That ring is his heart?

00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:21.816 position:13% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] Every heart beats
with a unique wavelength.

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:24.752 position:16% line:83% align:start
Something you might call
someone's "personality".

00:06:25.286 --> 00:06:26.954 position:16% line:89% align:start
Each heart is different.

00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:30.591 position:27% line:83% align:start
Once placed onto
his victim's finger.

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.426 position:10% line:83% align:start
The ring connects the wearer
to Stigma's heart.

00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:35.830 position:30% line:83% align:start
It then changes
the heart's wavelength

00:06:35.963 --> 00:06:36.964 position:27% line:89% align:start
to match his own.

00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:38.833 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's truly terrifying.

00:06:40.134 --> 00:06:41.569 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Then.

00:06:41.702 --> 00:06:43.671 position:13% line:83% align:start
The reason that Koishikawa
was transformed before?

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:46.007 position:10% line:83% align:start
And the attack that happened
in my country--

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.075 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
Yes. It appears that Stigma

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:49.844 position:24% line:83% align:start
has been spreading
pieces of his heart

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:52.747 position:21% line:83% align:start
all across the globe
by way of these rings.

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.151 position:7% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Now that you mention it,
that reminds me.

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:01.289 position:38% line:83% align:start
That day,
when Momijiyama saved my life.

00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:03.391 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't remember our fight
very well,

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:05.893 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the whole thing
feels sorta hazy.

00:07:07.328 --> 00:07:08.629 position:16% line:89% align:start
But one thing sticks out.

00:07:08.763 --> 00:07:11.198 position:16% line:83% align:start
The memory is still clear
in my mind.

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:16.704 position:13% line:83% align:start
When the darkness inside me
was brought to the surface.

00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:19.573 position:13% line:83% align:start
My consciousness sank into
the depths of my heart,

00:07:19.707 --> 00:07:21.809 position:10% line:89% align:start
like falling into a dark sea.

00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:24.845 position:13% line:89% align:start
There was this huge chasm.

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:28.015 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, it'd be better
to call it a wound.

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:31.052 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think it was a wound
within my heart.

00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:33.486 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thinking about it now.

00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:35.856 position:13% line:83% align:start
The thing I saw deep inside
that tear.

00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:38.225 position:27% line:83% align:start
had to have been
Stigma's heart.

00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:43.564 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait! Are you saying
you saw Stigma's heart

00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:45.333 position:30% line:83% align:start
while you were
under the ring's control?

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:46.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is it really possible?

00:07:46.968 --> 00:07:48.502 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure
none of Stigma's other victims

00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:50.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
remembered anything
after they were attacked.

00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:53.274 position:7% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] Thus, we were unaware
of the possibility before.

00:07:53.674 --> 00:07:55.109 position:7% line:89% align:start
That wearing one of those rings

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:58.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
serves as a link between
the host's heart and Stigma's.

00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:01.115 position:7% line:83% align:start
What the heck is Stigma's goal,
anyway?

00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:04.051 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is he trying to turn people
into himself or something?

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.653 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Back when it happened,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.755 position:7% line:83% align:start
and I witnessed Stigma's heart
from my own.

00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:10.157 position:33% line:83% align:start
I saw things
from his perspective

00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:12.259 position:10% line:89% align:start
and his desires became clear.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.529 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was like a vision
flowing into my mind.

00:08:16.831 --> 00:08:19.166 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Tell us what you saw, Iko.

00:08:19.433 --> 00:08:20.568 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want to hear everything
there is

00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:22.036 position:16% line:89% align:start
to know about his goals.

00:08:22.737 --> 00:08:24.872 position:30% line:83% align:start
[IKO] The heart
I saw during that vision,

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:27.575 position:19% line:89% align:start
it was really abstract.

00:08:28.743 --> 00:08:30.611 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure
what I saw was earth.

00:08:31.078 --> 00:08:32.480 position:35% line:83% align:start
There were
the shadows of people

00:08:32.613 --> 00:08:34.849 position:27% line:83% align:start
holding hands in
a ring around the globe.

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:38.319 position:30% line:83% align:start
I think, I saw
Stigma's ideal world.

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:40.654 position:21% line:83% align:start
People hand in hand,
united together,

00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:42.490 position:13% line:89% align:start
all fighting for one goal.

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:43.691 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:46.594 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ah. What exactly
are you getting at, huh?

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:47.795 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're making it sound like--

00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:49.163 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
That's right.

00:08:49.964 --> 00:08:52.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
While I don't like
how he's doing it,

00:08:56.604 --> 00:08:58.072 position:21% line:89% align:start
he wants world peace.

00:08:58.239 --> 00:09:00.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
I believe that to be
Stigma's ultimate goal.

00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:02.676 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:04.712 position:24% line:83% align:start
That runt's actions
are far from peaceful!

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:06.280 position:10% line:83% align:start
Bring him here! I'll make him
pay for his crimes!

00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:07.381 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY]
Calm down.

00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:08.549 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
If we could bring him in,

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:10.151 position:13% line:89% align:start
this would be simpler, yes.

00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:12.820 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Um there's something else.

00:09:13.187 --> 00:09:15.990 position:16% line:83% align:start
Back when I saw what was
inside of Stigma's heart.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.930 position:19% line:83% align:start
The impression I got is
that he's extremely childish.

00:09:23.364 --> 00:09:25.699 position:19% line:83% align:start
Almost like he's a kid
who's refuses to accept

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:27.168 position:19% line:89% align:start
that he has to grow up.

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:30.137 position:38% line:89% align:start
A child.

00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:31.540 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Lemme get this straight.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:32.907 position:21% line:89% align:start
Some snot-nosed brat

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.575 position:33% line:83% align:start
thinks making
a squad of Stigmas

00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:36.545 position:33% line:83% align:start
just like him
will lead to world peace.

00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:37.978 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Yeah, pretty much.

00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:39.847 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's all I could feel
from his heart

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.982 position:10% line:83% align:start
when he and I were connected
before.

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:44.085 position:16% line:89% align:start
Was that helpful at all?

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:46.220 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
It was more than helpful, Iko.

00:09:46.487 --> 00:09:48.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
Seeing even a fragment
of Stigma's vision

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:50.157 position:13% line:89% align:start
was incredibly advantageous

00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:52.359 position:27% line:83% align:start
and will help us
read his next move.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.694 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so glad.

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.063 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Um, thank you for your help.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.631 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:57.765 --> 00:09:59.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
It must've been hard
to relive all of that.

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:00.668 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
No, I'm okay.

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:03.637 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've been wanting to tell you
about it for a while now,

00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:06.307 position:21% line:83% align:start
so when Unilord asked
if I'd help, I said yes.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.475 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:10:08.008 --> 00:10:09.777 position:16% line:83% align:start
[IKO] I've been thinking
about it for a bit.

00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:11.612 position:30% line:83% align:start
And I wondered
if there was some way

00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:12.980 position:21% line:89% align:start
I could help you out.

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.750 position:33% line:83% align:start
But I'm just
an ordinary person.

00:10:17.051 --> 00:10:18.853 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I were to go into battle
with you,

00:10:19.153 --> 00:10:20.855 position:10% line:89% align:start
I would just get in the way.

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:25.159 position:35% line:83% align:start
So, I hope
I was at least a little useful.

00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:26.494 position:38% line:89% align:start
You were.

00:10:26.694 --> 00:10:28.262 position:19% line:83% align:start
But you shouldn't worry
about that.

00:10:29.598 --> 00:10:30.898 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Unilord,

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:32.366 position:19% line:83% align:start
there's one more thing
I need to bring up.

00:10:33.602 --> 00:10:34.835 position:10% line:89% align:start
The girl from the North Pole,

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:36.937 position:24% line:83% align:start
the one who Stigma
called Tzveta.

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:40.641 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't know how it's possible,

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:43.043 position:7% line:83% align:start
but she looks a lot like I did
when I was a kid.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.112 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ALL] Huh?
[UNILORD] What do you mean?

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:47.314 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know,

00:10:47.616 --> 00:10:51.152 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I got this sense of dread
and deja vu from her.

00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:54.321 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe it's because
she looks like me?

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:57.124 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh!
-Pepesha?

00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:58.759 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MIANLONG]
Are you all right?

00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:01.262 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
Easy, now!

00:11:01.596 --> 00:11:03.764 position:27% line:83% align:start
A wound that deep
isn't going to heal right away,

00:11:03.898 --> 00:11:05.332 position:21% line:89% align:start
even with my powers.

00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:06.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
You should go home and rest.

00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:08.335 position:38% line:83% align:start

You're right.

00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:10.404 position:35% line:83% align:start
[breathing]
I'll do that.

00:11:11.372 --> 00:11:14.308 position:21% line:83% align:start
As soon as I recover,
I'll go home to investigate.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.043 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll find out the truth.

[UNILORD]
Understood.

But please, focus
on your recovery for now.

-About what?
-Um,

00:11:52.146 --> 00:11:55.749 position:19% line:83% align:start
maybe I misread things,
but you seem sort of depressed.

00:11:56.784 --> 00:11:58.553 position:38% line:83% align:start

No, not in the slightest!

No?

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:06.093 position:38% line:89% align:start
Honestly,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.529 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't really understand

00:12:07.662 --> 00:12:09.029 position:16% line:83% align:start
what's going on with me,
either.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.700 position:21% line:83% align:start

shook me up.

00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:14.335 position:24% line:83% align:start
If that girl really
is someone I knew,

she's being used
for someone else's goals.

00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:19.507 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I couldn't do anything
to help her.

00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:22.510 position:33% line:89% align:start
I feel stuck.

00:12:22.977 --> 00:12:24.245 position:13% line:89% align:start
Like, I failed her somehow.

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.180 position:44% line:83% align:start

But that's not true!

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.599 position:10% line:89% align:start
I guess that's my fault, huh?

00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:45.933 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:12:46.735 --> 00:12:49.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
Man. I could really go
for a drink right now.

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:51.640 position:35% line:83% align:start
But I guess
that'll have to wait

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:53.440 position:13% line:89% align:start
until I'm fully recovered.

00:12:53.642 --> 00:12:55.276 position:7% line:89% align:start
Please, just take me seriously!

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.378 position:33% line:83% align:start
All I want is
to help you feel better,

00:12:57.512 --> 00:12:58.546 position:35% line:89% align:start
because I--

'Cause I care.

some important advice.

When you want to cheer

but I do talk to them
sometimes.

And we even get to go on

I wonder,

were people always
this interested in me?

Um, do you think that
even I could become a hero?

You can. I really believe that.

Shy's not a hero!

A real hero--

they wouldn't sit up there.

00:19:13.788 --> 00:19:16.124 position:27% line:83% align:start

[SHY] That boy said,
"Shy's not a hero".

I probably believe that
even more than he does.

Uh, hey, kiddo.

What-- What the heck
are you doing here?

00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:52.794 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wanted to talk to you,

00:19:52.927 --> 00:19:54.428 position:24% line:83% align:start
because I wondered
what you meant before

00:19:54.562 --> 00:19:56.363 position:24% line:83% align:start
when you said that
I wasn't a real hero.

What're you talking about?

00:19:58.298 --> 00:19:59.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't it obvious?

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.136 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's 'cause Revozeale
is the best!

00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:04.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's the only hero
that I like!

Hmm?

00:20:06.641 --> 00:20:08.308 position:13% line:83% align:start
And you've been pretending
to be her all day

00:20:08.442 --> 00:20:10.978 position:33% line:83% align:start
so that means
you're nothing but a faker!

Wait.
Do you actually like Zeale?

So what? Are you,

gonna tell me that it's weird

00:20:17.552 --> 00:20:19.754 position:27% line:83% align:start
to like Civirevo
because I'm a boy?
