[SHY] It's been a few days
since everything

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.479 position:24% line:89% align:start
happened at school.

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:14.248 position:19% line:89% align:start
But today's a day off.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.819 position:33% line:89% align:start
Um, Shrimpy?

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.655 position:33% line:83% align:start
Are you sure
that I don't look weird?

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.658 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY]
You look perfectly fine.

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:25.693 position:13% line:83% align:start
You-- You can't keep poking
your head out like that!

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:28.328 position:13% line:83% align:start
If anyone sees you, they'll
find out that I'm Shy!

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.497 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY]
Unbelievable.

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:32.399 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm only here because
you asked me to come along.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.469 position:35% line:83% align:start
I know but,
it's just been such a long time

00:00:35.603 --> 00:00:38.105 position:21% line:83% align:start
since I even went out
with a friend, you know?

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.774 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.509 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Momijiyama!

00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:42.977 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm here!

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.445 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey! Sorry to keep you!

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.148 position:13% line:89% align:start
No. I just got here myself.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.450 position:7% line:89% align:start
Really? Oh! That's good, then!

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.987 position:19% line:83% align:start
You must be the Shrimpy
I've heard about!

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.221 position:24% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet 'cha!

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.223 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[SHRIMPY] You as well.
-[scoffs]

00:00:56.758 --> 00:00:57.792 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.827 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, Koishikawa,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.263 position:7% line:83% align:start
are you sure you're okay to be
walking around on your leg?

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:04.866 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:07.401 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm totally pain free!
It doesn't hurt anymore!

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:09.303 position:27% line:83% align:start
I got checked out
at the doctor,

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.405 position:27% line:83% align:start
and they told me
I'm fit as a fiddle!

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:13.106 position:16% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Though they did say
that it was strange

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.709 position:13% line:89% align:start
that it had healed already!

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:15.877 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:17.845 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
According to Shrimpy.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.747 position:27% line:83% align:start
Koishikawa's leg
might've been healed

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.684 position:10% line:83% align:start
as a side effect of that ring
that was put onto her finger.

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:26.721 position:27% line:83% align:start
But the situation
is still being investigated.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.355 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[IKO] Momijiyama!
-Huh?

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.724 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:01:30.692 --> 00:01:34.127 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's go! Today,
I'm thanking you, my way!

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:35.797 position:35% line:89% align:start
By the way!

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.832 position:30% line:83% align:start
That outfit is
so super cute on you!

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.333 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hah?

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.503 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Thank you very much!

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:17.431 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:26.206 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Man, this is awesome!

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's been forever

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.242 position:21% line:83% align:start
since I've been able
to walk around so much!

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.846 position:30% line:83% align:start
I almost forgot
how fun going out is.

00:03:34.582 --> 00:03:35.950 position:24% line:89% align:start
Having a good time?

00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:39.854 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh. Yeah.
Loads of fun.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.388 position:35% line:89% align:start
Momijiyama?

00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:44.324 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Hey, are you okay?
-I'm good! Just--.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.728 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY] Teru tends
to get rather drained

00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:48.162 position:16% line:83% align:start
when she does activities
like this

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:49.831 position:16% line:89% align:start
for long periods of time.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.632 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait! For real?

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.668 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm not super outdoorsy.

00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:56.070 position:33% line:83% align:start
You could say
I'm kind of an introvert.

00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:57.638 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! I had no idea!

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.407 position:19% line:83% align:start
I apologize! Let's find
somewhere to rest.

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:01.976 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
I'm so sorry.

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.614 position:16% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Today was supposed
to be about thanking you.

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:09.984 position:10% line:83% align:start
I didn't know you weren't one
for excursions like this.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.318 position:35% line:89% align:start
I feel bad.

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:12.787 position:27% line:83% align:start
I ruined the day
you had planned.

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:15.156 position:35% line:83% align:start
I-I'm just
not used to going out.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.791 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's my fault.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.326 position:7% line:83% align:start
I really messed everything up,
huh?

00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:21.195 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
Oh no!

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:22.697 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm making Koishikawa feel bad

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.966 position:24% line:83% align:start
because I'm such an
extreme introvert!

00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:29.837 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe I can save this
if I can make her laugh!

00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:33.541 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do-Do you remember
the other day back at school

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:36.110 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the nurse's office
when it was totally destroyed?

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:38.445 position:27% line:83% align:start
And you remember
when I was all like

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:39.814 position:24% line:89% align:start
"there was a bear!"

00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:42.250 position:38% line:83% align:start
[laughs]
Wasn't that funny?

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.986 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, that. The office.

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:46.754 position:10% line:89% align:start
I totally trashed the place.

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.191 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because of me there was
an alert throughout the city

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.726 position:19% line:89% align:start
for an imaginary bear.

00:04:51.893 --> 00:04:54.028 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh no! That's not
what I was getting at.

00:04:54.195 --> 00:04:56.964 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why am I trying to crack jokes
when I'm so bad at talking?

00:04:57.598 --> 00:04:59.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
I should just keep
my big mouth shut!

00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:03.303 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wish I could just disappear
and become one with the wind!

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.708 position:19% line:83% align:start
You really are amazing,
Momijiyama.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.778 position:24% line:89% align:start
We're the same age.

00:05:11.112 --> 00:05:13.948 position:16% line:83% align:start
But you've already faced
so much all on your own.

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:15.283 position:24% line:89% align:start
Like the other day.

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:17.285 position:16% line:89% align:start
I really look up to you.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.720 position:33% line:89% align:start
I mean that.

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.724 position:7% line:89% align:start
No. I'm not someone to admire.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.761 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
I was wondering,

00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:28.563 position:16% line:89% align:start
is there anybody else who

00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:30.565 position:16% line:83% align:start
knows that you're really
the hero Shy?

00:05:30.698 --> 00:05:32.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
No. I haven't told anyone.

00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:35.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's pretty much just you
and the other heroes.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.939 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
Not even your parents know?

00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:40.641 position:16% line:83% align:start
I mean, I don't want them
to know I'm running around

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:43.476 position:19% line:83% align:start
in an outfit like that.
It's so embarrassing.

00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:45.146 position:33% line:89% align:start
What? Really?

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.948 position:13% line:89% align:start
But you look so cool in it!

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:49.116 position:33% line:89% align:start
I see, then.

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:51.152 position:19% line:89% align:start
So that would make me.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.888 position:30% line:83% align:start
The one friend
who knows Shy's identity!

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.690 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right?

00:05:57.859 --> 00:06:00.862 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't believe it!
That's so cool!

00:06:01.596 --> 00:06:03.664 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, um, Koishikawa?

00:06:03.798 --> 00:06:05.933 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, sorry, got carried away!

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.469 position:33% line:89% align:start
[kid crying]

00:06:14.108 --> 00:06:15.375 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is he okay?

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.079 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, bud. What's goin' on?
What happened?

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:22.382 position:7% line:83% align:start
I got lost and now I can't find
my mom and dad!

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:25.286 position:38% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Ah.
That happens all the time.

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:26.888 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is that really true?

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:28.421 position:33% line:89% align:start
You bet'cha!

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.324 position:24% line:83% align:start
This here is called
pattern twenty-seven!

00:06:30.992 --> 00:06:34.161 position:16% line:83% align:start
The key to solving this--
is your Zweihander!

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:35.830 position:30% line:89% align:start
His Zweihander?

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.999 position:13% line:89% align:start
How'll my Zweihander help?

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:39.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's a Zweihander?

00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:42.469 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is a Zweihander!

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.905 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shrimpy?

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:45.606 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right, hero!

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.009 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let's journey
to find your parents!

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:50.177 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Right!
-Zweihan?

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:52.046 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry about this.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.948 position:13% line:89% align:start
We've gotta take a detour.

00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:55.216 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, sure.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.152 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lemme know when you
see 'em, all right, hero?

00:06:58.352 --> 00:06:59.452 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right! I will!

00:07:00.121 --> 00:07:02.455 position:21% line:83% align:start
You really have a way
with kids, Koishikawa,

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.125 position:21% line:89% align:start
it's very impressive.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.893 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hmm?
Think so?

00:07:06.594 --> 00:07:08.829 position:27% line:83% align:start
Maybe it's 'cause
I take care of my brother.

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:10.564 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's right!

00:07:10.698 --> 00:07:12.233 position:19% line:83% align:start
He was telling me that
you also rescued him

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:13.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
at the T-1 Hotel!

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.803 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thanks for that, Momijiyama!

00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:20.074 position:19% line:83% align:start
That just goes to show
how amazing heroes are!

00:07:20.675 --> 00:07:23.411 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was just doing my job,
that's all.

00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:27.248 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh, I wonder where our

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.749 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right there!

00:07:30.618 --> 00:07:31.752 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mommy!

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:33.187 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh.
-Huh.

00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:35.623 position:16% line:83% align:start
[FATHER] Where were you?
We were so worried!

00:07:35.756 --> 00:07:37.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, that went faster
than expected.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:40.460 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, you ready?
Let's get goin'!

00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:41.896 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure!

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:43.564 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, quest giver!

00:07:45.032 --> 00:07:46.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
Thanks for being so nice to me.

00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:50.071 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh my! You're a considerate one
if you came back to say

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:51.305 position:21% line:89% align:start
"thank you" properly.

00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:53.074 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, in that case,

00:07:53.207 --> 00:07:55.776 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've got a very important
mission for you!

00:07:56.544 --> 00:07:58.079 position:7% line:89% align:start
Whether it's your mom and dad,

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.147 position:19% line:89% align:start
or it's somebody else.

00:08:00.715 --> 00:08:02.583 position:38% line:83% align:start
Make sure
you're kind to them, too.

00:08:02.984 --> 00:08:04.285 position:19% line:89% align:start
Can you do that for me?

00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:06.854 position:41% line:83% align:start
[grins]
Yeah!

[SHY]
Koishikawa,

00:08:14.762 --> 00:08:16.564 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've been thinking about this
for a while, but--

00:08:16.831 --> 00:08:19.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
Aw man, Momijiyama.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.968 position:38% line:89% align:start
I did it!

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.038 position:16% line:83% align:start
I repeated something Shy
said in front of Shy!

00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:27.608 position:47% line:83% align:start
Oh!
I'm so embarrassed right now!

00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:29.577 position:16% line:83% align:start
It just really felt right
to tell him

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.412 position:7% line:89% align:start
that in the moment, so I, uh--

00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:33.814 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
I feel the same way.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:35.983 position:10% line:89% align:start
You said that you admired me.

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:38.386 position:19% line:83% align:start
But you didn't hesitate
to help that boy.

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:39.553 position:27% line:89% align:start
You just did it!

00:08:39.754 --> 00:08:41.422 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, I guess what I'm saying is.

00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:43.524 position:16% line:89% align:start
I really admire you, too.

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:47.628 position:16% line:83% align:start
Heroes and regular people
are the same.

00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:49.730 position:16% line:89% align:start
If you act with kindness,

00:08:49.964 --> 00:08:51.732 position:7% line:89% align:start
it doesn't matter who you are.

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:54.735 position:33% line:83% align:start
Watching you
made me realize that.

00:08:56.237 --> 00:08:57.371 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh! Sorry!

00:08:57.538 --> 00:08:59.073 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm being weird again.

00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:02.476 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jeez, I've been talking
a lot today, huh?

00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:05.312 position:38% line:83% align:start
[smiles]
Let's get goin'!

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:07.448 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's still tons of fun
to be had!

00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:09.650 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, Sure. Let's go!

00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:17.625 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh. Look, Momijiyama.

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:20.661 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's a poster of Stardust.

00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:24.432 position:19% line:83% align:start
Have you ever met him?
He seems kinda cool.

00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:26.200 position:24% line:89% align:start
No. I haven't yet.

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:28.503 position:13% line:89% align:start
Both a rockstar and a hero.

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:30.237 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's also the only hero

00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:32.773 position:13% line:83% align:start
to reveal his real identity
to the public!

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:37.578 position:7% line:83% align:start
He's donated over five billion
dollars to charity,

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.647 position:21% line:83% align:start
set up international
relief groups,

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.216 position:24% line:83% align:start
and his music makes
so many people happy!

00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:44.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
The guy has indirectly
saved more people

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:46.687 position:13% line:89% align:start
than any other hero so far!

00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:49.790 position:7% line:89% align:start
You sure know a lot about him.

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:52.893 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, no. I just read that
in some book.

00:09:54.028 --> 00:09:55.796 position:16% line:83% align:start
But a guy who goes out of
his way to do all that

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
has gotta be a super kind
and caring person.

00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:00.468 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Yeah, probably.

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:02.336 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-[SHRIMPY] Teru,

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:04.171 position:7% line:89% align:start
you've got a call from Spirit.

00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:05.673 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.143 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Hey there, Teru!

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:10.811 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's Spirit here!

00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:12.680 position:7% line:89% align:start
Calling from Russia with love!

00:10:13.114 --> 00:10:15.316 position:35% line:83% align:start
-What's up?
-Oh, um...

00:10:15.584 --> 00:10:17.384 position:7% line:89% align:start
I got a call from another hero.

00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:19.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] You're being
summoned by Unilord.

00:10:20.054 --> 00:10:22.156 position:10% line:83% align:start
And please bring your friend
along with you.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:23.592 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:25.392 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] Head to the spaceship
that we visited before.

00:10:25.527 --> 00:10:26.660 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll meet you there!

00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:28.362 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm guessing
it's hero business?

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:30.731 position:35% line:83% align:start
Seems like
we're being summoned.

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:32.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
They want us both
to go to outer space.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.734 position:38% line:89% align:start
Say what?

00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:35.504 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] Oh, and I guess
I should mention.

00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:38.339 position:21% line:83% align:start
That Stardust will be
joining us this time as well!

00:10:38.706 --> 00:10:40.374 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sta- Stardust, too?

00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:44.745 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh. Um. What's he like exactly?

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:46.180 position:24% line:89% align:start
I've never met him.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.617 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] There's that classic
shyness of yours!

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:50.050 position:21% line:89% align:start
You'll be just fine!

00:10:53.287 --> 00:10:54.321 position:35% line:89% align:start
All-right.

00:10:54.556 --> 00:10:55.756 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, he's a smooth talker,

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.858 position:10% line:83% align:start
and is pretty darn confident,
too.

00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:00.427 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's super decisive,
and charismatic.

00:11:01.362 --> 00:11:02.696 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's charming,

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.965 position:10% line:83% align:start
has a gorgeous singing voice
and is a real smooth talker.

00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:07.034 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Um, are you drunk?

00:11:08.503 --> 00:11:11.305 position:30% line:83% align:start
Huh. You know,
now that I think about it.

00:11:13.974 --> 00:11:15.910 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's like a psychopath.

00:11:18.913 --> 00:11:20.181 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MALE DIRECTOR 3A]
And cut!

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:25.554 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:28.022 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd say this latest album
is your best yet!

00:11:28.189 --> 00:11:31.125 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're making some real magic
with this music video!

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:32.594 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ STARDUST]
Do you think?

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.428 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hope we've found
the right flow.

00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:36.130 position:27% line:89% align:start
How 'bout drinks?

00:11:36.497 --> 00:11:39.867 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, as much as
I would love to, I can't.

00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:41.335 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:11:43.103 --> 00:11:45.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
The flow of my night
has been decided by another.

Hey there! Good to see you!

00:11:59.588 --> 00:12:00.555 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's Spirit!

00:12:00.689 --> 00:12:01.989 position:30% line:89% align:start
He-Hello there!

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:04.526 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] We've been seeing
each other a lot lately!

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:07.061 position:19% line:89% align:start

Aw! You're such a cutie pie!

00:12:12.534 --> 00:12:13.702 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet you!

00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:16.036 position:41% line:83% align:start
So um,
why am I being summoned up?

00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:17.871 position:44% line:89% align:start
Teru,

00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:20.675 position:19% line:83% align:start
you managed to retrieve
the black ring, did you not?

00:12:21.308 --> 00:12:23.844 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I'm being honest, that
was the first time anyone

00:12:23.978 --> 00:12:26.380 position:27% line:83% align:start
has collected one
in its complete form.

00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:30.150 position:21% line:83% align:start
You did an absolutely
marvelous job, Teru!

00:12:30.284 --> 00:12:31.519 position:35% line:89% align:start
That ring.

00:12:31.653 --> 00:12:33.622 position:16% line:89% align:start
Um, about that, actually.

00:12:33.887 --> 00:12:35.789 position:16% line:89% align:start
There was this boy and--.

00:12:36.524 --> 00:12:38.926 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, there's still
a lot I don't understand.

00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:40.928 position:41% line:83% align:start
Mm-hmm?
I bet!

00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:42.997 position:35% line:89% align:start
But anyway,

00:12:43.998 --> 00:12:46.635 position:38% line:83% align:start
let's go!
Space base awaits!

00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:49.770 position:16% line:83% align:start
Shrimpy, please stay here
and keep watch.

00:12:50.337 --> 00:12:51.305 position:41% line:89% align:start
Roger!

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.207 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll contact you
if something happens.

00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:55.476 position:24% line:89% align:start
Can you answer me?

00:13:01.616 --> 00:13:03.450 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:07.021 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's the Earth!

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:10.659 position:30% line:83% align:start
Mo-Momijiyama!
We can see the Earth!

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:12.826 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah!
It's pretty, isn't it?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.362 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on, you two!
This way!

00:13:16.531 --> 00:13:19.099 position:10% line:83% align:start
Unilord is going to fill you
in on the details,

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:21.101 position:10% line:89% align:start
but that strange boy you met,

00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:23.304 position:21% line:89% align:start
we call him "Stigma".

00:13:23.505 --> 00:13:24.673 position:27% line:89% align:start
And the thing is,

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:26.407 position:19% line:89% align:start
he's been seen before.

00:13:26.541 --> 00:13:27.808 position:24% line:89% align:start
All over the world.

00:13:28.042 --> 00:13:29.209 position:24% line:89% align:start
All over the world?

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.646 position:33% line:83% align:start
What could he
possibly want, Pepesha?

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:36.483 position:21% line:83% align:start
Apparently, his goal
is to free people's hearts.

00:13:36.785 --> 00:13:39.554 position:16% line:83% align:start
But there's no way we can
confirm if that's true.

00:13:40.588 --> 00:13:42.089 position:24% line:89% align:start
Free their hearts?

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:44.825 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's become the number one
priority for all us heroes.

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:48.228 position:13% line:83% align:start
Whichever way you slice it,
he's a huge problem.

00:13:48.797 --> 00:13:50.030 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, here we are!

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:53.300 position:33% line:83% align:start
Knock, knock!
We're here!

00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:55.503 position:33% line:83% align:start
How strange!
Where's Eunnie?

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:58.573 position:47% line:83% align:start
Oh?
Three of our guests are here.

00:13:58.707 --> 00:13:59.774 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Here.
-Ready.

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:00.974 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow.

00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:02.777 position:27% line:89% align:start
So many Shrimpys!

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.346 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did Unilord cook for us?

00:14:05.747 --> 00:14:07.047 position:33% line:89% align:start
There we go.

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:08.415 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are you making borscht?

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.085 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've been quite into soups
these days.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.254 position:16% line:89% align:start
Momijiyama, who is that?

00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:16.256 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh. She oversees the--

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.958 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
Pardon my late introduction.

00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:21.161 position:27% line:83% align:start
Nice to meet you.
I am Unilord.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.132 position:10% line:83% align:start
I am in charge of supervising
all our heroes.

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:26.835 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's a lot of work.

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:30.437 position:16% line:83% align:start
The ordeal you faced must
have been terrifying for you.

00:14:30.705 --> 00:14:34.007 position:19% line:83% align:start
Know that all us heroes
feel quite responsible.

00:14:34.676 --> 00:14:35.976 position:19% line:89% align:start
As you are Shy's friend

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.579 position:21% line:83% align:start
we think it would be
appropriate for you to be

00:14:37.712 --> 00:14:39.681 position:24% line:83% align:start
aware of the danger
the world is facing,

00:14:39.814 --> 00:14:42.483 position:24% line:83% align:start
and what we heroes
must be prepared to do.

00:14:44.184 --> 00:14:46.621 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please, sit down.
We can talk while we eat.

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:48.021 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm quite proud of this soup.

00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:49.089 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Please, sit.
-Please, sit.

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:51.526 position:38% line:83% align:start
Whoo-hoo!
Let's dig in!

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.198 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, wow!
This is really good borscht!

00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:00.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is there soy sauce
in this recipe?

00:15:00.334 --> 00:15:03.538 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, you noticed?
I find it adds depth.

00:15:03.872 --> 00:15:05.740 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, it does!
-Um!

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.244 position:44% line:83% align:start
Can--
Can I take some photos?

00:15:10.411 --> 00:15:12.946 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[BOTH] Huh?
-Miss Iko,

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:15.349 position:10% line:89% align:start
this is a top-secret facility

00:15:15.517 --> 00:15:17.819 position:27% line:83% align:start
so I cannot allow
photos to be taken.

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:20.755 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Uh.
-If you wish to take photos.

00:15:20.988 --> 00:15:22.757 position:24% line:83% align:start
I ask that you use
our photo booth.

00:15:22.891 --> 00:15:25.292 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Heck yeah!
-That's a thing?

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:28.228 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Say cheese.
-Yay!

00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:30.732 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is so cool!

00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:33.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
My brother's gonna be
so jealous

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.368 position:27% line:89% align:start
when I show him!

00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:37.705 position:19% line:83% align:start
So are you, um, are you
a big fan of heroes?

00:15:38.606 --> 00:15:40.007 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Do you think it's weird?

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.409 position:27% line:83% align:start
Especially 'cause
I'm in middle school.

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:44.077 position:35% line:89% align:start
No! I mean.

00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:45.613 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm the weird one here.

00:15:45.747 --> 00:15:47.549 position:30% line:83% align:start
All dressed up
in this dorky outfit.

00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:49.617 position:30% line:83% align:start
No, that's not
what I meant by that at all.

00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:51.018 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's just that--

00:15:51.586 --> 00:15:53.320 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aah! Huh!

00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:56.223 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Careful now.
-Hmm?

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:57.525 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:59.026 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stardust! Hi!

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:00.929 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's-- It's really him.

00:16:01.663 --> 00:16:04.965 position:30% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] Well,
it seems everyone is assembled.

00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:10.705 position:7% line:89% align:start
All right. Why did you call us?

00:16:10.905 --> 00:16:13.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] I hear Stigma
has appeared in Japan.

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:15.142 position:24% line:89% align:start
Fortunately for us,

00:16:15.275 --> 00:16:17.144 position:33% line:83% align:start
Shy was able
to retrieve the ring.

00:16:17.545 --> 00:16:20.147 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh.
And it's in one piece, too.

00:16:20.915 --> 00:16:21.982 position:16% line:89% align:start
How'd you pull that off?

00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:23.484 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh? Well,

00:16:23.885 --> 00:16:26.621 position:21% line:83% align:start
that ring brings out
what's in a heart, doesn't it?

00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:29.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, I tried to understand
Koishikawa's heart,

00:16:29.557 --> 00:16:32.426 position:16% line:83% align:start
and when I did I was able
to take it right off of her.

00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:34.194 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's who she is.

00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:37.130 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was wondering why
there was a civilian here.

00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:41.503 position:7% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Um, what exactly is that
weird ring thing anyway?

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:43.303 position:16% line:89% align:start
And what did it do to me?

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.209 position:13% line:83% align:start
You see, it uses a person's
heart as an energy source

00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:51.211 position:30% line:83% align:start
and converts it
into a crystal form.

00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:53.615 position:19% line:83% align:start
Which gives the wearer
immense power.

00:16:54.516 --> 00:16:56.518 position:7% line:89% align:start
It can use a heart for energy?

00:16:56.918 --> 00:16:59.119 position:16% line:89% align:start
But how is that possible?

00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:01.355 position:16% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD] The heart holds
immeasurable power.

00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:05.025 position:16% line:83% align:start
It is far greater than an
ordinary person could imagine.

00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:06.828 position:24% line:89% align:start
Even our own rings,

00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:08.395 position:16% line:89% align:start
the Heart-shift bracelets

00:17:08.563 --> 00:17:11.331 position:16% line:83% align:start
also use a person's heart
as an energy source.

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:14.536 position:24% line:89% align:start
The difference is,

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:16.403 position:19% line:83% align:start
his ring forces its way
into the heart of the wearer

00:17:16.538 --> 00:17:18.438 position:33% line:83% align:start
and draws out
their inner darkness.

00:17:18.573 --> 00:17:20.207 position:13% line:89% align:start
It was created from malice,

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
rather than the desire
to protect.

00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:25.813 position:24% line:83% align:start
Stigma was seen for
the first time in my country

00:17:25.947 --> 00:17:27.515 position:19% line:89% align:start
just about a year ago.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.752 position:21% line:89% align:start
I saw the kid myself.

00:17:34.589 --> 00:17:35.590 position:33% line:89% align:start
On that day,

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.525 position:7% line:89% align:start
he took advantage of my friend

00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:39.827 position:33% line:83% align:start
and used him
to cause mass destruction.

00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:47.134 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, do you mean that

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:49.637 position:16% line:83% align:start
he put one of those rings
on your friend?

00:17:49.971 --> 00:17:51.138 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
Correct.

00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:52.774 position:10% line:83% align:start
Same as what happened to you,
Shy.

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.241 position:35% line:89% align:start
May I ask,

00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:56.343 position:16% line:83% align:start
how did you deal with it
when it happened?

00:17:56.744 --> 00:17:57.745 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:17:58.178 --> 00:17:59.379 position:33% line:89% align:start
I cut it off.

00:17:59.747 --> 00:18:00.748 position:35% line:89% align:start
You, what?

00:18:00.882 --> 00:18:02.149 position:16% line:89% align:start
You mean the ring, right?

00:18:02.517 --> 00:18:03.751 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
No.

00:18:06.153 --> 00:18:07.789 position:41% line:89% align:start
Finger.

00:18:08.422 --> 00:18:10.792 position:16% line:83% align:start
It appears you still have
all your fingers.

00:18:11.926 --> 00:18:14.494 position:13% line:89% align:start
You got lucky, Koishikawa.

00:18:15.295 --> 00:18:17.799 position:38% line:83% align:start
Stop it.
You're scaring them.

00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:19.801 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're just kids, remember?

00:18:20.334 --> 00:18:23.605 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
I get a civilian being scared.

00:18:23.805 --> 00:18:25.105 position:27% line:89% align:start
But Shy's a hero.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
I understand now
why I was summoned.

00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:29.744 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you getting at?

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.047 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, then. Let's get to point,
shall we?

00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:36.116 position:30% line:83% align:start
What is it that
you want from me, Unilord?

00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:38.987 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hmm?
You, Stardust,

00:18:39.252 --> 00:18:40.822 position:16% line:89% align:start
are a rare kind of human.

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:42.557 position:27% line:83% align:start
One who can take
ruthless action

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.692 position:24% line:83% align:start
for both yourself,
and the world.

00:18:45.392 --> 00:18:46.894 position:10% line:89% align:start
That is why I need your help.

00:18:48.195 --> 00:18:50.130 position:21% line:83% align:start
I would like for you
to fight Shy.

00:18:50.263 --> 00:18:51.566 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-What?

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:54.802 position:38% line:83% align:start
Unilord!
What is the meaning of this?

00:18:55.036 --> 00:18:56.169 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
At this time,

00:18:56.336 --> 00:18:58.372 position:16% line:83% align:start
if Stigma were to appear
before her again,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.908 position:30% line:83% align:start
it is unlikely
that she would survive.

00:19:01.643 --> 00:19:03.343 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then let me fight
Teru instead, and--

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:04.946 position:27% line:83% align:start
-That won't work.
-Huh?

00:19:05.647 --> 00:19:08.082 position:21% line:83% align:start
You are too attached
to fight her for real.

00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:10.417 position:30% line:83% align:start
It would negate
the entire point.

00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:12.887 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't have it in you
to fight her.

00:19:13.788 --> 00:19:16.390 position:19% line:83% align:start
Perhaps she reminds you
of somebody else you know.

00:19:18.126 --> 00:19:19.459 position:7% line:89% align:start
Stardust, look. You don't have.

00:19:19.594 --> 00:19:20.928 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Pepesha!
-Huh?

00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:23.296 position:21% line:89% align:start
I-I'll give it a try.

00:19:23.865 --> 00:19:24.899 position:38% line:89% align:start
But Teru.

00:19:25.232 --> 00:19:26.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've been worried about it
myself.

00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:28.836 position:38% line:89% align:start
As I am,

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.872 position:13% line:83% align:start
can you really even call me
a hero?

00:19:31.506 --> 00:19:33.306 position:41% line:83% align:start
I know
that I'm not very strong.

00:19:33.908 --> 00:19:36.778 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's why.
I wanna be stronger!

00:19:37.145 --> 00:19:38.579 position:38% line:89% align:start
That way.

00:19:38.713 --> 00:19:41.214 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll be able to save everyone
and leave no one behind!

00:19:41.916 --> 00:19:42.950 position:35% line:89% align:start
Momijiyama.

00:19:43.483 --> 00:19:45.252 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[STARDUST] Impressive.
-Huh?

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.756 position:7% line:89% align:start
Said like a real hero. Tell me.

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:50.591 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are you prepared, then?

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:53.661 position:13% line:83% align:start
To give up on being a hero
if you lose?

00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:57.197 position:16% line:89% align:start
What? That's ridiculous!

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.266 position:27% line:83% align:start
-You can't just--
-Okay, I'll do it.

00:20:00.134 --> 00:20:03.370 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll do my best. I'll beat you!

00:20:07.608 --> 00:20:09.877 position:38% line:83% align:start
[exhales]
It's huge!

00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:11.411 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FN] Multipurpose
Room Section 3 in Space HQ

00:20:11.546 --> 00:20:13.748 position:19% line:89% align:start
Teru, will you be okay?

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:15.415 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah. I'll be fine.

00:20:15.616 --> 00:20:17.552 position:21% line:89% align:start
I mean, I am a hero!

00:20:17.752 --> 00:20:18.653 position:44% line:89% align:start
Teru.

00:20:18.786 --> 00:20:21.288 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
Shy! It's time to start.

00:20:24.659 --> 00:20:27.461 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know I said I could win
but I'm scared!

00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:32.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's review the rules,
shall we?

00:20:32.734 --> 00:20:34.802 position:16% line:83% align:start
The heart-shift bracelets
that we wear,

00:20:35.503 --> 00:20:37.772 position:33% line:83% align:start
are directly
connected to our hearts.

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:39.774 position:19% line:83% align:start
If your heart and mind
are strong,

00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:41.976 position:7% line:83% align:start
you'll be granted the strength
that you ask for.

00:20:42.543 --> 00:20:44.277 position:16% line:83% align:start
But if you doubt yourself
for even a moment,

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.080 position:24% line:83% align:start
your transformation
will revert.

00:20:46.581 --> 00:20:48.182 position:35% line:83% align:start
That means,
whoever's transformation

00:20:48.315 --> 00:20:49.650 position:21% line:89% align:start
reverts first loses.

00:20:49.784 --> 00:20:52.452 position:24% line:83% align:start
which will put you
at a severe disadvantage.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.789 position:38% line:89% align:start
So, Shy,

00:20:54.922 --> 00:20:56.958 position:10% line:83% align:start
if you manage to hit my face
even once in battle,

00:20:57.091 --> 00:20:58.893 position:13% line:89% align:start
we'll name you the victor.

00:20:59.994 --> 00:21:01.896 position:19% line:89% align:start
Okay, that makes sense.

00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:04.932 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't get it.

00:21:05.332 --> 00:21:07.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why are you making them
fight like this?

00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:08.669 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's the point of it?

00:21:09.103 --> 00:21:12.006 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shy has little to no
combat experience to speak of.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.243 position:27% line:83% align:start
However, Stardust
is incredibly experienced

00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:16.409 position:21% line:89% align:start
with using his heart.

00:21:17.211 --> 00:21:20.148 position:7% line:83% align:start
If she cannot overcome an enemy
more powerful than her,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.983 position:10% line:89% align:start
even in a space such as this.

00:21:22.517 --> 00:21:23.684 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then her future as a hero

00:21:23.818 --> 00:21:26.020 position:30% line:83% align:start
will be filled
with much hardship.

00:21:29.023 --> 00:21:31.358 position:33% line:83% align:start
[whimpering]
I can't stop shaking.

00:21:31.893 --> 00:21:34.294 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've never fought
another hero before.

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:36.664 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Unilord.

00:21:36.798 --> 00:21:38.298 position:7% line:83% align:start
If things become too dangerous,
then I'm go--

00:21:38.431 --> 00:21:39.667 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
No, you won't!

00:21:40.568 --> 00:21:41.936 position:16% line:89% align:start
Until this fight is over,

00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:44.739 position:21% line:83% align:start
you do not interfere,
no matter what happens.

00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:47.508 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you step in to help her,
she loses

00:21:47.642 --> 00:21:50.144 position:10% line:89% align:start
and can no longer be a hero.

00:21:50.912 --> 00:21:53.480 position:44% line:83% align:start
Shy!
When this coin hits the floor,

00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:55.683 position:10% line:89% align:start
that's when our fight begins.

00:21:56.383 --> 00:21:57.585 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it?

00:21:57.718 --> 00:21:58.753 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:22:02.123 --> 00:22:03.224 position:35% line:89% align:start
Momijiyama!

00:22:03.558 --> 00:22:05.325 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't push yourself!

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.595 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:12.800 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!
