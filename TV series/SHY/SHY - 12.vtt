[FEMALE ORPHAN 8A]
Whoa, it's Shy!

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:41.769 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MALE ORPHAN 8A]
Aren't you Japan's hero?

00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:43.136 position:24% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE ORPHAN 8B]
What are you doing in Russia?

[indistinct chatter]

00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:48.241 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shy!

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please, just give me
a little space!

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:52.346 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.948 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[NATALIA] Pesha.
-Huh?!

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.784 position:19% line:83% align:start
It looks like everyone
inside is all right.

00:01:56.918 --> 00:01:59.787 position:13% line:83% align:start
Doctor Isaak is checking up
on each of them.

00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:01.556 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh. That's great.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.559 position:7% line:89% align:start
Now that I see you in uniform,

00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:08.096 position:24% line:83% align:start
you really do look
the part of a Hero.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.463 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hearing you say that
to my face

00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:11.398 position:35% line:83% align:start
is honestly
a little bit embarrassing.

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.433 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, get over it!

00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:16.070 position:19% line:89% align:start
But, it's no surprise.

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:17.505 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:19.439 position:24% line:83% align:start
I knew it was only
a matter of time

00:02:19.574 --> 00:02:22.409 position:19% line:83% align:start
before you made a name
for yourself out there.

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:24.946 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
You really think so? Why?

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.413 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATALIA]
Why, you ask?

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:29.851 position:30% line:83% align:start
Because I knew
how incredible Lenya was,

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:32.720 position:24% line:89% align:start
and she loved you.

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:34.088 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Mama?

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:36.189 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NATALIA] Ah, don't take me
the wrong way, though!

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:38.726 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your accomplishments
are your own,

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.494 position:21% line:89% align:start
through and through.

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:41.996 position:27% line:83% align:start
I just can't help
but see the woman

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.932 position:21% line:83% align:start
I always looked up to
every time I look at you.

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:46.299 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hold on!
I never knew

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.835 position:21% line:89% align:start
you looked up to her!

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.170 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course, you didn't.
You think I told her that?

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:51.271 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.273 position:7% line:89% align:start
She never seemed like a child.

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:56.243 position:21% line:83% align:start
She had a certain way
she approached every day.

00:02:57.612 --> 00:02:59.346 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NATALIA] Some of the days
we shared back then

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.649 position:19% line:83% align:start
could only be described
as awful,

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:05.620 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I don't recall seeing
her cry or lose her temper.

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:09.289 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think, she must've had
a strict upbringing

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:10.725 position:21% line:89% align:start
before she came here.

00:03:10.858 --> 00:03:13.493 position:21% line:83% align:start
Her parents told her
to not cause trouble,

00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:15.429 position:19% line:89% align:start
to not rely on others.

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:17.264 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, she didn't.

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:20.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
But because of that,
she found herself

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.537 position:21% line:83% align:start
wanting to take care
of the other kids.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.238 position:27% line:83% align:start
She helped people
without expecting anything,

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.708 position:13% line:89% align:start
and I'm sure that kindness

00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:28.810 position:33% line:83% align:start
followed her
into adulthood too.

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:31.244 position:30% line:83% align:start
She was bullied
because they knew

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:32.647 position:16% line:89% align:start
she wouldn't fight back.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.083 position:27% line:83% align:start
I saw her put up
with more than I could've.

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:38.351 position:30% line:83% align:start
But none of it
seemed to shake her.

00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:42.523 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's only one way
to describe the way she acted.

00:03:42.657 --> 00:03:45.960 position:21% line:83% align:start
Someone who dedicates
their life to others is a Hero.

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:51.465 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, you know being her daughter
and carrying her legacy,

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
it just made sense.

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:55.937 position:30% line:83% align:start
I see her love
in everything you do.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.605 position:24% line:89% align:start
It felt so obvious.

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.508 position:19% line:83% align:start
Naturally you'd grow up
to be a superhero.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.643 position:16% line:89% align:start
The way that I figure it,

00:04:02.777 --> 00:04:05.213 position:13% line:83% align:start
she's still alive and well,
right?

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.014 position:16% line:89% align:start
My hero lives on in you.

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.017 position:24% line:89% align:start
You really mean it?

00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:12.019 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:15.656 position:16% line:83% align:start

-[SPIRIT] Yikes.

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.926 position:30% line:83% align:start
They've got me!
Help please!

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.763 position:10% line:89% align:start
Kids, our Hero's in trouble!

00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:22.964 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:04:23.097 --> 00:04:25.432 position:24% line:83% align:start
Time to wrap it up
and head back inside!

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.835 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHILDREN]
'Kay!

[panting]

00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:31.873 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thanks. I was stuck.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:34.509 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY]
Teru? Teru!

00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:37.011 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shrimpy? Can you hear me?

00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:39.647 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY] Ah!
Thank goodness. You're safe.

00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:42.216 position:10% line:83% align:start
I couldn't get a hold of you,
so I was worried.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, it's fine, now.
We're okay.

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:47.255 position:38% line:89% align:start
I think.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:50.124 position:19% line:83% align:start
Pepesha and I were able
to take care of the situation.

00:04:50.258 --> 00:04:51.659 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY]
Got it.

00:04:51.793 --> 00:04:54.461 position:21% line:83% align:start
Unilord recently sent
reinforcements to be safe.

00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:56.329 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:00.668 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was told we had an emergency.

00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:02.537 position:7% line:89% align:start
But it seems we're not needed.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.872 position:7% line:89% align:start
[SPIRIT] Stardust! Lady Black!

00:05:05.006 --> 00:05:06.306 position:24% line:89% align:start
You were sent here?

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.875 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
Yeah.

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.545 position:13% line:83% align:start
Right before the two of you
arrived on this scene,

00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:14.515 position:13% line:83% align:start
we received a transmission
from Unilord.

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:15.883 position:38% line:83% align:start
[UNILORD]
Moments ago,

00:05:16.017 --> 00:05:17.852 position:30% line:83% align:start
the governments
and Heroes of all nations

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:21.823 position:13% line:83% align:start
agreed to share information
and cooperate with each other.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.927 position:38% line:83% align:start
We hope,
when Amarariruku appears,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.198 position:10% line:83% align:start
the nations and Heroes of the
world will work together.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.099 position:21% line:83% align:start
During our briefing,
we got word

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:35.970 position:10% line:83% align:start
the two of you were handling
that very emergency.

00:05:36.103 --> 00:05:37.705 position:21% line:89% align:start
And it seems you did.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.174 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll make sure Unilord receives
an exhaustive report from me

00:05:40.308 --> 00:05:41.943 position:19% line:89% align:start
on the events of today.

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:44.312 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] But before I do that,
I need to check

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:45.813 position:19% line:89% align:start
that everyone is safe.

00:05:46.814 --> 00:05:47.882 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:50.383 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then could anything
use my attention?

00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:52.753 position:24% line:89% align:start
There is one thing.

00:05:52.887 --> 00:05:54.288 position:35% line:89% align:start
Look here.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:55.623 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Isn't it odd?

00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:57.825 position:13% line:89% align:start
A ring left by Amarariruku.

00:05:58.593 --> 00:06:02.096 position:35% line:83% align:start
If you can,
get this to Unilord right now.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.497 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is serious. Will do.

00:06:05.533 --> 00:06:07.702 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
I should be on my way, then.

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:10.171 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm a busy man, after all.

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:11.706 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Um, wait!

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:14.742 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thanks for earlier!

00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:16.978 position:16% line:83% align:start
The guidance you gave me
was helpful.

00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:21.182 position:10% line:83% align:start
I needed it, and it helped me
save everybody today.

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:23.483 position:16% line:83% align:start
I meant to tell you that
a while ago.

00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:27.722 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I couldn't so...
I'm sorry for the wait.

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:33.928 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, I remember.

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:35.863 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're the girl
from the spaceship.

00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:39.600 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
That is where we met, innit?

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:42.536 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
He forgot all about me.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.038 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STARDUST]
I didn't do a single thing

00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:45.940 position:13% line:89% align:start
to deserve your gratitude.

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:48.709 position:27% line:83% align:start
You got stronger
and saved them on your own.

00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:51.612 position:13% line:89% align:start
Take credit where it's due.

00:06:51.746 --> 00:06:54.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're responsible
for your own successes

00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:56.984 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's the same
with your failures.

00:06:57.118 --> 00:07:00.988 position:13% line:83% align:start
You can't divert the blame
to anyone else.

00:07:01.122 --> 00:07:02.990 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, hold your head high.

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:05.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let yourself feel pride
for all the people

00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:06.727 position:24% line:89% align:start
you rescued today.

00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:09.730 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then have that pride
empower you going forward.

00:07:11.198 --> 00:07:13.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't let them see
you doubt yourself.

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:16.469 position:16% line:83% align:start
They'll think they should
apologize for being saved.

00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:19.907 position:10% line:83% align:start
Assure them it's no problem.
Okay?

00:07:21.142 --> 00:07:22.677 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, I'm headed out.

00:07:23.778 --> 00:07:26.714 position:35% line:83% align:start
Lady Black,
you take care of it from here.

00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:28.582 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:30.651 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll check to see
if anyone's injured now.

00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:37.325 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's the situation?

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.393 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do you know
if anyone's wounded?

00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:40.895 position:35% line:89% align:start
Um, a few.

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:43.631 position:21% line:83% align:start
Some of the citizens
were hit by enemy attacks.

00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:46.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you follow me,
I'll take you to them.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.535 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK]
What about you?

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:49.603 position:35% line:89% align:start
Was I hit?

00:07:49.737 --> 00:07:51.439 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about me, yet.

00:07:51.572 --> 00:07:53.874 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please make sure
the others are okay first.

00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:55.609 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:57.979 position:27% line:83% align:start
You finally look
like a real Hero.

00:07:58.112 --> 00:08:00.748 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LADY BLACK] Seems you've
climbed your first mountain.

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:06.354 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATALIA]
Do you have to leave already?

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.090 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're more than happy
to put you up for the night.

00:08:09.223 --> 00:08:12.426 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't want to risk
overstaying our welcome today,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.928 position:21% line:89% align:start
but maybe next time.

00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:17.465 position:35% line:83% align:start
Understood.
Well, be safe now.

00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:19.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hold on.

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:22.103 position:13% line:83% align:start
Before you leave, I wanted
to thank you for saving us.

00:08:24.138 --> 00:08:26.907 position:24% line:83% align:start
While you're away,
know that we're constantly

00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:30.211 position:27% line:83% align:start
-thinking of you.
-That means the world to me.

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:31.912 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Natalia.

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:38.786 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
They're still out there.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.156 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wonder what Stigma
and Amarariruku are after.

00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:43.991 position:19% line:89% align:start
I keep feeling like...

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:45.493 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's something
important going on

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:47.762 position:19% line:89% align:start
right under our noses.

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:49.930 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even if we don't know
what to expect.

00:08:50.064 --> 00:08:53.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
We Heroes have to be prepared
in any way that we're able.

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.903 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] So, we've gotta
keep pressing on!

00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:57.705 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Uh, totally!

00:08:57.838 --> 00:08:59.740 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
But, first things first,

00:08:59.874 --> 00:09:02.910 position:13% line:83% align:start
there's a bar a little over
that way I like going to.

00:09:03.044 --> 00:09:04.745 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hold on! You want more?

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:06.347 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can hardly believe
you're still standing

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.183 position:19% line:83% align:start
after watching how much
you drank with Natalia.

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:11.385 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] Something
that tiny's barely enough

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.020 position:21% line:89% align:start
to whet my appetite!

00:09:13.154 --> 00:09:14.889 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now let's go!

00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:16.657 position:16% line:89% align:start
Gonna drink till morning!

00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:18.826 position:19% line:89% align:start
Gonna drink till dawn!

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:22.531 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Amarariruku,
and the power Stigma has.

00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:27.001 position:7% line:83% align:start
To peer inside people's hearts,
and warp their dreams.

00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:31.705 position:19% line:83% align:start
I may not know exactly
how it works yet,

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:34.275 position:19% line:89% align:start
but I know I'm a Hero.

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:37.144 position:30% line:83% align:start
And I was asked
to end this twisted dream.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:41.782 position:27% line:83% align:start
The way it seems,
it's gonna be difficult.

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:44.919 position:24% line:83% align:start
and take more than
beating them in a fight.

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:47.556 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Teru!
You got rocks in your shoes?

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:49.890 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Oh, uh...
I'm right behind you!

00:09:50.758 --> 00:09:52.026 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:54.829 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT] You don't think
I drink too much, right?

00:09:54.962 --> 00:09:57.198 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[SHY] You definitely do!
-[SPIRIT] Huh?!

00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:02.002 position:38% line:83% align:start
[STIGMA]
Even if the body's gone,

00:10:02.136 --> 00:10:05.106 position:27% line:83% align:start
the heart remains
complete in this world.

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:07.675 position:19% line:83% align:start
Here, where our hearts
are free,

00:10:08.476 --> 00:10:11.378 position:21% line:89% align:start
they never truly die.

00:10:11.513 --> 00:10:15.349 position:16% line:83% align:start
So don't let this setback
make you sad, Kufufu.

00:10:15.483 --> 00:10:16.450 position:35% line:89% align:start
You'll see.

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:17.885 position:30% line:89% align:start
Tzveta's here.

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:20.754 position:19% line:89% align:start
With you, with us all.

00:10:22.423 --> 00:10:26.293 position:19% line:83% align:start
In the end, we'll each
become one single heart.

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:33.267 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[SHY] Shy.
-[SPIRIT] Shy.

00:10:39.173 --> 00:10:41.142 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Good morning, Momijiyama!

00:10:42.611 --> 00:10:44.178 position:35% line:89% align:start
Koishikawa.

00:10:45.346 --> 00:10:46.680 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Morning.

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:52.319 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know that matryoshka doll
you brought me as a souvenir?

00:10:52.453 --> 00:10:55.055 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, my little brother's
totally obsessed with it!

00:10:55.189 --> 00:10:56.924 position:21% line:83% align:start
We were just chatting
this morning about

00:10:57.057 --> 00:10:59.160 position:21% line:83% align:start
where the best place
is to show it off!

00:11:00.161 --> 00:11:02.597 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
That's awesome.

00:11:03.364 --> 00:11:05.900 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're not quite seeming
like your usual self.

00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:08.002 position:30% line:83% align:start
I guess you did
just get back home.

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:10.070 position:10% line:89% align:start
You must still have jet lag.

00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:11.705 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah.
[sighs]

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.575 position:16% line:89% align:start
The trip was really busy,

00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:15.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
but there's nothing
to fret about.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:18.045 position:35% line:83% align:start
After all,
I'm a Hero, aren't I?

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:19.880 position:33% line:83% align:start
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:21.382 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're looking...

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:23.417 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-[groaning]

00:11:23.552 --> 00:11:25.953 position:35% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Whoa!
You're worse than I thought!

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.458 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes, she's caught a cold.

00:11:32.627 --> 00:11:33.928 position:21% line:89% align:start
She'll be just fine!

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:35.930 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna stay with her
till she's better.

00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:39.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
Right, I appreciate it!

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:43.070 position:21% line:89% align:start
That was the school.

00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:45.072 position:27% line:83% align:start
They also thought
you should stay home.

00:11:45.206 --> 00:11:47.708 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, let's get you
in your bed and jammies!

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:50.110 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll hang out for as long
as you need me.

00:11:50.844 --> 00:11:52.780 position:10% line:89% align:start
I couldn't ask you for that.

00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:53.981 position:21% line:89% align:start
Please, don't worry,

00:11:54.114 --> 00:11:56.150 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't want you
to miss school.

00:11:57.586 --> 00:12:00.321 position:33% line:83% align:start
Says the girl
who's barely able to stand up!

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:03.324 position:27% line:83% align:start
At bare minimum,
I'm walking you home!

00:12:03.457 --> 00:12:04.758 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.428 position:33% line:89% align:start
Um, one sec.

00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:09.797 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Why exactly are you doing this?

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.966 position:7% line:89% align:start
Isn't this easier than walking?

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:15.135 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Koishikawa Taxi
will be departing now!

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:18.607 position:21% line:83% align:start
But first, which way
was it to your house again?

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:20.642 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, that way.

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:21.875 position:41% line:89% align:start
Onward!

00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:23.511 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHY] [whimpering]
Aren't I too old

00:12:23.645 --> 00:12:25.079 position:16% line:89% align:start
to get a piggyback ride?

00:12:25.212 --> 00:12:27.582 position:10% line:89% align:start
And she's the same age as me.

00:12:27.716 --> 00:12:29.316 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just kill me.

00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:32.554 position:21% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Anyway, I guess
even someone like you

00:12:32.687 --> 00:12:34.154 position:19% line:89% align:start
isn't immune to colds!

00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:37.124 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wait, did you think I wasn't
a human or something?

00:12:37.258 --> 00:12:38.993 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nah, I just thought
maybe heroes had

00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:41.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
some extra resistance
to getting sick.

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:45.132 position:30% line:83% align:start
Which is silly,
'cause everyone gets sick!

00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:49.837 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHY] If I were a proper hero,
I wouldn't let anyone see me

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.573 position:24% line:89% align:start
looking this lame.

00:12:51.706 --> 00:12:53.374 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry.

00:12:55.175 --> 00:13:00.047 position:27% line:83% align:start
But this also...
kinda makes me happy.

00:13:06.353 --> 00:13:09.557 position:16% line:83% align:start
Passengers, we've arrived
at the destination!

00:13:09.691 --> 00:13:11.258 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thank you again for the help.

00:13:12.226 --> 00:13:15.129 position:44% line:83% align:start
Whoa!
Hey, you look kind of rough!

00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:18.098 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
I'm really sorry.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Hey, Momijiyama,
is there anyone here

00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:24.673 position:30% line:83% align:start
who'll get you
medicine and stuff?

00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:25.973 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
No.

00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:28.710 position:7% line:89% align:start
Although, Shrimpy can watch me.

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:30.177 position:44% line:83% align:start
[IKO]
Got it.

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:33.881 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then, how about I go
pick up a couple of things?

00:13:34.014 --> 00:13:35.983 position:19% line:83% align:start
You should go lie down
and get some rest!

00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:38.485 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, no! That's too much!

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.921 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I'll go
on my own a little later.

00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:43.558 position:7% line:89% align:start
Jeez, you always act like this!

00:13:43.692 --> 00:13:45.926 position:24% line:83% align:start
Putting the weight
of the world on your shoulders!

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.262 position:27% line:83% align:start
[IKO] It's fine.
Leave it all to me!

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:50.397 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, sure.

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:55.869 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Maybe she's right.

00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:58.707 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've been pushing myself
harder than usual lately.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.974 position:30% line:83% align:start
I guess my body
wasn't able to hold up

00:14:01.108 --> 00:14:02.443 position:19% line:89% align:start
with all the fighting.

00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:05.979 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, I was freezing
the whole time I fought

Okay, what would that be?

You used to gently rub my back.

Don't worry about it.

That's super kind of you.

So on top of it.

I'd like to say I play
my role pretty well!

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.405 position:13% line:83% align:start
I do have a little brother,

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.642 position:30% line:83% align:start
That reminds me

We used to live together

[SHY] That feels

I hope I didn't upset you.

00:17:06.728 --> 00:17:09.864 position:24% line:83% align:start
No. I'm comfortable
talking about her.

00:17:09.998 --> 00:17:13.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHY] In those days, my parents
weren't home very often.

00:17:13.935 --> 00:17:17.605 position:13% line:83% align:start
So honestly, she would act
more like a mother to me.

00:17:17.739 --> 00:17:20.575 position:7% line:83% align:start
Earlier today when you heard me
talking in my sleep,

00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:23.778 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was dreaming about the past

I see.

00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:28.983 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm making a habit of this.

00:17:29.116 --> 00:17:32.620 position:24% line:83% align:start
I always find a way
to embarrass myself with you.

00:17:32.754 --> 00:17:34.221 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's what you think?

00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:36.290 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't see it as embarrassing.

00:17:36.423 --> 00:17:38.191 position:44% line:83% align:start
[SHY]
Oh, come on.

00:17:39.293 --> 00:17:42.062 position:38% line:83% align:start
Honestly?
It's great.

00:17:42.195 --> 00:17:43.898 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've helped me
to feel at ease.

00:17:44.032 --> 00:17:45.867 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm grateful to see this.

It's like learning that Heroes
are average people, too.

How'd that make you
feel at ease?

you were out of reach

I want you to know
how I respect that,

calling you by your first name.

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:47.127 position:19% line:83% align:start

Oh, sure.

00:18:55.036 --> 00:18:56.904 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:06.480 position:24% line:89% align:start
I really told her.

00:19:16.991 --> 00:19:19.527 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHY] I've always wanted
to be more normal.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
And no, it's not because
I don't like being a Hero.

eye contact normally.

in my skin normally.

Or heck, just calling friends
by name normally.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.328 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've taken my first step,
and maybe it shouldn't be

00:19:55.462 --> 00:19:57.431 position:13% line:89% align:start
such a big deal for a Hero.

00:21:28.589 --> 00:21:30.024 position:35% line:89% align:start
Don't care.

00:21:30.158 --> 00:21:32.794 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you trying
to find down there?

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:36.363 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KUFUFU]
Something big!

âª

00:21:38.431 --> 00:21:41.368 position:27% line:83% align:start
My darling Tzveta
hasn't come home yet,

00:21:41.502 --> 00:21:43.905 position:19% line:83% align:start
she might be down there
alone and scared.

00:21:44.038 --> 00:21:46.507 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, I'll keep fishing
until I get her!

00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:48.375 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're still on that, girly?

00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:50.978 position:24% line:83% align:start
Tzveta disappeared
a lifetime ago!

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:58.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you forget again?
I'm Kufufu.

00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:00.755 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

00:22:00.888 --> 00:22:03.724 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KUFUFU] What's stopping you?
Not like I'll stay dead.

00:22:03.858 --> 00:22:06.961 position:41% line:83% align:start
[DOKI]
Okay then, you asked for it!

00:22:11.464 --> 00:22:13.366 position:41% line:83% align:start
[INORI]
Cease this pointless fight.

00:22:14.969 --> 00:22:17.839 position:16% line:83% align:start
Treat others as you would
like them to treat you.

00:22:18.573 --> 00:22:21.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
Love thy neighbor,
even when it's hard.

00:22:21.609 --> 00:22:24.045 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now let us lift
our hearts up in prayer!

00:22:24.812 --> 00:22:27.081 position:33% line:83% align:start
Where are we?
Heaven!

00:22:32.019 --> 00:22:33.087 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:22:33.621 --> 00:22:36.057 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our master has bestowed
upon us a beauteous world

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.527 position:27% line:83% align:start
-in which we may
indulge and rejoice! -Huh!

00:22:40.528 --> 00:22:42.395 position:16% line:83% align:start
[-INORI] If we can share
this world with the sheep

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.497 position:21% line:83% align:start
who live their lives
in darkness,

00:22:44.632 --> 00:22:47.500 position:27% line:83% align:start
we can herd them
into the light of tranquility.

00:22:49.637 --> 00:22:53.140 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, whatever.
You got any info on Stigma?

00:22:53.274 --> 00:22:55.309 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course, I do.

00:22:55.442 --> 00:22:57.778 position:35% line:83% align:start
Our master
has begun preparations.

00:22:58.646 --> 00:23:01.315 position:35% line:83% align:start
He's going
into that forsaken world.

00:23:01.448 --> 00:23:03.517 position:21% line:89% align:start
To give it salvation.

00:23:06.287 --> 00:23:08.289 position:38% line:83% align:start
[STIGMA]
We have a right to dream.

00:23:08.421 --> 00:23:09.690 position:35% line:89% align:start
We all do.

00:23:09.824 --> 00:23:13.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's one of the few things
we share equally.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.396 position:27% line:83% align:start
But no two people
have the same dreams.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.431 position:19% line:89% align:start
Could you imagine that?

00:23:18.566 --> 00:23:21.235 position:27% line:83% align:start
If we were united
under one dream.

00:23:21.369 --> 00:23:24.906 position:21% line:83% align:start
We would finally live
an unburdened and happy life.

00:23:27.208 --> 00:23:29.744 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now, let's begin.

00:23:30.945 --> 00:23:33.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll make a world
where that's our reality.

00:23:34.382 --> 00:23:35.917 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.654 position:19% line:83% align:start
It will take more time,
but even the night

00:23:39.787 --> 00:23:41.656 position:13% line:89% align:start
will soon be put to sleep.

00:23:44.825 --> 00:23:46.727 position:38% line:83% align:start
[STIGMA]
Wait for me.
