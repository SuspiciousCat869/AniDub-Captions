00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.302 position:19% line:83% align:start
[IKO] Did you remember
a change of clothes?

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.639 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[SHY] Yeah.
-And your toothbrush?

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:45.740 position:24% line:89% align:start
Got it right here.

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:47.107 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! Your passport?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.142 position:30% line:83% align:start
Did you really
think I'd forget that.

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:51.512 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've double checked everything.

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:52.747 position:35% line:89% align:start
She's fine.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.983 position:24% line:89% align:start
I promise I'm okay.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:56.684 position:33% line:89% align:start
I am a Hero,

00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:59.319 position:10% line:89% align:start
so like, hey! I've got this!

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.023 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're totally right.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.458 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, have a good trip.

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:05.627 position:41% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

00:02:08.963 --> 00:02:11.532 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Please don't worry,
residents of Japan.

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:12.700 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.902 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll be back soon.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.839 position:13% line:89% align:start
But for now, I'm in Russia.

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:21.075 position:30% line:89% align:start
The other day,

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.210 position:24% line:83% align:start
when we encountered
Amarariruku,

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.579 position:30% line:83% align:start
Pepesha thought
one of their members

00:02:24.712 --> 00:02:26.446 position:10% line:89% align:start
looked like she did as a kid.

00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:29.349 position:13% line:89% align:start
Since she looked familiar,

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:32.285 position:19% line:83% align:start
Pepesha and I agreed to
investigate in her homeland.

00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:34.388 position:30% line:89% align:start
But that said,

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.424 position:35% line:83% align:start
I had hoped
she'd be here first!

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:41.428 position:10% line:83% align:start
Being alone in an unfamiliar
country is terrifying!

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.798 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Look who it is!
-Huh?

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.768 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thank you for coming
all the way out here.

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:48.235 position:30% line:89% align:start
There you are!

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:50.905 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you feeling any better
since you got hurt?

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.707 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, all patched up!

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.510 position:7% line:83% align:start
I am right as rain and nothing
could bring me down now.

00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:57.779 position:13% line:89% align:start
Not with such a cutie here.

00:02:57.912 --> 00:02:59.747 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now let's hurry and go!

00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:02.416 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm happy you're here!

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:04.886 position:24% line:89% align:start
She's drunk again.

00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:07.622 position:38% line:89% align:start
[humming]

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.624 position:19% line:89% align:start
Um, mind if I ask you,

00:03:09.757 --> 00:03:12.225 position:21% line:83% align:start
do you ever go a day
without drinking?

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.293 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:15.129 position:21% line:89% align:start
Jeez, Debbie Downer!

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:16.998 position:30% line:89% align:start
Am I bad? Huh?

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:18.700 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm not sick or anything.

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:21.069 position:27% line:83% align:start
I just want to be
presentable for you.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.470 position:30% line:83% align:start
So you're drunk
because of me?

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:24.739 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:26.306 position:33% line:89% align:start
Being honest?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.743 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you ever came
across me sober,

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:32.446 position:7% line:83% align:start
you probably wouldn't recognize
the woman in front of you.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.715 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:37.085 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.986 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, would you mind telling me
where we're going?

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:41.689 position:19% line:83% align:start
I figured we could head
to the place I grew up.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.626 position:13% line:83% align:start
They kept photo albums from
every year since they opened.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.063 position:21% line:83% align:start
I suppose it sounded
helpful for our research.

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:50.598 position:21% line:89% align:start
That sounds exciting.

00:03:50.732 --> 00:03:53.067 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm curious what you were like
as a little kid.

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:54.836 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Are you now?

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.506 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid I wasn't the
cheerful girl you know today.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:01.142 position:30% line:83% align:start
But I feel like
you're always happy.

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:03.745 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah?
I'm glad you think so!

00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:07.782 position:19% line:89% align:start
Looks like we're here!

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.420 position:24% line:89% align:start
What is this place?

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:15.189 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is home.

00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:17.390 position:10% line:89% align:start
Also known as Yuri Orphanage.

00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:19.292 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, so you mean...

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:22.630 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't worry your pretty face,
everyone's as kind as can be!

00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:24.232 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ISAAK]
Well, well, well.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
I thought I heard some cheerful
voices approaching.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:28.569 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm glad you're back, dear.

00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:30.972 position:35% line:83% align:start
I've missed
my beloved daughter.

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:33.040 position:7% line:89% align:start
Good to see you, Mister Isaak!

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.643 position:27% line:89% align:start
You...look great!

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:37.310 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:39.312 position:19% line:89% align:start
And who's your friend?

00:04:39.547 --> 00:04:42.382 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let me introduce
Teru Momijiyama.

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:44.317 position:16% line:89% align:start
She came here from Japan.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.154 position:13% line:89% align:start
Huh? Pleasure to meet you.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.388 position:27% line:83% align:start
I appreciate you
welcoming me here.

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:50.792 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, the pleasure is all mine.

00:04:50.992 --> 00:04:54.162 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hope that you'll enjoy
your visit at Yuri Orphanage.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.164 position:19% line:89% align:start
You can call me Isaak.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.599 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm the director
of these facilities.

00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:01.969 position:24% line:83% align:start
You look so young,
but your Russian is incredible.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.139 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, well, I try.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.741 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHRIMPY]
She's using the power of

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:08.943 position:16% line:83% align:start
her Heart-Shift Bracelets
to translate.

00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:11.679 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ISAAK] Well, no point
in standing around.

00:05:11.813 --> 00:05:14.182 position:24% line:83% align:start
What do you say we
start heading inside?

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're all gonna be
happy to see you.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.557 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[giggling]
-Listen up, kids.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.891 position:30% line:89% align:start
We have guests.

00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:26.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
Say hello to Pepesha
and her friend.

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:28.129 position:24% line:89% align:start
What? Pesha's here?

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:29.297 position:38% line:89% align:start
For real?

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:32.233 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey. How are we doing?

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
[excited laughter]

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:35.002 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are you doing over here?

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:36.871 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've read every single
book that you sent us!

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:39.140 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Those snacks were yummy, too.
-Thank you for everything!

00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:42.342 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm glad all of you
seem to be doing so well!

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.445 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Pepesha's really popular
here, too.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:47.315 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'd like to ask
if you don't mind.

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:49.283 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where did the two of you
first meet?

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:51.418 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?!
Oh, let me think.

00:05:52.053 --> 00:05:54.354 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess we're sorta
like colleagues,

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.423 position:10% line:89% align:start
or we work in the same field.

00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:57.959 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.895 position:10% line:83% align:start
She's never mentioned a word
to me about the work she does,

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.864 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I'm glad that
whatever the two of you do,

00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:05.633 position:24% line:83% align:start
she has someone she
can rely on from day to day.

00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:07.969 position:13% line:89% align:start
Right. Uh, thank you, sir.

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:11.873 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's been ten whole years since
Pesha called this place home,

00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:14.075 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I can tell she's
still pretty concerned

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.408 position:13% line:89% align:start
about the kids' life here.

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:17.111 position:10% line:89% align:start
Every month, like clockwork,

00:06:17.245 --> 00:06:19.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
we'll get some money
from her in the mail.

00:06:20.348 --> 00:06:23.450 position:7% line:83% align:start
And because of her generosity,
we keep this place running,

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:25.253 position:19% line:89% align:start
and the kids are happy.

00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:27.655 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, all of the staff
here choose to respect

00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:29.790 position:24% line:83% align:start
her privacy when it
comes to her work.

00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:33.426 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you ask any of the children
what they think she does,

00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.428 position:33% line:89% align:start
she's a hero.

00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:37.932 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:06:41.702 --> 00:06:44.338 position:24% line:83% align:start
Here are the albums
from when you were still here.

00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:46.207 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thanks for getting these.

00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:48.309 position:7% line:89% align:start
But you've piqued my curiosity.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.077 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why do you need so many?

00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:52.980 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm investigating something
that happened back then,

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:56.050 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'm dying to know
what I was like as a kid.

00:06:56.284 --> 00:06:57.251 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:06:57.385 --> 00:06:59.353 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, make yourselves at home.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.689 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, more importantly, Pesha.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
It smells like you have
a taste for the bottle.

00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:07.460 position:10% line:89% align:start
Be careful not to overdo it.

00:07:07.662 --> 00:07:09.496 position:24% line:89% align:start
[awkward chuckling]

00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:11.732 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sure thing.

00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:18.506 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm!

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:21.709 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hope these won't
all be dead ends.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.513 position:38% line:83% align:start
If I may,
this might be redundant now,

00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:28.582 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I had no idea you
grew up in an orphanage.

00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:30.952 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It never came up.
-Yep.

00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:32.920 position:27% line:83% align:start
These people took
me into their arms

00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:35.189 position:10% line:89% align:start
when I was only 12 years old.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.692 position:10% line:89% align:start
I spent five years with them

00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:39.894 position:27% line:83% align:start
before going out
to live on my own.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.430 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it's wonderful,
don't you think?

00:07:42.663 --> 00:07:45.465 position:33% line:83% align:start
Everyone here
is so warm and kind.

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:48.202 position:13% line:89% align:start
So when I chose to go away,

00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:50.571 position:13% line:89% align:start
I felt lonely without them.

00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:53.975 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of course, I still come back
every time I get the chance.

00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:56.277 position:33% line:83% align:start
So I haven't
completely left the nest.

00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:58.279 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Oh, hey! Check it out.
-Huh?

00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:00.281 position:13% line:89% align:start
This one's a picture of me.

00:08:00.414 --> 00:08:01.983 position:24% line:89% align:start
Which do you mean?

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.884 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ta-da!

00:08:04.452 --> 00:08:05.453 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:07.021 position:16% line:89% align:start
Look at that grumpy teen.

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:09.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wonder if I was always
that grouchy.

00:08:09.557 --> 00:08:10.858 position:16% line:89% align:start
I must have been annoying

00:08:10.992 --> 00:08:12.860 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you couldn't
have been that bad!

00:08:12.994 --> 00:08:15.529 position:30% line:83% align:start
You look cute,
even though you're upset.

00:08:16.364 --> 00:08:18.599 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah?
But look at me.

00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:21.235 position:38% line:83% align:start
Not quite
the life of the party.

00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:22.403 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.740 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, you've got a genuine
smile in this one.

00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:28.075 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
If you can call it that.

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:30.511 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why does my whole face look
so awkward?

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.814 position:38% line:83% align:start
You know,
I think you're on to something.

00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:36.183 position:24% line:83% align:start
You do sort of look
like that Tzveta girl,

00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:37.251 position:19% line:89% align:start
if you squint a little.

00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:38.753 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:40.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I don't think
these are enough to go off of.

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:42.556 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let's find some more pictures.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.225 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[sliding]
-Huh?

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:45.593 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHY] Something just
fell to the floor!

00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:47.762 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
Huh? I wonder what.

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:48.929 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:50.598 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:52.666 position:21% line:89% align:start
What is it? Anything?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.368 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wouldn't you know it,

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:57.471 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's a picture of me
with my mama.

00:08:58.072 --> 00:09:01.042 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wow. You must've been really
young in that photo.

00:09:01.275 --> 00:09:02.643 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:04.979 position:19% line:83% align:start
It must have been stuck
in between the pages.

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:06.914 position:33% line:89% align:start
I remember...

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:09.250 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:10.851 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
That's right.

00:09:12.053 --> 00:09:14.188 position:10% line:89% align:start
For a while when I got here,

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:17.992 position:7% line:83% align:start
I carried this picture with me
everywhere.

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:22.730 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was so scared
of being all alone.

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:24.398 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:26.300 position:10% line:89% align:start
You really loved your mother.

00:09:26.434 --> 00:09:27.935 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's plain to see.

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:29.336 position:38% line:89% align:start
No doubt.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.005 position:19% line:89% align:start
And I looked up to her.

00:09:31.439 --> 00:09:34.575 position:24% line:83% align:start
She took care of me
those 12 years all by herself.

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:38.179 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mama was also raised
inside this orphanage.

00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:39.613 position:21% line:89% align:start
So when she was gone,

00:09:39.747 --> 00:09:41.816 position:33% line:83% align:start
it made sense
I'd come here, too.

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:44.318 position:16% line:89% align:start
She rarely said too much.

00:09:44.652 --> 00:09:45.753 position:38% line:89% align:start
But then,

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.354 position:33% line:83% align:start
some nights,
she'd go on and on.

00:09:47.488 --> 00:09:48.923 position:24% line:89% align:start
As happy as can be.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.325 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do you wanna guess why?

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:53.394 position:13% line:89% align:start
Guess why she was happier?

00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:55.763 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-That's right!

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.399 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because she was drunk
as a skunk.

00:09:58.533 --> 00:09:59.733 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:02.736 position:24% line:83% align:start
My mama was always
the stoic and cool type

00:10:02.903 --> 00:10:04.872 position:24% line:83% align:start
but when she drank,
she let down her walls

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:07.341 position:24% line:83% align:start
and was like a cute
and talkative friend.

00:10:08.476 --> 00:10:12.313 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's why, I remember watching
her drink and thinking,

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.516 position:21% line:89% align:start
"Alcohol is magical."

00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:16.283 position:30% line:83% align:start
"It has mystic
properties to return

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:18.853 position:24% line:83% align:start
adults to what they
were like as kids."

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.154 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:23.891 position:27% line:83% align:start
Which is why kids
weren't allowed to drink it.

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:27.228 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because then you might
turn into a baby and disappear.

00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:28.530 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:30.498 position:19% line:89% align:start
With all that in mind,

00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:32.833 position:10% line:89% align:start
a lot more things make sense.

00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:35.537 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're like your mother.
Don't you think?

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:36.704 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:10:37.138 --> 00:10:38.839 position:10% line:89% align:start
You really think that's true?

00:10:38.973 --> 00:10:42.243 position:19% line:83% align:start
I mean, just going off
of everything you've told me.

00:10:42.443 --> 00:10:45.346 position:7% line:83% align:start
Like the fact that both of you
love drinking alcohol.

00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:48.349 position:16% line:83% align:start
Or what about how you're
both cute when you're drunk?

00:10:48.617 --> 00:10:50.117 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, that doesn't mean a thing.

00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:51.852 position:21% line:83% align:start
Everyone around here
gets like that

00:10:51.986 --> 00:10:53.387 position:16% line:89% align:start
with a couple of drinks.

00:10:53.522 --> 00:10:54.556 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

-Huh?

00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:56.857 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

[door creaks open]

00:10:58.659 --> 00:11:00.629 position:38% line:83% align:start
Any luck
finding more about yourself?

00:11:00.761 --> 00:11:02.029 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, plenty.

00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:04.732 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're already getting
into the afternoon hours.

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:07.401 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't the two of you
join us for lunch?

Oh, that was wonderful.

Thank you for the meal.

00:11:14.609 --> 00:11:17.178 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think a little beer
would be perfect right now.

00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:18.379 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you say?

00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:20.181 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're getting me worried.

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:22.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know when to stop,
don't you?

Hey, look over this way.

I've got just
what you're fixing for.

00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:31.125 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'd know the voice that makes

Hi, Natalia!

It's been way too long.

00:11:35.429 --> 00:11:37.231 position:21% line:83% align:start
It looks like you've
put on some weight.

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:38.567 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:40.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I don't have any beer
for brats like you.

This lady is Natalia.

00:11:47.542 --> 00:11:50.411 position:10% line:83% align:start
She's been an important part
of the staff since I was a kid.

00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:53.047 position:19% line:83% align:start
You must be the girlie

00:11:53.214 --> 00:11:55.316 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah. I'm Teru Momijiyama.

00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:57.718 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, we may not
have much around here,

00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.453 position:16% line:89% align:start
but enjoy what there is.

That's so generous of you.

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:04.892 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's time to catch up, Pesha.

We're long overdue, Natalia.

It looks easy.

[NATALIA] Tell me, what brought
the two of you out here?

I don't suppose
memory lane came a-callin'?

00:12:20.374 --> 00:12:21.308 position:38% line:89% align:start
I guess.

00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:24.912 position:13% line:83% align:start
While I scanned the albums,
I remembered more of my days

00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:26.480 position:21% line:89% align:start
here than I expected.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:29.216 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was nostalgic
the entire time.

00:12:29.483 --> 00:12:32.052 position:19% line:83% align:start
[NATALIA] If I recall,
you were a nightmare

00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:33.387 position:21% line:83% align:start
when you first joined
our family.

00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:35.289 position:13% line:83% align:start
I couldn't get a damn word
out of you.

[SPIRIT]
Was I really that bad?

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:41.829 position:10% line:83% align:start
Nowadays, you're starting to
look more and more like Lenya.

00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:43.531 position:19% line:89% align:start
Though I don't remember

00:12:43.665 --> 00:12:46.166 position:21% line:83% align:start
ever seeing her smile
without a glass in her hand.

00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:48.737 position:27% line:89% align:start
So, is Lenya...?

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:51.506 position:10% line:89% align:start
Short for Letana Andreanova.

00:12:52.707 --> 00:12:54.676 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's the nickname
my mama went by.

00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:59.079 position:7% line:83% align:start
I knew Lenya years ago when we

If you don't shut up,
you'll tell them everything.

Good to see you, Pesha.

00:18:49.496 --> 00:18:51.766 position:33% line:83% align:start
I assume that
you're feeling better.

00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:55.603 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TZVETA] Sorry about that,
I went too far.

00:18:55.737 --> 00:18:58.740 position:13% line:83% align:start
But in my defense, you did
something really mean to me,

00:18:58.873 --> 00:19:00.508 position:19% line:89% align:start
like some awful adult.

00:19:00.742 --> 00:19:02.110 position:30% line:89% align:start
I want answers.

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:04.344 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why are you here
of all places?

00:19:04.846 --> 00:19:07.115 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
She looks a lot like mama.

00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:09.249 position:21% line:89% align:start
But it can't be her.

00:19:10.518 --> 00:19:13.387 position:30% line:83% align:start
Stigma uses the
darkness in people's hearts.

00:19:14.287 --> 00:19:17.825 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sure he's just trying to
take advantage of my weakness.

00:19:20.528 --> 00:19:23.163 position:24% line:83% align:start
This has got to be
some kind of trick.

00:19:23.965 --> 00:19:25.733 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why am I here, you say?

00:19:25.867 --> 00:19:28.803 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, it's funny.

00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:30.270 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't have a single memory

00:19:30.404 --> 00:19:32.540 position:27% line:83% align:start
before I woke up
at the North Pole.

[crashing]

00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:35.710 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, I wonder why myself.

00:19:36.443 --> 00:19:37.979 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's something about you.

00:19:38.112 --> 00:19:41.916 position:13% line:83% align:start
Something about this place
that stirs my memories a bit.

00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:44.519 position:7% line:89% align:start
Perhaps you were the one person

00:19:44.652 --> 00:19:46.888 position:33% line:83% align:start
I cared about
more than anything.

00:19:47.287 --> 00:19:50.758 position:35% line:83% align:start
Or perhaps
the person I hated the most.

00:19:51.025 --> 00:19:52.225 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's enough of that.

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:53.761 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just who are you anyway?

00:19:54.095 --> 00:19:56.731 position:10% line:83% align:start
And why are you the spitting
image of my mama?

00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:58.766 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh. Huh?

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:00.902 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wonder if that's the reason

00:20:01.035 --> 00:20:04.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
why Pesha rolls off
the tongue so easily.

Cut the crap with the lies
and cheap imitations.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.682 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're going to piss me off!

00:20:14.882 --> 00:20:16.249 position:33% line:89% align:start
How bizarre!

00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:18.853 position:27% line:83% align:start
For some reason,
when I'm looking at you,

00:20:19.187 --> 00:20:21.254 position:13% line:89% align:start
my heart feels alive again.

00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:22.990 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SPIRIT]
To be frank,

00:20:23.124 --> 00:20:25.459 position:35% line:83% align:start
my emotions
are as hazy as my memories.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.262 position:21% line:83% align:start
But Stigma's ideology
has earned my approval.

00:20:29.964 --> 00:20:31.264 position:35% line:89% align:start
This world,

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:33.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
it cost me nothing
but pain and suffering.

00:20:34.035 --> 00:20:35.837 position:27% line:89% align:start
My cold reality.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.006 position:19% line:83% align:start
I believe I hated it to
the core of my being.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.043 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TZVETA]
But not this place.

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:44.344 position:10% line:89% align:start
I felt warm when I was here.

00:20:44.712 --> 00:20:47.515 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wish I could spend
eternity in these walls.

00:20:47.782 --> 00:20:50.484 position:30% line:83% align:start
As I enter this
nostalgic landscape.

00:20:50.618 --> 00:20:54.387 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can feel the gentle
winds of home embrace me.

00:20:56.023 --> 00:20:58.593 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's better than I could ever
imagine it feeling.

00:20:58.726 --> 00:21:00.561 position:16% line:89% align:start
I knew my place was here.

00:21:00.695 --> 00:21:02.496 position:7% line:89% align:start
What do you mean "your place?"

00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:04.799 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's like he said,

00:21:05.233 --> 00:21:06.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
within every person's heart,

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:08.603 position:30% line:83% align:start
there's a place
made for you alone.

00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:11.873 position:13% line:83% align:start
A place to separate reality
from your dreams.

Kufufu!

Somewhere the never ending

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.179 position:21% line:83% align:start
torment of existence
cannot reach you.

-No.

00:21:28.556 --> 00:21:30.658 position:7% line:89% align:start
A name you've all heard before.

no more.

From now on,

we'll live our life here.
