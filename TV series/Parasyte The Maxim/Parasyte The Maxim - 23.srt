1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,950
<i>Out here in the trees,</i>

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,692
<i>I don't think I can pinpoint
Goto by the sound of his breath.</i>

3
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,617
<i>I have no chance of defeating him,</i>

4
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:14,710
<i>but I feel no fear.</i>

5
00:00:15,523 --> 00:00:16,627
I'm numb to it all.

6
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:20,169
<i>The will to live, anger, grief...</i>

7
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:23,239
<i>I don't feel any of those emotions right now.</i>

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:25,820
And yet,

9
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:27,881
<i>it's like I'm being driven.</i>

10
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:30,761
<i>I'm being pulled straight to him.</i>

11
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:33,845
<i>It isn't... it isn't courage,</i>

12
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:38,383
<i>and it's not some sense of duty to
fight as a 'hero' of the human race.</i>

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,044
<i>It's just that, if I do nothing,</i>

14
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:45,786
<i>then I will be forced to witness more deaths
at the hands of the monster that followed me here.</i>

15
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:51,302
<i>If anything, it's a miracle
I've survived this long as it is.</i>

16
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:54,390
<i>It's up to me to finish this.</i>

17
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:57,471
<i>Death could very well be waiting at the end,</i>

18
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:58,642
<i>but I don't care.</i>

19
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:00,403
<i>I'm just...</i>

20
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:02,767
<i>so tired of it.</i>

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,584
<i>It's like it's not even real anymore.</i>

22
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:09,305
<i>But for some reason, I feel...</i>

23
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:11,367
<i>positive.</i>

24
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,644
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

25
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:17,276
<i>I feel like this thing might
work out somehow if I just go.</i>

26
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:20,582
<i>Even though, I know what my chances are.</i>

27
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,381
<i>And they're not good.</i>

28
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,058
<i>It's strange...</i>

29
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,289
<i>My senses are honed and sharp.</i>

30
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:32,016
<i>Like they're heightened or something.</i>

31
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:35,131
<i>And then...</i>

32
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,146
<i>I found him.</i>

33
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:16,911
<i>He's sleeping.</i>

34
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,953
<i>I guess even they have to rest.</i>

35
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,323
<i>Migi slept a lot, too.</i>

36
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:30,652
<i>I guess I...</i>

37
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,463
<i>should've gone after him when he was asleep.</i>

38
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,824
<i>It's only because I'm not a parasite,</i>

39
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,294
<i>and that I'm no longer joined with Migi,</i>

40
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:41,116
<i>that I'm able to get this close to him.</i>

41
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:45,406
<i>Maybe this is why I've been feeling
like things are going to work out somehow.</i>

42
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,040
<i>Well, maybe there's another reason.</i>

43
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:52,754
<i>Migi...</i>

44
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,164
<i>Could you still be alive somewhere in his body?</i>

45
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:00,345
<i>If I called out to you right now,</i>

46
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:01,479
<i>would you answer me?</i>

47
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,587
<i>Migi!</i>

48
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:08,157
<i>I should've known it wouldn't be that easy.</i>

49
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:23,739
Dammit!

50
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,637
Where are you?

51
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:29,157
Show yourself!

52
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,406
Some lowly little human is daring to challenge me?

53
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,398
<i>That's right...</i>

54
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:44,306
<i>Yeah, I'm not afraid of you!</i>

55
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,617
<i>I know I can't win,</i>

56
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:49,280
<i>but at least I can do some damage.</i>

57
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,351
<i>I will make you suffer!</i>

58
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:55,598
<i>You have more speed and power,
but I have much keener senses.</i>

59
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,332
<i>I can fight you!</i>

60
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:01,293
<i>As long as I have a plan, I can fight you!</i>

61
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:03,342
<i>But what should I do?</i>

62
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:07,420
<i>How can I possibly find a way to
put a dent on something so strong?</i>

63
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,455
<i>Migi, please tell me what to do!</i>

64
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:13,987
You at least owe it to yourself to give some thought

65
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:16,755
to something else, anything else.

66
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,641
I'm just sayin', don't give up no matter what,

67
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,366
and remember that there's always an option.

68
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,288
<i>That's right, don't give up!</i>

69
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:25,341
<i>Think!</i>

70
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:30,891
<i>The back of his neck... Yes!</i>

71
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:32,986
<i>When he's controlling the entire body,</i>

72
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:34,615
<i>THAT should be his weak spot.</i>

73
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:37,123
<i>Even if I can't win, I can hurt him.</i>

74
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:39,522
<i>I must cut as deep as possible.</i>

75
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:59,250
<i>His most vital organs are located in his torso.</i>

76
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,441
<i>I won't know where the gaps in his
armor are if I strike from the side,</i>

77
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:05,015
<i>but from above...</i>

78
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:10,013
<i>There's a hole on the back of his neck that
leads to the esophagus and his internal organs.</i>

79
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:12,595
<i>If I put all my weight behind it...</i>

80
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:14,483
<i>Behind this...</i>

81
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:17,682
<i>The angle has to be just right.</i>

82
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:19,648
<i>Now!</i>

83
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,587
<i>The cleaver's still stuck in there?!</i>

84
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,633
<i>It's in the way!</i>

85
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,751
Silly boy, the last time we met, you
skittered away like a little cockroach.

86
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:41,744
It was a wise choice.

87
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,757
Why would you ever come back?

88
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:47,542
What can a helpless little creature like you hope to do?

89
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,337
I see you took off your disguise.

90
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:52,846
Now I can at least see you for the
disgusting monster that you really are!

91
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:56,822
It's not necessary for me to
pretend to be human right now.

92
00:06:57,322 --> 00:06:59,692
The air is clean, and refreshing.

93
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:02,378
It seemed the perfect place to revive,

94
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:04,493
but you have ruined the mood.

95
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:10,345
Now, of course, I always welcome a battle,
even if there's to be only one opponent.

96
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:14,854
Hey! Migi! Are you in there?!

97
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,849
Are you talking to your little friend?

98
00:07:17,874 --> 00:07:21,314
Unfortunately for you, he's no longer with us.

99
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,427
You son of a bitch! Damn you!

100
00:07:25,138 --> 00:07:28,406
How dare you kill Migi?! Ahh!

101
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,121
I don't understand your approach to fighting.

102
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:39,694
I mean, take this little trinket, for instance.

103
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:44,209
Humans fight each other using a variety of tactics.

104
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,938
But something like this against me is...

105
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:48,247
ridiculous.

106
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,223
<i>What is this place?!</i>

107
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:21,146
<i>It's the trash pile from the other day.</i>

108
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:25,127
<i>I'm really gonna die?</i>

109
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:26,259
<i>Here?</i>

110
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:28,282
<i>With the garbage?</i>

111
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:30,497
How disappointing.

112
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,745
I wouldn't even call this a fight.

113
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:37,679
A battle with my creator Reiko
Tamura would have been interesting,

114
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:41,147
but it's too late for that now, isn't it?

115
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:43,777
Would you know anything about that?

116
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:45,505
<i>Reiko Tamura?</i>

117
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:49,328
He's one of the most "frail" among us,

118
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:52,075
a being I created through experimentation.

119
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:54,042
But he's invincible.

120
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:55,389
<i>"Frail"?</i>

121
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:58,677
<i>How can he be "frail" if he's "invincible"?</i>

122
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:00,312
Well, no matter.

123
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:04,733
It's time for you to become one
with the refuse that surrounds you.

124
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:11,320
Give some thought to something else, anything else.

125
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:13,020
<i>There's no more time to think!</i>

126
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:16,185
I'm just sayin', don't give up no matter what,

127
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,750
and remember that there's always an option.

128
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,082
<i>I'm going to die.</i>

129
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:22,315
<i>Then again,</i>

130
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:24,807
<i>I should be dead already.</i>

131
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:27,675
<i>He let me go.</i>

132
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,397
But this fight must wait.

133
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:34,042
There are too many others,

134
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,782
and I'm feeling a bit tired today anyway.

135
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,070
We can make it.

136
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:44,759
<i>Blood...</i>

137
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:46,912
<i>That was blood!</i>

138
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:50,184
<i>Could that have been the gap in his armor?</i>

139
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,926
<i>Can I get through it with this?</i>

140
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:02,680
<i>Well, I guess it's all I got.</i>

141
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,906
<i>Can I even be fast enough?</i>

142
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,280
<i>As soon as I try to get up, he'll
just attack and rip me to shreds.</i>

143
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:13,466
<i>I'm not sure I have a chance.</i>

144
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:18,422
<i>But if I don't try something,</i>

145
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,719
<i>I KNOW how this'll end.</i>

146
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,155
<i>It went in!</i>

147
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:42,813
Goddamn human!

148
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:48,930
You are going to shriek in agony!

149
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:56,894
<i>He's here!</i>

150
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:58,987
<i>But this is all I got.</i>

151
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:01,087
<i>I can't run anymore.</i>

152
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:03,527
<i>I did some good though, right?</i>

153
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,903
<i>I may not have caused a whole lot of damage in the end,</i>

154
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:08,691
<i>but at least I was able to hurt him, slow him down.</i>

155
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:27,425
How did you know where to find the gap in my defenses?

156
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:30,987
I saw you get shot there before.

157
00:11:31,012 --> 00:11:32,116
I saw you bleed!

158
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:34,062
Are you serious?

159
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,837
Do you mean to tell me you risked everything on that?

160
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:40,532
Very well then, not bad.

161
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:46,421
But I cannot abide being injured by
a lowly, scrounging, unworthy species.

162
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,321
IT'S OVER!

163
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,436
<i>This is it.</i>

164
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:51,517
<i>This time it really is the end.</i>

165
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:57,262
Who is that?

166
00:11:57,874 --> 00:12:00,706
Miki? Stop resisting me!

167
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,123
Stay out of my way!

168
00:12:07,383 --> 00:12:08,202
<i>What are you doing?</i>

169
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:11,524
If you're gonna kill me, then hurry up and do it already.

170
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,644
<i>Just finish me and be done with it.</i>

171
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:20,276
<i>The strike will enter my right shoulder</i>

172
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,215
<i>and exit my left side.</i>

173
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,134
<i>I should die instantly.</i>

174
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:32,417
Migi!

175
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,053
Hey!

176
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:47,380
Migi!

177
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:51,821
What's happening!

178
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,583
Why do you defy me?

179
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:55,987
What are you doing you cowards?!

180
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:57,882
Shinichi...

181
00:12:58,443 --> 00:12:59,298
Migi!

182
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,233
That's quite a powerful struggle.

183
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:07,219
I'll kill you.

184
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:10,709
I'll kill both of you, right now!

185
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,290
No, you won't.

186
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:17,560
As it happens, I shredded several of your
vital organs when I was making my way back out.

187
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,590
You'll have to repair them before you can fight again.

188
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:26,915
So what do you think's happening to him?

189
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,088
It's a revolt.

190
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:33,877
The parasitic cells that don't belong to the leader
have instinctively sensed danger and are trying to escape.

191
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:39,217
He's now in the middle of a tremendous upheaval
between the "head" and all the other parasites.

192
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,411
But why? Why'd it start now?

193
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:43,466
It was you.

194
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,178
You were able to inject poisons deep into Goto's body.

195
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,058
Poison?

196
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,740
Silence!

197
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,495
You will pay for this.

198
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:57,248
I promise you that!

199
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,387
I'll tear you both apart!

200
00:13:59,446 --> 00:14:01,289
He is quite full of rage now.

201
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,729
Anger is an emotion I have not experienced,
because I never took control of a brain.

202
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,719
But the source of his anger

203
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:15,289
stems from his desire to devour the human species.

204
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:21,463
Those feelings grew and accumulated,

205
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:25,234
resulting in an insatiable appetite for war and bloodshed.

206
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:28,599
But his time has now come.

207
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:46,900
A single cut to the rope that was already pulled
taught was enough to make his entire body explode.

208
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:52,955
Up until the point the poisons were driven
into his body, he was still one complete organism.

209
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:58,550
The head held absolute control, allowing him
to put the other parasites to sleep at any moment

210
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,150
and take full command of them.

211
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:02,760
So were you one of his slaves, too, Migi?

212
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:06,537
To be honest, it actually felt quite nice.

213
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,887
It was as if, though asleep,

214
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,557
there was a constant flow of
information streaming through my mind.

215
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,732
It felt rather wonderful.

216
00:15:16,754 --> 00:15:21,794
I got the feeling I wouldn't mind remaining a
part of this invincible "Goto" life-form forever.

217
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,056
Well, I'm glad you're back.

218
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:26,975
You have no idea how sad I was
when I thought you were dead.

219
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:28,685
Interesting.

220
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:37,505
This is where you found the implement
you used against Goto, correct?

221
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:40,060
Yeah, but what's this "poison" you mentioned?

222
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:42,042
Hmm? Burnt waste...

223
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:47,706
I can't actually say for sure, but
it might've contained hydrogen cyanide

224
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:50,015
from the combustion of acrylic compounds.

225
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:52,132
I take it that's poisonous?

226
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,418
Lethally so.

227
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,845
And it's from some shady company.

228
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:57,324
They just dumped it all here!

229
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,163
Well, it did help you out, right?

230
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:05,702
It just goes to show you, humans are very unpredictable.

231
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:13,274
Shinichi, we must go back to our previous location.

232
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:17,280
This is surprising, but Goto is trying to revive himself.

233
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,992
He's doing what?!

234
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:26,217
Look! Being blown apart earlier
has expelled the toxins from his body.

235
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:29,929
The head is trying desperately
to reunite with the other elements.

236
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:33,832
But since they were scattered in such
small fragments, reaction time is slow.

237
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:36,910
Possibility of regeneration is around 50 percent.

238
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,916
And if he does somehow manage to pull it off?

239
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:41,426
It won't change anything.

240
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:46,565
He could be slightly less powerful, but as long
as he's alive, he will still have the same desire.

241
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,075
He'll come after us.

242
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:49,591
Then, we have to kill him.

243
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:50,704
That's correct.

244
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:54,804
Migi?

245
00:16:57,704 --> 00:16:58,584
Never mind.

246
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:02,319
From my perspective, he's one of my own.

247
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,880
In fact, one with whom I've even shared the same host.

248
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:07,842
And if I were to kill him,

249
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:10,717
it would amount to what you refer to as "murder."

250
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,587
So, I'll let you handle it.

251
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:17,910
If you use that cleaver to destroy
his exposed organs, he won't survive.

252
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,883
So, then you mean you want me to do it?

253
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:22,238
Do as you like.

254
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:25,190
If you don't want to do it, you could always run away.

255
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:27,026
But more people would die.

256
00:17:27,238 --> 00:17:28,978
And he'd just find me again anyway.

257
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,148
That's right.

258
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:33,976
In that case, there's nothing for me to think about.

259
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,532
Honestly, it's kind of pitiful, huh?

260
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,189
We're actually quite frail.

261
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:47,557
We're nothing more than a life-form
that isn't able to survive on its own.

262
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:49,094
So, please...

263
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:51,411
Don't be too hard on us.

264
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,819
<i>Yeah, well, that may be true.</i>

265
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,127
<i>But still...</i>

266
00:17:58,526 --> 00:17:59,998
<i>Why were they really born?</i>

267
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,009
<i>To kill humans, because there are now too many of us?</i>

268
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:07,002
<i>To decrease our numbers because we've polluted the Earth?</i>

269
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:08,839
<i>It's true...</i>

270
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,694
<i>The toxins we're producing are
driving other species to extinction.</i>

271
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,311
<i>And this is evidence of that.</i>

272
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,960
<i>Goto was so immensely powerful,</i>

273
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,723
<i>but not against what humanity's left behind.</i>

274
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:24,108
We are two halves of the same whole.

275
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,530
Parasites and humanity are of one family.

276
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,554
<i>So when it comes to the life of Earth,</i>

277
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:31,593
<i>are humans the poison</i>

278
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:33,479
<i>and the parasites the cure?</i>

279
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,454
<i>Who decides that?</i>

280
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:39,732
<i>Who decides the value of life on Earth?</i>

281
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:41,874
<i>What deserves to live?</i>

282
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:44,651
You must make your decision.

283
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:46,432
There's no time for delay.

284
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:48,721
<i>I don't wanna kill him;</i>

285
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:51,829
<i>To end a life that's so desperate to survive.</i>

286
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,030
<i>I mean, that's it, right?</i>

287
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:56,318
<i>I don't want to kill.</i>

288
00:18:57,191 --> 00:19:01,279
<i>And that sentiment to treasure
life is a lasting trait of humanity.</i>

289
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:02,708
What is it?

290
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,062
I can't do it.

291
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:11,288
You might find it strange given
all we've gone through to fight him,

292
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:14,047
but if his chances of survival are fifty-fifty...

293
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:16,788
I'd rather let fate decide than me.

294
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,631
He's not a human being; He's different.

295
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,059
So imposing my will on him is wrong.

296
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:27,507
I see.

297
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,874
If that's your decision, then it's fine by me.

298
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,005
Well, let's go.

299
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:39,335
<i>It's entirely possible that I could be
committing a grave mistake here as a human being,</i>

300
00:19:40,217 --> 00:19:42,732
<i>but I'm not sure it's my place to decide</i>

301
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:45,071
<i>that an organism has no right to live,</i>

302
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:46,630
<i>even if it's harmful.</i>

303
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:50,449
<i>Or even if it just doesn't benefit humanity.</i>

304
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:51,822
<i>It's not...</i>

305
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,701
<i>it's not my decision to make.</i>

306
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:56,412
Shinichi?

307
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:00,086
Do you believe the Earth to be beautiful?

308
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:02,309
I don't know.

309
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:07,815
I cannot understand those humans who proudly
proclaim that they're doing something "for the Earth."

310
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:13,251
After all, the Earth can neither
appreciate nor even accept such an action.

311
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:14,622
It feels nothing.

312
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:19,252
And the life it spawned was born
into a boiling pool of hydrogen sulfide.

313
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:24,442
<i>Okay, so I'll leave it to fate.</i>

314
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:26,839
<i>Right?</i>

315
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,265
<i>I'm nothing more than a lowly human being.</i>

316
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:38,033
<i>And all I can really do</i>
