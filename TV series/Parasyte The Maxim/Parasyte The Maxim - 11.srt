1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,186
I think I drank too much!

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,125
Well, I should probably get going.

3
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:10,502
Now, hold on!

4
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:13,188
What's the big rush, huh? Sit down.

5
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:16,596
Hey, y'know, you're a lot cuter than Shiro said.

6
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:17,864
You're embarrassing me.

7
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:20,644
Ha-ha, I mean it, seriously.

8
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:22,941
Have you heard about that hair thingy?

9
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:24,880
Hold still...

10
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:29,190
Sorry about that! I pulled out three by acci...

11
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:41,366
No...

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,996
This is awkward.

13
00:00:58,214 --> 00:01:00,103
It was the hair that gave me away.

14
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:01,689
I could use some help.

15
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:04,753
I don't normally eat meat containing alcohol.

16
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:12,485
I owe you... I owe you my life.

17
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:38,555
I can't believe he'd do something like that.

18
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:41,462
How do Shinichi and I seem similar to you?

19
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,867
I mean, whatever it is you think you're sensing,

20
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,350
it could be some kind of "wavelengths"
being broadcast by dangerous jerks like him.

21
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:52,934
Don't tell me Shinichi...

22
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:54,686
Huh?

23
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,520
Nobody likes being snuck up on.

24
00:05:08,593 --> 00:05:10,040
Oh, sorry!

25
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:15,556
Look, if you really want one of
my hairs, you can help yourself.

26
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,460
Oh, uh... Okay, thank you.

27
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:21,241
You happy now?

28
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:25,470
Oh...

29
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:33,383
Wait up!

30
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:39,798
Hey, I remember you warned me
before about hanging around Shimada.

31
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:43,701
Does that mean you already knew about
what he was capable of from the start?

32
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:45,502
No, I... I didn't.

33
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,198
I guess not.

34
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:50,168
I mean who would be friends with a mass murderer, right?

35
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,406
What's with the serious look?

36
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:55,806
She has a special gift.

37
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,735
Maybe I could go ahead and tell her everything.

38
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:03,082
No, I shouldn't, not while Migi's still awake.

39
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:06,023
Shinichi, I know what you're thinking.

40
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,414
But don't do it.

41
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:09,965
That female is no ally of mine.

42
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:12,266
Nor is she an ally of yours.

43
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:14,681
Your name is Kana, isn't it?

44
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:17,737
Huh? Yeah, yeah that's right!

45
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:25,503
You said that you have some strange
telepathic ability to sense my presence,

46
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:27,605
but even if you feel like I'm close by,

47
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,469
you should not try to approach me.

48
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:30,607
Why not?

49
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,336
Because you might run into something else instead.

50
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,896
What? Like a monster?

51
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,799
Yeah.

52
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:38,573
Now why would you say that?

53
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:41,377
I mean, you're a normal human being, aren't you, Shinichi?

54
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,765
Yeah, of course I'm a normal human.

55
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:47,694
Hmm... Well, if my senses do happen
to point me in the direction of someone,

56
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,539
I already know what it is I need to do.

57
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,607
I'll pluck out a hair to see if they're safe or not.

58
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,381
No, Kana! You cannot do that!

59
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,881
You okay?

60
00:06:57,132 --> 00:06:59,087
Ah, I'm sorry.

61
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,364
It's just really dangerous, you know.

62
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:03,668
Does that mean you're worried about me?

63
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,210
That makes me kinda happy.

64
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,711
Shinichi...

65
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:12,026
I need to talk to you.

66
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,513
Ah, I have to get going! I'm really sorry. See ya.

67
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:15,905
Huh?

68
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:22,429
Oh, hello there.

69
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:24,260
Um, hello.

70
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:28,441
Shinichi, I don't want you to speak to that person again.

71
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:29,798
I can't do that.

72
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,959
You know if I just walk away from her,
then eventually she's gonna get into trouble.

73
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:39,111
Perhaps, but I believe the way you talk to
her has revealed more than enough already.

74
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:40,571
I'll be careful.

75
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,172
I hope so.

76
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,232
I, um... I know it's strange to
ask you this out of the blue, but...

77
00:07:47,502 --> 00:07:48,465
Ask me what?

78
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,853
Do you... think that Shinichi's
been acting a little different lately?

79
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,306
I've actually only met him a few times.

80
00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:59,268
I'm not so sure if I would really be a fair judge.

81
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:02,813
I mean when you first met him versus right now.

82
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,402
Did you two have a fight?

83
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,615
You like him, right? I can kinda tell.

84
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:12,607
Look, he's just different somehow, okay?

85
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:14,947
Not so much when we're talking, but when...

86
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:16,775
Mm-hmm...

87
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,911
I... I mean, he did save my life!

88
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:25,290
He saved your life?! So you mean
you have dreams like that, too?

89
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:26,817
Huh? Dreams?

90
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:28,801
Ah! Uh...

91
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:31,599
I guess I just don't see it.

92
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,641
I get the feeling he's been this way all along, you know?

93
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:38,549
He's got this kind of intensity about him.

94
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,211
Well, if you don't stop acting so
mopey, then you're gonna lose him for sure.

95
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:53,378
Looks like I might still have a chance!

96
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:03,480
I'll be back in ten minutes.

97
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:05,735
Understood, but, uh...

98
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,432
Couldn't you have worn something
a bit more... normal looking?

99
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:11,018
It'll just get dirty.

100
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:18,725
What do you want?

101
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:20,245
How many are inside?

102
00:09:20,372 --> 00:09:22,818
Are you kidding me? You some kinda moron?

103
00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:24,440
Get outta here before you get hurt.

104
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:27,605
Ah, of course, you yakuza are quite aggressive.

105
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,382
Okay, Short Shorts,

106
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:34,192
all these new anti-gang laws are cute and all,

107
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:37,062
but it won't keep you from getting
your ass beat, you understand?!

108
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,787
Hey! Who the hell are you?!

109
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,141
We got company!

110
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,849
What's wrong? Let's go.

111
00:10:53,365 --> 00:10:54,087
That's one.

112
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,399
Damn you! You're a dead man!

113
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:07,788
Two...

114
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:13,422
Heh, gotcha.

115
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:14,494
That's it asshole.

116
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:16,753
That makes three.

117
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,545
What?!

118
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:18,357
Holy shit!

119
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:19,463
This guy's not dead?!

120
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,496
They managed three hits.

121
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:23,562
I guess that's about right.

122
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,200
What the hell?!

123
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:29,828
What's this all about, man?

124
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:31,525
It's an experiment.

125
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:36,589
We wanted to determine exactly how successful we
would be against a group heavily armed with weapons.

126
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:37,517
No, please!

127
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:40,218
My god what the hell happened over there?

128
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:43,008
That guy, his head got bashed in!

129
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,079
I'm pretty sure I heard some gunshots.

130
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:46,326
Yeah, me too!

131
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:55,518
Hey, he's getting away!

132
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:57,439
Hey, get back here!

133
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,087
What the...

134
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,281
Where'd he go? He was right in front of us.

135
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:08,439
Let's get outta here.

136
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:10,806
I don't want to get in the middle of some damn gang war.

137
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:11,951
Maybe you're right.

138
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:14,809
But don't you think we should at
least call the cops or somethin'?

139
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:17,287
Nah, I'm sure somebody already did.

140
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:34,081
What is it?

141
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:38,087
Nothing. It's just, you're quite different from before.

142
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:42,932
Mass murder at a gang headquarters...

143
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:47,363
It says 22 people were massacred,
every single yakuza member there.

144
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:48,377
That's crazy.

145
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:52,858
It's like it keeps getting
worse out there every single day.

146
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:54,055
Yeah...

147
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:55,570
Was that a parasite?

148
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,691
No, they wouldn't kill like
that unless they needed to feed.

149
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:07,549
The Metropolitan Police Department has
just held an emergency press conference.

150
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:11,064
They made the announcement that they will
soon be releasing security camera footage of

151
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,811
a male suspect fleeing the scene.

152
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,877
That may have been a bit much.

153
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,957
It was a very successful exercise. Very.

154
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:32,595
Shinichi, hey!

155
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,303
I'm glad you're here. Thanks for coming.

156
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:38,016
Um-hmm. Thank you for asking
me to come out today, kind sir.

157
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,486
What d'ya wanna do?

158
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:45,180
I dunno, wanna go watch a movie or something?

159
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:46,463
Sure!

160
00:13:58,648 --> 00:13:59,904
I don't know about you,

161
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,857
but I still have nightmares about that day sometimes.

162
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:06,895
Even after I know I'm awake, I
just can't stop myself from shaking.

163
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:09,664
Does that ever happen to you, Shinichi?

164
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:11,354
Yeah, sometimes.

165
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,886
But by the end of the morning, I'm usually okay.

166
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:16,376
You're lucky.

167
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:20,998
Unfortunately, my dreams are always so... disturbing

168
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:22,835
I can't get them out of my head.

169
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,804
Well, actually, a friend told me something one time.

170
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,088
He said it helps to think of people like cows and pigs.

171
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:36,842
When you look at it that way, you can kinda see
that people are eating chopped-up animals all the time,

172
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:39,797
So it's natural. There's really
nothing for you to be afraid of.

173
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,160
That's kinda strange...

174
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:45,476
What kind of person would say that?

175
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,877
Ah... Hmm...

176
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:49,128
No one like you've ever met.

177
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:51,998
Well, maybe it's because of this friend...

178
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,812
that you've changed so much.

179
00:14:53,837 --> 00:14:54,877
No, it's not that...

180
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,630
I don't think so.

181
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,321
Look, I'm sorry! I don't mean anything
bad, it's just you're different, that's all.

182
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,302
I never know which Shinichi's gonna show up.

183
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:09,195
It was that trip.

184
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,107
Ever since he got back, he hasn't been the same.

185
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:14,758
Um, Shinichi...

186
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:19,046
When your dad got hurt while on
vacation, and then, you went...

187
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:22,051
Let's get going.

188
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:27,370
I guess I shouldn't have asked him about it.

189
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,488
Oh, how cute!

190
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,088
Come here, little guy!

191
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:49,222
Is that your mama?

192
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:50,342
Must be.

193
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:52,374
Maybe they're strays.

194
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,451
Oh, I guess not. She has a collar.

195
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:00,240
Shinichi?

196
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:03,365
What a great day.

197
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:05,534
It's not even that cold out here.

198
00:16:05,969 --> 00:16:07,893
You sound just like an old man!

199
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:09,839
Old man? Aw, c'mon.

200
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,421
Mommy!

201
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,632
Hey, Mommy, come back!

202
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:17,216
Wait for me, Mommy!

203
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,218
Come on. Let's go.

204
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:22,369
Come on.

205
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:26,682
Mommy, you're stupid!

206
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:28,646
You're stupid!

207
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:29,761
Hey, now...

208
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:32,973
There's no need to get ugly.

209
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,937
I hate you!

210
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:36,221
I hate you! I hate you!

211
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:39,323
Excuse me? How can you say that to me?

212
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,988
I hope you die, Mommy!

213
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,423
Come on, let's go.

214
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:58,628
What's wrong?!

215
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:02,776
A hole... There's a hole!

216
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:04,344
A hole?

217
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:05,663
Uh, I, uh...

218
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,111
What's going on? Are you okay?

219
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:11,982
It was really hard to breathe all of a sudden.

220
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,963
Maybe I am old.

221
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:18,158
Oh, cut it out! Now you're just being pathetic, grandpa!

222
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:20,124
Okay...

223
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,704
Sometimes...

224
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,195
it's like my body is being torn apart.

225
00:17:26,415 --> 00:17:29,170
But then, the sensation just goes away.

226
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:34,561
That's when I feel like a part
of Migi really has merged with me.

227
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:39,358
But... I really do like Murano.

228
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,904
I care about her more than anything.

229
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:46,540
And there's one thing that I'm absolutely sure of:

230
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:48,000
That feeling...

231
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:50,430
it comes from MY heart.

232
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:52,250
When I'm with her,

233
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,436
it makes me wish Migi would just...

234
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:56,175
stay asleep.

235
00:17:57,396 --> 00:18:00,176
Stay asleep... forever.

236
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:22,150
I'll see ya.

237
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:35,028
You... you really are Shinichi Izumi, right?

238
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:44,326
If only we had...

239
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:48,152
If only we had gotten closer to each other sooner.

240
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:50,646
If that were the case...

241
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,897
I could truly believe without any doubt in my heart...

242
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:57,891
that you really are Shinichi.

243
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:04,242
I'm such an idiot.

244
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:06,199
I should've known from the beginning.

245
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:11,666
But!

246
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:23,265
Why are you making the effort to see her?

247
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,674
She said it's the last favor she'll ever ask.

248
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,184
So how could I ignore her?

249
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:29,204
I do not really understand that.

250
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,394
Guess I got here a bit too early.

251
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:40,002
One of my kind is nearby.

252
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:44,263
Wait, not just one of them, but three. No, five.

253
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:46,191
Well, are there three or are there five?!

254
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:47,165
They're over there.

255
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,717
We, each and every one of us,
must alter our way of thinking.

256
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:54,718
As it now stands, the topic of
global environmental conservation.

257
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:57,669
They've noticed us. But they still haven't made a move.

258
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,256
Y'know something, Migi?

259
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:02,396
You and I may be the weirdest crime-fighting duo ever.

260
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:03,383
Shinichi...

261
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,995
They're currently about sixty meters away.

262
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:07,382
Eight of them in total.

263
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:08,920
Two are down low...

264
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:10,803
And six are elevated...

265
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,281
Still no aggression.

266
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:17,187
Could you give up your vehicle to
prevent just an ounce of pollution?

267
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:20,999
Completely reversing the course of
our daily lives is next to impossible.

268
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:23,217
But if we choose to do nothing, our
entire planet is in eminent danger.

269
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:24,436
All six up there...

270
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,041
They're all parasites?

271
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:27,153
And the two below.

272
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,757
At this distance it would be
difficult for them to identify us,

273
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:32,708
but they might if we make eye contact.

274
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,490
A popular approach is to use scare
tactics to try to elicit results,

275
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,283
offering a terrifying glimpse into of a dismal
future, threatening that we're doomed to fail.

276
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:42,572
Did he see us?

277
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:44,652
No, no way, not with this crowd.

278
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:45,705
He saw us.

279
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:47,385
Your eyes met.

280
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:50,591
But they don't seem to be very
interested in us at this time.

281
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:54,053
Shinichi, now we've seen what's
going on, I say we get out of here.

282
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:54,624
Yeah...

283
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:58,646
A parasite running for mayor?

284
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,714
What the hell are they up to?

285
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:01,891
Hey, Shinichi!

286
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:04,192
What are you doing here?!

287
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:06,118
Uh, yeah, well...

288
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,534
I just so happen to live in this neighborhood.

289
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:10,974
And ya know, I'm the one who asked you here.

290
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:12,842
Oh, right, of course you did.

291
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,187
But it's right here, in front of you!

292
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:19,233
It's at the local level and
not with the national bureaucrats

293
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:20,783
that environmental issues can start to be addressed...

294
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:22,013
This is bad...

295
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:48,953
Next time: "Kokoro"
