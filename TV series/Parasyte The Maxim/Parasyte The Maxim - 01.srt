1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,966
Not long ago, someone on Earth had a passing thought...

2
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,082
I have failed...

3
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:05,389
This is unfortunate.

4
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:09,062
What? What's unfortunate?

5
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:10,287
Be quiet.

6
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:22,745
What a dream...

7
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:24,701
That was the worst night's sleep...

8
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,527
Did you find that "worm" of yours?

9
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:39,118
My hand feels kinda numb.

10
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,833
Well, probably because you wrapped
your headphone cord around it last night.

11
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:48,245
Can I... Can I just have toast.

12
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:51,435
No, sir! You need to eat a proper breakfast.

13
00:02:51,662 --> 00:02:54,930
Come on, gimme a break! I had a rough night.

14
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:57,511
That's because you stayed up too late.

15
00:02:58,362 --> 00:02:58,837
Hm?

16
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:03,883
Relax, it's just a spider.

17
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,950
Seriously, Shinichi,

18
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:08,510
when are you gonna get over this silly fear of bugs?

19
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,708
At the latest meeting of the OECD...

20
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:16,937
At... the... latest... meeting of the O-E-C-D...

21
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:19,385
Daddy! Where's Mommy?

22
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:21,455
I need something to eat.

23
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:24,115
Daddy! Where's Mommy?

24
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:27,180
I need something to eat.

25
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,757
Hi-yaa!

26
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:57,680
Murano?!

27
00:03:57,952 --> 00:04:00,057
Ah, don't act surprised.

28
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:01,430
What do you mean?

29
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:04,949
Come on, you obviously knew I was sneaking up behind you.

30
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,579
Ah, no, I didn't!

31
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:08,046
Huh?

32
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:10,995
Uh...

33
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:19,280
Oh my God, oh crap!

34
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:20,325
I'm so sorry!

35
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:21,632
I didn't mean to, I swear.

36
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:22,608
I mean I...

37
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:26,182
Real nice, Shinichi. Real nice!

38
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:28,664
What the heck were you thinking?

39
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:30,288
Yuko...

40
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,372
I don't know what's wrong with me.

41
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,928
Ah man, I am off today...

42
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:40,230
S'there a problem with your hand?

43
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:42,573
Uh... no.

44
00:04:43,294 --> 00:04:44,132
It's fine.

45
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:25,695
What the...?!

46
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:41,018
What the hell is going on?!

47
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:46,980
Shinichi!

48
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,506
Is everything alright?!

49
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:50,520
Help me!

50
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:54,105
What the hell is going on in here?

51
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,489
What are you doing to your arm?

52
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:57,360
There's... There's something in it!

53
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:58,681
A worm or something!

54
00:05:58,706 --> 00:05:59,285
A what?!

55
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,690
A worm?

56
00:06:01,057 --> 00:06:04,218
Ah, you've gotta be kidding me.

57
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:06,462
I'm telling you the truth!

58
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:08,816
It's like it burrowed a hole right into my arm!

59
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:09,674
Uh-huh...

60
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:12,849
Okay, son, let's have a look at it then.

61
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:15,550
Look! It's right... Huh?

62
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:19,531
Okay, son, please don't tell me that you are on drugs.

63
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:21,395
No, no, I'm not! I swear!

64
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:23,959
Honestly, sweetie, don't scare us like that.

65
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:27,211
That's weird...

66
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,044
Doesn't even hurt or anything.

67
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,528
It felt so real.

68
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,095
I couldn't have just imagined the whole thing, right?

69
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,608
Shinichi!

70
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:38,248
Hm?

71
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,598
Hmm...

72
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:40,503
Uh... ah...

73
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:41,442
Hmm?

74
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:42,059
Huh?

75
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:45,119
My lecture not riveting enough for ya?

76
00:06:45,144 --> 00:06:49,186
I think you're aware that the use of cell
phones is not permitted during class hours.

77
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,750
I thought I turned it off, and... and I...

78
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:53,143
Yes?

79
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,236
Sorry, sir.

80
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:01,284
Huh?

81
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:04,084
Uh, Murano, about this morning...

82
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:08,122
Looks like she's still pretty pissed off.

83
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:14,041
Okay, look, because you're my friend and I'm such
a wonderful person, I'll go and apologize for you.

84
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:15,818
Really? Thanks, Yuko.

85
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:17,973
But first you have to tell me if you're okay.

86
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:20,795
Because well... you don't look so good.

87
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:22,583
Yeah...

88
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:24,705
I don't really feel so good either.

89
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:27,999
I think I'm gonna ask the teacher if maybe I can go home.

90
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:38,605
There's no way my hand could
just move on its own could it?

91
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:42,559
I mean, after that thing from last
night, I don't know what to think.

92
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,726
Oh, my God, thank goodness you're okay!

93
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:21,905
Is that Shinichi?

94
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,662
Well, he's home early.

95
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,335
I don't know how the hell you got in there...

96
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,848
but you're coming out!

97
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:58,108
How very unfortunate.

98
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:05,265
I... right hand... failure.

99
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,319
F-failure?

100
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,786
What did you do to my hand?

101
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:13,725
I have... I have eaten it. Gone.

102
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:28,118
I am, uh... new to talking your language.

103
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,599
You must teach me, Shinichi.

104
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,843
Just what are you?

105
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:41,316
So tired. I sleep now.

106
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:45,213
Huh?! Wait a minute! You've got
to answer some questions first!

107
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:46,935
Hey! Come on, wake up!

108
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:50,396
Shinichi? Is everything all right?

109
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:53,168
Hello? Shinichi?

110
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,979
No! Don't come in!

111
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:56,643
I'm fine...

112
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,183
Everything's fine!

113
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:23,914
Awww...

114
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:28,320
How can I even search for something like this?

115
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:32,381
I mean who ever heard of something
like this ever happening to anyone before?

116
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,515
Shinichi! Dinner's ready!

117
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:39,356
I got a call from the school today.

118
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:41,283
They said you left early.

119
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,966
Oh yeah? Something happen?

120
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:45,818
Nothing much.

121
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:47,583
Just felt a little sick, that's all.

122
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,333
Anything serious?

123
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:50,195
Nah.

124
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:52,018
Oh? You want seconds?

125
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:53,392
You must feel better.

126
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:58,621
So you don't feel well, but
you still have an appetite, huh?

127
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:00,113
Well, I'm feeling better now.

128
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:02,112
What's the big deal?

129
00:11:07,638 --> 00:11:09,723
I can't tell Mom and Dad about this...

130
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:10,994
They'll think I'm crazy.

131
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:14,994
I love you, love yooou!

132
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,576
Ah, face.

133
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, God...

134
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,238
Ha! Too many drinky drinks!

135
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,424
Huh?

136
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:37,301
Nakamura! You left your laundry outside in the rai...

137
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:43,204
Actually...

138
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,868
I can't tell anyone about this.

139
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:50,027
If I went to the police, they'd probably
put me away for the rest of my life.

140
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:53,781
And if I went to a doctor, I'd
just end up being their freakshow.

141
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:55,709
Then everyone would know.

142
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:58,378
I don't know what to do.

143
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,159
Hey.

144
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:01,615
Wake up.

145
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,927
Is it morning?

146
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:15,565
Yes, it is...

147
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:20,597
It's morning and I'm awake!

148
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,264
I'm still having a nightmare.

149
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:35,021
What are you doing?

150
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:38,313
As you can see.

151
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:39,766
I'm studying.

152
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,842
I see you can speak pretty well now.

153
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:45,708
So, what are you?

154
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:47,840
Are you an alien or something?

155
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:49,738
An alien?

156
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:51,284
What's an alien?

157
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:55,254
Is that wormy thing what you're
really supposed to look like?

158
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:04,438
I can't help but notice that none of your
biology texts seem to have anything about me.

159
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:07,533
Did you come from outer space?
Some distant planet somewhere?

160
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:11,214
I don't have any idea where I came from.

161
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:13,621
My earliest memory is with you.

162
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:17,510
Feeling disappointed, I was
unable to... occupy your brain.

163
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:20,135
My brain?! Are you kidding me?

164
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:22,830
Wait! You're not gonna go after my brain next are you?

165
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,048
If that were possible, I would've
done so already. But sadly, it's not.

166
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:30,283
Since I've already matured without
eating your brain, it's too late.

167
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:31,904
Most unfortunate.

168
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:35,135
Well, what would have happened if
you had succeeded? In eating my brain?

169
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:40,487
You'd probably still look pretty much the same as you do
now, but your head would be able to do things like this.

170
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,180
That's so gross!

171
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:44,798
So why, exactly, is this happening to me?

172
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,823
Pure chance.

173
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,062
You were not chosen for this specifically.

174
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,340
Guess I really should go to a hospital.

175
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,131
Whether I'm a freakshow or not.

176
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:55,897
A hospital? Why?

177
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,346
So they can cut you off, of course.

178
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,773
That would be undesirable.

179
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:03,669
I rely on the nutrients that are
present in your bloodstream for survival.

180
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:07,457
If I were to be removed, then I
would most assuredly shrivel up and die.

181
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:11,473
And on top of that, Shinichi, you would
end up losing your right hand in the process.

182
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:13,252
Unfortunate for both of us.

183
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,331
Look! You're the one who just took over my arm
without asking. So you don't really have a say here.

184
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,084
Hmm...

185
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:22,683
How about this?

186
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,890
I can re-connect the circuitry in your arm

187
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:28,284
so that while I'm asleep you'll be able
to control your hand just like before.

188
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:29,302
Huh?

189
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:30,976
That'll work, won't it?

190
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:34,835
The two of us are gonna have to
learn to cooperate and coexist.

191
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:36,479
It's really our only option.

192
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:37,153
Huh?

193
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:40,262
You don't get to decide any of this!

194
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,186
I'm tired. I sleep now.

195
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:45,467
Wait a minute! Hey, you're just doing
that to get out of this discussion!

196
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:47,396
Use me with care...

197
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:57,701
So I guess I'm supposed to clean up this mess.

198
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,311
Don't I get any bacon and eggs?

199
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:06,576
You said you didn't want any yesterday.

200
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:09,643
I thought you told me that I
needed to eat a proper breakfast.

201
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,451
And I'd like more toast too, please.

202
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:14,405
I sure do wish you'd make up your mind.

203
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,238
Look at that, there've been even more of these attacks.

204
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:18,318
Another murder?

205
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:19,381
Uh-huh.

206
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:23,098
A mother and her daughter were killed just last night.

207
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:28,730
Their bodies were found "savagely mutilated", and now
it looks like the father has disappeared without a trace.

208
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:34,043
Somebody else was decapitated, and there was
another hacked up and hung out like the laundry!

209
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:36,050
Can we not talk about that right now?

210
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,737
Oh... yeah.

211
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:39,709
Uh...

212
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,057
Hey, Shinichi, check it out.

213
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,585
You're okay with them now?

214
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,052
Huh? What do you mean?

215
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,659
Well, that was a bug!

216
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,577
Is this a different route from yesterday?

217
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,644
Oh, so you're awake.

218
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:14,686
Where is it you're going?

219
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:17,758
I decided to go talk to the police.

220
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:19,057
Oh, don't do that.

221
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:23,891
You know they'll just take you and turn you into
their lab rat and run all sorts of experiments on you.

222
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,735
Your life will never be the same again.

223
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:28,454
Okay, well then, what do YOU suggest?

224
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,974
I told you this morning.

225
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:32,702
Cooperation and mutual coexistence is...

226
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,266
Stop!

227
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,395
Keep your voice down.

228
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,057
I sense one of my own.

229
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:43,273
Yes, one of my species. I feel him.

230
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:44,484
There's more of you?!

231
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,327
Wait, how do you know it's there?

232
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:47,567
I just feel it...

233
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,222
Something like brainwaves.

234
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,408
It's my first time sensing it, but I
can tell: It's definitely out there.

235
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:55,183
About 200 meters.

236
00:16:55,443 --> 00:16:58,662
You mean to tell me, someone else out
there has gone through the same thing I have?

237
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,710
Right, go right!

238
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,383
Shinichi...

239
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:09,848
Hmm? 'Kay.

240
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:16,141
At the next intersection, turn left.

241
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:20,282
It would seem that they have sensed me, too.

242
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,665
What is it? Keep moving.

243
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:31,655
So, if it's one of your species or whatever,
then could it be someone whose brain was eaten?

244
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,931
It's possible.

245
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,684
Then no way! That's too screwed up!

246
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:46,021
I would like to find out exactly
what sort of being I actually am.

247
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:49,375
That sort of information would
be quite valuable to you as well.

248
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:52,546
Uh... okay okay.

249
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:57,351
Another twenty meters. Around that corner.

250
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,475
It seems to be eating.

251
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:00,901
Huh?

252
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:12,918
It's a dog, and it's eating another dog?

253
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:22,737
So I see... you failed too.

254
00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:25,254
Please... please don't talk, Mr. Doggy.

255
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,377
Your host is not... optimal.

256
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:38,003
I... also... am dissatisfied... with... this host...

257
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:39,408
Run!

258
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:41,858
Run! Hurry!

259
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:46,505
Where are we going?!

260
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:49,600
You told me to take you there,
now you're telling me to run away!

261
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,821
I sense its murderous intent. You're
still human. It harbors suspicion of you.

262
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,278
It wants to fight.

263
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:05,800
We'll do it here.

264
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:08,101
What?! You wanna fight that thing?!

265
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:13,555
There's no choice.

266
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:15,439
If it kills you, I will die as well.

267
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,090
We're in this together.

268
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:18,230
Here it comes.

269
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:21,129
What the hell? You gotta be kidding me!

270
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,943
This cannot be happening!

271
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:38,325
Is that... its heart?

272
00:19:42,552 --> 00:19:44,485
It will die without it. Look!

273
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:49,069
Just like me, it's dependent on its body's
digestive system and other vital organs.

274
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,481
So I guess there really are more of you out there.

275
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:58,950
Yes, but this one's core was the head.

276
00:19:59,457 --> 00:20:02,338
It controlled the host by manipulating the nervous system,

277
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:05,580
but it made a crucial mistake when
it altered its body to grow wings.

278
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:09,216
That caused its core to alter, and its
focus to disperse, creating an opening.

279
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:12,421
But it... it was still one of your own kind though.

280
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,538
It's because of the canine.

281
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,283
Maturation and environment were factors,

282
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:18,792
but it was lax with its studies.

283
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,711
Research is the reason I won.

284
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,864
It's like I'm talking to an insect.

285
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:27,677
Doesn't have a shred of sympathy.

286
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:34,725
Shinichi, that's cold.

287
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:42,398
Not long ago, someone on Earth had a passing thought...

288
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,048
"All life is sacred and must therefore be protected."

289
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,477
Next time: "The Devil in the Flesh"
