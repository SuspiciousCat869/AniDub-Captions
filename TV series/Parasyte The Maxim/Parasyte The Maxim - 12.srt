1
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,140
Oh!

2
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:22,131
<i>Again... The same dream...</i>

3
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:55,960
We have seen several types at this point...

4
00:01:56,107 --> 00:02:00,177
Ryoko Tamiya the teacher was certainly a
surprise, but now there's a politician...

5
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:04,378
He won't be able to get elected without
having a solid grasp of human psychology.

6
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:06,486
There's no way he'll ever get elected...

7
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:09,186
He's gonna have to show his true colors soon enough.

8
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:12,274
Although, given which town this guy's in...

9
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:16,596
It's possible that Ryoko Tamiya is
somehow involved in all this. Possibly...

10
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,333
<i>He seems to be very interested in this.</i>

11
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:22,666
So... I guess you think he's after something.

12
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:24,247
Yes. I do.

13
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:29,080
The first possibility is that by assuming
a human identity and studying mankind,

14
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:31,755
he has developed a real interest in politics.

15
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,756
In which case, he would actually make an excellent mayor.

16
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,497
That's ridiculous.

17
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,670
But there is also a second possibility.

18
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:41,777
He wants to secure safe haven
and a food source for others.

19
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,440
Good point, but even if they hide the bodies after
feeding on them, people are still gonna turn up missing.

20
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,486
And let's say they killed somebody
who was famous or something...

21
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,142
they'd get exposed for sure.

22
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:57,576
Being in a position offering both access and control
of such information while securing food would be ideal.

23
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:59,376
So that's his goal then?

24
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:04,014
<i>If they organize this way, they'll
become more and more dangerous.</i>

25
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:06,173
<i>And that'd put HER at risk, too.</i>

26
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,703
But it's right here, in front of you...

27
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,594
Come on, let's go over there.

28
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:11,393
Huh?

29
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:16,599
That's not where we agreed to meet, so...

30
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:18,081
what's going on?

31
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:20,798
Oh, y'know I just had this feeling that you were there.

32
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:23,906
I thought I told you to stay
away, even if that happened again.

33
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,720
Yeah, but it was much more than just you.

34
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:29,522
I could sense it in the crowd that had gathered there...

35
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,927
I'd say, there were about four or five of them.

36
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,998
<i>Migi said that he could sense eight of them,</i>

37
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:40,379
<i>so I guess the parasites can sense
their own kind better than she can.</i>

38
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:44,882
<i>Either way, this makes things way too risky for her.</i>

39
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,127
Shinichi.

40
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:49,927
What are you thinking about?

41
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:51,927
Uh... it's nothing alright!

42
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,665
Look, I can still think about whatever I want.

43
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,982
Well, I felt concerned for some reason.

44
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,146
Hmm...

45
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:09,177
Personally, I'd prefer that you not
get involved further in this situation.

46
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,462
Even if we fought them, we wouldn't win.

47
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:15,004
Oh look. It's not like I came here to fight.

48
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:18,172
I just want to see if I can
find out how many of them are here.

49
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:21,531
It's impossible to calculate their numbers.

50
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,441
Even a guess will be fine...

51
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:28,562
Honestly... Don't you want to know
how the others of your kind have evolved?

52
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:29,551
I suppose.

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,565
Well?

54
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,453
They don't show up just because you go looking for them...

55
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:37,993
Uhh...

56
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,464
Ah! You're here!

57
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:43,684
Hey there.

58
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:45,038
What's up?

59
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:48,199
There's something kind of
important I wanted to ask you about.

60
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:49,373
Oh yeah?

61
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,910
About your special "ability"...

62
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:56,560
Have you ever gotten that
feeling from anyone other than me?

63
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:59,610
Huh? Well. Yeah...

64
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,394
But not really that often.

65
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:03,063
And when I do see them,

66
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:06,301
they turn out to be normal, some random guy or whatever.

67
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,548
Look for your own good...

68
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:12,595
you should really stay away from anyone
you feel transmitting that "signal."

69
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,735
But why, what's wrong with them?

70
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,007
Are they those parasite things
that everybody's been talking about?

71
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:21,432
Wait a second, are you one of these parasites, too?

72
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:23,169
That's not what I mean...

73
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,135
Kana.

74
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:24,713
Hm?

75
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,687
Mitsuo?

76
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:27,095
I need to talk to you, okay.

77
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,985
Right. I'll see ya.

78
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,345
Uh... Hey, hold on.

79
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:35,408
We'll talk soon...

80
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:37,360
There's something else we need to talk about, too.

81
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:38,535
And what's that, huh?!

82
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:39,724
I'll text you.

83
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,901
You don't have to text me...

84
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,583
I'll be able to feel it when you're nearby.

85
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:44,803
You'll "feel it"?

86
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:48,190
Kana, sometimes what you feel is someone else.

87
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,792
"Sometimes what you feel is someone else"?

88
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,674
Kana, what the hell's going on?

89
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,995
Mitsuo! This has nothing to do with you!

90
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:56,522
Uhh...

91
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:03,920
Shinichi. What is it that you
needed to talk about with that female?

92
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:10,136
Tell me the truth, was speaking to her your
actual objective in going on today's outing?

93
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,146
So what if it was?

94
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:15,333
As you have surmised...

95
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,718
my species has indeed evolved over time...

96
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:21,690
But still, we are not capable
of developing true human emotions.

97
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,240
We don't know "sympathy."

98
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:23,978
I know.

99
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:28,215
So I'm asking you not to take any action
that would potentially put me at risk...

100
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,488
If you were to reveal too much to her, then I...

101
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:31,774
I get it okay.

102
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:34,089
I'm not so sure you do Shinichi.

103
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:39,662
I can only assume that you would not want your right
hand to suddenly slice someone to shreds, would you?

104
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,606
So... You're threatening me?

105
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:43,539
Yes.

106
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,654
You literally have no sympathy at all, do you?!

107
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:49,586
I believe that's what I just said.

108
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:54,936
<i>I wonder what he wants to tell me...</i>

109
00:06:58,921 --> 00:06:59,561
Again.

110
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:01,845
And it's so close.

111
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:06,026
<i>I don't think it's him,</i>

112
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:08,394
<i>but I guess it's possible.</i>

113
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:10,682
<i>Over there...</i>

114
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,436
<i>around the corner.</i>

115
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:16,922
<i>Huh?</i>

116
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:22,838
<i>Uhh... Ahh...</i>

117
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:26,054
That's not him.

118
00:07:30,154 --> 00:07:32,122
Ah! Shinichi.

119
00:07:34,506 --> 00:07:35,200
In here?

120
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:39,396
You did say in your text that a
place with no one around would be best.

121
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:44,958
Huh?!

122
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:46,898
Ugh-ow, jeez!

123
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,089
Okay, he's asleep.

124
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,285
Huh?

125
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,673
<i>And then... I told Kana everything I knew...</i>

126
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:56,884
<i>everything about the parasites.</i>

127
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:02,061
but the one that bonded with me messed
up while trying to take over my brain,

128
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,920
so it took over my hand instead.

129
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,364
And he won't attack anyone anymore.

130
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,965
So you understand, right?

131
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:11,103
Hmm...

132
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,283
I guess I was hoping for something more interesting.

133
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,183
You kinda got my hopes up.

134
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:19,356
Kana, I can't expect you to believe all of this,

135
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:22,247
but everything I told you is the truth.

136
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:25,068
Well if that's the case, then
why don't you show me some proof?

137
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:28,209
Go ahead. Lemme see your hand turn into some monster.

138
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:30,620
I told you, he's sleeping right now.

139
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,298
Why don't you just come out and say it?

140
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,720
You don't want to see me anymore
because you don't want that girl,

141
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,019
Murano or whatever, to see you with me.

142
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:40,702
Are you kidding?

143
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:44,245
I wouldn't spin some elaborate
lie for some bullcrap like that.

144
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:46,615
Some "bullcrap"?

145
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:50,905
Seriously, if you hate me so much,
why don't you just come out and say it?

146
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,860
Kana... You've got this all wrong.

147
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,036
Hm... You know what...

148
00:08:57,407 --> 00:09:01,073
The thing that I feel is different
for you than it is for the rest of them.

149
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,728
Huh? Really?

150
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:03,755
Uh-huh...

151
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,750
There's a very distinct difference between them...

152
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:10,017
I can tell if it's you or if
it's one of those weird monsters.

153
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,485
You really can?

154
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:15,140
So I won't go near anyone with
a "signal" that's not yours...

155
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:17,081
That should solve it, right?

156
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:20,491
Uh... Hm... I guess so.

157
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:22,679
Okay, now as far as I can tell...

158
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:24,939
I'm the only one in the world who can do this...

159
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:28,471
You must admit, that's pretty amazing stuff isn't it?

160
00:09:29,425 --> 00:09:31,677
Yeah, you've got something special.

161
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,082
So. Since I've told you about my secret...

162
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,991
You're gonna have to show me your secret someday, too.

163
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:39,144
What secret?

164
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,398
Um your right hand...

165
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:45,802
Otherwise, how can I ever really
be able to believe your story.

166
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:47,739
Fair enough.

167
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:48,838
It's a promise, then.

168
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:51,989
Yeah, I promise.

169
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:52,950
Mm...

170
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:56,123
Well. He won.

171
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,175
That means the parasites have now secured
a refuge as well as a stable food supply.

172
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:04,183
<i>They're as intelligent as humans...</i>

173
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:06,842
<i>and they'll do anything to protect themselves.</i>

174
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:11,923
<i>She said she's able to tell
me apart from the rest of them,</i>

175
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:14,500
<i>but I'm not sure that adds up.</i>

176
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:20,241
Oh really?

177
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:21,492
Yeah.

178
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:24,037
It's supposed to be a really great movie.

179
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,719
Oh...

180
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:31,402
Yuko and Akiho said they cried their eyes out...
so I have to see it while it's still in theaters...

181
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:34,312
Okay. So, tomorrow at ten o'clock then?

182
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:35,060
Sure!

183
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:39,195
<i>Why don't you notice me?</i>

184
00:10:39,564 --> 00:10:41,477
<i>We're joined... by fate.</i>

185
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,276
<i>I'm the only one who can sense you.</i>

186
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,512
<i>SHE doesn't feel you like I do...</i>

187
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,378
<i>Look over here.</i>

188
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:55,202
<i>Feel me.</i>

189
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,898
<i>Please...</i>

190
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:17,193
Mitsuo!

191
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,401
Don't scare me like that.

192
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:21,138
What're you doing?

193
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,368
What's it matter to you?

194
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:26,259
This isn't like you...

195
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:28,491
It's like you're a stalker.

196
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:32,825
The way you're sneaking around and following
me, that would be you... You're the stalker.

197
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:35,412
Can't you see he already has a girlfriend?

198
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,637
That guy's not right for you, Kana... You know that.

199
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:40,863
Oh, yeah? And you're saying that you are?!

200
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:42,570
I have had enough of this!

201
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:45,095
Always following me around like a little puppy dog...

202
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:47,226
Please, you need to get out of my life!

203
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,767
Uhh... Mm...

204
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:54,947
I don't know what to say...

205
00:11:55,806 --> 00:11:57,522
I can't believe you hate me that much...

206
00:11:58,764 --> 00:11:59,463
Mitsuo...

207
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:01,815
I'm sorry...

208
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:04,383
But, I just can't do this!

209
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:06,902
You need to give me some space.

210
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:14,115
I've decided to tell you something.

211
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:15,335
Huh?

212
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,497
It'd be foolish for me to make an enemy out of you...

213
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:22,893
But then again, I certainly don't want you
doing something rash while I'm asleep, either.

214
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:23,653
Huh?

215
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,976
It's about that female, Kana.

216
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:28,236
Her power has grown stronger,

217
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,795
and she has now begun to emit her own signal.

218
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,615
Signal?

219
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,859
It's the signal parasites send out
that allows us to sense one another.

220
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:40,109
I became aware of hers while we were
on our way home from school yesterday.

221
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:41,989
What? No way!

222
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:44,748
<i>If she sends out a signal...</i>

223
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,412
<i>then those things will be able to find her...</i>

224
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,538
<i>She'll get herself killed!</i>

225
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:55,765
Most likely, she can only send her
signal when she has full concentration,

226
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,376
however, her transmission range is quite limited.

227
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:00,213
Why didn't you tell me this before?!

228
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:05,680
No... Thank you for telling me now.

229
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:10,503
Migi... The other day...

230
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:16,354
While you were asleep, I told Kana everything I
knew about the parasites, and I told her about you, too.

231
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:18,816
But don't worry she didn't believe me.

232
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:20,991
I thought as much.

233
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:24,301
Look, I know she wouldn't turn against you. And so...

234
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:26,778
I was hoping...

235
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:30,008
that maybe you would agree to show yourself to her.

236
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:31,936
I mean, it'll be fine!

237
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,459
Besides, if she does ever tell anyone else,

238
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:36,270
I can always bluff my way out of it.

239
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,593
As long as you kept on pretending to be my right hand...

240
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:42,265
she'd just sound like a crazy person talking nonsense.

241
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:43,859
Well?

242
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:47,341
All right.

243
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,480
Okay, I'll give her a call then.

244
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:53,099
We'll meet her tomorrow...

245
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:56,347
Ah! I have a date with Murano.

246
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:58,471
Mm...

247
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:10,062
Ah...

248
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,115
Mmm...

249
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:21,215
I guess we're a little early.

250
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,979
Hey. You remember, right?

251
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:25,935
What you promised yesterday.

252
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,689
Yes.

253
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:28,091
But this is bad.

254
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:30,143
Two of my kind are approaching.

255
00:14:30,282 --> 00:14:30,757
Uhh...

256
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:35,235
Hello?

257
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:36,521
I'm sorry...

258
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,514
I want to change our meeting place...

259
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:40,863
For now, don't go near the trains.

260
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:42,293
I'll call you later.

261
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:43,746
Huh?

262
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:48,491
It's those two.

263
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:50,148
Let's go.

264
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,014
Wait. If we move, it'll make them suspicious.

265
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,414
Pretend you're making a call.

266
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:02,285
<i>This time...</i>

267
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,914
<i>I'll show you what my power can really do.</i>

268
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:09,027
<i>I can sense you, and you alone.</i>

269
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:10,994
<i>No one else,</i>

270
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:14,582
<i>not even that girl Murano, has such feelings for you.</i>

271
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:17,478
I want you...

272
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:19,915
I want you to sense me, too.

273
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:40,222
They acted as though we were nothing out of the ordinary.

274
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:46,963
C'mon why won't she pick up?

275
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:51,986
There he is!

276
00:15:57,952 --> 00:15:58,868
It's no good.

277
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:03,091
With all these people around, there's
no way I can pinpoint Kana's breathing.

278
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:07,001
Migi. Aren't you able to receive that signal of hers?

279
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:10,353
Impossible. Her signal is weak in comparison,

280
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:12,778
and she may not even be sending it out right now.

281
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:15,712
I'll see him.

282
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:17,243
I will!

283
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:19,704
I'll see him soon...

284
00:16:21,623 --> 00:16:22,713
Shinichi...

285
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:23,728
There!

286
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:26,195
Uh! What? You found her?

287
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,893
I didn't. It's one of mine kind.

288
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:30,606
I'm not worried about that now...

289
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:31,756
No... Wait...

290
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,067
If Kana senses that guy's signal...

291
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:36,022
She's likely to approach it.

292
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:37,142
Which way?!

293
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,269
Shinichi! I told you!

294
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:44,948
I am able to sense you and only you!

295
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:46,161
Shinichi!

296
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,094
Haha!

297
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,092
It's a human?

298
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,956
The signal was rather weak...

299
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,458
but this is...

300
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:06,400
unexpected.

301
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:18,285
<i>I'll be okay...</i>

302
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:19,710
<i>He'll come to save me!</i>

303
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:29,631
Shinichi!

304
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:47,636
Migi.

305
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:49,971
Handle the defense.

306
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:51,322
Defense?

307
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:58,396
AAHHHH!

308
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:00,040
AHH!

309
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:03,036
Incredible.

310
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:14,946
It's no good. She's lost too much blood.

311
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:16,043
No, no...

312
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,170
Kana.

313
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,816
Shini...

314
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:27,013
Shinichi... I...

315
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:29,939
I knew that you were going to come for me...

316
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,167
I could sense you.

317
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,867
Just hold on!

318
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,700
Uhh...

319
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:39,117
I saw this before.

320
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,352
It was in a dream...

321
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,470
Please, please try not to talk.

322
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:50,360
It was just so embarrassing...

323
00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:53,425
I could... never tell...

324
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:54,947
anyone...

325
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:57,740
Ahh...

326
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:01,553
Kana...

327
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,345
Huh...

328
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:28,361
That's the boy who found her.

329
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:31,956
He seems pretty calm for someone
who just found his friend murdered.

330
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:34,362
This is confidential information,

331
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,899
but that kid's mother was actually
killed by a parasite as well.

332
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,865
Really?

333
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:47,370
Not too friendly, huh.

334
00:19:47,961 --> 00:19:52,448
I'm sure he's pretty tired of all the questioning
he's been through. The kid's had a rough go of it.

335
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:56,297
And we also had him give us
one of his hairs, just in case.

336
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:58,237
Oh, I'm sure he was a fan of that.

337
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,583
Well we can't be too careful...

338
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:03,142
The victim was murdered by a parasite...

339
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:06,279
But we... we don't know who killed that parasite.

340
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:10,247
Something tore through its rib cage, gouged out its heart,

341
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:13,384
then slammed it with enough
force to destroy the wall itself.

342
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:14,823
No human could do that.

343
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:18,147
Which means, there was at least
one other parasite at the scene.

344
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:20,548
So, the parasites had a falling out?

345
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:23,768
Yeah well... we have to consider that as a possibility.

346
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:28,717
If I... had just gone to the movies with Murano...

347
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:31,385
then none of this would ever have happened to Kana.

348
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:34,207
That's not true, Shinichi.

349
00:20:34,627 --> 00:20:37,221
It was just a matter of time for this to happen...

350
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,825
You don't need to feel responsible.

351
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:41,609
How can you say that?

352
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:43,059
Stop right there.

353
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:47,942
Kana...

354
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:50,302
Kana is dead!

355
00:20:52,392 --> 00:20:54,594
Why couldn't you protect her, you bastard?!

356
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:04,067
How can you be so freakin' calm right now?!

357
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,917
Just one tear!

358
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:10,027
You can't shed just one tear for her, huh?!

359
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:11,013
Shinichi.

360
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:11,920
You aren't...

361
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,887
you aren't even human!

362
00:21:15,094 --> 00:21:16,251
That's right!

363
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,946
You don't know who the hell I am!

364
00:21:35,454 --> 00:21:37,054
<i>If we take this any further...</i>

365
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:39,300
<i>I'm gonna rip this guy to pieces.</i>

366
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,325
<i>"Not human"?</i>

367
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:49,202
<i>He's right... he's absolutely right.</i>

368
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,167
<i>And why am I so calm right now?</i>

369
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:56,716
<i>Is it possible?</i>

370
00:21:57,904 --> 00:21:59,825
<i>Have I just not felt it happening?</i>

371
00:22:00,508 --> 00:22:01,959
<i>Am I gradually being...</i>

372
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:04,315
<i>has my brain been taken over?</i>

373
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,997
<i>I mean... Kana is dead...</i>

374
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:10,911
<i>but I... but I can't cry.</i>

375
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:18,070
Stop it, Shinichi.

376
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:18,740
Huh...

377
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:25,496
At least my blood's still red.

378
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:32,106
For now anyway.

379
00:22:45,853 --> 00:22:48,616
Next time: "Hello Sadness"
