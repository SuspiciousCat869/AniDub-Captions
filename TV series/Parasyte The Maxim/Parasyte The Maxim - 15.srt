1
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:11,144
They're splitting up.

2
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:13,270
Which one should I follow?

3
00:00:14,377 --> 00:00:16,001
Yes... Understood.

4
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,618
I'll let you know what I find.

5
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:34,209
Pickin' up chicks?

6
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:23,954
Well that's not good.

7
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:27,394
I didn't even really notice that you came up behind me.

8
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:18,050
I want you to help me with something.

9
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,275
The last I heard, he was headed
for this building's basement.

10
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:31,110
But I'm not crazy enough to go in there by
myself, so I was kinda hoping you guys would...

11
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:32,407
What did we say?

12
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:35,237
We explicitly told you not to go after this one.

13
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:38,095
Well?

14
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:39,802
Do you sense anything?

15
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:43,532
No, none of my kind are currently in the area.

16
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,418
I don't get it. Where is he?

17
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:57,715
Something smells really bad in here.

18
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,410
Huh?

19
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:04,552
Oh, my God... Not again!

20
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,233
Shinichi, one of them is coming.

21
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:10,257
Two hundred meters...

22
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,777
One hundred eighty meters...

23
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,609
Very fast. It's probably in a car.

24
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,505
If we leave now, we'll likely
run into it near the entrance.

25
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,665
God, this is bad! C'mon, we gotta hide!

26
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,605
It has another human.

27
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:28,685
Eew, gross. What is this place?

28
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,283
Oh, never mind that.

29
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,179
Please just stand right over there, if you don't mind.

30
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,405
Oh, like this?

31
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:38,780
Yes, that's fine.

32
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:41,659
What's this about? You're so weird.

33
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:45,985
Don't make a move, Shinichi.

34
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,899
<i>Why are you hiding?</i>

35
00:04:51,077 --> 00:04:52,527
<i>Well, whatever.</i>

36
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:54,097
Now then...

37
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,984
Let me get a look at you.

38
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,573
<i>This is it. This is how they eat people.</i>

39
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,588
Stop right there!

40
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:06,261
Who is that?!

41
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,131
Who are you?

42
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:12,213
I can tell you're not one of us.

43
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,392
Careful, lady!

44
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:15,200
That guy's not really a human!

45
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,227
Get away from him!

46
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:17,376
Huh?

47
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,607
Hurry! He brought you here to kill you!

48
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:31,536
You son of a bitch!

49
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,435
You're a filthy human.

50
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:35,664
Listen to me, Shinichi.

51
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,505
You have to forget that I'm even here.

52
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:41,868
He'll defeat us before we can
finish discussing how to coordinate.

53
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:48,290
You can see his blades' movements, right?

54
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,372
Yeah!

55
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:54,330
I don't...

56
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,437
Everything's moving so fast!

57
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:00,016
Just keep dodging his strikes.

58
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,733
And don't even think of trying to
attack this one like you did last time.

59
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,978
Can we really beat him like this?!

60
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:13,647
Well done, your moves are quite good.

61
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,847
I'll win this by having the better steed.

62
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,747
Did you just call me a steed?!

63
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:07,628
Our weakness is below the neck; The human portion.

64
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:10,343
If we can protect that, we will ultimately win.

65
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:19,493
I couldn't save her.

66
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:23,968
And it's too late now.

67
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:26,658
I knew what was going on.

68
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:29,168
But instead I...

69
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:32,649
I spent... I spent too much time doing nothing!

70
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:37,304
In any case, this whole thing is bad news.

71
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:40,024
Judging from the man's actions,

72
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:45,024
this structure must be one of the communal
dining areas established by Hirokawa.

73
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:46,863
And if that's true,

74
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,153
it could mean that we've just committed
a clear act of aggression against the mayor's faction.

75
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:55,538
Are you listening, Shinichi?

76
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:06,597
I was wrong.

77
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:07,666
Hmm?

78
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,697
I was so wrong.

79
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,797
Shinichi, we need to leave this place as soon as possible.

80
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:22,706
So, what now?

81
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,764
I mean, you're not going to stop looking, are you?

82
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:32,279
There's a detective I met a while back,

83
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:34,741
I believe his name was Hirama.

84
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:37,946
I'm sure he'll listen to whatever you have to say.

85
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,618
Because, not long ago,

86
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:41,644
he suspected me of being one of them.

87
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:45,059
Hey now, don't give him any strange ideas.

88
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:46,603
What's strange about it?

89
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,924
We're trying to go up against Hirokawa.

90
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,671
What're you saying?

91
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:55,299
Have you not realized that we could be in
an extremely precarious situation right now?

92
00:08:56,174 --> 00:09:00,879
We can use the video he recorded to get the
police to search the building from top to bottom.

93
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:02,646
Don't be foolish.

94
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,828
We are in that video footage, too, you know.

95
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:06,995
Look, I don't even care about that anymore!

96
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,664
Do you want your father to be murdered as well?

97
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:13,899
What's that s'posta mean?!

98
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,246
Why would you say that?!

99
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:16,978
You don't have to worry.

100
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:19,633
I was wrong, okay?

101
00:09:20,254 --> 00:09:23,035
I'm in way over my head here, just like my wife told me.

102
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,884
A small-timer like me shouldn't have
gotten involved with this to begin with.

103
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:35,842
I'm gonna get rid of every bit of
evidence I've managed to find so far.

104
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,068
How could you?

105
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:38,883
You saw what happened!

106
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,119
Are you trying to say none of it means anything to you?

107
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:42,346
Of course, it does!

108
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:45,203
Dammit, yes! Look at me, I'm still shaking here!

109
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:49,646
But anybody who saw that and honestly thinks
he could fight it is out of his freaking mind!

110
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:50,571
Maybe you don't get it.

111
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:52,708
You're not a normal human being anymore!

112
00:09:56,697 --> 00:10:01,254
Look the fight that I just witnessed back there,
that was two monsters trying to kill each other.

113
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:04,663
I'm only a simple, normal person.

114
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:08,787
I'm not that brave, and I don't have
any special power crap to protect myself.

115
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:10,462
I can't do all that, okay?

116
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:15,515
As of today, I'm gonna forget about the
monsters and Reiko Tamura... and you too.

117
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,083
C'mon, don't look at me like that.

118
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,337
I have a wife and kid to think about, all right?

119
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:30,421
I know I got a little high and mighty, talking
about the good of humanity and stuff, but this...

120
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,169
this is too much.

121
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:36,812
Well, I guess that's true human nature for you.

122
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:39,356
Shut the hell up.

123
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:45,756
Maybe you don't get it!

124
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:47,803
You're not a normal human being anymore!

125
00:10:50,597 --> 00:10:51,902
<i>He's absolutely right.</i>

126
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,772
<i>I'm NOT normal anymore.</i>

127
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:56,835
<i>The things I can sense...</i>

128
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,441
<i>The things I can do...</i>

129
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,987
Shinichi...

130
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:06,473
I've said this many times now, but
we should avoid futile resistance.

131
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,370
Futile?

132
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:09,865
Yeah, maybe.

133
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,033
But well, we did win today, right?

134
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:17,938
We can beat them one-on-one! That is the answer!

135
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:21,611
If I were to choose to cooperate with you, that is.

136
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:28,353
<i>I can do it...</i>

137
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:30,465
<i>I can do it!</i>

138
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,734
<i>If I put my mind to it, I can do anything!</i>

139
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:41,414
<i>One at a time...</i>

140
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:44,739
<i>Yes, I can get them one at a time!</i>

141
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:47,808
<i>I'll beat them alone if I have to.</i>

142
00:11:48,112 --> 00:11:50,128
<i>I don't need to ask any more humans for help.</i>

143
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:53,255
<i>That way, I'm sure Migi would help me.</i>

144
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:57,558
<i>No... I will make him help me!</i>

145
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,818
<i>Call it my human ego or whatever,</i>

146
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:10,414
<i>but I wanna save as many people as I can!</i>

147
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:14,506
<i>And it'll make things safer for Murano, too.</i>

148
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,227
Did you and Shinichi have a fight or something?

149
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:20,943
I haven't seen you together lately.

150
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:22,825
Not so much a fight as...

151
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:25,489
Well, I don't know.

152
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:29,248
It's like we just can't really
trust each other or something.

153
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:37,144
I don't know, it looks like HE trusts YOU.

154
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:49,902
I... I gotta go!

155
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,190
Murano, wait!

156
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,103
Seriously?

157
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:55,436
Shut up, Akiho.

158
00:12:57,217 --> 00:12:59,786
<i>I will protect every person I can!</i>

159
00:13:02,556 --> 00:13:03,960
Our enemy is strong.

160
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:05,970
We cannot allow him to roam free.

161
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:07,750
Killing him would be a waste.

162
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:10,223
Though I care nothing for the detective.

163
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:12,042
Unwise...

164
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:14,879
He is, without a doubt very dangerous to us.

165
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:16,238
Why would you defend him?

166
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,966
We are not human beings, are we?

167
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,046
Why would our opinions be in
such opposition to one another?

168
00:13:22,824 --> 00:13:23,694
Now then...

169
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:27,606
I understand you're currently raising a human child.

170
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:30,026
Could that be affecting your judgment?

171
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:32,634
Why not simply dispose of it?

172
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:35,308
I can't do that just yet.

173
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,470
At any rate,

174
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:41,545
Shinichi Izumi killed one of our members in a dining area.

175
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,526
We can't just let this go, obviously.

176
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,600
We will need to eliminate him.

177
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,613
Very well, then.

178
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:53,117
But I would like to make sure that
his body is returned to me fully intact.

179
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:54,530
For what purpose?

180
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,533
I want to dissect him.

181
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,930
Very impressive, Mr. Goto.

182
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,994
Was it Mozart?

183
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:25,018
No, Chopin.

184
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,713
Our target is purported to be formidable.

185
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:33,143
Granted, I think it should be you who takes care of him.

186
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:39,172
If you're implying Miki wants
to do it, I will allow him to try.

187
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:43,402
He could use some more study.

188
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:51,698
<i>What is this?</i>

189
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,558
<i>Who are you?</i>

190
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:58,135
Things are rough for me, too, you know?

191
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:00,999
<i>You... You're a monster!</i>

192
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:05,575
Hmm?

193
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:10,156
Ah, so I look like a monster to you?

194
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:12,988
But you're in no position to talk.

195
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:16,352
Just take a look at this, Shinichi.

196
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:29,184
What... What the hell was that?

197
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,024
<i>I need to kill off the parasites
by attacking them one at a time.</i>

198
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:39,147
<i>But how am I ever going to get Migi to agree to it?</i>

199
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:44,262
<i>Maybe the best way would be to
make it so that we have no choice...</i>

200
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,852
<i>that we have to fight.</i>

201
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:54,910
What're you doing?

202
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:56,423
I'm gonna be late for class.

203
00:15:56,984 --> 00:15:58,084
You don't have time.

204
00:15:58,184 --> 00:15:59,351
I sense my kind.

205
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:01,152
What? Again?!

206
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:03,278
<i>Here's my chance!</i>

207
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:05,263
Okay, let's fight.

208
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:06,603
Where is it right now?

209
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,276
Don't be so eager.

210
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,870
WE are being targeted this time.

211
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:14,288
The signal's headed straight for
us right now with intent to kill.

212
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:15,151
I sense three.

213
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:17,025
There's three of 'em. O'kay.

214
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,696
Do we fight, or do we run?

215
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,788
You seem more than ready for a fight, at the moment.

216
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,115
If so, this is the ideal location.

217
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:26,456
Don't be ridiculous!

218
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:30,795
I will NOT do this at school!

219
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:34,739
Shinichi!

220
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:42,129
It's okay. You don't have to worry, Murano.

221
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:42,762
Huh?

222
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,024
It's okay!

223
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:47,681
Look, you don't have to worry.

224
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,502
Don't tell me...

225
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:56,242
Shinichi?

226
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:00,194
Stop; I've lost them.

227
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:03,869
They're more than 300 meters away
now, and they seem to be on foot.

228
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,614
So there's three coming for us at once?

229
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,075
In this case,

230
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,475
we should consider taking them out one-by-one,
rather than opposing all of them together.

231
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,540
Take them out one by one...

232
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,336
Okay, I'm ready to go!

233
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:25,030
No, never mind.

234
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,326
Forget about that strategy.

235
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,720
Migi, why?!

236
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:30,044
I'm tired.

237
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,229
It's time for me to sleep.

238
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,191
You've got to be shitting me?!

239
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:35,990
It can't be helped.

240
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,492
It's a case of simple physiology.

241
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:41,021
In any case, you have to keep moving,

242
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:43,398
as straightforward as possible.

243
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,494
That's all we can do for now.

244
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,946
So then, I'm on my own for four hours?

245
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:08,713
Well, I guess I can relax a bit for now.

246
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:10,716
Two more hours, huh?

247
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:12,483
I should be able to shake them off.

248
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:16,584
A taxi? Seriously?

249
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,704
You can keep the change.

250
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,811
Thanks a lot.

251
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,435
<i>Only one, huh?</i>

252
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:27,141
<i>So, it's not him.</i>

253
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,041
Well, hello there!

254
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:31,964
Nice place, huh?

255
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:34,661
No one around, and it's so quiet.

256
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:35,965
<i>He's smiling.</i>

257
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,162
<i>There's no way this guy's a parasite.</i>

258
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:43,398
I'm kinda surprised. You took off in
quite a panic back there, didn't you?

259
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:46,842
And I had heard you were so tough.

260
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:50,003
So what's goin' on? Huh?

261
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:52,842
You know, your hand's signal seems awfully weak at the...

262
00:18:53,855 --> 00:18:55,794
Hey! Wait up!

263
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,527
<i>I've never seen a parasite as expressive as that before!</i>

264
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,545
<i>But he is pretty slow.</i>

265
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:10,781
<i>Parasites should be able to get
more from their host-body potential.</i>

266
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:14,187
<i>Still, the other two could be close by.</i>

267
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:16,328
<i>I can't let my guard down!</i>

268
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,098
Where ya headed to, young fella?

269
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,944
Would you like a lift somewhere?

270
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,512
Yeah, thank you so much.

271
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,293
<i>Is he... is this guy...</i>

272
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:42,295
<i>or his dog...</i>

273
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:43,960
<i>are they parasites?!</i>

274
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:46,735
<i>No, it's too small.</i>

275
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,760
Are you sure you wanna get out here?

276
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:53,977
Yeah, I can't thank you enough, sir.

277
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,965
<i>Thank God!</i>

278
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:00,685
<i>I guess he was okay.</i>

279
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:03,091
<i>It's been almost four hours now.</i>

280
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,652
<i>It looks like they've given up.</i>

281
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,550
Please, Migi, wake up.

282
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,556
Migi? Migi!

283
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:39,442
WAKE UP!

284
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,998
Ah, Shinichi, I'm so glad to see you're all right.

285
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:47,452
They're here!

286
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:48,705
That's right.

287
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:52,038
But I still haven't been able to
find where the other two are hiding yet.

288
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,610
I don't think you understand. All
three of them are in that one body.

289
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:57,399
Huh?!

290
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,635
Did you seriously name your parasite "Migi"?

291
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,067
What a coincidence!

292
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,288
Well...

293
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:07,022
You are simply not gonna believe this.

294
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,177
Ya'see, I'm called "Miki." With a 'K'.

295
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,437
Well, this is interesting.

296
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:22,596
Ya'can't beat me.

297
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:48,860
Next time: "Happy Family"
