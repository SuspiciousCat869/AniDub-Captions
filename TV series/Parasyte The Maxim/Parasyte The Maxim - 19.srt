1
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:04,982
<i>What the heck's with this guy?</i>

2
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:08,617
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

3
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:10,247
<i>he's a parasite!</i>

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,909
<i>No, he's definitely human.</i>

5
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,117
<i>I can tell that much, somehow.</i>

6
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,930
<i>C'mon, Migi!</i>

7
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:21,431
<i>Wake up!</i>

8
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:57,398
What's with him?

9
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:58,804
He's changed.

10
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,998
He's different now. Something's going on.

11
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:05,196
This is who he really is.

12
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:07,918
<i>Wait...</i>

13
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:11,548
<i>Is he human? Is he really?!</i>

14
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:19,748
<i>It's not like I really think that
I'm all that special or anything.</i>

15
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:25,714
<i>How am I able to tell humans and monsters apart?</i>

16
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:28,783
<i>Huh, let's see...</i>

17
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:34,419
<i>Maybe because I've had my share of "fun" with humans.</i>

18
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:36,901
<i>Put simply...</i>

19
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:42,626
<i>I know more about the "quality" of
these beings than anyone else does.</i>

20
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:45,361
<i>It's just a shame...</i>

21
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,149
<i>they break so easily.</i>

22
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:50,596
<i>Oh, yeah...</i>

23
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,451
<i>I've had my fun.</i>

24
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,247
<i>Still, most animals have the same ability, don't they?</i>

25
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:04,448
<i>It's just an innate capacity to
tell your own kind apart from others.</i>

26
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:09,896
<i>I was shocked the first time
I found one of them, of course.</i>

27
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,590
<i>I mean, it was a...</i>

28
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:16,866
<i>creature in humans' clothes, walkin' around in the crowd.</i>

29
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:20,523
<i>If I watched everyone pass by,</i>

30
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:24,913
<i>there'd be one or two of them every hour, if I was lucky.</i>

31
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,329
<i>It was kinda weird that no one else seemed to notice them.</i>

32
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:31,044
<i>But as for the creatures themselves,</i>

33
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,404
<i>they looked like they really didn't care.</i>

34
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:36,627
<i>I pretty much kept my distance.</i>

35
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,173
<i>Honestly, I felt like these guys were BAD news.</i>

36
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:44,881
<i>In fact, I guess you could call that
an "innate animal instinct" as well.</i>

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:55,002
<i>Yet, part of me eagerly looked forward to seeing
how some "mysterious" monster would do things.</i>

38
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:58,783
<i>But it was really no big deal.</i>

39
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,759
<i>Honestly, it wasn't so different from stuff I had done.</i>

40
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:06,434
Well now, you made quite a mess.

41
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,275
I mean, ya gotta clean up after
yourself when you're done playing.

42
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:11,539
Don't move!

43
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,586
Wait, no! I... I didn't do this!

44
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,835
I know it looks bad,

45
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:18,329
but it wasn't me!

46
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:26,492
He's taking his sweet time.

47
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:29,794
Mr. Hirama, I'm afraid we can't wait.

48
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,829
Shinichi Izumi's expression never
changed once during questioning,

49
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:39,969
but he certainly seems to be afraid right now, doesn't he?

50
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:42,792
Uragami?

51
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:44,894
It's a wash.

52
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:47,546
What? What's that supposed to mean?

53
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:50,737
Well, this guy might have potential...

54
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:54,651
but something else has got my attention.

55
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,899
There's something different about THIS guy.

56
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:01,425
Things got a little confusing there at first.

57
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:04,221
"Confusing"? In what way?

58
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:07,496
I guess maybe I could've imagined it but...

59
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,486
but just for a second,

60
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:13,728
I thought I saw something inhuman deep in his eyes.

61
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:14,538
WHAT?!

62
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:18,019
Jesus Christ, man, don't yell in my ears, all right?

63
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:20,226
Anyway, I think it must've been nothin'.

64
00:05:20,964 --> 00:05:22,885
When I took another good look at him,

65
00:05:23,318 --> 00:05:25,741
I didn't see whatever I saw before.

66
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:38,386
So, the two of you will be staying
at the hotel for a few more days.

67
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:41,928
We'll have an officer escort you
if you need to visit your house,

68
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:44,266
so just be sure to let us know in advance.

69
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,240
No thanks, that's not necessary.

70
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,750
Yeah, well, I insist.

71
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,353
Um, Mr. Hirama?

72
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,999
I have a question about the baby, sir.

73
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:05,274
I assume you're talking about the one with Reiko Tamura.

74
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,396
Well, we need to do more tests.

75
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:11,517
After all, the poor little thing
was being raised by a parasite.

76
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,506
So, what happens if you confirm the baby's normal?

77
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:20,290
If that's the case, the child will
then be raised in an appropriate facility.

78
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:21,552
So, um...

79
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:23,689
Why would you be worried about that?

80
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,876
Uh, no... It's just I...

81
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:31,514
If you were to come forward and say
that you are related to Reiko Tamura,

82
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:33,579
then I'd have YOU look after it.

83
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:35,399
Huh? What?!

84
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:42,072
I was just joking.

85
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:48,413
<i>"Deep in his eyes," huh?</i>

86
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:51,050
<i>What the hell did he see?</i>

87
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:56,195
Shinichi, need the bath?

88
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,150
Nah, you go ahead.

89
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,049
Okay, will do.

90
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:08,157
<i>Ah man, who was that guy?</i>

91
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:11,468
<i>Just thinking about him gives me the chills.</i>

92
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,647
<i>I've seen all sorts of man-eating
monsters, but that guy...</i>

93
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:19,812
Shinichi, it would seem that you're exhausted,

94
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,905
and not just physically, but also mentally as well.

95
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:26,717
I met someone really messed up
while you were asleep earlier.

96
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:28,714
Human?

97
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,860
Yeah...

98
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:32,102
But this guy...

99
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:34,883
He must've been...

100
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:36,754
a killer.

101
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:39,206
I just...

102
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:42,281
I don't know what's what anymore.

103
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:45,645
I mean, that guy was really off,

104
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,613
and just terrifying.

105
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:51,464
And yet, Reiko Tamura, a parasite that ate people,

106
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,000
actually saved me...

107
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:55,926
And healed the hole in my heart.

108
00:07:57,506 --> 00:08:00,140
I still find it impossible to comprehend.

109
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:01,952
Tamura's behavior.

110
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,764
We are two halves of the same whole.

111
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,188
Parasites and humanity are of one family.

112
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,790
Therefore, in regards to the.

113
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:20,247
"Legal Interpretation of
Emergency Measures and Response to.

114
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,720
Indiscriminate Killings by Parasites"...

115
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:26,981
The government has indeed given
its approval for this operation.

116
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:30,789
But I'd like you to keep in mind that
there are still many, many gray areas.

117
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:33,981
Well, yes there are.

118
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:36,440
Good to see you, Inspector.

119
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:38,377
Assistant Inspector.

120
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:41,647
Well, ASSISTANT Inspector,

121
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:45,666
there's talk you'll make superintendent
by the day of this operation.

122
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:47,846
You're a really funny guy.

123
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:52,553
In fact, he'll be commanding the front-line
forces during the upcoming tactical operation.

124
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:54,146
The name's Yamagishi.

125
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:55,846
As you've already been informed,

126
00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:00,493
Mr. Hirama will be in charge of overseeing
the support functions of this operation.

127
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:04,494
Meanwhile, Mr. Yamagishi, has his own set of objectives.

128
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,536
Identifying and eliminating the enemy.

129
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:08,671
Um, Director...

130
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:15,244
I feel that Uragami, the man I mentioned to you,
could be a very powerful asset if we use him correctly.

131
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:21,097
I think we need to reassess our proposed
operations and incorporate him into the core strategy.

132
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:24,248
Yeah, of course I appreciate the input, but...

133
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,201
As for this "psychic power" of his, I dunno.

134
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:30,626
I can't really trust a convicted killer.

135
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,308
Using a rogue element like that guy?

136
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:36,274
It could hamper how our tactical forces operate,

137
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,241
especially when it matters most.

138
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:40,377
Now, he wouldn't be there as an operative.

139
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:43,376
We'd only be using him as an extra pair of eyes.

140
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:44,888
A "pair of eyes"?

141
00:09:45,422 --> 00:09:49,048
But we already have a detection
system that'll be set up to handle that.

142
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:53,908
It's not like you're facing some flock of
sheep that can just be herded up by dogs.

143
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:57,988
You are clearly attributing these
creatures with far too much humanity.

144
00:09:58,304 --> 00:10:02,124
We're not out to conduct a
manhunt here, Assistant Inspector.

145
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,501
This is pest extermination.

146
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:11,412
We haven't been able to get in
touch with Reiko Tamura for days.

147
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:15,402
The same goes for Kusano, Hikawa, and Maesawa.

148
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:20,247
Three dismembered corpses were recently
discovered in a municipal construction site,

149
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:25,703
and the following day, a female who was
believed to be a parasite was shot dead in a park.

150
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:30,321
However, all four bodies were
retrieved by a special agency,

151
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:33,654
and none of their identities have as yet been revealed.

152
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:38,348
We both know that Kusano never
cared for Reiko Tamura or her methods.

153
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:41,805
I'd say he conspired to kill her without our consent,

154
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:45,024
but instead ended up being the victim himself.

155
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,773
So you think the woman who was shot dead in the park

156
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:49,157
was Tamura, yes?

157
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:51,563
Most likely.

158
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,605
Now that a special anti-parasite agency has been created,

159
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,640
I am no longer receiving confidential information.

160
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,903
That means the government is finally
starting to take this seriously.

161
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:05,410
That would seem to be the case.

162
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:09,721
Shinichi!

163
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:12,101
Murano!

164
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,324
I sure have been good at making you worry.

165
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:19,498
Oh, here!

166
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:23,855
These are all the notes I took while you were gone.

167
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:26,328
Oh, thank you.

168
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:28,015
I'll make some copies of them.

169
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:29,335
Hey, it's been a while!

170
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:30,901
Hey, Murano!

171
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:33,715
You done with your little vacation?

172
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,007
Uh... uh...

173
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:39,326
All right, listen up!

174
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:42,170
This will be your last timed trial in high school!

175
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:45,400
Give it everything ya got, guys.
Don't leave anything out there!

176
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:46,192
Oh, eat it.

177
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:48,901
I don't think I like the idea of Coach holding a gun.

178
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:53,914
'Kay, Izumi, I've always wanted to say this,
you have never taken any of this seriously.

179
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:57,358
So just once, for me, you gotta run like you gotta pair!

180
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,738
<i>Yeah, I couldn't really go all out before, could I?</i>

181
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,512
<i>The last one, huh?</i>

182
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:03,800
Get set!

183
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:23,025
Jesus! Ten point five seconds?

184
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:24,345
No freakin' way.

185
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:30,504
<i>Whatever. I could've done it in nine.</i>

186
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:36,758
What's the matter? You too embarrassed
to change with the rest of us?

187
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:37,404
Uh...

188
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:41,478
We're all dudes here, so don't go gettin' all shy!

189
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:47,381
Sorry, man.

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,187
Nah, don't worry about it.

191
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:51,117
It's nothing.

192
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:54,877
Dumb-ass!

193
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:03,652
Hy-aa!

194
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:15,553
We'll be graduating in three months.

195
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:17,215
Yeah...

196
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:19,948
So much has happened.

197
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:21,404
It's kinda unreal.

198
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,197
Way too much, if you ask me.

199
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,100
Yeah, but there were good things, too.

200
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,098
Guess now I've gotta do some studying.

201
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:36,873
Huh?! You're taking the entrance exams?

202
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,221
Yeah. Of course!

203
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:43,329
Hey, ya know what?

204
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:45,438
When I get to college, I...

205
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,310
Let's go.

206
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:02,277
We can do it, y'know?

207
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:08,110
In fact, I am certain of it.

208
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:12,960
And yet, I can't help but feel
as though we're missing something.

209
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:15,425
I don't know what it is,

210
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,779
but it's definitely something.

211
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,807
I'd very much like to hear your thoughts.

212
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,459
Why's it always...

213
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:27,167
have to be Shinichi?

214
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,708
It shouldn't be JUST him.

215
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:33,220
Everyone at this school...

216
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,359
We're all trying our best to move on.

217
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:40,972
We all just want things to be normal again...

218
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,644
go back to how they were.

219
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:46,994
Instead, we have to live on edge,

220
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:50,013
afraid of what'll happen next!

221
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:00,478
He looks like just a regular high school kid.

222
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,674
He's the witness I mentioned.

223
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:06,384
Ah, so you're the guy?

224
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:10,718
I heard that you got the chance to see
Hirama and his men put one of them down recently.

225
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:11,811
That's right.

226
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:15,281
I know that you're a civilian and everything,

227
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:20,154
but do you have any ideas about any type of
weapons that would be effective against them?

228
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:24,826
A flamethrower would be an excellent choice.

229
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:26,992
But they can move so fast.

230
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,767
Of course, fire alone will not be enough.

231
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:31,936
But I do think it'll be effective.

232
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:35,403
To put it simply, it will startle them.

233
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:37,791
At least the surface part, anyway.

234
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:44,738
Now, we're as intelligent as humans, and we
parasites don't have an irrational fear of fire.

235
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:46,384
But...

236
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,528
if we did encounter it suddenly,

237
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,174
we'd suffer an internal disconnect.

238
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:55,095
In short, we would be startled.

239
00:15:55,418 --> 00:15:56,618
Uh-huh...

240
00:15:57,479 --> 00:16:00,938
We know Goto's body contains several parasitic sections,

241
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:04,193
but each of those beings are
controlled by a single consciousness.

242
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:08,840
So if that consciousness is startled, it
should effectively unbalance him significantly.

243
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:10,557
Makes sense, I guess.

244
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:14,107
So we should use flamethrowers?

245
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:16,652
Huh?

246
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,788
Ah, I'm sorry.

247
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:21,802
Okay, I'm sure that'd probably work.

248
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:26,153
But still, no matter how many
parasites there are in one body,

249
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,196
there's just one heart.

250
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,004
The day has come...

251
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,239
What's going on?

252
00:16:57,694 --> 00:16:59,009
I have no idea.

253
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:01,491
It looks like the riot police.

254
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,297
But why?

255
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:17,602
<i>So, this is it.</i>

256
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:31,744
Sensors ready...

257
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:33,371
and standing by.

258
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:37,505
Let's do this.

259
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,283
Attention! This is an emergency announcement!

260
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:45,415
Everyone within the building, please listen
to the following instructions very carefully.

261
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:49,283
I'm Detective Mizushima with the
Higashi-Fukuyama Police Department.

262
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:54,564
A male assailant armed with a hunting rifle has entered
the building and is now hiding somewhere on the roof.

263
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,997
Mutsuki and Kisaragi Squads
will rendezvous in the main hall.

264
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,022
Yayoi Squad will cover the annex.

265
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,577
Uzuki Squad, take the second floor and seal all exits.

266
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:06,821
Satsuki Squad, protect the detection system.

267
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:09,306
Minazuki Squad, neutralize the chameleons.

268
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:11,486
Let's move men; Make it count.

269
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:14,078
Please proceed to the main hall
on the first floor at this time.

270
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,936
<i>They say they're police?</i>

271
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:31,966
<i>But I'm sure NONE of them are peace officers.</i>

272
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:36,391
<i>You're really doing this, you disgusting humans?</i>

273
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:42,119
This is where the fun begins.

274
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:46,773
We will strip these bastards of their
masks and lead them to the slaughter.

275
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,581
The suspect is currently on the north side of the roof!

276
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:53,811
Now, we'll be able to evacuate
everyone so he can't see you,

277
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:56,908
but he may take notice if the
entire building leaves at once.

278
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:59,853
Therefore, we will be leaving in groups of seven.

279
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:03,370
I'm tellin' ya, I don't know.

280
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,657
I hafta see 'em in person.

281
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:08,533
A monitor's useless.

282
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:12,572
Still, this is pretty impressive though!

283
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,917
It looks like some kinda war zone.

284
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:17,800
I'm not so sure you even really need me around.

285
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:22,510
Oh, it's you.

286
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:25,401
So bringing in the armed forces wasn't enough.

287
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:28,383
You had to recruit a killer and some damn teenager, too?

288
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:29,884
Man, you guys are up the creek.

289
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:31,541
That's enough! Shut the hell up!

290
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:35,918
You see any?

291
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:38,104
Well, do you?

292
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,921
I don't know, sir.

293
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:50,546
Most of all, we would like to find the deviant with the
multiple parasites that you were telling us about earlier.

294
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:53,068
<i>The "deviant"?</i>

295
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,483
And then, of course, there's the other one:

296
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:59,034
There is Mayor Hirokawa.

297
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:01,782
<i>That's right...</i>

298
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:03,799
<i>Hirokawa's the key!</i>

299
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:07,800
<i>But what... what was she trying to say about him?</i>

300
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:11,226
They said we're supposed to evacuate in groups of seven.

301
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:13,317
You should go first, Mr. Mayor.

302
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:14,363
No, I couldn't.

303
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,897
Please give the children and elderly first priority.

304
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,590
And then the women.

305
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:23,902
Please ensure that all city workers
are shifted toward the end of the line.

306
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:30,133
Here come the first seven.

307
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:37,917
HQ to all squads. If shots are fired and the
chameleons make any attempt to escape or retaliate,

308
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:39,731
initiate safeguards at once.

309
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:40,943
Roger.

310
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:48,742
I will now remove all matter from the
sensor image that does not contain human DNA.

311
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:54,815
Nothing in this group.

312
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,037
All right, let's send out the next seven.

313
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:02,313
There's nothing here, either.

314
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:08,236
Migi, you have any idea how many of them are in there?

315
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:11,335
We're pretty far away, so I can't say for sure.

316
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:13,483
But there are several present.

317
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:16,901
There!

318
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:19,885
It's that one!
