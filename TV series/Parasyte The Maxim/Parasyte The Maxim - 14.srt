1
00:00:01,073 --> 00:00:02,713
Shinichi, your eyes...

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,280
your eyes have no tears.

3
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:15,754
<i>Goodbye... Murano...</i>

4
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:51,537
Shinichi, I was unsure earlier about what would happen.

5
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,221
This was for the best, right?

6
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:58,435
I mean, if that guy had been watching us
again, he'd probably start going after Murano next.

7
00:01:58,801 --> 00:01:59,779
"That guy"?

8
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:00,641
Yeah...

9
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,351
Y'know the man from before...

10
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:04,893
He was watching me again this afternoon, too.

11
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,684
Why didn't you say so sooner?

12
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,576
'Cause you would've tried to kill him.

13
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:12,008
Well, I've changed my thinking on that matter.

14
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,519
His investigation of you would
appear to be ongoing, correct?

15
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:20,724
If the same person is continuing to
operate despite us having discovered him,

16
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:23,470
we could actually be facing several enemies.

17
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,906
We may as well track down everyone
involved in this investigation and then...

18
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:29,183
Kill them all, right?

19
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:30,113
No...

20
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:36,412
In fact, I've noticed just how adverse a reaction you
have when it comes to the idea of killing other humans.

21
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:38,105
And that means,

22
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,099
we will have to work together.

23
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:47,399
Instead, we should investigate him.

24
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,576
How exactly?

25
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,987
We will call in an ally and ask for help.

26
00:02:51,346 --> 00:02:52,360
An ally, huh...?

27
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:54,927
But where in the world would we ever find one?

28
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,791
Sorry for making you come here.

29
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:03,413
And getting you involved in all this, of course.

30
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,178
What are you talking about?

31
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:06,602
You two can count on us.

32
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:08,659
You're the only ones in the same boat we are!

33
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,464
We have to help each other out y'know!

34
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:11,730
I know, but...

35
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:14,356
but you kinda already helped me out enough already...

36
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:16,904
You got that right! You totally owe us!

37
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,793
This is a huge pain for us!

38
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,992
That was not me just now.

39
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:22,699
Right.

40
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,294
Seriously. I get it.

41
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,549
But wouldn't it be better just to kill the guy?

42
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:31,589
No, we can't. It's not that easy, all right?

43
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,397
Anyway, do you have any idea who might be behind all this?

44
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,716
Actually, I think we do.

45
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,959
Assuming the enemy isn't some
organization... we do have a guess.

46
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:45,389
Okay, let's say we're gonna just
try to catch him instead of kill him.

47
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:47,155
You at least know what he looks like, right?

48
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,664
Yes, I remember him well.

49
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,241
Like this.

50
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:52,556
Okay... I got it.

51
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:58,888
For now, I think we're going to stay
in the hotel over by the train station.

52
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,413
Right. Okay.

53
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:02,049
Oh, by the way.

54
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:04,035
About this guy's name...

55
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:08,302
we decided "Parasite" was too confusing
because they use that on TV and everywhere...

56
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:09,837
so I've decided to call him "Joe".

57
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:12,054
He so desperately needs a friend you guys.

58
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:12,919
Hehe.

59
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:16,256
Guh. I do not get it with all the friggin' names.

60
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,014
I agree. Names are totally unimportant.

61
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:31,269
You look like you're exhausted.

62
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:33,879
You should really go see a doctor.

63
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:37,034
Hm. I did go see a doctor... Look!

64
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:39,331
That's not what I'm talking about.

65
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,485
Yeah, well, they wouldn't believe me anyway.

66
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:43,958
Someone's hand stretching out and attacking me?

67
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:46,521
But it did happen, and I did get hurt...

68
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,100
I mean this is real, isn't it?!

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,863
Isn't it?

70
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:50,855
Please calm yourself down.

71
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,070
Believe it or not, I've calmed down quite a bit...

72
00:04:58,316 --> 00:05:00,909
And I've taken time to think
about what happened back there.

73
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,763
As in, what the hell was that... thing?

74
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:05,510
I haven't come up with anything.

75
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,178
Well nothing that makes any sorta sense at least.

76
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:11,653
I'll pay you for all the work you've done up until now...

77
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:13,602
But your job's over.

78
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,055
Over? But we've just barely scratched the surface...?

79
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:21,165
I mean come on here... How am I
supposed to deal with all this crazy stuff?

80
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:23,895
I... I at least have to figure out what that thing was!

81
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:27,272
Asking me to believe your story is far more unreasonable.

82
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:28,224
I guess I...

83
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:31,009
Hold on! Wait a second!

84
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,081
You mentioned something to me about
Shinichi Izumi's hand before, didn't you.

85
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:36,216
Oh?

86
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:38,325
You did...! You definitely did!

87
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,299
So then you...

88
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:42,014
You already knew about it! You knew!

89
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,991
That's the whole reason you asked me
to investigate him in the first place!

90
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:47,101
Do you know what that monster actually is?

91
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:49,203
Look, you gotta tell me what's going on here lady!

92
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:52,289
Would you stop this foolishness? We're done.

93
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:56,217
Hey! I can't just walk away from this... Ah... Ow...

94
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,806
Ugh... Aww..

95
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:00,798
Hmph.

96
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,640
<i>This would seem to be as far as I can go using the humans.</i>

97
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:13,220
<i>Ultimately, very little was accomplished.</i>

98
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:16,020
<i>Perhaps I should get rid of that investigator.</i>

99
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:20,207
Huh?

100
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:32,565
Hahaha...

101
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:37,271
<i>Was I really laughing just now...?</i>

102
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:42,089
<i>That's the first time I've ever
laughed without making myself do so.</i>

103
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,831
<i>But when I saw how panicked that man looked...</i>

104
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:46,861
Heh!

105
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:50,786
<i>I completely forgot about my facial expressions.</i>

106
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:54,396
Hehehe...

107
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:58,193
Hahaha...

108
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:25,714
<i>Already asleep, huh?</i>

109
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:29,766
Ahh...

110
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,974
Ahh! What a day.

111
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:36,944
Oh, well, well. Enjoying yourself, I see.

112
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:37,741
Want some?

113
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,255
No, I'll pass.

114
00:07:47,386 --> 00:07:49,560
You've had it pretty rough lately, haven't you?

115
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:52,120
What? You've been having bad dreams...

116
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:53,626
You cry out in your sleep.

117
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:55,330
And now you've gotten yourself hurt.

118
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:57,532
Don't worry. It's no big deal.

119
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:02,761
So... is this job that you've been
working on really just a background check?

120
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,119
Do what? What're you talking about?

121
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,990
I'm just saying that nothing good is
going to come from getting involved in...

122
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:11,359
in things that you don't belong, that's all.

123
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:15,915
So now you're thirsty all of a sudden?

124
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:20,183
If this job gets too dangerous... well
then, isn't that what the cops are for.

125
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,498
I just don't want anything to happen to you.

126
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,573
I don't want you getting in over your head.

127
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:25,640
Okay?

128
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:28,661
What you don't think I'm cut out for this, ugh...

129
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:30,686
No. Maybe not this one.

130
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,223
Jesus hon, thanks for the vote of confidence.

131
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:38,215
<i>I gotta do this...</i>

132
00:08:38,906 --> 00:08:41,181
<i>I gotta show the whole goddamn world!</i>

133
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:45,355
<i>The parasites transmit signals...</i>

134
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,781
<i>Those transmissions allow them to sense the
others of their kind that're located nearby.</i>

135
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:53,682
<i>They can't talk to each other like
they're on the phone or anything,</i>

136
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:56,970
<i>but if they agree on a kind of "call sign" beforehand,</i>

137
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,390
<i>they're able to exchange simple messages.</i>

138
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,577
Shinichi.

139
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:02,756
They've found him.

140
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:03,623
Got it.

141
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:05,880
We'll meet him at the next corner.

142
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:07,095
Understood.

143
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:13,638
Huh?

144
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:17,454
Huh? Ah!

145
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,308
Glad you came...

146
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:20,980
I didn't think you'd show up.

147
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:21,633
Gah!

148
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,028
Please don't say anything.

149
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:26,281
Now get in.

150
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,873
Who's he? What're you guys planning to do to me?

151
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:35,352
Look, we don't intend to cause you any harm...

152
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:38,308
We're just going some place where we can talk in private.

153
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:42,971
<i>He doesn't need to be so afraid of us...</i>

154
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,442
Honestly, there's so much I want to ask you.

155
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:54,189
But first... I'd like you to
hear about our side of things.

156
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:56,446
Fine. Sure I'll hear you out, okay.

157
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,353
But you gotta tell me what's up with this guy.

158
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,339
There is something wrong with his face!

159
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:03,818
He changed it a bit so you
wouldn't know what he looks like.

160
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:05,443
Uh, y-yeah...

161
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,863
Right... Please listen closely
to what I have to say to you...

162
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,344
My own life is at stake right now.

163
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:12,567
O-kay...

164
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:16,568
<i>And then... I went through everything...</i>

165
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:20,312
<i>all the way from when Migi dug
into my hand right up to the present.</i>

166
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,131
<i>Naturally, he was pretty shocked at first,</i>

167
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:26,184
<i>but the more he listened to my story...</i>

168
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,037
<i>the calmer he seemed to become.</i>

169
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,133
<i>But, even though he had begun to relax while I talked...</i>

170
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:36,365
<i>that skeptical look never left his eyes.</i>

171
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,984
All right. I get the gist of things.

172
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,663
I'm sure you know how crazy this whole thing sounds...

173
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,612
Normally there's no way I'd believe it...

174
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:48,202
but seeing as how there's a
whatever right here in front of me...

175
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:50,755
I have to unfortunately believe at least some of it.

176
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:53,074
So? What do you want me to do?

177
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:56,698
I'm asking you to keep this quiet.

178
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,796
Can you do that for us?

179
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,504
I understand your point but according to your own
account, there are more of these things out there.

180
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:07,514
Can we really just stand by and do nothing?

181
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:08,108
Uh?

182
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:10,842
If you really do care about humanity...

183
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:11,695
Then you...

184
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,165
you have an obligation to come forward on this.

185
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,591
Even if they turn you into some kind of experiment...

186
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:20,222
Even if it means sacrificing yourself,
you have to think of civilization!

187
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,748
You have to think of all of us!

188
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:23,831
Isn't that what it means to be human?

189
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:26,256
What'd I say? We should totally take this guy out!

190
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,148
Agreed.

191
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:28,190
Uh! Ah!

192
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:29,756
Ahh!

193
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:30,594
Stop it!

194
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:33,838
Maybe you should sacrifice yourself.

195
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:36,421
I want you to listen to me very closely.

196
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:39,607
If you have a right to live, then we have that same right.

197
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,241
Granted, the concept of "rights" may be uniquely human,

198
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:48,424
but in any case, you need to understand that
we will do anything to ensure our own survival.

199
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:53,973
And I will not allow him to come forward
and be turned into some kind of specimen.

200
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:56,546
If you're saying that will make you our enemy...

201
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:59,023
I could kill you at a moment's notice.

202
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:01,116
Take a good look at him.

203
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,614
He's a teenager, still in high school.

204
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,414
From your perspective, he's still a child, correct?

205
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:10,408
His mother was killed... He's endured a great deal.

206
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:15,541
He has been forced to step over a pile of corpses,
yet continues to try his best to solve things.

207
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:19,413
I believe this is when you humans
are supposed to experience compassion.

208
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,977
Would you be able to endure all this?

209
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:26,458
<i>Migi doesn't really sound like himself at all right now.</i>

210
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:31,203
<i>I'm sure he's just saying that stuff to
get a reaction out of this guy, but still...</i>

211
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:32,880
Okay listen...

212
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,517
I honestly do not plan to kill you.

213
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,134
Run for it! Hurry!

214
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,613
Yeah... I know.

215
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,828
I have one more question.

216
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:46,424
I want to know: Who asked you to investigate Shinichi?

217
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,280
Yeah right... You know I can't say that.

218
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:51,487
What! Are you serious?

219
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:54,529
Are you really gonna try and pull
some self righteous bullcrap now?

220
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:57,631
Well, we do already have a pretty good idea who it is...

221
00:12:57,664 --> 00:13:00,976
And to be perfectly blunt, your
client is actually a parasite.

222
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:03,127
Wait what?...! That can't be right!

223
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,998
I believe he mentioned her earlier, didn't he?

224
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:09,667
She was the female teacher who just
disappeared from his high school...

225
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,073
Ryoko Tamiya.

226
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:12,973
Who... Who's Tamiya?

227
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:17,369
She's already changed her name, but your
client's name could possibly sound similar.

228
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:21,539
Ryoko Tamiya... Reiko Tamura...

229
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,875
Look I barely even get the concept of having
stupid names, but I coulda figured that out.

230
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:33,176
If you decide to continue digging deeper into this,
it will be your client rather than us who kills you.

231
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:35,046
<i>Son of a bitch...</i>

232
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:46,021
Shinichi Izumi?

233
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:47,938
Ah! It's you!

234
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,454
To think, she got in touch with you
right after we suspected something...

235
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,478
She wants to meet on the roof of the university...

236
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:58,408
What do you think she's up to?

237
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:02,856
Right now, Ryoko Tamiya is one
hundred thirty meters from us...

238
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:05,571
Which means she must be somewhere beyond that building.

239
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,287
She went from high-school teacher to college professor...

240
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:09,924
Very ambitious.

241
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:16,654
Altruism is action undertaken
for the sole benefit of others.

242
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:21,363
It's the opposite of self-interest, and
would seem to have no benefit for oneself.

243
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:25,897
If anything, the action tends help others
while being disadvantageous to the actor.

244
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:26,896
What a cutie.

245
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,598
Aw, so sweet!

246
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:30,393
While these actions may not be
surprising amongst our fellow human beings,

247
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:36,291
what can be interpreted as altruistic behavior
has actually been reported in several animal species.

248
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:38,930
Honeybees are an excellent example of this,

249
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:44,169
they sacrifice themselves, one after another,
to protect the hive if a predator should appear.

250
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:46,284
While this could just be instinct,

251
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,503
some actions would not seem to preserve the species.

252
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:52,660
The prime illustration of such
a practice could be identified...

253
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:54,098
as infanticide.

254
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:58,201
But why kill the offspring of one's own species?

255
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,918
In recent years, what's been discovered is...

256
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:03,468
something called the "selfish gene" theory...

257
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:09,153
To put it in simple terms, all animals are
manipulated by their own body's genetic code.

258
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:11,388
What's important is the self,

259
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,929
and the offspring who inherit that DNA,

260
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:16,158
rather than the species as a whole.

261
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:17,521
That being said...

262
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,416
Let's expand a bit further...

263
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:22,633
We can now justify all altruistic behavior,

264
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,910
such as caring for others in one's "pack,"

265
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:28,522
familial love, marital love and even maternal love.

266
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:33,108
This premise would suggest that love
and compassion don't actually exist.

267
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:40,376
Therefore, all behavior that appears to be love is
really just behavior to aid in transmitting one's own DNA.

268
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,631
To be sure, this theory is not without its problems.

269
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:48,050
There have been countless examples of animals
helping others completely unrelated to them.

270
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:51,713
This includes like creatures from unrelated DNA strains,

271
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,530
and even instances of protecting
those of a different species altogether.

272
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:57,177
Which begs the question,

273
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,697
can a theory like this fully encompass the
complexity or the depth of the human consciousness?

274
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:07,528
For example, it's interesting to consider
whether human efforts toward such issues

275
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:12,875
as environmental-and-natural conservation
are altruistic or selfish at their core.

276
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:15,695
<i>It's almost time.</i>

277
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,365
Who holds a baby like that?

278
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:20,227
Yeah...

279
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:31,650
I'm glad you came. You look well.

280
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,858
Why'd you want us to meet here?

281
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:39,153
I chose this place because
others of my kind rarely come here.

282
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:42,068
Also, there was a lecture I wanted to attend.

283
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:44,236
So it's true.

284
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:46,426
You are quite different from before.

285
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,655
How did the two of you combine?

286
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,417
What really happened?

287
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:53,322
I find it difficult to believe it occurred without reason.

288
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:53,755
Uh...

289
00:16:55,577 --> 00:16:57,974
So is that really... your baby?

290
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:00,244
Yes. It is mine...

291
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,655
I haven't had it long, so I
haven't began working on it yet.

292
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:05,564
Working on it? How so?

293
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:08,471
Your right hand... "Migi," wasn't it?

294
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:12,365
Shall we exchange information again? For both our sakes.

295
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,337
First, I'd like to confirm it was
you who hired the private investigator.

296
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,523
Hm.

297
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:21,287
Didn't you think that doing so
might put you in great danger as well?

298
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:23,333
I don't really worry about it...

299
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,308
I know I can simply assume another
identity, if it comes to that.

300
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:29,747
So what's the deal with this Mayor Hirokawa?

301
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:32,635
Why would one of your kind want to be mayor anyway?

302
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:34,874
I'm not entirely sure myself...

303
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:37,998
And yet... I know that we are still evolving.

304
00:17:38,064 --> 00:17:42,992
We've learned that recklessly slaughtering
human beings for food is not a wise option for us.

305
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:46,102
Going forward, we're going to have to think about...

306
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,637
how we can coexist with humans.

307
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:50,310
"Coexist"?

308
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:53,860
Hideo Shimada said the same thing, you saw what he did.

309
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:58,520
Couldn't it be said that, in a way,
humans and their livestock coexist?

310
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:00,625
Now, that's not to say you're equals...

311
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,303
But still, judging from a pig's point of view,
humans are merely predators that feed upon them.

312
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:09,118
Humans are so fond of grandiose ideals.

313
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:12,601
You grasp onto the notion that
all life on Earth is sacred,

314
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,636
yet you don't behave in such a way.

315
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:18,486
I'll admit, there may be a little truth
to some of the things that you're saying.

316
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:20,460
But that being said...

317
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:24,801
There are reasons why I will never be able to forgive you!

318
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,683
What happened to you?

319
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:31,728
You just don't really seem to be
like a normal human being anymore...

320
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:33,541
I'm not sure how to put it...

321
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,160
A mother and... child...

322
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:50,174
I heard that your mother went missing.

323
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:51,567
Uh...

324
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,324
Was she killed?

325
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:54,202
Ah...

326
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:02,146
Shinichi, calm down!

327
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:11,195
Hahaha... I see!

328
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:13,230
So, one of us ate her.

329
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:13,817
Huh...

330
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:16,667
Ohh... Impressive...

331
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,997
It's like the air is trembling around us...

332
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:20,464
I'm gonna kill you!

333
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:23,063
I think I'd lose if I fought you now...

334
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:26,133
So, I'll have to use the child to shield myself.

335
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:27,317
Ah!

336
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,155
Oh my god! Look?!

337
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:35,048
It's that lady from class.

338
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:40,509
<i>It seems human children are more perceptive than adults.</i>

339
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,995
Be quiet.

340
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:48,394
<i>That bitch...</i>

341
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,625
Move it! Get outta my way!

342
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:58,411
<i>Goddamn humans...</i>

343
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:00,974
What's wrong, Shinichi? You must settle yourself.

344
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,954
<i>She will pay... Her day is gonna come!</i>

345
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,399
So, I'll have to use the child to shield myself.

346
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,753
I haven't had it long, so I
haven't began working on it yet.

347
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,850
Hello, young man.

348
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,163
Yes, <i>you!</i>

349
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:24,696
Huh?

350
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,737
Yes... Come on...

351
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:29,121
Come here... I do reading.

352
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:30,890
Yes that's it...

353
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:33,651
You seem to be full of suffering...

354
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:35,393
Let me see your hand.

355
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,875
Let's go.

356
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:39,470
<i>Left hand?</i>

357
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:41,258
Hmmm...

358
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:45,116
I see you have a hole in your heart now, don't you?

359
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:46,633
Huh?! How did you...

360
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,451
It's a very large hole indeed.

361
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,496
So then how can I...

362
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:52,794
how can I close it?

363
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,871
See the person.

364
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:54,329
What?

365
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,726
You have to meet once again
with whomever created this hole...

366
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,145
You must meet with them and have talk.

367
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:02,782
Then you have closure.

368
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:08,798
Yes... This individual is the
only one who can heal your wounds.

369
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:10,680
There is no other way.

370
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,181
Huh?

371
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:24,045
Too late for that, I already killed her.

372
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:49,086
Next time: "Something Wicked This Way Comes"
