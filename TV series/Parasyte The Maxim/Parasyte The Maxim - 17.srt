1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,319
Good evening, Tamura.

2
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:09,425
We can try to hide them,

3
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:11,827
but they can't be suppressed, can they?

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,803
The strongest signals that we emit
are those which harbor animosity.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,847
I know of your intentions.

6
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:20,843
Get on with it.

7
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:24,155
Why did you not make any attempt to escape?

8
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:26,654
Because I was intrigued.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,499
I fell prey to my curiosity.

10
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,412
Though I must wonder, are there
any others who support your actions?

11
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:37,271
No, it's only the three of us.

12
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:40,918
Hirokawa and Goto know nothing about what we're planning.

13
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:42,191
I see.

14
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:43,739
And your reason?

15
00:00:44,172 --> 00:00:45,534
Call it an instinct.

16
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:51,398
I believe that, going forward, you will prove
to be an extremely dangerous liability for us.

17
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:52,632
Very well, then.

18
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:55,374
You remind me a lot of Mr. A.

19
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:57,006
Mr. A?

20
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:04,822
We parasites have a tendency to think and operate in a
manner that is normally quite logical and uncomplicated.

21
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:09,776
I thought that temperament would make
it easy to create a united organization,

22
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:11,786
but I was mistaken.

23
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:18,118
Still, for the parasites, myself included,
to have such individual differences...

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,866
or rather, such personalities...

25
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:22,897
makes me very pleased.

26
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:27,604
I'm actually moved by your decision to eliminate me.

27
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:30,214
Well then,

28
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:32,436
shall we get started?

29
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:36,808
With only three of you, I hope
you have some sort of plan in place.

30
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,234
Stop her! Kill her!

31
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:43,741
The muscle strength of my host is superior to yours.

32
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:46,667
Therefore, even in single combat, I would win.

33
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:48,927
You seem so certain.

34
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:56,456
Too slow...

35
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,597
Huh?

36
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:04,268
You can keep that.

37
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,907
What is she thinking, splitting in two?

38
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:12,340
I'll go after her.

39
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:23,210
Tamura entered his body.

40
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:25,354
Are... Are you okay?

41
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:26,254
Yeah.

42
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:53,716
Right there, that's her!

43
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,142
Uh, excuse me!

44
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,521
Huh?

45
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:10,498
Why are you putting rocks in your bag?

46
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,259
It's dangerous out here.

47
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:16,536
Did you just see...

48
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:18,458
We saw the weirdest thing back there.

49
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:22,567
We saw a lady just now who looked like she
only had half her head, and she was, uh...

50
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:25,054
she was running around laughing and it was crazy.

51
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,277
Just half of her head? Oh dear, how strange..

52
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:34,920
I still... I still have my
head, but it's empty inside! See?

53
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:44,117
<i>She's lost her purpose,</i>

54
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,842
<i>and can no longer think rationally.</i>

55
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:51,595
<i>There's no way half a parasite can
maintain control of the host body.</i>

56
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:53,395
<i>It's suicide.</i>

57
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,100
<i>Such a waste.</i>

58
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,488
<i>For one so famed for her intellect,</i>

59
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:01,179
<i>how sad for her to die this way.</i>

60
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:10,831
My legs... I can't feel my legs!

61
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:16,335
What is this?!

62
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,585
It's not me! Not ME!

63
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:30,890
<i>One of us is dead.</i>

64
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,854
Ah, you can survive by burrowing inside.

65
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:52,534
But now, can you really take over
completely when you're split in two?

66
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,076
Will you be able to defeat me
using a body that's so badly damaged?

67
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:02,161
Stop it! This is MY body!

68
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,641
Stop it! NO!!

69
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:06,174
Who am I even talking to now?

70
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,924
Is it Hikawa? Or is it Reiko Tamura?

71
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,841
Please stop! I'm on your side! It's me!

72
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:14,260
Really, then why are you moving toward me?

73
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,234
Dammit! I can't control anything below my neck!

74
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:18,466
Just give in.

75
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,674
And die along with that fragment of Reiko Tamura!

76
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:24,501
But I am on your side!

77
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,378
What have you done?

78
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:35,492
Is this really your strategy?

79
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:38,907
The body you attempted to take over now lies in shreds.

80
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,335
Just, come out!

81
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:43,971
How long do you plan to keep hiding in there?

82
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,565
The human part of our body is our weakness.

83
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,749
You should make your strike without all the grandstanding.

84
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:08,553
Even if the host body is destroyed,

85
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:12,313
our parasite cells survive for a short time on their own

86
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:14,301
and emit brainwaves.

87
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:18,722
You're obviously experiencing this phenomenon right now.

88
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:24,467
The strongest wavelengths we parasites
emit are animosity and murderous intent,

89
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,144
as you're well aware.

90
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,989
The ability to detect these is quite important.

91
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:33,946
It's how we determine whether an individual
who's outside our range of vision is friend or foe.

92
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,818
But you cut your own ally into pieces,

93
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:41,026
thereby surrounding yourself with fragments of her flesh,

94
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,758
all of which continue to emanate her signal.

95
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:47,831
That's right.

96
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:50,603
All those fragments were acting as camouflage,

97
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,633
masking my transmissions as I approached you.

98
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:59,292
Goddamn you, that's impossible!

99
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:03,607
Do you know where you came from, and
where it is you're ultimately headed?

100
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:07,898
Have you ever pondered about such
things, as a human being might do?

101
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:14,733
Goodbye, Kusano.

102
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:23,236
Hmm... cannibalism...

103
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:27,879
Hmm? It's unlocked.

104
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:42,901
You are more troublesome than I thought, Mr. Detective.

105
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:51,985
Huh? He left?

106
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:54,227
Well, when did he leave the hotel?

107
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,288
Dad, what are you doing at home?!

108
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:08,729
I'm afraid he hasn't been here.

109
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:12,449
Why the hell are you there?!

110
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,016
Good morning.

111
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,483
I take it you're there to kill him.

112
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:19,215
As a matter of fact, it's quite the contrary.

113
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,698
I was hoping to contact YOU regarding a personal matter.

114
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,455
You know where Hikari Park Number One is?

115
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:32,706
It's very important that you meet
me there this afternoon, at 5:20 PM.

116
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:34,488
What are you talking about?

117
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:36,973
I need to give you something.

118
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:40,664
Seeing as how you're something
in-between human and parasite,

119
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:41,964
it's perfect for you.

120
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:57,843
<i>A mother...</i>

121
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:01,459
It's not right! Something's very wrong!

122
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,699
Who are you? Ryoko!

123
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,279
Where is my Ryoko?!

124
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,139
<i>No one's home today, either.</i>

125
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:21,183
<i>I wonder if something's happened?</i>

126
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:32,966
Uh, hey! Um, Ms. Izumi?

127
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:38,287
Where is... Where is Shinichi?

128
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:40,147
Sorry, he isn't here.

129
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:41,867
I see...

130
00:11:42,474 --> 00:11:45,401
So, are you, uh, Shinichi's mother?

131
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,021
I'm not.

132
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,323
Do I really look that old to you?

133
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,023
Uh, no.

134
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:54,879
But please tell me.

135
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,679
Do you know what's going on?

136
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:57,946
Shinichi...

137
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,663
He's caught up in something bad, isn't he?

138
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,002
What do you mean by bad?

139
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:04,121
Well, I, uh...

140
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,193
I can tell that something is definitely messed up.

141
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:10,620
Shinichi would never say anything about it, but still...

142
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,194
You're worried, aren't you?

143
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,767
Worried about him?

144
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:19,117
I'm quite jealous.

145
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:20,711
Huh?

146
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,766
Don't trouble yourself.

147
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:26,181
Shinichi's actually much stronger than he looks.

148
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,301
And he'll be back home very soon, perfectly fine.

149
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:32,776
But when is "soon"?

150
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:41,672
<i>Where have I seen her before?</i>

151
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:53,477
Seriously though, where did Shinichi run off to?

152
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:54,588
It's just weird.

153
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:56,273
I swear.

154
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,759
Doesn't he know how worried we are about him?

155
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,373
<i>He'll be back, soon.</i>

156
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,544
<i>It could even be today.</i>

157
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:06,712
You... you will...

158
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:09,351
come back, right?

159
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,334
<i>He'll be back.</i>

160
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,064
Hey!

161
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,829
It's okay. You don't have to worry, Murano.

162
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:26,084
<i>He will...</i>

163
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:28,447
<i>He has to!</i>

164
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,162
What's wrong?

165
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:47,752
Where you going?

166
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:49,499
Sorry! Go ahead without me!

167
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:55,844
<i>I think this is...</i>

168
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:58,081
<i>this is where Kana lived.</i>

169
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,324
<i>I wonder if she knew...</i>

170
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,256
<i>the Shinichi that I don't.</i>

171
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,669
No, please wait!

172
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:41,364
What the...

173
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:44,256
How is that girl so damn fast?!

174
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:44,854
Hey!

175
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,684
Goodness, young lady.

176
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:51,906
A nice, young girl like you shouldn't
resort to using such foul language.

177
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:52,450
Uh...

178
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:57,266
Hmm?

179
00:14:58,373 --> 00:14:59,219
What's this?

180
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:05,550
Ah, there, there, there.

181
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,239
Hey, little fella...

182
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:08,869
You're good with children.

183
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:13,456
Well, my wife was the only one
with a job there for quite a while.

184
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,380
So I spent lots of time with my little girl.

185
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:18,971
Aw, you're okay, you're okay.

186
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:25,542
I guess I must've gotten here too early.

187
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,150
Then walk around a little bit.

188
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:30,436
I'd like to get a layout of the terrain.

189
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:31,816
Sure.

190
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:48,769
Even a cold-blooded monster still values her child.

191
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:53,087
I've been doing some extensive research on you humans.

192
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:56,406
And on some level, I'm able to comprehend your

193
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:58,686
rather irrational behavior.

194
00:15:59,294 --> 00:15:59,957
Really?

195
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:02,706
Well, I guess that's good.

196
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:07,885
But you know, you'll never fully understand, right?

197
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:10,150
You don't know what it means to be human.

198
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:12,181
How it really feels to be a parent!

199
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,252
How could you possibly grasp the depth of
the sadness that comes with losing everything?

200
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:19,959
Everything that's ever mattered
to you in your entire life?!

201
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,483
You can't do it!

202
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:27,642
Because I could kill this
innocent child right here and now,

203
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,981
and you wouldn't even so much as bat an eye, would you?

204
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,858
You'd just move on like nothing happened!

205
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:34,953
And you know it!

206
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:38,299
This baby can't really be yours anyway.

207
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:40,251
This baby's human.

208
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:48,579
What is this?

209
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,041
I've never felt this sort of signal from one of my kind.

210
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:55,142
It's Reiko Tamura's brainwave, but...

211
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,113
What is this emotion?

212
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,151
You could never love it.

213
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:04,575
You're completely cold and dead inside.

214
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:09,368
If I could just make you feel even one tiny shred
of the grief I've had to suffer through, then...

215
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,526
I... I wouldn't do it.

216
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:35,633
I would never...

217
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:38,911
No human could ever kill a helpless child.

218
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:40,704
You... you don't...

219
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:45,406
I didn't think...

220
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:47,738
I didn't think a monster like you...

221
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:54,309
Th-that was a sur-surprise.

222
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:05,281
Yes, I'm rather surprised myself.

223
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,880
Reiko Tamura has started moving.

224
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:11,873
She's headed for the corner on the opposite side.

225
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:14,106
So, over this way?

226
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:27,172
What am I even doing here?

227
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,181
I can't believe I came all this way.

228
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:44,214
There's a... There's a man! He's over there!

229
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:48,477
Kuramori!

230
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:52,409
Are you okay?

231
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:54,066
Are you able to talk to me?!

232
00:18:56,073 --> 00:18:58,828
Ah, hey there, Detective...

233
00:18:59,028 --> 00:18:59,940
Where are they?!

234
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:01,347
Are they up on the hill?!

235
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:05,732
Just go! And if you spot one of them, do not hesitate!

236
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:06,571
Yes, sir!

237
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:09,444
Was it Reiko Tamura?!

238
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:10,962
Did she do this?

239
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:13,026
Does Hirokawa know what she's up to?!

240
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:15,414
There's a... a woman...

241
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,302
She's dressed in white... She's holding...

242
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,810
And she's holding a little baby.

243
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:23,221
And there's some blood...

244
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:26,215
My... my blood got on the baby's clothes.

245
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:28,472
Right! We won't let her get away!

246
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,816
There's one more thing I need to know.

247
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:33,573
You mentioned you had a "partner" in your report.

248
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:34,768
Is he a human?

249
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,343
What's his name?

250
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:38,129
Please, you gotta tell me!

251
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,313
He is... human...

252
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:48,675
Like me, he had a small family, and it was taken from him.

253
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:49,699
He too...

254
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:52,274
He also s-suffers...

255
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,735
Talk to me! Tell me who he is!

256
00:19:56,204 --> 00:19:58,979
Yoko... Yumi...

257
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:01,482
I'm coming home.

258
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,263
I'll see you soon...

259
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:05,290
Kuramori!

260
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:07,619
Stay with me, buddy! Come on!

261
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:09,493
I... I would never...

262
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,326
I wouldn't do it...

263
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,221
The baby...

264
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,288
No! Stay with me!

265
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:18,715
Kuramori, please!

266
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:25,377
<i>You were an honorable man...</i>

267
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:28,921
<i>one of the greatest of heroes.</i>

268
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:33,257
<i>And I swear you will NOT have died in vain,</i>

269
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:34,917
<i>Detective!</i>

270
00:20:36,054 --> 00:20:36,974
I understand!

271
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:38,874
White clothes, holding a baby.

272
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:43,347
Don't move! What's your name?

273
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:44,592
Answer me, now!

274
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:49,798
<i>I just pray that Hirokawa's group
hasn't found out about what we're planning.</i>

275
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,061
<i>We cannot let Reiko Tamura get away.</i>

276
00:20:53,405 --> 00:20:54,870
<i>We have to finish her off.</i>

277
00:20:55,272 --> 00:20:55,986
<i>Now!</i>

278
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,453
Next time: "More Than Human"
