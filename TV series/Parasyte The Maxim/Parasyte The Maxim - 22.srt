1
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:08,881
I'm sorry but I have some bad news for you, Shinichi.

2
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:10,395
What is it Migi?

3
00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:11,801
What's going on!

4
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:13,744
You need to hurry up, right now.

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,352
Are you sure it's him?

6
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:18,680
These signals are very intense and focused.

7
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:21,727
And given the speed of approach, he must be in a car.

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,264
Here. Take a right at the corner.

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,083
Great! Now I'm a thief.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,409
Such matters are trivial at this point.

11
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:31,094
So, uh, Migi...

12
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:33,354
I have to ask, when did you learn to drive a car?

13
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:36,760
I did master human language
in a single day, if you recall.

14
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:40,354
Okay, I need a favor from you.

15
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:43,933
Please take us out to somewhere less populated.

16
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:47,052
If we try to fight him in the
city, a lot of people could die.

17
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:49,609
Very well.

18
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:54,266
Also, I have an idea that's definitely worth a shot.

19
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:05,735
Hm?

20
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:48,435
Well?

21
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:52,060
It didn't work. He's still alive.

22
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,489
He's extremely resilient.

23
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:56,579
Let's get out of here.

24
00:02:56,797 --> 00:02:57,646
Where can we go?

25
00:02:58,824 --> 00:02:59,447
Just run.

26
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,750
Okay. Stop here.

27
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:16,911
Why are we stopping now?

28
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:19,164
I thought we couldn't afford to waste time, right?!

29
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:20,068
Take a breath.

30
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:22,918
Until he catches up, we really should strategize.

31
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:24,397
"Strategize" now?!

32
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:27,105
We are about to be chopped into little pieces!

33
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:29,276
Shinichi, I know what you're feeling.

34
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:31,371
Anyone would fear being killed.

35
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:32,811
I'm afraid, too.

36
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,328
But this... this is our moment of truth.

37
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:37,507
Ah...

38
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:41,737
Now remember, you have a strength
that other humans don't possess.

39
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,934
And you can be calm, no matter what the circumstances are.

40
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,777
Now, put your hand on your chest

41
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:49,708
and breathe deeply, like always.

42
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,509
Good. Well done.

43
00:04:02,713 --> 00:04:03,400
Listen.

44
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:07,551
Yes, Goto's abilities outclass ours in every possible way.

45
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:10,940
Simple logic says we have almost no chance of winning...

46
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:14,334
In which case, I say we shift our line of thought.

47
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:19,053
If it's not possible for us to
win even if we work together...

48
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:22,397
then maybe we ought to give working separately a try.

49
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:23,152
Do what?

50
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:27,187
Sometimes sheer strength can be beaten... by pure chance.

51
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:28,159
"Chance," huh?

52
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:32,060
I took a lighter from that car,
and I put it inside your left pocket.

53
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,636
Well now...

54
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,867
They've used the branches to
spread out in all four directions.

55
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:48,376
How uninspired.

56
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,648
This will be a race against time.

57
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:55,844
The human body is our lifeline,
but it's also our greatest weakness.

58
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,494
The cells within you that were once
part of me have since been altered..

59
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:02,553
And are now completely integrated.

60
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,572
Therefore, Goto won't be able to detect you.

61
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,784
He'll come straight toward me
without ever noticing you at all.

62
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:14,192
If this fight goes on too long, I'll shrivel up and die.

63
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:16,547
It's indeed a reckless plan...

64
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:20,682
But that's exactly why Goto
is not likely to see it coming.

65
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:42,069
What's this? No counterattack at all?

66
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,907
<i>Where is the human boy?</i>

67
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:50,690
<i>Once I've found and destroyed the host, it's finished.</i>

68
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:56,653
His body is protected by an armor
of semi-hardened parasitic cells...

69
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:01,258
but I doubt very much that they cover the entire surface.

70
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:04,807
That said, there's no time to
search for the gaps in his armor.

71
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:10,213
But I believe the area least likely to be
protected, and therefore the most optimal target...

72
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:12,757
would be... his head.

73
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,012
Controlling the multiple parasites throughout his torso
and limbs must require a tremendous amount of energy.

74
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:24,272
So it must be very difficult for the head already.

75
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:27,704
That means, if we can remove the head,

76
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,950
he should lose control,

77
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,806
disabling enough protection for
us to be able to destroy the body.

78
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:34,653
<i>Come on, Migi...</i>

79
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,507
<i>If we don't hurry up, then you're not gonna make it...</i>

80
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:39,860
We'll have just one chance.

81
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:44,686
Goto's speed and power are far greater
than mine, so decapitating him won't be easy.

82
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,701
<i>Uh oh. My consciousness is already starting to fade.</i>

83
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,197
<i>I'll have to hurry.</i>

84
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,320
<i>But I still don't have a good angle.</i>

85
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,925
Come out! You cowards!

86
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:57,671
Am I really that terrible?!

87
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:02,358
Spreading out in all directions is
nothing but temporary camouflage at best!

88
00:07:02,384 --> 00:07:05,406
You should be using your brains
to fight, not run and hide!

89
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:07,034
Go now! Do it!

90
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:08,567
<i>Was that my voice?</i>

91
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:10,148
There you are.

92
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:16,104
Hmm?

93
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,585
When exposed directly to fire, Goto's surface
cells will reflexively break away from his control...

94
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,158
And when that happens...

95
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:27,465
U-ugh...

96
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:29,411
Damn! Not deep enough!

97
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,444
That's not good.

98
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:35,577
Migi!

99
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:37,089
Stay back, Shinichi!

100
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:37,909
Are you okay?

101
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:39,620
We have failed.

102
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,286
Well, this is quite a surprise... Well done.

103
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,526
Go, now! Hurry!

104
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:45,048
But you...

105
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:45,685
Just go!

106
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,172
Both of us don't have to die!

107
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:52,976
But still... Migi...

108
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:00,788
What are you doing?! Get out of here now!

109
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,201
<i>Goodbye, Shinichi.</i>

110
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:13,983
<i>This is our farewell...</i>

111
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,359
<i>I'm pleased I didn't take over
your brain when we first met...</i>

112
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,997
<i>Because of that, you and I were actually
able to create many fond memories together...</i>

113
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:25,666
<i>as friends.</i>

114
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,932
<i>I'm... fading...</i>

115
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,222
<i>strangely... sleepy...</i>

116
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:41,130
<i>and I feel... so very...</i>

117
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,356
<i>alone.</i>

118
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:47,070
<i>Such... must be...</i>

119
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:48,770
<i>death...</i>

120
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:48,817
Who's there?!

121
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,803
Uh...

122
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:54,856
Uh... I'm sorry.

123
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:56,322
You a burglar or somethin?!

124
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:57,068
I'm not!

125
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,498
But, yeah, I guess... Well... Sorry.

126
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,629
Huh?

127
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,277
I sorta did try to take a drink of some of your water.

128
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:08,312
Ah, did ya now...

129
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:11,085
I guess that water isn't even free anymore.

130
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,882
Uh, I'm sorry...

131
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:15,092
Well... Um...

132
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:16,769
I should be going...

133
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,733
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

134
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,800
Okay, wait just a second.

135
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:24,605
Yes, ma'am?

136
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,635
Looks like you've been hurt, haven't you?

137
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,377
Uh... No, ma'am. This is...

138
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:31,472
No... On your head...

139
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:34,997
Guessing ya lost that right arm of yours a long time ago.

140
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:37,323
No, I'm all right...

141
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,492
And I think the bleeding's already stopped.

142
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:42,075
Come inside and let's take a look.

143
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,359
But, I...

144
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:44,559
Well come on...

145
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:47,672
I don't think any burglar would be this polite.

146
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:50,330
Besides, you look like you've been crying.

147
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:50,897
Ah...

148
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:53,765
Look kid,

149
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:57,444
I've been livin' on this Earth for a long, long time.

150
00:10:57,469 --> 00:11:00,845
And I can tell if a person's worth a damn or not.

151
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,577
This isn't from a fair fight is it?

152
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,950
Someone bullied you good, didn't they?

153
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:08,187
Am I right?

154
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,107
Uh-huh...

155
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:12,810
This cut's pretty deep actually.

156
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:18,147
Hmph... People out there can do
some awful things to each other.

157
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,732
Uh... Oh...

158
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:31,809
<i>I never expected such kindness from a stranger.</i>

159
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,600
Thank you so much for everything.

160
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:38,586
You should probably stay here for the night.

161
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,991
Huh? No, I couldn't possibly.

162
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:44,654
Where else are you plannin' to go at this hour?

163
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,845
There aren't any hotels around here.

164
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,598
Uh, Ma'am,

165
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:51,162
do you live out here in the country all by yourself?

166
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,732
Nah, I don't have any more family left.

167
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:55,718
Oh... I... I'm sorry, Ma'am.

168
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:57,268
Oh, it's okay, son.

169
00:11:58,383 --> 00:11:59,968
You call me, Mitsuyo.

170
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,670
It's nice to meet you...

171
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:05,610
My name is... my name's Shinichi Izumi.

172
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:08,019
Shinichi?

173
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:10,287
It's nice to meet you, too.

174
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,486
Thanks for this,

175
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,678
I'm sorry to have you help with the shopping.

176
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:17,225
Oh no, it's no problem.

177
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:18,960
It's the least I can do.

178
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:24,972
We should probably tell everybody that you're my nephew.

179
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:25,807
Nephew?

180
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:28,237
A lot of strange things have been going on lately.

181
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:31,277
People really don't like outsiders around.

182
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:32,714
"Strange things"?

183
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:36,746
This is what I was talking about.

184
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:42,680
Some company keeps coming out here and
dumping these huge truckloads of garbage...

185
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:46,956
One time, it actually caught fire
and nearly burned up the whole mountain.

186
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:52,008
The big cities are having trouble
finding room for all their crap,

187
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:54,212
but this is ridiculous.

188
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:54,865
Yeah...

189
00:12:55,084 --> 00:13:02,270
Everybody around here's been trying to keep watch,
but they still manage to slip in here and dump more.

190
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:05,140
I don't know how those assholes do it.

191
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:09,305
<i>Mitsuyo may be a little nuts, but she's got a kind heart.</i>

192
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:13,193
<i>Still, every time I try to thank her and leave...</i>

193
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:16,958
<i>she stops me with another barrage of conversation.</i>

194
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:22,141
<i>With Migi gone, I honestly have no idea what to do next...</i>

195
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:26,253
<i>so a few hours have turned into several days.</i>

196
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:30,630
<i>But I can't keep imposing on her forever...</i>

197
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:34,545
<i>I really must go home and tell Dad what's going on.</i>

198
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:37,941
<i>About how I lost my arm...</i>

199
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:39,810
<i>And how I had a friend...</i>

200
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:41,400
<i>named Migi...</i>

201
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,655
<i>About the day that Migi first showed up...</i>

202
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:46,961
<i>and all the things we did together...</i>

203
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:48,073
<i>And about...</i>

204
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:50,943
<i>about how great Migi was.</i>

205
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:53,818
<i>He fought for me.</i>

206
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:55,826
<i>Saved me...</i>

207
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:58,450
<i>He was intelligent, courageous...</i>

208
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:00,816
<i>And better than I could ever be.</i>

209
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:02,926
<i>Because Migi...</i>

210
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,001
<i>is a true hero!</i>

211
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:12,137
<i>Where am I?</i>

212
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,689
<i>I feel like I've been here before...</i>

213
00:14:16,364 --> 00:14:17,073
<i>What is that?</i>

214
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:18,733
Uh, who are you?

215
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:21,225
What's wrong? Did you lose something?

216
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:22,372
Have I lost...

217
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:25,340
Oh, that's right. I'm looking for a friend.

218
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,710
Looking for your friend? What do they look like?

219
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:30,005
Look like?

220
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,533
I can't really remember that.

221
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:34,642
I'm afraid you're on your own then.

222
00:14:34,724 --> 00:14:35,657
Hey, wait!

223
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:37,832
I think he looked like you.

224
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,329
That's right! I remember now...

225
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:41,661
But... He...

226
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,350
He died.

227
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,731
What? Your friend's dead?

228
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:46,384
Yeah.

229
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,156
No. No he's not.

230
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:50,424
He's still alive.

231
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:51,009
What?!

232
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,229
I can tell.

233
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:54,933
Actually, I know his name, too.

234
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:56,502
His name...

235
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:57,872
His name?

236
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:00,953
Migi!

237
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:10,528
Ah... Migi!

238
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,563
<i>Some of his cells are still inside me!</i>

239
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:16,117
Hey, there...! It's me!

240
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:17,226
Don't you remember?!

241
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:19,714
Keep it down a little bit...

242
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:21,998
You're talking in your sleep.

243
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:25,513
Oh!

244
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:28,058
<i>It's no good.</i>

245
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:30,956
<i>There's still some of him in there but...</i>

246
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,904
<i>not enough to do anything.</i>

247
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,841
<i>Migi...</i>

248
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,178
<i>Migi!</i>

249
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:56,117
I see. Well, I guess it is what it is.

250
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,469
And I suppose I just can't keep you here forever.

251
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,550
I don't know how I'll ever be
able to repay you for your kindness.

252
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,110
Hm...

253
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:05,334
Hm?

254
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,195
What's your problem?

255
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:10,195
Don't you know how early it is?

256
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:12,012
Okay boy, now talk to us!

257
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,482
You really expect us to believe you're her nephew?

258
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:17,083
Hm? Oh what the hell difference does it make?

259
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:19,628
Besides, the kid was just about to head out anyway.

260
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:20,795
Oh, I don't think so!

261
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:23,370
There's been way too much going on around here lately.

262
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,671
All that illegal trash dumping

263
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:28,286
and then that crash between
two cars without any drivers...

264
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:28,766
Uh...

265
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:31,423
And now, we have a murder on our hands.

266
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:32,178
Haah?!

267
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,941
Nakano, you said the killer was some outsider, right?

268
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:37,783
Well take a look at 'im.

269
00:16:40,563 --> 00:16:44,241
I'm tellin' ya, that thing I
saw wasn't just some "outsider"...

270
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,327
This kid has been with me the whole time...

271
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:48,645
It wasn't no human, ya understand?!

272
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,579
I wasn't just seein' things!

273
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:52,179
It was three meters tall!

274
00:16:52,786 --> 00:16:56,011
A-and... that thing it had like four front legs!

275
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:59,031
And a whole bunch of eyes all over the place!

276
00:16:59,221 --> 00:16:59,743
I'm serious!

277
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,668
<i>That's Goto. It's gotta be.</i>

278
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:05,240
Look, you guys can call me crazy all you want...

279
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,063
But this blood, that's all over my coat is from Kitayama!

280
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,637
And some horrible monster killed and
ate him, he lives right down the road!

281
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:15,128
You gotta believe me!

282
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,503
So it was around here somewhere?

283
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,814
Yes sir... that's right.

284
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,609
Oh! Uhh...

285
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:30,683
Ah, that is just horrible.

286
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:33,653
Wait a second, this is just like
those stories that were in the news.

287
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,073
Uhh... The Mincemeat Murders...

288
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:38,544
Right.

289
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:40,931
Understood.

290
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:47,747
A bunch of local hunters are getting together tomorrow,

291
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:52,095
and they ought to be able to take
this "monster" of yours down for good.

292
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:56,787
Hunting rifles... will not destroy him.

293
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,063
Huh? "Destroy him"?

294
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,443
You mean, you know about this monster thing?

295
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:03,965
Yes, I do...

296
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:05,795
That's how I wound up here...

297
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,143
He's after me.

298
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:10,228
Huh?! Oh, quit talking such nonsense.

299
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,880
So this whole thing is my fault!

300
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:13,475
He followed me here...

301
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:15,270
And now more people have been killed!

302
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:19,075
I'm gonna have to keep moving or others will die too.

303
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,277
Come on, son.

304
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:23,707
All I wanted was to live...

305
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:25,749
No matter what it took...

306
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:29,086
Even though some of my friends have already died for me.

307
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:30,668
But I can't...

308
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:34,138
I can't keep running away from this forever can I?!

309
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:36,266
Why can't you?

310
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:44,519
If it saves you then why not? Just keep on running...

311
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:47,725
If it can save your life, then you have to do it.

312
00:18:48,204 --> 00:18:50,628
There's no shame in that, son.

313
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,376
Mitsuyo, I can't.

314
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:56,213
There are things I've avoided that now I must do!

315
00:18:56,906 --> 00:18:59,786
I must sacrifice myself and face that monster...

316
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:02,056
before any more people out there get slaughtered!

317
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:04,009
Oh, shut up and cut the crap!

318
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,497
Don't be a jackass!

319
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:08,326
What is this "sacrifice myself" trash?

320
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:09,941
How can you talk such bullshit?!

321
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:12,187
Who the hell do you think you are anyway?!

322
00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:15,174
Sacrifice yourself? What a freakin joke!

323
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:18,527
What could a snot-nosed brat like you do about it anyway?!

324
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:26,564
Look, I might not know your whole story...

325
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:31,340
but I think you need to sit back and
just let the grownups handle this situation.

326
00:19:39,673 --> 00:19:41,320
So, you're determined are ya?

327
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:45,257
Don't you have someone special out there...

328
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:46,936
someone you care about?

329
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:50,115
Someone you know. Someone you wish you knew.

330
00:19:50,242 --> 00:19:53,032
Just someone out there you can't leave behind...

331
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,136
You know...

332
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,453
S-someone that makes you...

333
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:58,083
human...

334
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:03,075
Look, I don't know what your plan is or anything...

335
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:06,893
but you at least owe it to
yourself to give some thought...

336
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:10,696
to something else... anything else.

337
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,414
Because, son, once you've
thrown it all away, then that's it.

338
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:18,948
I'm just sayin' don't give up, no matter what,

339
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:21,828
and remember that there's always an option.

340
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:31,138
Hold on...

341
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:34,731
Is there anything I can give you that you can use?

342
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:36,620
A weapon or whatever?

343
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:37,371
Uh...

344
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:41,436
Ah... I'll take this.

345
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:44,992
Really, you seriously want that old thing?

346
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,634
Well I guess it's better than nothing.

347
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:48,466
Hm.

348
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,480
<i>Please dear...</i>

349
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,741
<i>Keep that boy safe.</i>

350
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,035
<i>If Goto has changed his appearance...</i>

351
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,890
<i>then there'll be no way to recognize him...</i>

352
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:18,846
<i>But I guess...</i>

353
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:20,628
<i>I'll just have to deal with it...</i>

354
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,343
<i>whenever that time comes...</i>

355
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:49,113
Next time: "Life and Vows"
