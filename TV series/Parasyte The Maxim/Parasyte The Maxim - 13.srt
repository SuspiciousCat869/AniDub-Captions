1
00:00:03,232 --> 00:00:04,299
Hey, Shinichi.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:05,160
Huh?

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:06,810
Did you hear what happened?

4
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:10,138
You know, about the girl who
got killed in the next town over?

5
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:11,086
She, um...

6
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,512
Yeah, I heard about that!

7
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:14,802
There's like a ton of rumors going around!

8
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:18,287
And I heard the body was found
by none other than you, Shinichi!

9
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,866
Good grief, Akiho!

10
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:50,259
You okay?

11
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:52,781
Mm-hm, what about you?

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,505
All right, I guess.

13
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,994
So, um...

14
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,419
The other day...

15
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,090
we were supposed to go see a movie.

16
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:08,666
But uh...

17
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:14,012
Yeah, well everything happened.

18
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,394
It's just awful.

19
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:22,330
Yeah...

20
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:03,045
In spite of all the many feeding locations we prepared,

21
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:06,291
he chose to feed outside the designated areas,

22
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:07,802
and was therefore killed.

23
00:03:07,827 --> 00:03:09,484
It's an unfortunate incident.

24
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:13,414
Not only did he allow himself to
give in to the immediacy of hunger,

25
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,486
he fought against his own kind, which is very selfish.

26
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,928
He acted as though he were an animal.

27
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,856
We're better off he's dead.

28
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:22,648
If only it were that simple.

29
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:27,533
We have now provided the humans with
another sample for them to examine.

30
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:30,624
And of course, the perpetrator has yet to be revealed.

31
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,391
Do you think this could've been done by a human?

32
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:35,456
Yes...

33
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,231
and we know exactly who it was.

34
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:42,103
The boy who found the dead human female.

35
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:44,158
Shinichi Izumi.

36
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:48,046
He was probably enraged when he
saw that his friend had been killed.

37
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:50,569
He was "enraged"? His "friend"?

38
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,791
Are you saying that this boy's brain is entirely human?

39
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,652
Yes, his brain remains intact.

40
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:59,178
And he's coexisting with his parasite.

41
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,301
He's quite a valuable specimen.

42
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:03,335
"Valuable specimen"?

43
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,758
He could also be viewed as a threat.

44
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:10,879
Right now, I am making an effort to
ensure a more secure future for all of us.

45
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:14,626
I'd like you to consider my
research on him as part of that.

46
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,307
Very well, I'll leave the matter of
this boy in your hands for now then.

47
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:21,624
Oh yes, and by the way...

48
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:23,475
How is your child, Tamura?

49
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,461
Just like a normal human child.

50
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:29,565
Though I am rearing it with human assistance.

51
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:30,955
Oh, goodness.

52
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:33,972
Oh, what's the matter?

53
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,393
What can I do for you?

54
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:38,477
I already changed your diaper.

55
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,024
Whatcha' need?

56
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,121
Mommy's home.

57
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,400
Well, hello, welcome back.

58
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:52,092
Be quiet.

59
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:56,268
I've trained it well, haven't I?

60
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:57,318
Huh?!

61
00:04:57,652 --> 00:05:00,736
Thanks for your help. Please
do come back again tomorrow.

62
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:04,432
O-of course! If you'll excuse me!

63
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:14,866
<i>For me to conduct the proper experiments,</i>

64
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:17,429
<i>it will need to grow a little more first.</i>

65
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:25,457
I've followed him around for a week, but so
far I've found nothing much out of the ordinary.

66
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:28,116
It's intriguing that his mother's gone missing,

67
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:32,875
and that he was also recently a witness in
that high-school girl's mysterious grisly murder.

68
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:36,337
Otherwise, he seems like a
completely average high-school student.

69
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,833
Yes, yes, that's correct.

70
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,881
I understand.

71
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,331
Please continue your investigation.

72
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,084
An average high-school student?

73
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:50,746
Human observational skills are less than impressive.

74
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:54,780
However, there are some things that only humans can do.

75
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:58,309
I couldn't test him using Hideo Shimada, but...

76
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:02,930
Perhaps... I can arrange something.

77
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:13,801
You're Shinichi Izumi, right?

78
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:34,067
All right, who put you up to this?

79
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:37,910
Uh, it was... it was a woman.

80
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:40,166
A woman? What's her name?

81
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,308
I don't know. She just came up to us today.

82
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:44,741
I'd never seen her before.

83
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:57,205
Yo!

84
00:06:58,633 --> 00:06:59,367
Kamijo...

85
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,433
Why're ya looking so miserable
first thing in the mornin', little man?

86
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,727
C'mon, I don't look that bad, do I?

87
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,031
Are things going good with your girlfriend?

88
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,967
Y'mean good like how?

89
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,572
Don't play dumb with me.

90
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,331
Have ya done it yet or what?

91
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:16,432
What? No, cut it out. It's nothing like that.

92
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:18,159
Aww, whatever...

93
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,424
Hey!

94
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:23,017
This is a tough subject for
me to bring up with you, but...

95
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,127
there are some rumors about... Shinichi.

96
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,194
Huh?

97
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:30,129
I've heard that HE found the body in the latest murder,

98
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,212
and that the dead girl was actually a friend of his.

99
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,249
Yes, I knew that.

100
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:37,295
So, what else about it?

101
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,599
Has your brother found out anything?

102
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,254
No, nothing so far.

103
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,471
Don't you think it's weird,
after something like that happened,

104
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,433
Shinichi is so calm?

105
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:48,790
He's kinda acting a little too normal.

106
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:51,550
Morning.

107
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,607
Uh, see you later, Murano.

108
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,151
So, what's with her?

109
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:57,570
Oh, it's nothing.

110
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:01,695
<i>Even back when... when he saved my life,</i>

111
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,682
<i>he seemed so calm and strong.</i>

112
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:06,264
<i>It was almost like...</i>

113
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:08,579
<i>he was someone else.</i>

114
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:16,049
<i>But still...</i>

115
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,071
<i>was there really nothing between him and Kana?</i>

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,848
<i>No, that's not the point.</i>

117
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,360
<i>Even if nothing WAS going on,</i>

118
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:27,375
<i>he's still kind of... cold.</i>

119
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,700
Are you...

120
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,007
Oh, sorry! I have to...

121
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:33,208
to run some errands.

122
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:34,773
Oh... Huh? Uh...

123
00:08:38,357 --> 00:08:39,839
Okay, I might have something.

124
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,969
This kid has some incredibly fast moves.

125
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:45,056
It's amazing. I mean look at this!

126
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:48,517
Okay then, did you happen to
notice anything else about him?

127
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:50,308
Huh, well, whaddya mean?

128
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:52,867
Well, like... something unnatural...

129
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:57,175
For example, did the movements of
his right hand seem peculiar in any way?

130
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,166
Ah, well, I dunno.

131
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:02,063
I don't really remember anything like that.

132
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:05,093
<i>If that's the case,</i>

133
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:08,056
<i>some unique variation must have occurred.</i>

134
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:12,794
I wonder what's wrong with Murano?

135
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,792
Maybe... maybe she's just worried,

136
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,044
because of everything that happened to Kana.

137
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:22,837
Hang on... Of course!

138
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,372
She's supposed to be worried.

139
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:29,539
With all the stuff that's been going on lately,
I'm the one being weird for acting so calm about it.

140
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:31,164
That's exactly what's it is!

141
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:32,900
What are you talking about?

142
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:34,980
You make an excellent human being.

143
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:38,021
You can separate yourself from needless emotions.

144
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:40,661
Migi, you're not helping.

145
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:43,074
You're making me lose even more confidence.

146
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,935
In any case, you can sometimes
be overheard when speaking to me.

147
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:52,569
Whenever you grow more agitated, your voice
becomes loud enough for your father to find it strange.

148
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:56,984
Dad?

149
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:57,876
Hm?

150
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,876
I'm going out for a bit.

151
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:02,133
All right, don't stay out too late.

152
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:02,992
Right.

153
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:19,257
<i>A bit late to be going out, kid.</i>

154
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:31,423
<i>This is the same town where that girl was murdered.</i>

155
00:10:56,084 --> 00:11:00,418
<i>So you find the body of your friend, and now
you're going back to the scene of the crime?</i>

156
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,383
<i>Something's going on.</i>

157
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:06,690
<i>The way he was moving earlier,
and now whatever this is...</i>

158
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:11,213
<i>What're you up to Shinichi? What're you hiding?</i>

159
00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:15,771
Shinichi...

160
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:17,451
What are we doing here?

161
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:19,761
I can't explain it, but...

162
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:21,602
The way I am now...

163
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:26,022
It's like, more and more, I just forget
about anything that's painful or sad.

164
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,601
It simply disappears.

165
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,589
And is that wrong?

166
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:33,446
I was never like this before.

167
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,314
I used to obsess over the smallest
things. I worried all the time.

168
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:41,229
That, of course, is a waste of energy.

169
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:43,914
That's not the point!

170
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:46,084
<i>Who're you talking to?</i>

171
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:48,801
<i>Yourself?</i>

172
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:57,595
I think Kana was out looking for ME and
ended up following that monster instead.

173
00:11:58,035 --> 00:11:59,201
And it got her killed.

174
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:02,138
It was because of me!

175
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:04,668
You really shouldn't think like that.

176
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,842
No, for her, I need to try to...

177
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:10,597
This might sound kinda strange,

178
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:13,914
but I want to be able to mourn Kana's death.

179
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,313
I don't want to forget what sadness feels like.

180
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:21,930
I'm a human being.

181
00:12:22,987 --> 00:12:23,830
Uh-huh...

182
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,310
Ah, Jesus Christ!

183
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,364
Migi, what the hell're you doing?!

184
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,778
What do you think? I'm going to kill him.

185
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:47,011
Wait! Stop it!

186
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,550
Run for it! Hurry!

187
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:53,296
Shinichi, don't interfere!

188
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:54,948
What are you doing?! Run!

189
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:15,706
I don't have the body mass to cut him in half.

190
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,499
Not good.

191
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:22,521
He's getting farther away.

192
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:24,819
Someone, help me!

193
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:26,598
Migi...

194
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:31,173
Look, do you seriously not
understand the position you're in now?!

195
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:33,833
We've just been seen up close by some complete stranger!

196
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:35,570
And he had a camera!

197
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,677
Let's go! Follow him...

198
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:38,867
and kill him!

199
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:41,292
No way! We can't kill him!

200
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,708
Migi... stop it!

201
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:52,113
Shinichi, I don't understand, you've
seen a great number of humans die already.

202
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,497
So, what's the difference if one more dies right now?

203
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:56,574
Besides, it's for our own protection!

204
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,673
There's no reason to hesitate!

205
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,934
Just forget it! I won't!

206
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,013
That's going too far!

207
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:09,630
I'm tired...

208
00:14:11,738 --> 00:14:13,746
Killing humans is out of the question.

209
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,064
We can't do that.

210
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:16,933
I don't care what the reason is.

211
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:18,976
He's gone.

212
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:22,754
It would be too late to catch him now anyway.

213
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,088
You sure took your time.

214
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:32,145
Did something happen to ya?

215
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:33,847
No, Dad.

216
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:35,709
Everything's okay.

217
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,550
Get some sleep.

218
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:57,050
That male appears to have been targeting
you specifically in his investigations...

219
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,684
which means that, even though he knows a lot about us,

220
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,691
we do not know anything about him.

221
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:09,197
If that man turns out to be a
police officer or someone in the media,

222
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:11,400
or a member of some government agency,

223
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:13,559
then I'm afraid we're already done for.

224
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:16,517
And if that's the case, we'll
be made into lab rats for sure.

225
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:18,621
<i>Lab rats...</i>

226
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:25,769
Shinichi?

227
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:29,531
Oh...

228
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:42,235
You're a damn monster! Have
you really been eating people?!

229
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,961
You... You stay away from me!

230
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,483
Leave me alone, Shinichi! I don't know you anymore!

231
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:47,865
Get out of here!

232
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:50,659
Mr. Izumi?

233
00:15:51,146 --> 00:15:52,292
Mr. Izumi?!

234
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:53,519
Hey!

235
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:56,544
Pull your head out and wake up.

236
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,313
It's your turn to read the next section.

237
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:01,021
If you're not going to make an effort, then just leave!

238
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:06,081
Uh... What are you doing?!

239
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:11,069
Holy crap, he totally just left.

240
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:12,783
Shinichi...

241
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:27,230
<i>They'll come for us. I know it.</i>

242
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,716
<i>They're going to come get me
and turn me into an experiment.</i>

243
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:35,973
But before that happens, it's possible
that one of my kind could eliminate us.

244
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,025
Either way, there will certainly be consequences.

245
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:40,447
You can count on that.

246
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,847
<i>Whaddya I do?</i>

247
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:44,657
<i>What the hell should I do?!</i>

248
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:48,036
<i>Maybe I should just cut my arm off right now.</i>

249
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,011
<i>While Migi's still asleep!</i>

250
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:54,070
<i>No, I can't.</i>

251
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,406
<i>Who was that guy?</i>

252
00:16:58,888 --> 00:16:59,917
<i>Who's after me?</i>

253
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:01,370
<i>After us?</i>

254
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,592
<i>I bet... I bet he's still watching, right this minute!</i>

255
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:09,256
Mommy! Over here!

256
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:11,109
Saki, please wait!

257
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:14,696
Next up, for the traffic report
with Mr. Fukada from Metro.

258
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,596
Package for a Mr. Bulat.

259
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:30,596
Hey! Don't go! Listen to me!

260
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,505
Please just hear me out! Please!

261
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:41,764
Why is this...

262
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:43,964
Why is this happening to me?

263
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:49,793
<i>It's not fair...</i>

264
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,381
<i>I don't deserve this!</i>

265
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:00,754
<i>I seem to be able to calm down in seconds.</i>

266
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,071
<i>That's just how my body works now.</i>

267
00:18:05,872 --> 00:18:07,791
<i>I guess there's no turning back.</i>

268
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:09,443
<i>In which case...</i>

269
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:11,735
<i>it's time.</i>

270
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,033
What's up?

271
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,357
What did you want to meet with me about?

272
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,492
Uh, well... It's, uh...

273
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:25,479
I wanted to ask about Yuko.

274
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,253
Huh?

275
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:27,765
I mean, um...

276
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,674
She's back to her regular, cheerful self again.

277
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:32,708
She didn't even get a scar or anything.

278
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:36,772
Did you seriously call me out here just to tell me that?

279
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:39,490
Ah! No, uh... not really.

280
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:43,284
I just wanted... to talk while we still could.

281
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,889
Come on! That makes it sound
like you won't ever see me again.

282
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:51,299
Uh, that's not it.

283
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,200
Shinichi, you seem kind of depressed.

284
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:00,272
The truth is, I'm a little off myself.

285
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,943
Hey, is it okay if I go first?

286
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:05,555
Uh... Sure.

287
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:08,712
I've been trying not to let it get to me,

288
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:10,650
but I just can't help myself.

289
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:13,308
It's about... Kana.

290
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,275
You canceled our date that day so
you could meet up with her, right?

291
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,075
It was for something important, wasn't it?

292
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,445
At least, something more important
than going to see a movie with me?

293
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:29,760
I... I've wanted to tell you about so many things!

294
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:32,120
So tell me! Just say something!

295
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:34,120
Shinichi, you can tell me anything!

296
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:39,540
You've been preoccupied with
something for a while now, haven't you?

297
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,095
And not about what happened to Kana. What is it?

298
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:42,768
Nothing.

299
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:43,863
You're lying!

300
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,550
You look miserable.

301
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,920
And whatever it is,

302
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,684
it's so big that even someone dying
isn't enough to really shock you anymore!

303
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:54,460
Come on, Shinichi! What is it?!

304
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:56,512
That's not...

305
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,748
That's not how it is, okay?

306
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:03,091
Shinichi, you're so strong.

307
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,760
I really think you are.

308
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,494
But even so, there are times when
I simply can't bear to look at you.

309
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:13,960
I can see you trying so
desperately to hold something back.

310
00:20:16,512 --> 00:20:18,576
Please, what happened to you?

311
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,139
Don't do this by yourself; Talk to me.

312
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,544
I wish...

313
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,587
No, no! Nothing's going on, really.

314
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:38,341
How can you possibly expect
me to believe nothing's wrong?!

315
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:39,294
Forget it!

316
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,567
I can't even talk to you anymore!

317
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:44,826
<i>No, please don't say that.</i>

318
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:48,343
<i>I need you... I need you... I need you more than anything!</i>

319
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,706
<i>I'll tell you! Yeah! I'll tell you!</i>

320
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,522
<i>Murano, something happened to me.</i>

321
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:59,130
<i>I have a... I have a...</i>

322
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:07,584
There's nothing going on.

323
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:13,759
It's like you don't trust me.

324
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,977
