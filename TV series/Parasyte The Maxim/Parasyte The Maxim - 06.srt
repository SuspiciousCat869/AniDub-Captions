1
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,215
Uh? Ah...

2
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,554
I have punctured the boy's heart...

3
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,007
Your human host is now dead.

4
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,212
And you will follow in a matter of minutes.

5
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:05,440
Now you must accept your fate as one
who was unsuccessful in seizing the head.

6
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:11,898
There's no time to waste.

7
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:15,757
A direct hit to the heart is critical
and cannot be repaired very quickly.

8
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:21,187
At this rate, Shinichi's brain
will soon be rendered inoperable...

9
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:26,987
My only available option is to merge myself...

10
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,100
with his heart.

11
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:31,656
As I am sealing the wound,

12
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,783
I must initiate heart function while
also circulating the blood within myself.

13
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:41,359
The parasite we just encountered seems to have
successfully relocated to another host's head,

14
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,631
but this is a far riskier venture.

15
00:02:58,193 --> 00:02:59,676
Ah...

16
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,333
Good. It seems this might actually work.

17
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:12,388
But I can't expect an instantaneous recovery.

18
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:17,057
I'll slowly gather cells from throughout
his body to aid in the healing process.

19
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,620
In the meantime, I will begin to
gradually return to his right hand

20
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:23,213
through his bloodstream...

21
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:27,072
Huh? Shinichi's absent again today?

22
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:31,562
Yeah... I heard the teacher tried calling
his house a few times, but no one answered.

23
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:33,745
I'm really worried.

24
00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:36,029
Wanna swing by there later?

25
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:36,864
Yeah, sure.

26
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,907
Oh, but we don't know where he lives...

27
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:42,696
I do... I sorta went home with
him after school the other day.

28
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:43,380
Huh?!

29
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:44,887
Hey, Murano!

30
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,905
I didn't know you and Shinichi were a thing.

31
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,407
Is it serious?

32
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:50,924
What?! No! I mean we're not a thing.

33
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:55,049
Oh yeah, excuse me. You just went
home with him "casually"... Hehe...

34
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:56,762
Akiho, this is none of your business.

35
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:58,867
Quit being so nosey, get your own life alright.

36
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:01,508
C'mon, I want all the juicy
details! What'd you do at his house?

37
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,792
So are Shinichi and Murano... Really dating?

38
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:06,089
I don't know. Who cares!

39
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,652
C'mon, girl spill it! Gimme some dirt!

40
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:09,749
Could you just drop it?

41
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:10,601
Seriously.

42
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:22,561
Sugar.

43
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,058
Uhh...

44
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:07,912
Hmm...

45
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,213
Huh?!

46
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:17,781
Hm...

47
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:48,488
<i>The wound... It's sealed...</i>

48
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:52,127
<i>But it looks like it's been fused together or something.</i>

49
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:56,577
<i>Migi?</i>

50
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,152
<i>Did Migi heal me?</i>

51
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,162
Ahh...

52
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:12,544
It wasn't...

53
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:16,931
It wasn't a dream?!

54
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:29,301
Hello?

55
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,888
Ah, I'm glad we finally got you!

56
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,225
I'm calling from Sakurazaki Hospital.

57
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,581
Have I reached Mr. Kazuyuki Izumi's residence?

58
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,272
Yes...

59
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,443
Ah! My Dad! That's my Dad!

60
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,786
Oh, don't worry. He's fine.

61
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:49,617
He's getting some rest at the moment, but he's
in stable condition, and he's not in any danger.

62
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:52,146
I just wanted to suggest, when you come to visit,

63
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:54,067
if you could bring him a change of clothes and maybe some

64
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:55,125
I'll be right there!

65
00:06:58,054 --> 00:06:58,572
Oh!

66
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,999
Shinichi?

67
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:13,363
Um... You haven't been to school lately,

68
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:14,855
so I came to check on you.

69
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:17,717
You mentioned that your parents were on vacation,

70
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,884
so I was worried that maybe you had gotten sick,
and you were just laid up here all by yourself...

71
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,281
Uh...

72
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:30,181
Found out my dad was in an accident while they were away.

73
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:30,670
Oh?!

74
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:38,153
Wow... your mom must really be struggling right now.

75
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:39,427
Uhh...

76
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:40,143
Oh!

77
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:46,850
Look... I won't be back at school for a while.

78
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:50,438
Uh...

79
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:51,998
Shinichi...

80
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,207
Shinichi!

81
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,347
You... you will...

82
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:05,984
come back, right?

83
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:15,231
<i>I'll kill it! That thing is dead!</i>

84
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,202
<i>It was able to get away...</i>

85
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:33,734
<i>but not before Dad had the chance to
see what that monster really looks like...</i>

86
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:35,667
<i>in its true form.</i>

87
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:38,008
So then the male...

88
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,276
has not yet returned?

89
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:43,086
<i>But how did it find our address?</i>

90
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,857
<i>From their luggage... or at their hotel?</i>

91
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:50,756
<i>I'm sure it won't be long before that
thing figures out which hospital Dad's in.</i>

92
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:54,596
<i>I don't have much time... I have to hurry!</i>

93
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:57,942
Um... um, excuse me!

94
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:58,416
Hm?

95
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,330
Are you doing okay?

96
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:05,707
You uh, you look like you're kinda worried or
something, so I thought I'd see if you're alright.

97
00:09:05,732 --> 00:09:07,301
Are you from Sakurazaki?

98
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,035
Yeah. I am.

99
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:12,118
So, do you know Sakurazaki Hospital?

100
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:14,819
Oh! Yes. I know where that is.

101
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:19,294
So, Mr. Izumi, it was the night of the 18th, correct?

102
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,991
That's when you say your wife was killed.

103
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:22,977
Yes.

104
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:29,022
Has she...

105
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:32,549
Has my wife's body been found yet, Detective?

106
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:33,627
Mr. Izumi...

107
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,815
I believe your wife is very much alive.

108
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:37,768
Huh?

109
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:39,355
On the 18th...

110
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:43,198
that's the day on which you reportedly
struck your head and fell into the ocean...

111
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:46,446
Your wife returned to the hotel alone about 9:00 pm.

112
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:47,639
That's impossible!

113
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,058
We did confirm...

114
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:52,037
The staff at hotel's front desk said they spoke with her.

115
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,585
She told them you had to leave on urgent business,
but that she would stay on for one more night.

116
00:09:56,945 --> 00:09:58,826
She then checked out the following morning.

117
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,280
No... That can't be right!

118
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:06,809
It had to be somebody else!

119
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:12,133
Um sir, the hotel staff confirmed the burn
mark located on the woman's right forearm.

120
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:15,524
They've stated that they're certain she
was the same person who arrived with you.

121
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,281
Mr. Izumi...

122
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:19,681
In my opinion,

123
00:10:19,946 --> 00:10:21,728
I believe that the terrible shock you've suffered

124
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:25,534
is causing you to confuse reality
from before your traumatic accident

125
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:27,771
with perhaps a nightmare you had afterwards.

126
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,913
No way... That was not a dream!

127
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,592
I know what I saw!

128
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:38,173
Ugh... Uh...

129
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:41,097
This is it.

130
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,897
Thank you so much.

131
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:45,373
Hehe... See ya!

132
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:50,056
Yes. He's right down there.

133
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:53,633
Huh?

134
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:55,235
Dad, I'm here!

135
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:56,259
Huh?

136
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:00,979
Shinichi.

137
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:04,556
Dad... I uh...

138
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,425
I'm sorry that I made you worry, Son.

139
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:08,991
Dad...

140
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:11,397
But Mom... she's...

141
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:16,768
<i>Uh, I can't handle this...</i>

142
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:19,656
<i>It hurts so much I can barely talk...</i>

143
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:21,780
<i>and... and I can't even cry.</i>

144
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:24,321
Shinichi, what's wrong?

145
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,320
It's Mom, Dad she's...

146
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:33,090
Shinichi... About that...

147
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:35,653
It seems that something has happened to your mother...

148
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:37,623
and well, we don't know where she is.

149
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:38,268
Huh?

150
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:40,037
But, Dad...

151
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:43,025
You saw it!

152
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:44,178
Saw what?

153
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:45,560
What do you mean?

154
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:49,423
Well... The doctor says that I'm confused... like

155
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:52,200
looks like I hit my head pretty hard, Son.

156
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:54,821
<i>But Dad... No...</i>

157
00:11:57,054 --> 00:11:59,785
I've asked the police to keep up their search for her...

158
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,821
The doctor wants me to stay here for a while
longer, but it's nothing serious. So please don't worry.

159
00:12:05,113 --> 00:12:06,076
"Don't worry"?

160
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:08,586
How can you even say that?!

161
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:12,763
Shinichi, did something happen back home?

162
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:15,279
What? Well of course something happened!

163
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,800
Mom has been murdered by some monster!

164
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:19,259
Dad, you know that!

165
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:24,059
Is that what I told you?

166
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,150
I told you all that nonsense... on the phone?

167
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,382
Ugh... I'm sorry!

168
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:31,977
I'm so sorry! I was losing it!

169
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:35,449
<i>What? Does he really think it's all in his head?</i>

170
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:39,762
Son, I'm going to recover and be just fine.

171
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:43,747
I want you to try and take it easy
for a few days, and go back home.

172
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:46,993
I know it's tough, but hang in
there just a little bit longer.

173
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:49,840
If you have any problems, then you
can always go to your uncle's house-.

174
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:52,115
Dad. I need to tell you something.

175
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,595
Hmm?

176
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,032
It's about Mom and the monster-

177
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:55,810
Shinichi!

178
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:56,283
Uh...

179
00:12:57,673 --> 00:13:00,173
Please. Not right now...

180
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,280
<i>Dad...</i>

181
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:04,281
<i>He's crying...</i>

182
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,518
<i>He knows, doesn't he?</i>

183
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:08,801
<i>He knows that Mom is dead.</i>

184
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:13,409
<i>I want to tell him the truth
about what that monster really is...</i>

185
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:16,167
<i>About the creature that killed her.</i>

186
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,265
<i>If only Migi...</i>

187
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:23,415
<i>If only Migi was actually an ally of humanity.</i>

188
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,143
Here, I brought you some clothes.

189
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,884
So where are you going to stay, Shinichi?

190
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,425
Here with you.

191
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:36,685
C'mon you know you can't get a good night's rest in here.

192
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:39,565
They told me about a hotel that's right by the beach.

193
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:41,067
That's where you should be staying.

194
00:13:46,546 --> 00:13:47,706
<i>I'm at a hospital...</i>

195
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,376
<i>and Migi's asleep...</i>

196
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:52,318
<i>This could be my chance to get him looked at!</i>

197
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,664
<i>No, now's not the time.</i>

198
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:58,123
<i>I need his abilities to find the enemy.</i>

199
00:13:58,449 --> 00:13:59,528
<i>And fight them.</i>

200
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:01,550
<i>I hate to admit it, but...</i>

201
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,776
<i>I have no choice but to trust Migi and rely on him.</i>

202
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:10,943
Huh?! The Sakurazaki Hotel, is that far away from here?

203
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:12,694
Um, no, not far at all.

204
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,453
In fact, it's just a few blocks away from here.

205
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:19,079
<i>A few blocks...</i>

206
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:22,830
<i>That's at the edge of Migi's
ability to detect our enemies.</i>

207
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:24,979
<i>If that thing shows up at the hospital,</i>

208
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:27,179
<i>we might not be able to make it in time.</i>

209
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:35,936
<i>This is perfect.</i>

210
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:38,364
<i>Right behind the hospital.</i>

211
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:41,033
Hello, excuse me.

212
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:42,956
Uh...

213
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,963
I guess, you'll be needing a room?

214
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:47,579
It's you!

215
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:48,412
Hehe...

216
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,326
Hey, Mom! We have a guest checking in!

217
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:58,276
<i>Dad must've seen it...</i>

218
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,171
<i>He saw Mom get killed.</i>

219
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,055
At some point,

220
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,761
I'm going to have to tell him everything I know.

221
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:08,769
But for now...

222
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,343
I just have to keep him alive...

223
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:14,460
<i>and avenge Mom's death.</i>

224
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,954
Excuse me... your dinner's ready for you downstairs.

225
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:25,888
Get it while it's hot!

226
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:27,199
Thanks.

227
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:27,743
Hm-hm.

228
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,079
<i>I could totally tell that she was coming.</i>

229
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,018
<i>Are the walls that thin,</i>

230
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,482
<i>or has my hearing somehow improved?</i>

231
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:42,872
Shinichi.

232
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,988
I thought I might keep this to myself,

233
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,663
but I've decided to tell you.

234
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,576
It's very important.

235
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:53,500
The feelings you have for your
family are incredibly strong...

236
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,001
However, your feelings for me
are practically nonexistent...

237
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:01,986
Actually, I know you think of me
as more of a hinderance at best.

238
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,945
And while we do act as allies, one
could say that we are really enemies

239
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,029
forced into a difficult situation.

240
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,041
Yeah, so what's your point?

241
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:15,213
You see, during the time that I
was repairing your damaged body,

242
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:18,004
it would seem that my body underwent a change as well.

243
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:19,331
A change?

244
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:21,434
That's correct.

245
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:26,475
I have now developed a weakness that
others of my kind have never experienced.

246
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:29,698
Every day now, for about four hours,

247
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,551
I fall completely and totally asleep.

248
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:35,534
That's it? But you've always gone to sleep.

249
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,674
Not like this...

250
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:40,613
Previously, even the slightest
disturbance would awaken me immediately.

251
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:44,134
For instance, if you were surprised,
or if your breathing was uneven.

252
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,327
Or if...

253
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,704
one of my associates approached within 300 meters.

254
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,523
"Associates"?

255
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,698
Correct...

256
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:53,712
But since this change has occurred,

257
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:56,646
it appears that while asleep, I am able to detect nothing.

258
00:16:56,866 --> 00:17:00,391
So, if an enemy were to appear
during that four-hour sleep cycle...

259
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,389
it would mean...

260
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:03,875
the end for both of us.

261
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:04,501
Oh...

262
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,613
Repairing your heart

263
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:10,637
meant that I had to spend an extended
period of time detached from your arm.

264
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:15,069
And as a result, my physiology has been slightly altered.

265
00:17:16,249 --> 00:17:18,973
Why would you wait so long to tell me about this?!

266
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,622
Well, ever since one of my
fellow parasites killed your mother,

267
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:25,718
you have been harboring a great
deal of hostility toward me.

268
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:31,100
You must realize that revealing one's
weakness to an enemy is extremely dangerous,

269
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,381
so that's why I said nothing until now.

270
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:37,583
However, I determined that if you
weren't made aware of this problem...

271
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,879
the situation would become
even more dangerous for us both...

272
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:42,519
Do you understand?

273
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:49,843
Yes, I do... But I don't really think of you

274
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,001
as an enemy anymore, Migi.

275
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,290
You did save my life, you know.

276
00:17:57,767 --> 00:18:00,082
That's not entirely accurate, of course...

277
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:03,361
Since there was my life to consider as well.

278
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:07,596
Morning!

279
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,492
Oh... good morning.

280
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,995
Oh, hey... There's more color in your cheeks...

281
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:18,375
Yesterday you were looking kinda ragged, ya' know.

282
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:20,372
Hmm...

283
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,691
So I guess you slept well, then.

284
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,432
Oh, thanks.

285
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,258
It's been a while since you
were able to read the paper, huh?

286
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,773
It has. When I fell into the water...

287
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:36,214
my tablet and my cell phone
were both completely destroyed.

288
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:39,060
Then we'll have to get you new ones when you get home.

289
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:42,343
Uh-huh... When're you uh?

290
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,409
I'm gonna stay a bit longer and see how things go, okay?

291
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:52,190
<i>Whenever Migi is in a deep sleep...</i>

292
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:55,208
<i>I'll have to use my own eyes to keep watch.</i>

293
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:59,032
<i>I'll try to have Migi sleep
during the day if that's possible,</i>

294
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,818
<i>when people are around and
there's less chance of an attack.</i>

295
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,267
<i>Now, if that thing does show
up here, how would it approach?</i>

296
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,262
<i>Migi told me not to fight unless he was awake...</i>

297
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:12,479
<i>but I may not be given a choice.</i>

298
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,618
<i>I'll have to defend myself somehow.</i>

299
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:17,993
<i>Besides, I am not going to run from my mother's killer!</i>

300
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:20,488
Hello there!

301
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,234
Uh...

302
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:22,848
Hey, uh...

303
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,029
It's...

304
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,991
It's Makiko, isn't it?

305
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:27,657
You can call me Maki.

306
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,969
Have you been sitting out here all this time?

307
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,046
I guess you must be really worried about your father, huh?

308
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:34,806
Um... Well, yeah...

309
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,013
And I don't really have much else to do.

310
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:38,297
Ah...

311
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:41,840
Um, do you have a girlfriend?

312
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:42,408
Huh?

313
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,656
Shinichi. I sense one.

314
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:46,129
Huh...

315
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:50,055
It's just about 300 meters away,
in the direction of the beach.

316
00:19:50,515 --> 00:19:51,256
<i>It's here!</i>

317
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:54,302
Hey Maki, which way is it to get to the beach?

318
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:54,988
Huh?

319
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:58,368
If you head straight down the road back to my place and...

320
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,378
Huh...

321
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:00,951
Wait, hold on!

322
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:03,377
If you just go straight, you'll hit the seawall!

323
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:04,077
Stop!

324
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,141
Hold on!

325
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:13,210
Hey!

326
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:15,949
He's so fast!

327
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:20,101
Shinichi. I need to confirm.

328
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:21,061
Yeah, what?!

329
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,761
Is it all right to kill her?

330
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:34,723
Yes! Something like that cannot be
allowed to roam free in this world...

331
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,621
I cannot allow it!

332
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:42,121
Ahh...

333
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:46,689
You just took off before I got the chance to
finish telling you exactly how to get there.

334
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:50,849
To get down to the beach, you're gonna
have to circle around the west side... Huh?

335
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:54,022
Whoa!

336
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:58,214
<i>Huh? I just saw it down at the far end of the bridge.</i>

337
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,107
<i>This is it!</i>

338
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:06,163
Shinichi, I have something else I need to tell you.

339
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:08,349
And it's something about you.

340
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,294
It has finally become clear to me that you have...

341
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,170
Just save it!

342
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,494
<i>You're not getting away!</i>

343
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,652
<i>You will pay...</i>

344
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,480
<i>for what you did to my mother!</i>

345
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,336
You're dead!

346
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:49,153
Next time: "A Dark Night's Passing"
