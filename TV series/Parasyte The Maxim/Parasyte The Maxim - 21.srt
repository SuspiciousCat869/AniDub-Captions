1
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:07,788
Ah, hello.

2
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:16,629
Yayoi Squad has engaged Hirokawa.

3
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:18,408
Do not let him get away.

4
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:19,954
Make sure he's taken out.

5
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:55,887
Welcome, gentlemen,
so nice of you to come.

6
00:01:57,648 --> 00:02:00,594
It is certainly an honor to have you all here.

7
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,447
When it comes to the art of death,

8
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:07,979
every species on Earth pales in
comparison to that of the human race.

9
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:14,228
Yet, as I look at the fine instruments you hold,
I feel they could be put to a FAR greater purpose.

10
00:02:14,488 --> 00:02:18,614
Such implements of force can be
used not for simple eradication,

11
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:23,012
but rather the protection of
the balance of our very existence.

12
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:28,016
That's right: To purge those
who offer nothing to our community.

13
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:32,935
Because when put to task, all
of us must admit an obvious truth:

14
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:37,184
That not everyone in our vast population
deserves to be part of our family.

15
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:41,410
Instead, they attack our
values. They attack our ecosystem,

16
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,002
in a crime of arrogant apathy far
greater than that of crude genocide.

17
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:47,815
Yet, hope is here.

18
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:49,738
It's staring you in the face.

19
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:51,912
It may be different and seem frightening,

20
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:53,635
but you will come to cherish it.

21
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:59,554
The time has come that we must hold our own
predators in high regard, and in fact protect them.

22
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:01,465
And the most fascinating thing,

23
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,180
is that these predators will ultimately
allow us to grow stronger and more powerful.

24
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:09,119
They are our saviors, our masters.

25
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,381
And they will restore the balance that we could not.

26
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:15,466
<i>Hirokawa...</i>

27
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:20,189
Not long ago, someone on Earth had a passing thought:

28
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:24,357
"All life is sacred and must therefore be protected."

29
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:27,441
Who do you think you are, you monster?!

30
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:31,717
This is why I cannot abide my own kind.

31
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:36,524
If defiance is truly your intention,
do not pretend and act otherwise.

32
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:40,768
Even environmental conservation is
skewed in favor of our own hubris,

33
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:43,458
a viewpoint most refuse to acknowledge!

34
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:48,979
We MUST consider all life on Earth, not
just the prosperity of a single species!

35
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:51,854
That presumes your own rule over creation!

36
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:54,865
Humans repeatedly claim they're on the side of justice,

37
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,277
and what greater justice is there than natural selection?!

38
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,491
The human race has been inhabited,

39
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:04,871
and relinquished of the sacred duty
by preserving the balance of life on Earth!

40
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:09,178
Thus, exposing YOU as nothing
but parasites infesting this planet!

41
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,451
It's you...

42
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,696
You are the infection!

43
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:21,961
We're the... infection?

44
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:23,747
Fire!

45
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:51,795
What's wrong?

46
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:00,149
The mayor... was a human.

47
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:00,901
He what?!

48
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:21,293
Hirokawa, huh?

49
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:25,131
Right up to the end, I never did quite understand him.

50
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,846
Reiko Tamura was especially intrigued by him,

51
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,536
and had several initiatives underway.

52
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:36,368
But that's all over now.

53
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,505
This must be rather upsetting...

54
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:44,513
a human like this among you.

55
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,546
No... no... I don't...

56
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:53,603
Wh-what the hell is this? What happened here?!

57
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:58,028
I'm tellin' ya, this was that guy from before.

58
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,196
He's more powerful than the others are.

59
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:03,664
I mean you can't even shoot him.

60
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:10,146
Report.

61
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,124
Hirokawa has been neutralized, but...

62
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,640
Well, another parasite has arrived.

63
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:18,546
We'll meet Minazuki Squad and head over there.

64
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:19,704
We're on our way now.

65
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:25,053
U-Uragami...

66
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,615
You bastard!

67
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,912
Oh man, my hand's all numb.

68
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:32,470
Guess that's why knives've always been my thing.

69
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,720
Say "cheese."

70
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,172
Holy shit!

71
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:42,191
It blew his whole hand off!

72
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:47,265
You had to know this would happen,
Detective. I mean, I was already on death row.

73
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,671
I've got nothing to lose.

74
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,636
<i>Now to get outta here.</i>

75
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:58,288
<i>That big guy is so powerful
he'll break through eventually,</i>

76
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,821
<i>and that's MY chance.</i>

77
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,379
Reiko Tamura would often question our purpose here,

78
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,707
and wonder why we were born.

79
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,147
I guess... none of that matters anymore.

80
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,516
The reason for my existence is to fight.

81
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,653
Shinichi, let's go home.

82
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:35,253
There's no point in us staying any longer.

83
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,704
After all, our work here is finished now.

84
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,638
How can you be so sure about that?

85
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:44,333
And besides, we really have to see
if that Goto guy can be taken down.

86
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:46,001
It doesn't matter.

87
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,846
The humans have already won.

88
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:52,644
If they really wanted to, they could
use cannons or missiles or even bombs.

89
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,302
They can do whatever they want.

90
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:59,183
At this stage, we, as individuals,
no longer have any say in what happens.

91
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:02,773
You're acting strange, Migi.

92
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:27,950
Fire!

93
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,102
How can he move like that?

94
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,652
You can do better than that.

95
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:54,002
Humans are supposed to be the most intelligent
life forms on the planet. Isn't that right?

96
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:58,218
He can dodge gunfire?!

97
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:03,033
I can do more than that.

98
00:09:03,632 --> 00:09:05,327
I'm improving all the time.

99
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:11,308
Please, please don't shoot me!

100
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:12,390
Open fire.

101
00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:13,632
They're beyond our help.

102
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:15,185
No, don't!

103
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,430
<i>If this monster is able to move like this,</i>

104
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:29,618
<i>then that drastically limits our firing options indoors.</i>

105
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:32,618
<i>We're at too great a risk of shooting our own men.</i>

106
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,499
<i>We need a more open area.</i>

107
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:36,325
Let's fall back!

108
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:40,555
To the roof. Let's go, now!

109
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:46,918
One more round.

110
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,852
But shouldn't that have finished him?

111
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:56,740
Stay vigilant. We need to be twice as
cautious, and engage him on our terms.

112
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,257
<i>This guy's comfortable using
the walls, floor, and ceiling.</i>

113
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,310
<i>Standard indoor combat tactics are useless here.</i>

114
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:08,156
<i>This place is his lair,</i>

115
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:09,877
<i>and we're inside it!</i>

116
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:14,326
<i>It's sad to think we humans lost our advantage</i>

117
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:16,794
<i>in a structure we created.</i>

118
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:21,358
All right, split up left and right!

119
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:22,712
We'll take him out here!

120
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:29,683
What talk is this?

121
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:34,211
Son of a bitch...

122
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:36,772
You're all alone, Captain.

123
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:39,715
You don't have any more men left to help you out.

124
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:41,912
Although, I should say...

125
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,243
They wouldn't've helped anyway.

126
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:52,225
That body of yours seems to be rather special.

127
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,182
It's like it's armored!

128
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:55,737
That's correct.

129
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:59,331
But it doesn't protect my entire body, unfortunately.

130
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:01,072
There are gaps.

131
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:06,184
Through sheer firepower, you actually
got the better of me to some extent.

132
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:15,514
Even if I harden my cells,

133
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:19,059
deflecting gunshots head-on is still a risky proposition,

134
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:21,832
which is why I deflect them at an angle.

135
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,169
Godammit! Don't toy with me!

136
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:31,793
Although I am able to dodge gunfire,

137
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:34,479
it's not that I actually move faster than a bullet.

138
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:39,016
I just predict its trajectory based
on my opponents' eye and hand movements.

139
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,291
Did you hear that?

140
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:51,012
I think it came from the roof.

141
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:02,600
What the hell are you, anyway?

142
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:07,839
As you can clearly see, I am
simply a pure, feral life form.

143
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,167
You're... an abomination.

144
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,192
And what are humans exactly?

145
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:17,796
Go to Hell.

146
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:22,768
Oh a flamethrower, huh?

147
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:25,334
That might've been a good idea, kid.

148
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,787
See that? Something fell from up there.

149
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:44,317
Hey, what was that for?

150
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:46,126
I told you we should leave.

151
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:48,002
Well, well, it's you.

152
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,709
Ah, Goto!

153
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,207
I see...

154
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:56,842
So you were involved with this attack, too.

155
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,649
And it was a rather intense battle at that.

156
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:03,209
In fact, it seems that all
others of my kind were destroyed.

157
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:06,250
And if you were a part of this operation,

158
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:09,685
there's still some unfinished business here.

159
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:13,349
I'm sure killing you will be most satisfying.

160
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:16,811
And besides, I believe I need to kill you.

161
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:20,399
And when it's done, I will move forward.

162
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:21,990
"Move forward"?

163
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:27,870
Your aim was actually quite accurate,

164
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:30,181
if you intended to target the heart.

165
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,233
What in the hell?

166
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:35,338
But this fight must wait.

167
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,094
There are too many others,

168
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,882
and I'm feeling a bit tired today anyway.

169
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:44,870
He... he just flew!

170
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:49,979
Shinichi Izumi, what have you done?

171
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,818
Huh?! I didn't do anything!

172
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:54,565
I didn't! I swear!

173
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:56,129
Wait right there!

174
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,969
A lot of men died, well trained men...

175
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:03,193
men under Yamagishi's command.

176
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:05,867
You saw it. All it took was one monster,

177
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,680
and it was able to overtake us.

178
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,911
You expect me to believe you knew nothing?

179
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:12,850
You're doing it again.

180
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,810
You're hiding something, dammit!

181
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:21,532
No, I'm not! I honestly had no idea that just
one of these things could do something like this!

182
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:22,674
A head!

183
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,238
Someone's head fell off the roof!

184
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,844
Hey, Shinichi.

185
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:42,000
Shinichi, that was a terrible dream.

186
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:47,471
Migi, how do you know what I dreamed about?

187
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:49,388
I just do somehow.

188
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:52,605
Will Goto be coming after us?

189
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:55,721
He most definitely will, and it'll be soon.

190
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,318
I could sense how strong his resolve was.

191
00:14:58,993 --> 00:15:01,601
So... We're going to die.

192
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,916
No, we can't give up that easily.

193
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,978
We should try to go get some help.

194
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:10,075
Like Uda, for example.

195
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:11,155
Forget it.

196
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:14,013
We can't drag those two into this.

197
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:15,978
Well, we can get the humans to help.

198
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:18,953
They can deploy the military against him again.

199
00:15:18,978 --> 00:15:20,147
How can we do that?!

200
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,996
And even if we did, countless more people will die!

201
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:26,211
And we'd be responsible for their deaths!

202
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:28,985
Why should I care?

203
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:35,638
Migi...

204
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,219
You never really do change, do you?

205
00:15:42,194 --> 00:15:42,756
<i>Dad...</i>

206
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:46,013
<i>I'm afraid I might be saying goodbye soon.</i>

207
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,110
<i>And Mom...</i>

208
00:15:49,993 --> 00:15:51,823
<i>I might be seeing you again soon.</i>

209
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:55,051
I got it.

210
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,916
Why don't we just run somewhere far away?

211
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:02,504
I mean he's not... He can't be so obsessed
he'd track us across the country right?

212
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,094
Hey, Migi, are you asleep?

213
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:13,976
Ah! I forgot to go to school today.

214
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,379
Hahaha... school...

215
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:22,916
<i>Are you asleep?!</i>

216
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,113
<i>Migi!</i>

217
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,457
If he shows up now...

218
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,964
If he... if he shows up now...

219
00:16:58,993 --> 00:16:59,518
Hey!

220
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,051
You gonna apologize, asshole.

221
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,361
I... I'm sorry.

222
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:08,598
He's totally scared, dude!

223
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:11,159
Get down on your knees.

224
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:16,512
Please forgive me. I am so sorry.

225
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:17,989
That's a good boy.

226
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:24,835
I apologized, didn't I?!

227
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:26,613
You got what you wanted, huh?!

228
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:28,389
I said it! I said it!

229
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,007
Are you happy now?!

230
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,303
Shinichi?

231
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:46,960
Um, hey there.

232
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,279
Ah, so did you really skip school again today?

233
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:57,239
Uh-huh.

234
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:01,045
I sure did.

235
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,038
Just the kind of guy I am, ya know?

236
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:06,943
I'm a scumbag.

237
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,300
Uh, what was that?

238
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:11,083
You're acting weird.

239
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:21,252
Wha...

240
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,248
Stop that! It hurts!

241
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,908
Please, let go.

242
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:30,374
Stop it!

243
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,249
Shinichi?!

244
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:52,467
Your idea to run far away may not be a bad one, Shinichi.

245
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,950
Oh, hey. Guess you were awake then, huh?

246
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,622
Just run away... Yeah...

247
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:04,654
And right when I'm finally so close to graduating.

248
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,295
Shinichi...

249
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,945
Your senses seem to be a little dull at the moment.

250
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:17,431
Well, hello there.

251
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,976
How did you know you could find me here?

252
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:26,123
You really like this park, don't you?

253
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:28,820
I kinda like it, too.

254
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:32,903
I'm sorry about before.

255
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:35,576
I didn't mean to scare you like that.

256
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:39,979
You're a pretty mysterious guy, y'know, Shinichi?

257
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,478
Sometimes, I just don't get you at all.

258
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:49,874
It's cold out here.

259
00:19:50,947 --> 00:19:52,462
You wanna come over to my place?

260
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:54,364
So we can talk?

261
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:57,545
There's nobody else home now.

262
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:03,268
<i>Your true nature shows when your life is on the line.</i>

263
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,307
<i>And it turns out, I'm just pathetic.</i>

264
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,641
<i>All I can think of is that I don't wanna die.</i>

265
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:15,242
<i>I want to live!</i>

266
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:18,913
<i>And I wanna keep living.</i>

267
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,943
<i>I've often told Migi he's cold-blooded, but...</i>

268
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:31,796
<i>but I don't have any right to say that.</i>

269
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:34,345
<i>When all's said and done,</i>

270
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,286
<i>I've only made it this far by stepping on those around me.</i>

271
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:42,931
Shinichi...

272
00:20:44,106 --> 00:20:46,555
You're actually a pretty good guy, aren't you?

273
00:20:50,737 --> 00:20:53,365
The two of us have gone through
a lot together, haven't we?

274
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:56,705
So even if something bad happens, we'll be okay.

275
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,147
We can make it.

276
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,130
Murano...

277
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:03,898
I think that I might...

278
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,769
love you.

279
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:13,924
Shinichi, that's a heavy thing to just drop on a girl.

280
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:20,915
<i>I will live!</i>

281
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:24,179
<i>I'll do whatever it takes!</i>

282
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:49,240
Next time: "Repose and Awakening"
