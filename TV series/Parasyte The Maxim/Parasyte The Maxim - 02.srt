1
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:03,646
A-ahh...

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:08,645
I... right hand... failure.

3
00:00:13,648 --> 00:00:15,033
It's because of the canine.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,364
Maturation and environment were
factors, but it was lax with its studies.

5
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:52,638
Hehe...

6
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,578
Hey little lady. You a college student?

7
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:56,565
No? Really?

8
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:57,729
You work around here?

9
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:01,498
Ah, come on. It's okay. We just wanna talk to ya.

10
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:03,165
I'm sorry. Excuse me please.

11
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:04,898
Aw, now what's the big hurry.

12
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:06,265
You're not leavin' yet are ya?

13
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,422
Yeah. Dontcha wanna have some fun?!

14
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:10,498
Just relax...

15
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:11,622
Urk! Ugh!

16
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:14,431
Hey what do you think you're...

17
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:14,846
Gah!

18
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:16,233
Ugh!

19
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,004
I'll walk you.

20
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,104
AAAAHH!!

21
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,542
Think you can just walk away fancy pants?!

22
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:41,140
Uhhh...

23
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,383
I don't think my stomach can hold all four of you.

24
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:48,634
Your stomach?

25
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:57,153
Seems two swings was more force than necessary.

26
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:58,694
Aaaahh!!

27
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:04,644
I should probably change my appearance as well.

28
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,072
I take it you don't feel the
need to go to the police anymore?

29
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:18,772
Uh-huh. I think I realized that if I ran
into another one of you parasite things...

30
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:21,797
without you I'd be a pretty easy target to kill.

31
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:23,796
A very wise decision.

32
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,631
You know, I should probably give you a name.

33
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:32,153
No thanks. I do not have the needs
of human beings. Nor am I your pet.

34
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:37,087
Well I need to call you something, I
can't just call you "you" or "righty".

35
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:39,646
In that case... you can call me Migi.

36
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,048
What? Migi?

37
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:45,953
Well sure. It means the same thing,
but doesn't sound nearly as silly.

38
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:50,105
Hmm... Well I'm not so sure if I'd say that...

39
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:52,958
Well, you're the one who wanted a name.

40
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:55,217
I see no need for them anyway.

41
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:10,365
Nice shot! Whoo!

42
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,938
He's got some nice moves.

43
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:14,448
Huh? Well... I...

44
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,518
Shinichi!

45
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:16,519
Huh?

46
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:20,846
Murano here says that she'll totally
forgive you if you manage to make another shot!

47
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:22,450
What are you doing Yuko?

48
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:24,868
Uhh...

49
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:26,643
Hm...

50
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:34,940
<i>What's his problem?</i>

51
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:43,606
Five seconds left!

52
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,557
<i>Welp! Here goes nothing!</i>

53
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:47,658
Aah!

54
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,645
Ha ha ha!

55
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,987
Uh... oh!

56
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:57,078
Thank you, Migi.

57
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,202
Pretty good, eh, Murano?

58
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:00,398
Uh-huh...

59
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:03,272
Piece-a-shit, Shinichi...

60
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:05,836
Oh!

61
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,463
Oh, look at the time, I gotta go!

62
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:14,419
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,749
I really wasn't trying to grab you like that yesterday.

64
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:20,494
It's just... My hand just
sorta went off on it's own and...

65
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,737
anyway... I'm really sorry!

66
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:26,314
Well I'm glad you know what you did was wrong.

67
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,808
Yes, yes it was!

68
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,222
It was so very wrong!

69
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:35,396
Well maybe I can find it in my heart to forgive
you if you treat me to pancakes next Sunday.

70
00:05:35,742 --> 00:05:36,693
But hear this!

71
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,316
If you ever pull any crap like that again you're dead!

72
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:40,918
No, no of course.

73
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:42,329
I won't, I promise.

74
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:44,784
Hehehe...

75
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,627
Okay then. I'm holding you to it.

76
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:50,404
Hah...

77
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,180
Hmm?

78
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:56,902
Everything's just fine, don't worry!

79
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:58,036
It's all good.

80
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:04,851
Um... Shinichi?

81
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,448
You are... you are Shinichi Izumi... aren't you?

82
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:11,176
Well yeah...

83
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,692
Yeah of course I am!

84
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,990
What are you talking about?

85
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:19,562
See ya!

86
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:24,243
Are you crazy, what do you think you're doing, man?!

87
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,338
I was just curious about your human mating behavior.

88
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:30,326
I could sense you wanted to
mate with that female, correct?

89
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,470
Huh?!

90
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,442
No, no I did not want to "mate" with her!

91
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:35,147
Shinichi!

92
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:35,824
Huh?

93
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,379
Come outside with me.

94
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:39,829
Now.

95
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:49,929
So why are you in there talking to
yourself, ya practicing your pickup lines? Huh?!

96
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:51,882
Uh, well...

97
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:54,394
I should probably go get changed...

98
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:58,696
Hold it! I've had my eye on Murano
since we were both in middle school.

99
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:00,515
Oh yeah? Is that so?

100
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:02,179
You stay away from her.

101
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,025
Eh... Haha...

102
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,260
Come on, I don't want any...

103
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:05,820
Ugh!

104
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:08,302
Aahh... God...

105
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:10,143
What's your deal man?

106
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,260
Ah!

107
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,027
Uuhh...

108
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,423
Gaahh...

109
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:16,414
Come on, get up! You too much of a wuss to fight back?

110
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:17,542
Come here!

111
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:21,030
<i>I can't...</i>

112
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:24,640
<i>If Migi gets involved, this guy
is gonna get seriously messed up.</i>

113
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,010
You're even weaker than I thought you'd be!

114
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:30,796
Don't do it.

115
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,081
Ugh!

116
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:38,920
Take it easy, you need to hold back you idiot!

117
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:43,541
An "idiot"? That word is to be used when
addressing a being of lower intelligence.

118
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:45,729
You didn't kill him, did you?

119
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,282
He'll be just fine.

120
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:53,060
Huh?!

121
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:55,256
Ooh! Aah!

122
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,623
I'm detecting urine in your bladder.

123
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:03,106
It isn't healthy to suppress your
excretory functions in this manner.

124
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,076
Shinichi.

125
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:10,448
Jesus, Seriously?!

126
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,939
I told you not to talk whenever there's people around!

127
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:14,145
Please hold still.

128
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,391
I'm going to try to make your sex organ erect.

129
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,693
The hell you are!

130
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:21,272
Huh? Ah! No, no, no! Stop that!

131
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,792
I cannot believe you!

132
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:28,290
Shinichi. That's cold.

133
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,896
Be... quiet...

134
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:34,001
If you do not wash properly, dermatophytes
will propagate, causing such maladies as jock itch...

135
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:35,027
I said shut up!

136
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:38,974
Dude, it's kinda hard for me to pee
next to a guy talkin' to his pecker.

137
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:40,749
Ah-ahh! Uhh...

138
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:44,076
The "Mincemeat Murders"?

139
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:47,824
Yeah. From what I've heard, it seems that
they've been happening all over the world.

140
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:49,959
The victims are literally torn to pieces.

141
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,282
The police have been trying to keep it quiet, but
some really graphic videos have been showing up online.

142
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,360
What about the killer?

143
00:08:56,825 --> 00:08:58,112
Still out there somewhere...

144
00:08:58,627 --> 00:09:04,164
The thing is... there's no way one person could commit so
many murders all over the world at the same time, right?

145
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:08,765
There has to be more people involved in
this, like some kind of crazy cult or something.

146
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,026
Well, what does your brother say about it?

147
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:12,719
He's a detective, isn't he?

148
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:17,364
Yeah, well... I asked him about it the other
day, but he won't tell me anything right now...

149
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:21,545
Which hopefully means that the cops and
the government are already working on it

150
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,632
and trying to figure out a way to solve this thing.

151
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,000
So then, I guess this means that
more of your kind are out there, huh?

152
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:36,580
Most certainly.

153
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,824
When we ran into that canine I learned something.

154
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,727
It would seem that those inhabiting dogs only eat dogs.

155
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:46,447
While those who inhabit humans will thus only eat humans.

156
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:48,594
Essentially, we are cannibalistic.

157
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,466
What are you thinking, Shinichi?

158
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:55,660
Should we really stay quiet about this?

159
00:09:55,732 --> 00:09:58,081
What exactly do you mean by "stay quiet"?

160
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,317
We can't let them run wild.

161
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:02,907
They're killing people left and right.

162
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,816
What do you mean, "run wild"?

163
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:06,166
Don't you get it?!

164
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,485
Only WE know what they really are!

165
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:11,820
At this rate, there will be
more and more victims every day.

166
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,310
Which is why...

167
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:14,541
"Which is why" what?

168
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,925
If I take you to 'em...

169
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,398
They can research you...

170
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,844
And learn what you are...

171
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,184
I don't understand.

172
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:22,716
Your logic's a bit difficult for me to follow.

173
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:26,111
My kind are simply feeding to stay alive and nothing more.

174
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:29,101
It's natural for life forms to feed on other life forms.

175
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:32,483
You just find it unpleasant that
it's your own kind that is being eaten.

176
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:33,992
Well yeah of course!

177
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:36,702
Human life is a precious thing, isn't it?

178
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,146
I don't know.

179
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:41,007
I can tell you that I value my own life.

180
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:45,366
Although I've never really considered
any other life form to be all that valuable.

181
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:47,247
Yeah... bet you haven't.

182
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,485
'Cause you seem to be more like an animal or an insect.

183
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,966
Shinichi...

184
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:54,252
is that an attempt to be insulting?

185
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:55,880
Understand this.

186
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:59,109
If you were to take action in
any way that would be harmful to me,

187
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:02,467
I would have no choice but to do
everything in my power to stop you.

188
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:03,492
Uh-huh...

189
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,754
Your survival depends on me.

190
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:07,288
You're just a parasite.

191
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,408
I will protect your life.

192
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:13,623
Although... you don't necessarily
need to be able to speak.

193
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:14,570
Ah!

194
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:18,978
And then... you don't really need
to be able to see or hear either.

195
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:19,778
A-ah...

196
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:24,225
Well... Looks like someone's terrified.

197
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,415
Perhaps you should maybe take a little rest.

198
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:34,840
You're a demon...

199
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:40,767
Shinichi, I have done some research into
the concept of these "demons" you speak of.

200
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:44,611
And I would say that humans are the
life forms most closely resembling them.

201
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,369
Humans tend to kill and eat a
multitude of different life forms,

202
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:51,037
while my kind simply eats only one or two.

203
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,557
We're quite frugal and efficient in comparison.

204
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,560
Oh, whatever. I'm not listening.

205
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:02,670
People out there are being killed.

206
00:12:03,203 --> 00:12:06,231
And I'm the only one who truly knows what the killers are.

207
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:18,748
Mincemeat...

208
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:24,230
Hmm... Such a shallow breed.

209
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,966
They grind cows and pigs into feed, and
then act so surprised when it happens to them.

210
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,450
Hmm?

211
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,690
Well now...

212
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,479
Isn't this unusual.

213
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,224
It's one of my own.

214
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:43,135
Shinichi.

215
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:45,573
One's coming this way.

216
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:46,197
Huh?

217
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,743
It's one of my kind.

218
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:50,163
It's somewhere over in the crowd to our left.

219
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:57,649
There are too many people for me to identify
the individual, but I'm certain that one's there.

220
00:12:58,297 --> 00:12:59,415
We need to fall back.

221
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:02,950
A single misstep now, and it could
mean another fight to the death.

222
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,049
Walk faster. It's getting closer.

223
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:13,515
Maybe it wants us to join your little cannibal club.

224
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:19,391
Shinichi! Where do you think you're going?

225
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,079
It's forty meters away, right behind you.

226
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:23,406
And it's gaining on us.

227
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,192
I'm going to meet him.

228
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:27,934
I want to look this murderer right in the eye.

229
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:30,853
Don't be so foolish. You'll get yourself killed.

230
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,732
Then I guess you'll just have to protect me.

231
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,164
This is different.

232
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,347
We won't be up against a dog this time.

233
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,462
No one will be able to see us back here.

234
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,657
I have much to learn about the human mind.

235
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:49,501
You seem to be completely numb to fear right now.

236
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:51,253
Tell me. Why is that?

237
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:54,254
A lot of people have been
killed since these murders began.

238
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:58,036
<i>If I don't do something, Murano could be one of them.</i>

239
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:00,746
I know you think that I shouldn't do anything about it.

240
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:03,543
That I should let these things
go on killing people, but I can't!

241
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:06,509
I've got to fight! Fight for humanity!

242
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:09,824
For humanity then... I see.

243
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:12,167
And I'm going to need your strength to do it.

244
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:14,002
I need your help.

245
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:16,298
Migi please...

246
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:17,394
Five meters.

247
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:19,449
Uhh...

248
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,592
Now I see...

249
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,331
So this is the reason you were running away.

250
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,858
Your host's brain is still
completely intact and functional.

251
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:39,233
A rather dangerous situation wouldn't you say?

252
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,799
Shut the hell up, you monster!

253
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,345
Excuse me?

254
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:47,309
Stop right there!

255
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:50,854
If you attack this human, I will be
forced to retaliate and destroy you.

256
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:52,271
Take it easy.

257
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:53,993
I understand.

258
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:56,232
I can appreciate where you're coming from.

259
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,927
But you must realize...

260
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,824
you do have the option of simply moving over to me.

261
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:02,011
A transfer?

262
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,725
I don't think relocation's possible at this point.

263
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,024
What's that?

264
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,235
Looks like you still have a lot to learn.

265
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:13,091
Relocating from a mere appendage to a more
complex structure would indeed be impossible.

266
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,366
That said... moving from one arm to other is simple.

267
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:27,598
Well then?

268
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,268
I've created a location for you to join me.

269
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:32,168
You should fit quite nicely.

270
00:15:35,696 --> 00:15:38,919
Well? What are you waiting for, it's time to transfer.

271
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:42,852
Once we inhabit the same host,
we'll both become more powerful!

272
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:44,762
What's the matter?

273
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,721
It's simple: Kill your human and relocate over here.

274
00:15:47,752 --> 00:15:49,709
I'm losing a lot of valuable blood.

275
00:15:51,176 --> 00:15:54,012
If the two of us manage this body at the same time...

276
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:56,885
We could live upwards of one hundred and forty years.

277
00:15:59,222 --> 00:16:00,506
U-uh... Migi...

278
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,619
You're wasting time.

279
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:08,264
But you will have no choice in the
matter if your host no longer has a head.

280
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:10,756
Uhhh!

281
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:20,188
Wh-why would you do such a thing?

282
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:23,866
What the... what the hell is wrong
with you, do you realize what you've done?

283
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:25,677
My body... I need my body...

284
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:27,660
I need my body to survive...

285
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,280
I need my body to survive...

286
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:39,094
Migi...

287
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:42,195
Migi did you just save my life?

288
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:45,784
I was simply unsure if such a
relocation was possible to achieve.

289
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:50,142
The only life I consider important is
my own, so I chose the safest option.

290
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,816
Very tired. I must sleep now.

291
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:57,047
<i>My body... I need my body...</i>

292
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,050
<i>I need my body to survive...</i>

293
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:01,303
<i>I need my body to survive...</i>

294
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:05,223
<i>I'm not sure how to take this.</i>

295
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:08,371
<i>Migi put my life over one of his own kind.</i>

296
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:12,388
<i>Maybe he was only concerned
with saving himself, but still...</i>

297
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:16,805
Migi... you awake?

298
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,059
Mmmm! So good!

299
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:27,660
Mmmm!

300
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,704
Hmm...

301
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,983
You know, if you're not enjoying
yourself you could say so.

302
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,541
Uh, no no it's really great!

303
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:38,560
Mmm-mmm! Delicious!

304
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,205
Yeah, I am so not buying that...

305
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,690
Hehehe...

306
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:47,990
Hahaha...

307
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:50,203
Hehehe...

308
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:59,509
My parents are pretty strict
about me leaving the house nowadays.

309
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:01,452
Huh? Why's that?

310
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,016
Well, because of everything that's been going on.

311
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:06,222
You know, the Mincemeat Murders.

312
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:07,041
Oh, right...

313
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,210
It's just awful.

314
00:18:08,323 --> 00:18:11,123
I mean, they're getting cut to
pieces? What's wrong with people?

315
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:11,890
Yeah...

316
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,651
<i>Man, if she ever found out about Migi,
she would completely freak out for sure.</i>

317
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:21,999
Um, is something wrong?

318
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:25,312
Hey Murano... you like animals, don't you?

319
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:27,591
Mm-hm! Yeah of course.

320
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:29,433
Except worms, they're creepy.

321
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,606
Aah! Ugh!

322
00:18:32,104 --> 00:18:33,778
Are you okay?

323
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:35,116
Uh-huh...

324
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:36,732
Hey! Come over here!

325
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:37,166
Uh?

326
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:39,630
C'mon c'mon.

327
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:43,389
I wanna play in the sandbox!

328
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:44,780
Meow!

329
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,564
Aw crap...

330
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,182
Dude, you suck. It's my turn.

331
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:54,084
Air ball!

332
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:55,832
That's horrible...

333
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:59,566
Let's go. I cannot watch this...

334
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:00,728
Yeah, who could?

335
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,792
Hehe... Huh?

336
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,375
Who's this clown?

337
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:11,026
Hey you guys. You really need to cut it out.

338
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:12,931
Huh?!

339
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:14,071
Meow...

340
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,112
Oh, wow...

341
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,443
Meow!

342
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:20,997
Aw c'mon, we're just playing around, man!

343
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:23,164
Yeah, try mindin' your own business?

344
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:26,301
It is a living breathing thing.

345
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,509
Not a toy for you to play with. It's alive just like you.

346
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:30,514
Tsk!

347
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:31,481
Loser!

348
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,169
Seriously dude?

349
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:34,268
What a tool.

350
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,289
Hm...

351
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:41,739
Hehe...

352
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:42,709
Hmph!

353
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:44,596
Look out!

354
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,630
Whoa! Uhh!

355
00:19:52,953 --> 00:19:55,552
I will eat you alive.

356
00:19:56,743 --> 00:20:01,106
Aahh! Ooh!

357
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:03,881
Let's go.

358
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,022
Uh... O-okay.

359
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:13,006
<i>Maybe Migi was right about us.</i>

360
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:16,672
<i>Maybe human beings aren't so sacred.</i>

361
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:21,384
<i>Maybe... maybe we're the demons after all.</i>

362
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:36,015
Uhh!

363
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:39,549
Huh...

364
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:40,570
Uh...

365
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:50,521
Hey, Shinichi?

366
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:51,026
Yeah?

367
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,714
You are... Shinichi Izumi...

368
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:56,261
aren't you?

369
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,227
Yeah. Of course I am.

370
00:22:46,554 --> 00:22:48,893
Next time: "Symposium"
