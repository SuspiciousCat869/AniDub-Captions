1
00:00:01,173 --> 00:00:03,559
Was that meant as some sort of barricade?

2
00:00:03,686 --> 00:00:06,501
The only thing you've accomplished
is to block off your escape.

3
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:08,517
Surrender now...

4
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:11,922
Without complete control of that
body, there's no way to defeat me.

5
00:01:44,142 --> 00:01:48,516
Aside from your right hand, the rest
of your body is useless, afraid of pain.

6
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,119
A-ahh...

7
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:56,053
If you allow yourself to become flustered during
the battle it will only hold me back. And we will lose.

8
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:57,339
<i>That's what he's doing.</i>

9
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:00,775
<i>He's trying to get in my head and throw me off.</i>

10
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:03,312
Ahh!

11
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:04,675
<i>Migi...</i>

12
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,746
<i>I can't...</i>

13
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:12,102
<i>I cannot be afraid.</i>

14
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,863
<i>They're so fast I can't even see what's happening.</i>

15
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,279
<i>How can I do this?</i>

16
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:23,707
We delegate our roles.

17
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,274
I will act as if I'm attacking, but I
will actually be focused on defense...

18
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:31,246
That will allow me to protect you from his assault.

19
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,581
But if you're focused on defense, who will attack?

20
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,087
Shinichi...

21
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:38,307
I'm attacking!?

22
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,083
An analysis of Mr. A's actions thus far has
led me to believe he underestimates human ability.

23
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:46,260
He will naturally be wary of me,

24
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:50,174
but he has given no consideration
whatsoever as to your capabilities.

25
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,776
That is his weakness.

26
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:55,030
I will be on defense, and you will be on offense.

27
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:58,796
It's the most effective way for us to achieve success.

28
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:05,007
<i>Approach him gradually...</i>

29
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:07,813
<i>move very slowly...</i>

30
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,142
<i>Very slowly...</i>

31
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:16,582
<i>Trust Migi... He will protect you.</i>

32
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:17,790
Uuh...

33
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:20,649
<i>That's right, Shinichi.</i>

34
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,007
<i>We will do what Mr. A cannot...</i>

35
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:25,257
<i>We will share roles.</i>

36
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,328
<i>It's like Migi said...</i>

37
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:31,394
<i>This guy doesn't think I can do anything.</i>

38
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:34,299
<i>Well I can...</i>

39
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:36,092
<i>And I'm gonna do it.</i>

40
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,449
<i>He's still...</i>

41
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,353
<i>he's still a human from the neck down...</i>

42
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:50,888
<i>If I don't do this... he will kill us.</i>

43
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:56,570
Uh-ugh...

44
00:03:57,802 --> 00:03:58,830
Uh! Ahh!

45
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:01,042
Uh!

46
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:02,981
Aaah!

47
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:07,723
Uh... urgh...

48
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:10,318
I don't understand this.

49
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:13,081
We did it.

50
00:04:13,106 --> 00:04:14,979
That much blood loss will be fatal.

51
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:16,672
Impossible...

52
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:20,930
How could a feeble little human
runt find a way to attack me?

53
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:24,751
Uh... Ah!

54
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:27,850
Hold on. Let's wait and see what he does next.

55
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,243
His behavior seems quite erratic.

56
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:41,399
<i>He punctured an artery quite close to the heart...</i>

57
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,386
<i>I must stop the bleeding...</i>

58
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,096
Err... Gah!

59
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:46,288
Ah!

60
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:47,932
I understand...

61
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:50,543
Pushing it all the way through has closed off the wound.

62
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:51,389
Ah!

63
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,791
All right. Let's follow him...

64
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,138
We need to finish him off.

65
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:01,662
Ah! No...!

66
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,116
We've already done enough!

67
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,191
It's not a good strategy to let him go.

68
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:08,793
Look, if we go after him and do it,
then that'll officially make me a murderer!

69
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,540
Uh... Hmm?

70
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:13,854
That's not a person, Shinichi.

71
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:17,482
<i>I'm going to be killed by a...</i>

72
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:19,330
<i>by a human?</i>

73
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:22,070
<i>That doesn't make any sense.</i>

74
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,305
<i>This isn't working. My host is inoperable.</i>

75
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:35,217
<i>I must relocate. If that's even an option now...</i>

76
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:38,996
<i>Yes. Ryoko Tamiya!</i>

77
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,722
<i>I will share her host.</i>

78
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:42,606
<i>Where is she?</i>

79
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:52,103
Huh? Hey! The police are here!

80
00:05:58,295 --> 00:05:59,912
<i>Five more meters...</i>

81
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:05,127
Hm...

82
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,416
Huh?

83
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:12,048
Uh?!

84
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:17,949
Hmm...

85
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:23,360
How's Shinichi?

86
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,709
I dunno.

87
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:26,732
He hasn't gotten out of bed yet.

88
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:31,029
Well, I'm just glad he's okay.

89
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,330
<i>I can still feel what it was like when I stabbed him.</i>

90
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,218
<i>It really wasn't that long before
things settled back down again...</i>

91
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,641
<i>And classes at our school resumed.</i>

92
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,996
<i>Funny how quickly people forget.</i>

93
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,563
<i>Ms. Tamiya must have killed Mr. A...</i>

94
00:07:02,486 --> 00:07:04,908
<i>But she's still teaching as if nothing happened.</i>

95
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:09,793
<i>I haven't heard about any murders
being reported in her area...</i>

96
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:13,879
<i>but I'm sure she's out there killing nonetheless.</i>

97
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,749
<i>I can't sit back and let this happen.</i>

98
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,770
Yes, well, um... Ms. Tamiya.

99
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:28,035
Ahem. You see, the fact that you have become, uh,
pregnant is certainly just cause for celebration.

100
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:30,604
I mean uh, congratulations.

101
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:33,233
However-. You don't even know who's it is!

102
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:37,976
The fact that you are unmarried and refuse to
reveal the father's identity is most unsettling.

103
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,599
It's because you can't reveal who the father
is... not that you don't know who it is, right?

104
00:07:44,787 --> 00:07:46,249
I didn't expect this...

105
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:49,598
I had never imagined that our time
together was going to end this way.

106
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:50,983
Huh?!

107
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,687
I cannot afford to attract
attention over something like this...

108
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,989
I think Ryoko Tamiya's days are done.

109
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:57,922
U-uh...

110
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:01,061
Ms. Tamiya, wait! Please...

111
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,123
We should kill Ryoko Tamiya.

112
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,839
We can't win... Well, isn't not likely.

113
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:15,741
Also, the child that's growing
within her is undeniably a human...

114
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,284
Would you be able to kill her baby as well?

115
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:20,016
Shinichi?

116
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:27,531
Ryoko Tamiya no longer exists...

117
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,745
Thus, all those in her circle...

118
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:31,749
and that includes you, too...

119
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:34,551
Now have no particular reason to be kept alive.

120
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:36,514
Why do you keep killing people?

121
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,559
My hand lives off the nutrients in my bloodstream...

122
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:43,012
It survives on a diet of normal human food.

123
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:47,295
That means the rest of you... The rest of you
can sustain yourselves without eating people.

124
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,966
Hmm... It could indeed be possible.

125
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,227
Well, all right then!

126
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:55,184
A fly knows how to fly without ever being taught to do so.

127
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:55,675
Huh?

128
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:59,923
Just as every spider knows how to
spin a web and every fish can swim...

129
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:01,869
Why is that?

130
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,913
Mm... Well, I uh...

131
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:05,466
Here's what I think.

132
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:10,000
I believe that flies and spiders
are simply following a directive.

133
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,258
In fact it's my belief that every single life
on this planet lives by a directive of some sort.

134
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:17,438
What are you talking about?

135
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:19,275
Do you get this?

136
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,336
So then, you feel humans have no directive?

137
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:26,237
Uh! I still don't know what you mean!

138
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:27,823
Like God or something?

139
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:28,696
Huh?

140
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,100
When I first took control of this human host...

141
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:34,228
I instantly received a directive.

142
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:39,300
To devour your entire species... Now...

143
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:40,319
Gah!

144
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,802
Look. Just please answer me one thing.

145
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:05,266
What is it you plan to do... with your baby?

146
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,112
Give birth to it.

147
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,661
Possibly use it for some experimentation.

148
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:13,475
If it proves useless, it's food.

149
00:10:15,694 --> 00:10:17,169
Calm down, Shinichi.

150
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,620
This distance is not optimal.

151
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:22,597
You've become something of a nuisance...

152
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,265
Goodbye.

153
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:32,996
Uh... Oh shit!

154
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:35,174
She has more than two morph patterns.

155
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:35,931
Not good.

156
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:37,579
Ah...

157
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,106
Interesting...

158
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,358
It would appear you two are conjoined.

159
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,513
Ever so slightly.

160
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,181
I won't be killing you after all.

161
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:54,429
Hey, hang on!

162
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:55,446
Uh...

163
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:56,767
Wha...

164
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:07,374
Ah...

165
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:11,924
Oh, Ryoko! What on Earth's going on?

166
00:11:12,184 --> 00:11:15,536
I got a phone call from the school,
so I rushed over as soon as I could.

167
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:18,287
<i>Ryoko Tamiya's mother.</i>

168
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,605
I'm sorry, but I was actually just about to leave...

169
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:26,260
Could we perhaps talk about this later, Mother?

170
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:28,224
Ryoko...

171
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:31,609
I'm not going far, I'll be back soon.

172
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,887
Wait. Please.

173
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:37,513
I need you to look at me.

174
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:44,216
Uh...

175
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:46,712
Please, dear...

176
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:49,173
I need you to talk to me.

177
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:50,181
Huh...

178
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:51,863
It's not right...

179
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:54,198
Something's very wrong! Who are you?!

180
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,904
Ryoko?! Where's my Ryoko?!

181
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,672
Tell me! Wh-what did you do with my daughter?!

182
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:05,560
No, no! I'm calling the police!

183
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:18,959
<i>She saw through me so quickly.</i>

184
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:24,096
<i>My face and my voice should be a
near-perfect match to Ryoko Tamiya.</i>

185
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,306
<i>Strange...</i>

186
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:30,816
<i>I doubt this woman had any special
sensory abilities or anything.</i>

187
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:36,535
Uh... Mm...

188
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:39,105
Uhh...

189
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:41,838
Migi?

190
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:43,106
Hmm...

191
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:46,939
WAAHH!

192
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:47,505
Huh...

193
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:54,123
Uh? Ah! Aahh! Uh? Ah!

194
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:56,277
Please don't frighten me like that.

195
00:12:56,302 --> 00:12:58,098
What?! Frighten you?!

196
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:00,106
You okay?! Why were you yelling?

197
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:02,567
Ah! Uh, it was a dream!

198
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,704
A bad dream! Uh, it was really, really bad!

199
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:06,757
Oh...

200
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:09,457
Just go and wash up alright.

201
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:13,011
What are you doing?!

202
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:17,206
It seems to be three minutes is the
limit, the longest I can be separated.

203
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,351
So, what, you went on a little morning walk?

204
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:21,915
No, not a walk. But a movement analysis.

205
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,001
Wait, movement?

206
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:26,171
Hey! You're not testing to see
how to move up to my head are ya?

207
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,244
I already told you, that's not possible.

208
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:32,752
I matured without eating a brain, therefore I
would not know how to control an entire body.

209
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:35,675
But still, perhaps I should give it a try.

210
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,515
Ah! Quit screwin' around!

211
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,628
Hm? Wait a second...

212
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:44,673
So, then does that mean the ones who've managed to
take over a brain can move from one head to another?

213
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:46,395
In theory, yes.

214
00:13:46,461 --> 00:13:51,127
But there's always the possibility of rejection,
so swapping heads would be quite dangerous.

215
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:53,368
I really doubt anyone would risk it.

216
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:54,230
Oh...

217
00:13:56,864 --> 00:13:57,555
A trip?

218
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:01,384
Uh-huh. Looks like I can finally take some time off.

219
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,628
So, we'd like you to keep an eye on the house.

220
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:08,650
The way your father is always working, we haven't
had a chance to go on a vacation in a long time.

221
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:10,643
You don't... think it's risky?

222
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:13,306
You mean, because of the Mincemeat Murders?

223
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:15,241
Looks like those have finally stopped.

224
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,130
It's nothing to worry about anymore.

225
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,539
But that doesn't mean the killer's not out there!

226
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,201
Dad, how can you just go off to
some strange place, it's dangerous.

227
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:24,611
So, you're against it?

228
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:27,300
Mm...

229
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:28,213
Huh?

230
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:31,406
I am...

231
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,962
Hey, don't tell me my big, old boy is
going to be lonely without his mom and dad.

232
00:14:35,987 --> 00:14:38,891
No no! Y'know it's just that they're not gonna...

233
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:39,939
Who the hell is "they"?

234
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,781
Ah... I, uh...

235
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:46,463
Look Shinichi... If you really feel that
strongly about it, then we can cancel our trip.

236
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,109
Aw, come on, Baby.

237
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:52,173
Sweetie... I've noticed that something's
been bothering you for a while...

238
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:55,276
Is there something on your mind
that you'd like to talk to us about?

239
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:57,893
No. There's nothing to worry about, I'm fine.

240
00:14:58,286 --> 00:14:59,807
Is it one of your friends? Or maybe...

241
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,529
I said it's nothing okay!

242
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:03,378
I'm going out for bit.

243
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:05,481
Hmm.

244
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:09,831
Shinichi...

245
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:12,264
There's something we need to make clear.

246
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:13,890
Yeah, yeah, I know.

247
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,338
<i>If I ever told my parents the
truth about what's happened...</i>

248
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,941
<i>there's no telling what Migi might do.</i>

249
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,878
<i>The only reason he tries to protect me...</i>

250
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:26,104
<i>is because I'm his lifeline...</i>

251
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,876
<i>But my parents are a different story all together.</i>

252
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,348
<i>He'd eliminate them without any hesitation.</i>

253
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:35,701
<i>Migi has no concept of affection or love...</i>

254
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:41,502
<i>All said and done, there's really no
difference between him and Mr. A or Ryoko Tamiya.</i>

255
00:15:44,492 --> 00:15:46,969
I know that boy is hiding something from us.

256
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:48,437
Well of course he is...

257
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:50,161
Shinichi is a senior now...

258
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:53,663
I mean it's only natural that he keeps
a few secrets from his parents, right?

259
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:57,666
If anything, he's probably been
a little too good up until now.

260
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:02,296
He hasn't even really gone through some
rebellious phase and told us how he hated us yet.

261
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,622
Well, if you really think so...

262
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:06,337
Hmm...

263
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:11,768
You know hon, he might be...

264
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:14,214
he might be having some more guilt about your scar.

265
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,073
Huh?

266
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:16,867
You really think so?

267
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,344
I mean, that happened such a long time ago...

268
00:16:21,304 --> 00:16:23,756
Mommy, can I have a silver plate?

269
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:25,773
A silver plate?

270
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:28,534
Yeah, it's for an experiment in science class tomorrow.

271
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,705
Oh! By "silver," you mean an aluminum foil plate, I see.

272
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,073
Uh-huh! That's it!

273
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:35,360
Sure, of course...

274
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:36,712
But they're up there on the top,

275
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:39,294
and I'm making tempura right now,
so you'll just have to wait until...

276
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:40,225
I can get it!

277
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:43,812
Mhmm...

278
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:46,639
Uhh... Ahh... Would you please just wait?

279
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:48,004
Shinichi!

280
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:49,018
Uhh... Waa..

281
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:50,439
Be careful!

282
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,408
Oh! Uh...

283
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,370
Ah, that hurt...

284
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,387
Ah!

285
00:16:58,849 --> 00:16:59,876
Oww! Ahh...

286
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:00,789
Huh?

287
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:02,950
Are you okay, Shinichi?

288
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,838
Did you get any on you?! Are you hurt?!

289
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:07,372
You didn't get burned or anything? You're okay?

290
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:08,981
Uh, uh-huh.

291
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,450
Nobuko, your arm.

292
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:11,990
Huh?

293
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:14,190
Aah! Ooh!

294
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:19,375
Ow! Hmm?

295
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,001
Your mom's hurting much worse than you are.

296
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:28,679
Huh? What do you mean, I shouldn't be that worried?

297
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:31,675
It's true. Simply consider the probability.

298
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:35,157
My kind prefer urban areas where food is plentiful.

299
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:39,100
Furthermore, their targets are
normally people who are out by themselves.

300
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:43,001
If your parents travel out to the
countryside, they will be safer than they are now.

301
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:44,348
Yeah, okay...

302
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:46,951
Guess I shouldn't have been so
against it when they brought it up.

303
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:48,103
Shinichi?

304
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,092
Ah! Wh-what now?!

305
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:52,575
Were you, uh, just talking to somebody in here?

306
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:55,355
Nah, just to myself! What do you want?!

307
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,545
Huh? Well... dinner's going to be ready soon...

308
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:01,951
Oh, okay. I'll be down in just a few minutes...

309
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:03,461
And, uh, Mom?

310
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:07,896
The next time you come up here, could
you knock before you just open up the door!

311
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,660
Can I have some privacy?!

312
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:12,485
Oh... Okay, son.

313
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:13,880
I'm sorry.

314
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:19,441
Ahh... I seriously thought I
was gonna have a heart attack!

315
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:22,337
If that were to happen, it
would be an inconvenience for me.

316
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:27,654
Your son was yelling at me just now.

317
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:30,307
Well, he's probably up there whacking off or something.

318
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,022
Oh!

319
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:38,844
Um, I know I said I was against your
trip this morning, but I take it back now.

320
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:42,989
Honestly, I think it's a good idea
for you guys to get away from everything

321
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:45,685
and go relax somewhere with some nice fresh air.

322
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:47,130
Mmm...

323
00:18:48,204 --> 00:18:49,636
So, when do you leave?

324
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:55,204
I don't get it.

325
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:55,713
Huh?

326
00:18:57,945 --> 00:19:00,373
I just... don't understand you, Shinichi.

327
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,468
Ah...

328
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:03,575
What on Earth is going on with you?

329
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,782
You were so dead set against it this morning...

330
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:09,053
I mean you were very adamant...

331
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:11,972
And now you're saying something completely the opposite.

332
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:15,391
So now you're not so worried
about your parents, is that it?

333
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,998
Oh, now I get a guilt trip?!

334
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:19,444
Maybe you're the one with the problems here, Mom!

335
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:23,538
I don't get this... In fact, I
don't get anything about you anymore!

336
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:26,122
Something is just... Something is different.

337
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:29,909
And it's... like you're not my son anymore.

338
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:31,445
Baby, please.

339
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:35,148
Please, why won't you tell me?!

340
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:36,910
What's happening to you?

341
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:37,773
Uh...

342
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:42,155
Shinichi.

343
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:50,935
I didn't want to be alone...

344
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:53,031
At least, I didn't this morning.

345
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:54,160
Huh?

346
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:57,743
But when I talked to a friend
about it, he just laughed at me.

347
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:58,947
And I changed my mind.

348
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:01,848
So I think I'm feeling better about it now...

349
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,087
If I do get lonely, I can just
invite someone to come over.

350
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,776
That's really all there is to it.

351
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:07,865
Mm-hmm...

352
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:11,208
You guys understand, right?

353
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,252
Mm-hmm...

354
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,166
The taxi should be here in a coupla minutes.

355
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:27,856
This'll probably be the first
time we've been gone this long...

356
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:29,350
It should be really fun.

357
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:30,278
Y'know...

358
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,397
Back when we were living in the old
apartment, we couldn't even afford to take trips.

359
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,180
Right, we could barely afford the apartment itself.

360
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,318
It was in that little bitty
kitchen, where I wound up with this.

361
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:41,909
Oh!

362
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,836
Hmm...

363
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:45,154
Oh?

364
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:46,574
 Hehe...

365
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:50,845
Uh... Well, take care of the place.

366
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,707
Uh... Mm-hm!

367
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:55,644
And be sure to turn off the stove and lock the door.

368
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:56,304
I will.

369
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,068
And don't be worried about us, okay buddy?

370
00:20:59,371 --> 00:20:59,960
Okay.

371
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,253
We'll be back!

372
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:14,125
Huh...

373
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:19,761
It moved...

374
00:22:46,285 --> 00:22:49,112
Next time: "The Stranger"
