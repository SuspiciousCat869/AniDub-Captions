1
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:07,921
<i>That look on her face...</i>

2
00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:10,615
<i>I hate her.</i>

3
00:00:11,106 --> 00:00:12,773
<i>I hate everything about her!</i>

4
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:15,505
<i>She doesn't deserve to...</i>

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,864
Shinichi, calm down.

6
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:20,370
We'd be in trouble if we had to fight
while your breathing was this irregular.

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,096
I know.

8
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,728
There's so much I'd hoped to discuss with the two of you,

9
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:27,434
but I can feel a strong sense of imminent threat...

10
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:30,231
so I'll have to make this a bit shorter than I'd planned.

11
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:33,453
I've killed at least 38 people so far.

12
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:34,165
Uh...

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,296
Most of which were for food...

14
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:41,467
But to tell you the truth, I'd say
that figure is quite low among my kind.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,098
I was able to sustain myself with
the same food humans normally eat.

16
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:53,389
What I've found is that consuming humans is
completely unnecessary in order for my kind to survive.

17
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,186
I've done a fair amount of study on your species...

18
00:00:57,572 --> 00:01:00,920
Searching to find exactly what we parasites are to you...

19
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:03,495
and, in turn, what you are you to us.

20
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:07,478
The conclusion I reached is that we are two halves...

21
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:09,335
of the same whole...

22
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:13,083
Parasites and humanity are of one family...

23
00:01:13,586 --> 00:01:15,613
We are the children of mankind.

24
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,152
What was that?!

25
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:20,157
What kind of bullshit are you talking about?

26
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:23,786
Of course, given your human emotions,

27
00:01:23,811 --> 00:01:25,520
I'm sure this is hard to grasp...

28
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:27,012
But...

29
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:29,984
We are actually quite frail.

30
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:34,459
We're nothing more than a life form
that isn't able to survive on its own.

31
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:38,324
So, please... Don't be too hard on us.

32
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:41,150
You've got to be kidding me. Go to Hell.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,270
Interesting...

34
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:47,313
You two are extremely rare beings...

35
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,116
and that's exactly why I wanted the
chance to share my thoughts with you...

36
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:54,522
And also to give you an important word of advice.

37
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,255
It's in regards to Goto,

38
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,560
the man who's been pursuing you as of late.

39
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:01,257
You should avoid doing battle with him.

40
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:05,795
If you had started facing off
against Goto first rather than Miki,

41
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:08,159
I'm quite certain you'd be dead already.

42
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,132
Probably so.

43
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:10,544
Huh?

44
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:13,302
He is one of the most "frail" among us...

45
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:16,060
a being I created through experimentation...

46
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,242
But he's invincible.

47
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,947
You do know you just contradicted yourself, right?

48
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:22,128
Hehe...

49
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:26,352
Hahaha...

50
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,879
<i>She's laughing.</i>

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,530
And then there's the Mayor, Hirokawa...

52
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,957
<i>Shinichi Izumi?</i>

53
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:42,192
<i>I'm pretty sure that's Detective Hirama...</i>

54
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:45,100
<i>That means, all these guys... must be cops.</i>

55
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,243
<i>At first glance it all looks so normal -</i>

56
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:52,316
<i>a mother holding a baby...</i>

57
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:55,113
<i>and a young high school kid in the park.</i>

58
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:57,945
<i>But one is a known parasite.</i>

59
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:02,559
<i>And the other found the body of
his own friend murdered by a parasite.</i>

60
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:04,975
<i>And here they are, together.</i>

61
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:06,858
<i>Right after another murder.</i>

62
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,708
<i>What is this?</i>

63
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,523
<i>What in the hell are you two up to?</i>

64
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:14,455
<i>Shinichi Izumi...</i>

65
00:03:14,913 --> 00:03:17,581
<i>There's a lot more to you than you're letting on.</i>

66
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,519
<i>And there's some blood...</i>

67
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:57,643
<i>my blood got on the baby's clothes.</i>

68
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,238
Stay back! Hold on. Hold your position!

69
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:08,798
Now then.

70
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:11,799
You're Reiko Tamura? Correct?

71
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,931
Excuse me?

72
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:14,723
And you just killed a man.

73
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:16,263
His name was Kuramori!

74
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:17,690
Oh! Uh...

75
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:19,678
What is this?

76
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,226
Then I'll have to ask the other one.

77
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:24,461
Ikeda!

78
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,363
What the hell are you doing here?

79
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,238
You and I have met before.

80
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:31,541
You do remember me, don't you?

81
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:34,436
So if you're the same person that I met,

82
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,584
then you should be able to say my name.

83
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,143
So tell me, who am I, Ikeda?

84
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:44,169
Well I uh... It sounds like
you forgot my name, Mr. Hirama.

85
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:45,484
Hehe...

86
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,459
Okay that one would seem to be human.

87
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:53,948
Well. You appear to be quite
calm and collected, Ms. Tamura.

88
00:05:54,628 --> 00:05:57,400
I do believe you've mistaken me for someone else.

89
00:05:57,963 --> 00:05:59,689
From this short of a distance...

90
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:02,754
I feel quite confident that I would not miss.

91
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,006
Is this some sort of sick joke?!

92
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,796
You people are crazy! Leave me alone!

93
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:14,098
I'd be deeply sorry if I were wrong...

94
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:16,261
but I'm afraid I'm out of options now...

95
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:18,599
and I can't risk getting any closer.

96
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:20,929
Now you listen to me!

97
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:24,374
I am accountable for whatever happens here...

98
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,261
It's on me!

99
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:26,253
Don't do this!

100
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:28,120
I don't know what your talking about!

101
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:29,769
Hirama wait.

102
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:34,965
Uh? Huh?

103
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,719
Well done, you were right...

104
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:53,923
Fire! Fire!

105
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:55,323
Stop it!

106
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,856
The baby's human!

107
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:00,256
Shinichi Izumi! Get back!

108
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:01,717
Shinichi! Stay here!

109
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:03,063
But Migi...

110
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,301
<i>This can't be happening...</i>

111
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:18,676
<i>There's no way, right?</i>

112
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:22,339
<i>You're not involved in this, are you, Shinichi?</i>

113
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:25,411
<i>No. You wouldn't be caught in this...</i>

114
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:28,391
<i>No! You can't be!</i>

115
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,785
<i>Shinichi, please!</i>

116
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:36,991
Uh...

117
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:52,648
Curious... Why won't she fight back?

118
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,913
She's coming toward us...

119
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,052
She must have something up her sleeve.

120
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:03,230
Fall back now, Shinichi. Run!

121
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:05,718
<i>Shinichi...</i>

122
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:11,056
<i>Wait, Shinichi. Wait.</i>

123
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,202
<i>You can't leave me just yet.</i>

124
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:15,455
<i>I need to speak to you...</i>

125
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,498
<i>I need to speak to your humanity...</i>

126
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,550
Shinichi.

127
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:31,227
Mother...

128
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:33,275
Don't let her fool you!

129
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:36,252
It's a trap. Remember the hole in your heart!

130
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:42,954
Please don't.

131
00:08:43,216 --> 00:08:45,441
Whoa. Stop! Hold your fire!

132
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,872
Stop! Don't shoot or you'll hit the boy.

133
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:50,831
Something's wrong here.

134
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:56,167
I've been thinking...

135
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:58,282
for a long time...

136
00:08:58,795 --> 00:08:59,949
About why...

137
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,829
Why was I even brought to this world in the first place?

138
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:07,934
As soon as I would resolve one question...

139
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:10,714
another one would inevitably take its place.

140
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:13,601
I've sought the beginning...

141
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,288
And I've sought the end.

142
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:18,518
I've walked alone for so long...

143
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,491
always thinking...

144
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:22,872
wondering...

145
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:26,687
Perhaps nothing will change no matter how far I go.

146
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,649
So even if I stop,

147
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:30,672
it will still remain the same.

148
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:34,507
And if someone were to tell me it was all over,

149
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:36,044
I wouldn't be fazed.

150
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:37,677
But today...

151
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,366
today I finally found the answer...

152
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,209
to one of my questions.

153
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:45,189
Shinichi...

154
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,648
In the end...

155
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:50,222
I never did anything to harm this child.

156
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:54,212
This perfectly normal, beautiful child.

157
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:57,818
Please make sure it's raised in a normal way...

158
00:09:58,172 --> 00:09:59,531
by human hands.

159
00:10:02,712 --> 00:10:05,402
Yes of course. I will.

160
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,481
Hm. Thank you so much.

161
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,831
<i>Uh... "Thank you"?</i>

162
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:13,851
You know Shinichi...

163
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:15,766
I recently tried to...

164
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:18,710
to laugh like a human in front of a mirror.

165
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:21,300
And I believe...

166
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:23,748
It felt rather pleasant.

167
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,306
Ahh...

168
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:38,551
<i>She's dead...</i>

169
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,030
<i>I don't understand.</i>

170
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,005
<i>I'm sure she could have fought well if she'd wanted to.</i>

171
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:46,108
<i>Or at least run away.</i>

172
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:51,631
Huh?

173
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,588
I'm so sorry little guy.

174
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,518
<i>I know. I know.</i>

175
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:03,144
<i>Your mom is gone now, isn't she?</i>

176
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,663
<i>She's gone...</i>

177
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:07,571
<i>Your mom is...</i>

178
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:10,388
<i>Mom...</i>

179
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:13,370
Shinichi.

180
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,510
Are you okay, Shinichi? Did
you get any on you?! Are you hurt?

181
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:28,060
You have to meet once again
with whomever created this hole...

182
00:11:32,386 --> 00:11:33,153
It's dead.

183
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:34,592
Its heart stopped.

184
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:40,355
It was just so embarrassing...

185
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:43,465
I could never tell...

186
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:44,914
anyone...

187
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,588
They're dead...

188
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:50,696
All of them... they're dead... they're dead...

189
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:52,542
Life...

190
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:57,574
Life will be absorbed by this tree.

191
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,033
Shinichi!

192
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:06,016
You... you will... come back, right?

193
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:09,416
Come back, right?

194
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:13,933
Uhh...

195
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:22,576
Oh!

196
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:26,163
We're back home.

197
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,527
I'm so glad.

198
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:30,066
Hm...

199
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:31,799
Hmm...

200
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:33,707
What's wrong, Shinichi?

201
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:36,973
I just had a...

202
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:38,477
a really sad...

203
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,527
a really sad dream...

204
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:48,722
Uh...

205
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:51,969
Mm... Uh?

206
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:54,166
Shinichi?

207
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,636
Shinichi, you're here!

208
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:02,046
You did come back.

209
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:05,624
Huh...

210
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:09,070
Yeah, I did...

211
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:07,143
Murano.

212
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:07,857
Huh?

213
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:08,950
How's Shinichi?

214
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:13,030
He's fine, and it looks like he'll
be coming back to school pretty soon.

215
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:14,217
Well that's good.

216
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:15,854
So, like what happened?

217
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:18,945
He just left all of a sudden,
and never said where he was going!

218
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,399
Uh-uhh... Mm...

219
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:22,602
I'm sure she doesn't want to talk about that.

220
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:23,489
Let's go.

221
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:25,643
Hmm...

222
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:29,995
<i>What happened in the park that day...</i>

223
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,275
<i>didn't even make the news.</i>

224
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:34,227
<i>But still...</i>

225
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:37,024
<i>Shinichi's back.</i>

226
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:40,285
<i>He came back.</i>

227
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,805
So, you'll be having lunch in here.

228
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,116
Make yourself comfortable.

229
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,782
So how'd it go?

230
00:14:50,245 --> 00:14:52,380
Man, I'm worn-out.

231
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:58,765
Well, he looks just a little bit too
calm for someone his age, don'tcha think?

232
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:05,098
True, he does seem to be surprisingly level-headed, but
well, there are people out there with an easy temperament.

233
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:11,948
Although, I'm not sure he really has
this ability the detectives are looking for.

234
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:15,255
Not anywhere in the same league as the other guy, anyway.

235
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,288
Oh, good grief...

236
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:19,265
So he's really the only candidate?

237
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,351
Yeah, unfortunately so.

238
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,221
Dogs and cats...

239
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:29,891
And monkeys and birds and bears...

240
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:32,155
it's all such a waste of time.

241
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,227
I never told anyone that I could talk to animals.

242
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:36,735
You guys do get that, right?

243
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,113
Just shut up and move it.

244
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,312
So, which little critters will it be today?

245
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:42,379
Humans.

246
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,673
Hm... Humans?

247
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:46,926
Hahaha...

248
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,354
Aah, that's just great! Haha!

249
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:52,315
It means that the true test is finally at hand.

250
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:55,635
Oh, is that so?

251
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,244
After all this time, now you
wanna hear what I have to say?

252
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:00,613
Please, sir...

253
00:16:00,997 --> 00:16:02,863
I'm innocent, Mr. Detective!

254
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,470
Believe me.

255
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,700
Hahaha!

256
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:09,454
Nothing? Come on that was good.

257
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,861
Shut your damn mouth.

258
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,949
Get his cuffs.

259
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:28,553
Yeah?

260
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:31,405
Um, Shinichi Izumi...

261
00:16:31,677 --> 00:16:33,196
I need you to come with me, please.

262
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:34,276
Okay.

263
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:40,317
<i>No matter what they ask me,</i>

264
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:42,838
<i>I have to keep Migi's existence a secret...</i>

265
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,832
<i>I should calm myself down, one last time...</i>

266
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,760
This'll be the last thing, 'kay.

267
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,460
Oh, alright.

268
00:16:55,377 --> 00:16:56,718
Okay, Uragami.

269
00:16:56,832 --> 00:17:00,411
This is your chance to prove
your ability to us once and for all.

270
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,682
Alright, please go ahead and have a seat here

271
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:04,391
and wait to receive your instructions.

272
00:17:04,672 --> 00:17:05,240
Sure.

273
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,972
You're going to be meeting five people...

274
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:17,435
I want you to find which one of them is like you...

275
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:19,750
A human that has your same ability...

276
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:23,355
You did say you could recognize it if you met one, right?

277
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,664
Yeah yeah, that's right, I can tell.

278
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,150
I think I can...

279
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:30,754
And, let us know if they've been infected.

280
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,921
Wait, what?! So you're bringing one
of those monsters in here with me?!

281
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:37,516
What the hell are you thinking? Hey, goddammit!

282
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:39,508
This glass isn't gonna be able to keep me safe!

283
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:42,794
You can't just leave me in here and
let me get eaten by one of those things!

284
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,932
It's all right. Stop worrying.

285
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,120
That is thick, bullet-proof glass.

286
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:48,784
And it's also soundproof.

287
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:52,401
Right, let's begin. Mr. Fukami?

288
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:52,866
Hmm?

289
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,018
Please come in.

290
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:55,713
Okay.

291
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:04,984
Tch!

292
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,315
Hey, Uragami.

293
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,105
Knock it off and look at him!

294
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,302
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:11,626
What are your thoughts?

296
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:13,052
Hmm...

297
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:18,114
Well, I can tell that... this guy's not a parasite.

298
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:21,733
There is only a minimal response to my telepathy.

299
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,594
He's keeping his thoughts very tightly guarded...

300
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:29,459
so it's rather difficult for me to
determine if he has the same ability I do.

301
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,923
Well I guess what he's saying at
least sounds plausible, doesn't it?

302
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:36,475
Hehe... I really should mention this up front...

303
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:41,070
All of the self-proclaimed "psychics" in
that room... are most likely full of crap.

304
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:43,769
But if any of them actually had such powers...

305
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:46,250
or rather, finely honed abilities,

306
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,621
it'd be this guy who has the best chance.

307
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:51,165
Okay? Whatcha think?

308
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:53,361
Chubs over there is a total hack...

309
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:55,019
I want you to tell him something.

310
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,860
"Lying's the first step down the path of wickedness."

311
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:59,017
Well you'd know!

312
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,774
Yeah, great advice coming from a serial killer...

313
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:04,075
Okay, next candidate, please.

314
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:08,210
Huh?

315
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:10,808
What's the matter, Uragami?

316
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,439
You are screwed up, Detective...

317
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:14,561
You know what bein' in prison's like, right?

318
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,846
If you put a hottie like this in front of me, then...

319
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:17,802
Mmph!

320
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:18,960
Huh?

321
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:20,165
Ooohh...

322
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:22,859
Is he... godammit!

323
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:25,235
So-uh shouldn't we maybe stop him, Inspector?

324
00:19:25,427 --> 00:19:27,757
This is probably affecting his concentration.

325
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:28,432
Hehehaha...

326
00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:29,637
Oh dear God!

327
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:33,153
Ah! He's one! He's one of the parasites for sure!

328
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,158
Eww... Disgusting...

329
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:37,957
Aw don't leave, I'm not done yet! Baby?

330
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:40,027
Well this has been a waste of time.

331
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:42,035
Hmmm.

332
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,434
Mr. Izumi, sorry for the wait.

333
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:45,625
You may go in now.

334
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,294
Right.

335
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:51,688
You aren't able to hear each other,
so there's no need to hold back, okay?

336
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:55,012
Now tell me, what do you think of this man?

337
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:57,935
Well, I... I don't know.

338
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,060
For some reason, you tend to
encounter parasites quite often.

339
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,730
Most recently, you were approached
by the parasite known as Reiko Tamura.

340
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:09,508
Maybe there's something about you that attracts them...

341
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,071
Or perhaps...

342
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:14,481
You somehow have a way of
telling them apart from the rest us.

343
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:15,575
<i>Stay calm.</i>

344
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:18,151
<i>If I can just be calm, It'll be fine.</i>

345
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:19,870
No, sir.

346
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:22,917
<i>I can't help but think...</i>

347
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:26,264
<i>this is the partner Kuramori
was trying to tell me about...</i>

348
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:28,665
<i>just before his death...</i>

349
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:31,238
<i>But mentioning his name...</i>

350
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,396
<i>seems to have no effect on him.</i>

351
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:38,610
<i>But it's hard to believe a kid could bluff
his way through this without ever cracking.</i>

352
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:40,624
I think that piece a shit is asleep!

353
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:41,842
What the hell?!

354
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:44,283
Dammit, Uragami! Wake your ass up!

355
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:46,887
Uh... Hehe...

356
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,800
That chick really wore me out...

357
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,441
Heh, heh. Huh?

358
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,192
We're still doing this?

359
00:20:52,574 --> 00:20:54,454
You got a cute face there, boy.

360
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,496
I bet if you put on a skirt or
somethin' I could rub out another one.

361
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:00,064
Hehehe...

362
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:05,062
Hm...

363
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:09,418
Well, well, well, Mr. Detective.

364
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:10,092
Huh?

365
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:12,071
I need you to tell this guy...

366
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:14,459
to look me straight in the eye.

367
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:16,220
Shinichi.

368
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:16,920
Yes?

369
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:19,095
Uh!

370
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:49,440
Next time: "In Cold Blood"
