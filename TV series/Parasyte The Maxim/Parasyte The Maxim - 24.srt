1
00:00:03,447 --> 00:00:05,986
In the end... what were they really?

2
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:09,887
They're still being talked about online...

3
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:13,484
but no public agency has issued any formal statement.

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,540
After the bloody battle at City Hall,

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,639
there haven't been any
parasite-like activities around town...

6
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,192
or anywhere else in the world, for that matter.

7
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:24,261
Nothing at all.

8
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:28,022
Why did they suddenly go quiet?

9
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:33,214
One theory, of course, was that losing
that fight taught them all a lesson.

10
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:36,690
Another suggestion however...

11
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:40,842
is that they've just become much
better at blending in with human society.

12
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:46,638
Like Reiko Tamura, they've learned to alter their diets,

13
00:00:46,887 --> 00:00:52,684
gradually eating less and less human flesh
and, in turn, becoming more human themselves.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,414
And then...

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,182
there's Migi.

16
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:05,985
<i>Shinichi.</i>

17
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:09,241
Migi, you never change, do you?

18
00:01:09,707 --> 00:01:11,147
Nothing seems to faze you.

19
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:19,420
But ya know, I'm really glad you're still alive, Migi.

20
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:24,967
How do I look to you now, Shinichi?

21
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:28,395
I don't know. A little different again I guess.

22
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:31,224
But kinda the same. Maybe...

23
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,366
I don't know...

24
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:33,805
Don't trouble yourself.

25
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:36,747
I actually came today to tell you goodbye.

26
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:38,262
Huh? What do you mean?

27
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,591
I think I'm going to go to sleep.

28
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:44,359
Go to sleep? But you always sleep, right?

29
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:46,507
This is different.

30
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:48,911
It will be a bit longer this time.

31
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:50,586
Possibly forever.

32
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:52,224
Put simply,

33
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:55,325
just think of this as you regaining your right hand.

34
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:59,181
Huh? Why would you do this? I don't understand!

35
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:02,301
My internal structure has changed once again.

36
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:08,048
In particular, my time spent inside
Goto's body, dreaming and yet awake...

37
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:10,263
being alone and yet not alone...

38
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,820
that experience has been a major factor for me.

39
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:15,877
But, Migi...

40
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:19,651
Not only did I suddenly receive a wealth of information,

41
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:23,228
I became able to pursue multiple lines of thought at once.

42
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:28,404
I'd like to shut out all other information
and just work with what I have for a while.

43
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,145
I've decided to cease all outward activities.

44
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:34,968
But Migi. You can't be serious!

45
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,752
You've always been so curious...

46
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:38,343
What happened to that?

47
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:40,953
There's still a lot out there you don't know.

48
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:43,021
That's very true...

49
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:45,343
So I guess I'll put it like this.

50
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,550
I'm going to head in another direction...

51
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:51,270
One slightly different from
the waking world which you occupy.

52
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:54,318
I don't understand! Migi, please...

53
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,617
Shinichi... I want you to think
of me as nothing more than a dream.

54
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:03,329
It's the reason why, in the end, I'm
choosing to say goodbye to you in one.

55
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:05,225
What are you talking about?!

56
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:07,832
The time we've spent together, everything we've done...

57
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,060
That wasn't a dream! It was real!

58
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:11,057
Indeed...

59
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,612
The terrible things that happened to you...

60
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:17,462
all those deaths... those things were real, too.

61
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:20,024
Ah!

62
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:21,392
Mom!

63
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:23,501
Why is my mom here?!

64
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:27,484
This is an image you manifest
when you think about people dying.

65
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:29,132
Ohh...

66
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,062
So this is the form your mother takes inside your mind...

67
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:36,062
Uh, what? What do you mean?

68
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,631
Migi... What is all this?

69
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,494
It's all so different from
how I saw them in my mind's eye.

70
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:49,169
Show me myself.

71
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,339
Really?

72
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:54,987
What do you mean, "Really"?

73
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:58,690
Well, it is what it is.

74
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,800
Ultimately, we can only understand
each other on certain points.

75
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,404
You humans share the same physical makeup,

76
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:09,754
yet if you were able to exchange
consciousness with one another,

77
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,929
you'd be able to see entire worlds,

78
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:14,506
and hear things beyond your imagination.

79
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:29,257
Well, it's time to go.

80
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,410
I'll be moving on now.

81
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:32,686
Wait!

82
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:34,647
What if more parasites show up?

83
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,681
How can I fight them all alone?!

84
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,177
I'm sure you'll be fine.

85
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,395
Just be careful on the road, okay, Shinichi?

86
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:44,599
Wait!

87
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,601
So, I won't ever be able to talk to you again?

88
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,831
Not ever?!

89
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:50,912
I don't know.

90
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:54,085
Neither of us should be dying anytime soon.

91
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:58,605
Besides, a human who talks to
his own hand is just peculiar...

92
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:00,232
Fundamentally speaking.

93
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:03,322
How can you do this to me?

94
00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:05,273
Without any warning?

95
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:07,370
Once you wake up,

96
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:10,258
I'm sure you'll have forgotten all about this dream...

97
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,586
like always.

98
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:18,073
And... When that happens, I'd also
like you to forget about me as well...

99
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:22,255
You can do it... I'm certain you can.

100
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:25,542
And just think...

101
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:27,353
When morning comes...

102
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,728
you'll have an ordinary right hand...

103
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:31,802
Just like you did before.

104
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:34,486
Migi...

105
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,907
Thank you for everything, Shinichi...

106
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:44,730
Mm-hmm...

107
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:14,345
How in the hell could I ever forget you, you idiot?!

108
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:19,752
Migi...

109
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:33,198
Ugh... Nagai's been like a total pain lately,

110
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:35,038
he won't leave me alone.

111
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,660
Akiho, I swear...

112
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,865
Ah! Look who's here...

113
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,100
Hey, Shinichi! It's been a long time.

114
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:44,577
I'm late... sorry about that.

115
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:48,211
Mm-mm... Yuko and Akiho happened to be passing by.

116
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:50,985
Yeah, the two of us are going out to see an art exhibit.

117
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:53,749
And I could not care less, art is so stupid.

118
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,663
We'll see you two love birds later! Be good now, bye!

119
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:59,777
Yeah! See ya! Bye! Woo!

120
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,440
They seem to be doing well.

121
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,917
Mm-hm... I guess those two are really enjoying

122
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,652
the whole college-life thing.

123
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,867
I've totally been left behind haven't I...

124
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:10,704
Uh...

125
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:15,081
Then you'll have to hurry and catch up!

126
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,503
We're waiting for you.

127
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:22,808
After everything that's happened,

128
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:26,178
having to wait to take the
entrance exam again is like torture.

129
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:29,986
A wonderful summer of basking-in-the-sun torture.

130
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,425
Nothing at all has been happening recently...

131
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:37,106
And there hasn't been a single
sign of parasites around anywhere.

132
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,149
In fact, one time, I even called Uda...

133
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:43,821
and we talked about what we thought might have happened...

134
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:45,615
and how we got to where we are.

135
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,949
I decided not to tell him about Migi.

136
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,919
His "disappearance" is unique, even among his kind.

137
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:54,947
Migi...

138
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:57,129
I could never understand you -

139
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:59,764
and it looks like maybe I'm not the only one.

140
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,497
But that fits. In fact, I'm sure right now,

141
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:05,655
you're walking some path all your own.

142
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,972
The battles we fought together...

143
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,849
They weren't really for the sake of the Earth...

144
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,946
They were for humanity...

145
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,639
Or, to be honest...

146
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,001
sometimes just for me.

147
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,623
I could never see things from
the parasites' point of view...

148
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:25,598
let alone Migi's.

149
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,493
Of course not...

150
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:29,870
That was impossible right from the start.

151
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:33,751
We're two different species.

152
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,789
Sometimes we'd use each other,

153
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,659
and sometimes we'd kill each other...

154
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:40,803
But we may never truly comprehend each other.

155
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:46,143
Because, you can never possibly understand
someone when you've judged them by your own standards.

156
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:51,464
I believe it's arrogance that makes humans
think we can sympathize how other life forms feel.

157
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:56,382
It's obvious that among all the creatures out there,

158
00:08:56,597 --> 00:08:58,939
mankind doesn't really have many friends.

159
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,827
But, even if we can't relate to them,

160
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,964
they're still our "neighbors,"
and they deserve our respect.

161
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:09,418
We humans protect other species because we feel alone.

162
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:14,199
We protect the environment
because we don't want to go extinct.

163
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,855
Look inside the human heart, and
all you'll find is self-preservation...

164
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:23,035
I think that's all there is to it.

165
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,907
We don't know anything else.

166
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:27,677
And I doubt it'll ever end.

167
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:30,919
I mean it seems to have worked so far. Right?

168
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:35,222
Well that's what I think.. And so...

169
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:40,007
In the end, it's a contradiction for us
to love the Earth without loving ourselves.

170
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:42,375
Mm? Are you okay?

171
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:46,917
Uh... Oh, no I'm fine... I'm actually
trying to say it's more peaceful lately.

172
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,089
Yeah? But I'm pretty sure I heard
that crime has been on the rise.

173
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:52,250
Wait... that's it!

174
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:52,768
Huh?

175
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,725
That's why they're not standing out.

176
00:09:56,936 --> 00:10:00,508
Or maybe... they never stood
out that much in the first place...

177
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,596
Even murder can sometimes amount to
nothing more than a wild animal feeding itself.

178
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:09,297
In a narrow sense, they're our enemies...

179
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,650
but in a broader sense... they're just like us.

180
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:16,866
I mean, we were all born on this planet, weren't we?

181
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:19,978
And all of us...

182
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,047
all of us survive off each other.

183
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,788
Hmm...

184
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:38,072
Time has really flown by...

185
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:40,565
Can you believe how long we've been going out?

186
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:42,814
Wait, have we been dating all this time?

187
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,669
Huh?

188
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:45,382
Hehe... I'm kidding.

189
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,439
Ah... Hehe...

190
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:49,639
Y'know what...

191
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,319
Hm?

192
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,875
U-uh...

193
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:55,094
You are so mean to me sometimes.

194
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,287
Hehe... What?

195
00:10:58,913 --> 00:10:59,378
Oh...

196
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:03,536
What's the matter now?

197
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,336
<i>I must be imagining things.</i>

198
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,548
<i>He looked like that guy.</i>

199
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,396
I just thought I saw someone I knew.

200
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,450
So you wanna get something to eat?

201
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,427
Oh! Uh!

202
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,532
<i>No! It is him!</i>

203
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:27,209
What is it?

204
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,575
Hold this... Wait for me here okay.

205
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,308
Huh? I'll be right back!

206
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,049
<i>He went through here.</i>

207
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,001
What are you doing Shinichi?

208
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:43,193
Looking for me.

209
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,855
Uh... Aahh! Uh!

210
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,827
Ah!

211
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:49,452
Huh?

212
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:53,617
Yoo-hoo...

213
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:56,263
Murano!

214
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:00,324
Hey! You let her go!

215
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:02,439
Er.. Argh!

216
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:04,294
<i>This cannot be happening!</i>

217
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,629
<i>I should've just acted like I didn't see him!</i>

218
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:12,442
Let's get outta here.

219
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:13,300
Yeah.

220
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:22,846
Uh! Hey! Hey, what do you think you're...

221
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,465
Huh?

222
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:28,409
AAAAHH!

223
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:29,846
Someone, help!

224
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:31,973
Ah!

225
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:32,581
Ugh!

226
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:43,920
I'll get to you a little later.

227
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:46,104
I gotta talk to your boyfriend first.

228
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:51,787
Murano!

229
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:56,286
Excuse me...

230
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,616
Gah!

231
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:05,283
You got up here pretty fast.

232
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,509
Murano!

233
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:08,844
Shini-chi...

234
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:12,126
Aw, isn't that just the cutest thing ever?

235
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:14,622
She's so scared, she can barely even talk.

236
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,579
Stop it! What'd you do to her?!

237
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:17,879
Nothing yet...

238
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,392
This blood's from that minx over there.

239
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,912
Huh?

240
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:24,064
Hey. Come on now...

241
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,963
Settle down and just let her go, so we can talk.

242
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,509
Huh?! You can't be serious!

243
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:31,381
What is it you want?

244
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:34,458
I'll do anything. Look just...

245
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:36,425
please don't hurt her.

246
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,300
Uh-huh...

247
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,085
Is there something that you want?

248
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:43,859
If there is, just tell me.

249
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:46,411
Hmm... Something I want?

250
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:50,086
The cops aren't completely stupid.

251
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:53,431
I know it's only a matter of time
before they catch up to me again.

252
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:57,567
So I'm glad I got to run into you two kids first...

253
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:01,879
I would like to get an answer that
I can't get from any human being.

254
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:02,504
Gasp...

255
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:03,288
Huh?

256
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:07,713
When those monsters kill humans,
it makes total sense, right?

257
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:08,826
They're just feeding...

258
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:11,323
But what do you think I am?

259
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,420
Now, I'm sure you already know the answer to that...

260
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,705
I am true human nature.

261
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:24,359
I do wonder how all the people
out there are able to be so patient.

262
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:28,614
I mean, humans have always naturally
had the itch to kill one another.

263
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,749
Yet they make such a fuss over it,

264
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,839
when we're all thirsty for blood.

265
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:39,313
And these people who don't even
know what they are, try to demonize me?

266
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:43,694
I can tell the monsters from the
humans just by looking at 'em...

267
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:47,222
I know how unnatural the world has become.

268
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:51,845
So there is no need for any of these monsters!

269
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,403
We're already here. Humans will
naturally feed on one another!

270
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,528
It's been that way for thousands of years!

271
00:14:57,587 --> 00:15:03,328
It's only because we tried to stop all of a sudden
that there are now seven or eight billions of us!

272
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:05,590
We can't even sustain ourselves anymore!

273
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:08,041
They lie to themselves.

274
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,666
But not us. We're different.

275
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,218
So you can be honest with me.

276
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:14,827
I don't follow you. What do you mean?

277
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,931
Don't you play dumb with me...

278
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,594
You're a mix, aren't you?

279
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,054
You're part monster.

280
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:20,767
What?!

281
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:25,042
I knew it the first time that I saw you.

282
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,612
It's not in your head, though.

283
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:28,387
It's somewhere else in your body.

284
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:28,914
No...

285
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,549
Don't be ridiculous!

286
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:33,501
You're his girly-friend, right?

287
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:35,563
You've seen him up close and personal.

288
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:38,962
Tell me. Does he have some kind of scar somewhere?

289
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,541
A hole where a little friend might've dug inside him?

290
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:49,639
I'm begging you... Please, just let her go.

291
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,978
Now, answer me!

292
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:53,220
I'M the normal human here, aren't I?

293
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,223
I'm just doing my thing, following my natural instincts!

294
00:15:56,356 --> 00:16:02,391
I'm the one being true to my nature, while the rest
of this herd desperately keeps looking the other way.

295
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:08,388
I'm asking you for a favor, seeing as how
you're halfway between the humans and the parasites.

296
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:12,790
<i>Shinichi...</i>

297
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:18,544
Halfway between the humans and the parasites, huh?

298
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:24,144
Someone said something to me
very similar to that once before.

299
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:30,076
You know, you're not really
anything close to the likes of Goto...

300
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,298
but then again, I'm not very strong anymore either.

301
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:37,258
So if words can settle this, I'll say what you want...

302
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:40,215
Just please... please let the girl go.

303
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,203
Hmm...

304
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:45,669
Er! Okay, you're right!

305
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:47,051
It's like you said. I'm a...

306
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:47,791
Shinichi!

307
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,248
Just go. Call the police.

308
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:52,405
Huh?

309
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,478
Don't waste your time with this guy.

310
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:58,025
How can you call yourself a normal human being?!

311
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:00,702
You're even worse than those damn monsters!

312
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:02,635
Oh, my...

313
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:07,295
For someone who was trembling and couldn't
even speak earlier, you sure got spunky.

314
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,711
You can go to Hell, I'm not scared of you!

315
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,494
I've seen things disgusting garbage
like you can't possibly imagine!

316
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:15,409
Please... Murano...

317
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:18,335
Shinichi, you and I both went through it.

318
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,637
That's right.

319
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,929
Shinichi, you were incredible.

320
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,322
You carried me and protected me.

321
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,010
You did everything for me.

322
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,191
Sure, you might be a bit different,

323
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,951
but you ARE a human!

324
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:35,883
Because real humans believe that all life is precious!

325
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,629
You! YOU'RE the monster!

326
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:39,135
Enough, okay?

327
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:42,288
Shinichi, don't worry about me, just go!

328
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:43,813
Hahaha...

329
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:45,425
Yeah, yeah, go call 'em..

330
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,068
The two of us will just hang here and wait.

331
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:50,799
I think we'll be able to keep ourselves entertained...

332
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:54,780
I'll take my time slicing off every tasty little morsel.

333
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:58,493
I mean, it'll probably be the
last fun I ever get to have, right?

334
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:02,655
Breaking down the spunky ones is always so satisfying.

335
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:05,513
Shi-Shinichi!

336
00:18:06,314 --> 00:18:06,754
Uh...

337
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:10,773
I was... I was always trying to catch up to you.

338
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:14,230
But you were moving so fast, and then...

339
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:17,165
you went to a place I didn't understand.

340
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,499
I ended up being left behind.

341
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:21,456
Ah...

342
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,275
And now, I've finally caught up with you...

343
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:27,335
But I...

344
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:30,260
I may've gone a bit too far.

345
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,777
NO! DON'T!

346
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,467
<i>I'll save her! I can do it!</i>

347
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:38,352
<i>That's right, I'm fast!</i>

348
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:40,408
<i>I'm not your normal human being!</i>

349
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:43,334
<i>I see him. He looks like he's frozen in time!</i>

350
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:45,553
<i>Stop the knife with my left arm...</i>

351
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:48,135
<i>and then go for the jaw!</i>

352
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,186
Auughh!

353
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:49,844
Unngh!

354
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:51,760
<i>Now, with my right...!</i>

355
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,810
<i>Uhh...</i>

356
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:57,321
<i>Such a shame... to break so easily...</i>

357
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:03,026
AAUUUHH!

358
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,422
No... Murano...

359
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:15,545
God not you too... Not again... no...

360
00:19:19,504 --> 00:19:20,640
I met an organism.

361
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,467
I got to know it...

362
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:24,827
And it suddenly dies.

363
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,442
And then, I get sad...

364
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,365
Why does that happen?

365
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:32,328
Perhaps, that just shows you,

366
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:34,706
humans have too much time on their hands...

367
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:39,291
But still... having those feelings
is also their greatest merit.

368
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:42,241
To live with such room in their hearts...

369
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:44,763
It is indeed a wonderful gift.

370
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:48,802
But anyway... That's quite
enough of all this moping around.

371
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,692
I'm tired, you can do the holding now.

372
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:53,058
Uhh...

373
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:54,633
Gasp!

374
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:56,915
Ah... Murano!

375
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,461
Uh...

376
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:00,889
<i>I made it in time...</i>

377
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:02,326
<i>Migi!</i>

378
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:07,267
Uh!

379
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:14,247
Are you okay?

380
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:18,915
<i>Thank you, Migi...</i>

381
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,185
<i>I'm so glad you're still here!</i>

382
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:24,782
<i>Could Murano have seen Migi?</i>

383
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:28,621
<i>Oh, well... If it's her...</i>

384
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,318
<i>I guess I don't mind.</i>

385
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,430
<i>What a beautiful sky.</i>

386
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,591
Hey, um... Do you remember the
little puppy that died awhile back?

387
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:41,941
And I threw it in the trash can.

388
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:44,656
I keep forgetting to tell you this but...

389
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:47,737
but I thought about it for a long time...

390
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:50,261
and I buried it underneath a tree.

391
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:52,296
I know...

392
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:53,279
Huh?

393
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,130
I know. You did the right thing.

394
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:01,013
Because you're Shinichi Izumi.

395
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:03,248
Hm...

396
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:09,164
Oh my God! Look! There's three more bodies over there!

397
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:11,577
Did he say three bodies?

398
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:13,259
He's including us.

399
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,311
Hehe...

400
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:21,885
All of us are born here together...

401
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:25,770
And we live our lives trying to understand each other,

402
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,454
using little bits of reason we accumulate along the way.

403
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,882
Striving to find someone to relate to...

404
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:35,331
and when we finally do...

405
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:38,416
it's already over.
