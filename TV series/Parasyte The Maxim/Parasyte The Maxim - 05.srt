1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,670
I don't think I've been this far out before.

2
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:15,896
Oh, really? You gotta be up early tomorrow?

3
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,027
No I don't.

4
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,746
Good, then let's go a little bit farther.

5
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:22,241
Th‐there's a spot up ahead with a beautiful view.

6
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:24,508
I don't care for this thing.

7
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:28,904
Yeah well, y'know, you might wanna go
ahead and put it on, just to be safe.

8
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:31,935
Hey, what are you doing?

9
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:50,217
The vital organs are ruined.

10
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:53,320
My host body will die soon.

11
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,606
I'll use the man.

12
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:59,803
I see. The belt does serve a purpose.

13
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:09,598
My only choice is to relocate to this man's body.

14
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:12,679
There should be no difference in controlling a male host.

15
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:14,324
Sever the head...

16
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,883
fuse with the host... and regenerate...

17
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:20,461
It must all be done in an instant.

18
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,953
It feels strange...

19
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,150
I need to move...

20
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:36,996
C'mon, move...

21
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:12,891
Ah! Oh, crap! I'm gonna be late!

22
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:14,871
Why didn't you wake me up?!

23
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:18,398
You slept as long as you did
because your body needed the rest.

24
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:21,883
If I had woken you up, I would
deprive you of energy. It's a good thing.

25
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:22,771
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:25,678
And of course, your well‐being is also my well‐being.

27
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:30,740
Interesting...

28
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,018
it would appear you two are conjoined.

29
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:35,667
Ah man, what's that even s'pos'ta mean?

30
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:40,562
I'm not certain, but the reason could lie in
the network of your nerves and bodily fluids

31
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:42,873
that are linking my body to your brain.

32
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:43,633
Huh?!

33
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,616
It's possible your brain may be undergoing
some kind of change as well as your body.

34
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:54,734
Ryoko Tamiya was probably able to sense it, and
noticed something about you that seemed inhuman.

35
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:56,684
She thinks I'm not a human?

36
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:58,911
The only thing not human about me's you.

37
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,291
I'm not so sure.

38
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:05,317
It would not surprise me if you had changed
somehow, particularly at the psychological level.

39
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:08,344
Going to sleep now...

40
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,163
Hey, wait a second!

41
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:14,127
We're "conjoined"?

42
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:16,440
Ever so slightly.

43
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:18,965
I won't be killing you after all.

44
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:22,335
No, there's nothing wrong with me.

45
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:25,778
Something is just... Something is different.

46
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:29,164
You know, Shinichi, you've changed recently.

47
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:31,811
I'm not turning into one of them!

48
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,032
I'm not gonna kill and eat people.

49
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:43,106
Huh?

50
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:46,741
Hey! I thought I said stand up!

51
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,320
You like that, bitch?! Get some!

52
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,337
Nagai!

53
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,047
Stop it!

54
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,646
You got a problem?

55
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:00,519
C'mon guys, you need to leave him alone all right.

56
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:02,837
Shinichi?

57
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:05,211
And why's that?

58
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:13,980
Look, I don't know what's going on here,

59
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,838
but I thinks he's had enough.

60
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:17,284
Heh...

61
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:26,038
Got anything else you wanna say, Four‐Eyes?

62
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,499
I'm thinkin' the little shit wants another one.

63
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:31,596
Just forget it. It's kinda pitiful.

64
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:35,789
Look pal, we've got some business
with your boyfriend here, so get lost.

65
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:43,485
One thing I don't understand about the
human psyche is the notion of "self‐sacrifice."

66
00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:48,132
Doing something to assist another
being, at a cost to oneself, is unnatural.

67
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:50,362
I do no see the benefit in this at all.

68
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:52,593
The human psyche...

69
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,578
C'mon, get up, asshole.

70
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:55,953
We're just gettin' started.

71
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,207
That's it!

72
00:05:57,471 --> 00:06:00,235
Human beings are different from parasites!

73
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:02,760
Hey! I said to stop it!

74
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,671
It's not much of a fight when
you have someone outnumbered!

75
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:08,678
Yo, dude...

76
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:11,893
You sure you wanna do this? Hmm?

77
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,666
Yeah, I do.

78
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:18,262
Might've been a bad idea...

79
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,265
This what you wanted?

80
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,083
Don't you think you're overdoing it a little?

81
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,460
Not yet.

82
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:30,348
You heard the dumbass, he was askin' for it right?

83
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:37,151
Oh, no, Migi's not gonna know what this is about!

84
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,679
All right that's enough!

85
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:44,186
It's kinda lame to pick on someone so weak and sad.

86
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,388
Must be your lucky day.

87
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,868
Mind your own business. It's less painful.

88
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:56,045
Ah!

89
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:07,168
Wha...

90
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,158
What... What are you?

91
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:16,899
Come on, let's get outta here.

92
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,802
Hey there, Nagai, you doing okay?

93
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:32,508
Jesus Christ, man, you crazy?

94
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:35,609
Maybe... That was probably pretty stupid, huh?

95
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:39,041
But hey, that's the kinda stuff that
separates us from the animals, right?

96
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:40,463
Hmm?

97
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:46,263
Oh, my God, what happened to you?

98
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:49,145
Don't worry, it's nothing. I'm okay.

99
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:50,779
I asked him that, too.

100
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,574
And he wouldn't tell me either.

101
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,237
D'you get in a fight, or, uh...

102
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:55,909
Hey, Shinichi.

103
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:57,984
Nagai just got through tellin' me.

104
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,336
He said you took on Mitsuo's whole crew.

105
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:04,078
I wouldn't say I took them on.
They killed me. Look at my face.

106
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,920
Those guys have been doing more
and more crap like that lately.

107
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:09,645
If they try anything else, you let me know, okay?

108
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:11,132
Oh, sure.

109
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:22,883
Uh... It's you!

110
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,798
So I guess you have a girlfriend?

111
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:25,952
What do you want?

112
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:29,570
Why didn't you run away earlier?

113
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:31,428
Huh? I just couldn't...

114
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,325
You barely even know that guy and stood
up for him, and you got your ass kicked.

115
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:37,723
This guy's not quite right is he?

116
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:40,392
Do what? What's that supposed to mean?

117
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:41,805
Let's go.

118
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:47,800
I can see through you!

119
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:51,548
You can pretend to be all self‐righteous,
but I know that you're up to something!

120
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:54,519
What's her deal?

121
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:55,879
I dunno.

122
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:00,453
Dammit, Kana...

123
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:03,925
Stop it!

124
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:13,004
Shinichi, help!

125
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:19,260
Murano!

126
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:21,000
Shinichi!

127
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:25,457
There you are, you piece‐a‐shit.

128
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:28,180
Just let her go! Come on!

129
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:30,326
Nah, I don't think so.

130
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:33,300
Go on home; we'll take care of her.

131
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,180
What?

132
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:36,194
Ow, that hurts!

133
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:44,375
Shinichi, no!

134
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:45,790
I said go!

135
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,347
Please, stop it!

136
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:49,818
Y'ain't actin' like a frickin' hero this time!

137
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:53,190
Face it, you can't do a goddamn thing.

138
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,840
Shinichi...

139
00:09:58,006 --> 00:09:59,444
No not now, Migi.

140
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:01,019
You can go back to sleep.

141
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:02,235
Shinichi...

142
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:03,954
I can take care of this.

143
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,926
For your reference, I will rate each of them by strength.

144
00:10:11,454 --> 00:10:14,115
If your rating is a ten, then he's an 18.

145
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,679
The one to the right is a 13,
and the others are 14 and 12.

146
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,771
Migi, why are you telling me all this?

147
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:25,490
Even dogs and cats are able to evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of their opponents.

148
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:28,516
Animals instinctively avoid fights they cannot win.

149
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,344
Yeah, so what's your point?

150
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,248
Leave him alone!

151
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,578
Well, sometimes a human can't back down from a fight.

152
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,323
There's a difference between humans and animals.

153
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:44,847
Migi, I don't have much feeling in my hand!

154
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:46,106
Give me full control!

155
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:49,640
Sorry, you got something to say, you'll have'ta speak up!

156
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,271
Man, why doesn't he just give up?

157
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:02,363
You are gonna let her go!

158
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:03,938
Or else!

159
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:07,509
Wait! No, Migi, stay outta this!

160
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:15,385
"Or else," what?

161
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:17,561
You'll run home and tell your mommy?

162
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,204
I, uh, think that's enough, Mitsuo.

163
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:25,367
Kana...

164
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:29,763
Well, well, look what we have here.

165
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,559
Kamijo, Nagai!

166
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:42,560
Ah, yes, the majority overpowering the minority.

167
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:45,968
These humans actually make much
more sense than you do, Shinichi.

168
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,197
Looks like it's time for some payback, you son of a bitch.

169
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:52,099
You think cause you brought
some friends you've got a chance?

170
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:53,679
You've made a big mistake.

171
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:54,578
SHUT UP!

172
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:13,200
Hmm... The male genitalia are
actually quite different from the female.

173
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:15,625
I can't seem to control them very well.

174
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:21,224
Something's wrong, I can't move.

175
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,866
Damn! It's rejecting me!

176
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:27,329
I can no longer merge with a body of the opposite sex.

177
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:29,379
I must find a woman.

178
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,819
Leaving the urban area was a mistake.

179
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,849
I must find a new host and relocate.

180
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,439
Look, it's not like I can't walk or anything.

181
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:40,679
I'm fine, really.

182
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,437
Uh, no, you're not.

183
00:12:46,873 --> 00:12:48,343
I'm really sorry.

184
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,549
There's nothing that you need to apologize for.

185
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,359
Oww, ow!

186
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,939
Oh, huh? Your right hand isn't even scratched.

187
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,126
Cause I mean, your left hand
sure got messed up pretty badly.

188
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,952
Ah... How 'bout that?

189
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,436
Tell me... Do you think that I'm weird?

190
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:14,632
Do I seem normal to you?

191
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:17,545
Oh, no, you are not normal at all.

192
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:18,820
I'm not?

193
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,239
Well, you're kinda cool.

194
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,827
You risked yourself to help a friend.

195
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:29,503
Not many "normal" people out there would do that.

196
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:32,334
Is that s'posta be a compliment?

197
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:36,027
Of course.

198
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:41,820
I've never known anyone who would try
something like that, knowing you couldn't win.

199
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,689
You did a really good thing.

200
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:48,214
Oh, okay.

201
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:54,172
My parents are out of town right now...

202
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,856
Do you maybe wanna stay over?

203
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:58,641
Mmm... No, thanks...

204
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,786
I should go.

205
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,066
Very disappointing.

206
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,658
I'd hoped I'd get the chance to see humans mate.

207
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,648
Oh, go to sleep.

208
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,117
Who are you talking to?

209
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:15,594
You followed me home?

210
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:17,607
I just came to apologize.

211
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:18,767
Oh, uh...

212
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:20,726
Okay, then.

213
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:24,487
A truce?

214
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:29,059
Well, at the very least, WE don't have a problem, do we?

215
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:30,939
Um...

216
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:32,867
Yeah...

217
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:47,998
Sorry, I'm really... tired.

218
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,163
You should be careful when it comes to that female.

219
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:02,330
It seems she is able to sense, however slightly,
wavelengths that should only be perceptible to parasites.

220
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:04,396
But she is human, right?

221
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:08,239
I've noticed Murano's also a very perceptive person.

222
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:10,421
But THIS girl is on a whole different level.

223
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:12,274
You should stay away from her.

224
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,629
Yeah...

225
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:31,866
Wow, this is beautiful!

226
00:15:32,145 --> 00:15:35,934
Yeah, kinda makes all that rushin'
around to get here worthwhile doesn't it?

227
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:37,817
We should come back here.

228
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:40,605
And bring Shinichi with us!

229
00:15:41,738 --> 00:15:43,827
He's never far from your mind, is he?

230
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:46,225
Nobuko!

231
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:02,932
Your diet appears to be unbalanced.

232
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:05,480
You don't even know what this tastes like.

233
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,655
Your mother always prepares
nutritionally appropriate meals.

234
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:12,134
Well, I can eat like that again tomorrow.

235
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:17,648
It's from a public phone.

236
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:20,581
Shinichi?

237
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,006
Yeah, Dad?

238
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,119
Y‐your mother...

239
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,625
Uh... what's wrong?

240
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:30,262
Your... your mom...

241
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,043
I'm going to the police.

242
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,178
I'll get that damned monster if it's the last thing I do!

243
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:41,257
Wait, Dad?! A monster?!

244
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,352
"A monster"? It can't be...

245
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:51,431
But... but Mom...

246
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:53,893
Shinichi, what is it?

247
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,644
Dad! Mom!

248
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:03,664
What's going on? What is this place?

249
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:05,913
We're in no rush.

250
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:08,894
We'll just decide where to stop as we go along.

251
00:17:10,157 --> 00:17:12,847
It'll be nice to just relax and take it easy.

252
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,974
Dad, where's Mom?

253
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,869
That goddamn monster!

254
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:25,761
She's not a monster, she's... Mom!

255
00:17:26,764 --> 00:17:27,716
Shinichi...

256
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:29,473
MOM!

257
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:38,546
Come on, Dad, you gotta call me back.

258
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:41,176
I gotta figure out a way to find them!

259
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:46,767
Shinichi, you really need to get some sleep.

260
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,176
"A monster..."

261
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,717
That's exactly what Dad said on the phone.

262
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,523
I know that can only mean one thing.

263
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:58,173
Hmm... Hold on, Shinichi.

264
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:02,263
I'm detecting one of my kind nearby.

265
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:04,431
And it's coming directly toward us.

266
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:06,857
This is all your fault.

267
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:10,138
I was against them taking the trip in the first place.

268
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,838
But you said they'd be safe; you said it would be fine!

269
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,757
I never said that it would be "fine."

270
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:16,946
I merely pointed out that, in terms of probability...

271
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:21,428
Shut up! I should've told them about what was
really going on when you showed up in the first place!

272
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:23,971
I understand there's a lot
you'd like to discuss right now,

273
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,902
but I need you to focus on the
battle that's about to commence.

274
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:36,160
No, you won't need a weapon this time.

275
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:40,389
I will eliminate it before it's able to
determine whether or not we are friend or foe.

276
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,438
I can't face this thing unarmed.

277
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,206
I'm so full of hate right now, I'm going crazy.

278
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:47,021
Those damn monsters!

279
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:48,251
It stopped moving...

280
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:50,426
It's just outside.

281
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:00,195
How could it unlock the door?

282
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:21,534
It's you!

283
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:25,111
Mom?

284
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:29,694
So, then the male has not yet returned.

285
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:31,762
What's that Mom?

286
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,168
That's not your mother.

287
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:34,361
You know that.

288
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:35,947
Uh, welcome back!

289
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,293
Mom, are you doing okay?

290
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:39,806
What's the matter?

291
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:41,834
This is a unique situation.

292
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:44,495
A merge with the hand is highly unusual.

293
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,539
One of my kind has taken over
your mother's head, Shinichi.

294
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:49,621
Huh? My hand?

295
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,496
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Mom.

296
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:54,820
I mean, I really wanted to tell
you about it earlier, but I...

297
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,043
I just couldn't. I, uh...

298
00:19:57,324 --> 00:19:59,543
I mean, it's kinda crazy, right?

299
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:00,650
No, Shinichi, she's not...

300
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:01,629
JUST SHUT UP!!

301
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:03,956
Am I to assume the male is now dead?

302
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:09,637
I see. Then I must go back and confirm
whether or not he's actually been eliminated.

303
00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:12,259
The knife, it's in my way. Put it down.

304
00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:15,713
So, yeah, I know, having a
talking right hand is pretty weird.

305
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,766
I mean hard to believe right?

306
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,679
Just the hand? How unlucky.

307
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:24,380
Without taking the head, you
find yourself under human control.

308
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:26,846
Stop it, Mom!

309
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:29,360
I'll tell you everything I've been hiding from you!

310
00:20:29,624 --> 00:20:31,833
Just, please, stop talking like that!

311
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:34,227
Shinichi, you have to see what's happening.

312
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:35,076
Your mother is already...

313
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,549
Shut up! Just shut up!

314
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:37,670
You don't know what you're talking about!

315
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:38,377
Shinichi!

316
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:40,437
If you keep talking, I swear I'll cut you off!

317
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:43,394
Please, Mom!

318
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:46,458
It's okay...

319
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,333
You remember it right?

320
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:49,892
The scar on your arm?

321
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:53,040
Every time I see it, I feel guilty.

322
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:54,606
And, Mom, I...

323
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:56,773
I wanna apologize.

324
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:03,412
Shinichi!

325
00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:23,584
Mom...

326
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:49,226
Next time: "The Sun Also Rises"
