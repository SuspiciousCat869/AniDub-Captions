1
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:07,058
You're dead!

2
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:09,765
What the...

3
00:00:10,413 --> 00:00:11,058
Uh...

4
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:22,504
It's not the one I'm looking for...

5
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:25,429
But this one IS one of those parasites.

6
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:27,682
Ah! Hey, wait a second!

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,503
What's wrong? Migi?!

8
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:34,420
I've determined that his human brain is still intact.

9
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:35,793
It is?!

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,363
Whoa! That is crazy!

11
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:43,513
Just the hand?

12
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,021
How does THAT guy have a human brain?!

13
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:49,454
No, he's telling the truth!

14
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,061
I really do have a human brain...

15
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:52,627
It's totally for real!

16
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,066
Can you believe this crap?

17
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:01,632
Yes, Shinichi, the brain is indeed still intact.

18
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:04,853
From the lower half of his face to the base of his neck,

19
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:07,263
perhaps down to his chest, is the parasite.

20
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:08,521
Yep, that's right.

21
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,362
So, hey guys, that means we're like practically the same!

22
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:48,522
It was only a year after we got married,

23
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:50,455
my wife ran off and left me.

24
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:54,136
She never really said anything about what was wrong.

25
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:57,160
But my guess was she just got tired of me.

26
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:01,434
I've never been the most... exciting guy.

27
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,728
In fact, I'm so pathetic...

28
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,607
I didn't even have the guts to
go through with killing myself.

29
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:18,196
It's really beautiful...

30
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:38,297
What is that?! Go away! Shoo! Shoo, shoo!

31
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:56,444
And then, after all that, I...

32
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,016
Oh, my God, he tells the worst stories!

33
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,045
Now, your right hand should be
able to remember some of this stuff.

34
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:06,744
So, y'see, my very first and only thought
was to take over the brain of a host, right?

35
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:09,456
So I start zippin' straight for this guy's noggin.

36
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:11,003
But something's wrong...

37
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,239
What's happening?

38
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,184
It's not breathing.

39
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:18,245
If that doesn't change, the body will die.

40
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,940
There's no time to take the brain.

41
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:23,201
Neither one of us will make it.

42
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:25,804
So since he was about to eat it,

43
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,097
I had to just go for it and
get to merging as fast as I could.

44
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:40,658
I see, very interesting.

45
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:43,038
Ya see, that's how we wound up like this.

46
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:51,734
So, the problem is, whenever I
hand over the talky part to this guy,

47
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,565
he just blathers and yaps and puts everybody to sleep!

48
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:55,867
Quiet!

49
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:58,501
Anyway, I sure was surprised to see you!

50
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:01,744
When this guy suddenly tells me
that one of my kind is coming closer,

51
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,155
I was pretty nervous about what
sort of monster we were gonna run into.

52
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:08,014
But when you showed up, man, was I relieved.

53
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,849
I mean, wow! There are actually
other people out there who're like me!

54
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:15,498
So, I am dying to know... Tell me your story.

55
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,738
How'd you get like this?

56
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:18,633
Yeah, yeah, totally! Tell us!

57
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:23,428
Sure, but before I do that, do you think
maybe we could go somewhere else, please?

58
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,991
My name's Shinichi Izumi. And this is Migi.

59
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:31,941
The thing is, we need to stay close to a certain place.

60
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:36,178
Ah, well, I'm Mamoru Uda.

61
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,874
And this guy, you can just call him "Parasite."

62
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:41,878
That's right, you can just call me "Parasite".

63
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:46,341
Wait, where the heck did he go?

64
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,142
It's like he just disappeared.

65
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:55,227
That's awful! It's just completely awful!

66
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:59,119
That's why you've stayed so close
to the hospital this whole time?

67
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:01,709
It must be so hard. I couldn't do it!

68
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,365
Yeah...

69
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:06,512
I swear ta God, he cries all the freakin' time.

70
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:09,050
I don't understand how these humans operate at all.

71
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,149
I feel the same way sometimes.

72
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,423
I can't help but notice.

73
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,048
Your Migi speaks quite well.

74
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:16,514
Huh? Oh, yeah...

75
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:20,034
Well, that's probably because he
reads whenever he gets the chance.

76
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:23,145
Well, I learned how to talk
from watchin' a whole lotta TV.

77
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,017
I mean, all this guy does is sit on
the couch, and watch old re-runs and cry.

78
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:29,991
How about your host? Does he spend all his time crying?

79
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:32,125
Hey, look, that is just about enough!

80
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:39,225
Okay, I work at the hotel
that's just in the next town over.

81
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:43,630
And once he tells me one of those
things is around, I will let you know.

82
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,169
Uh...

83
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:46,444
Please let us help you out!

84
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:47,887
I mean...

85
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,566
You're the first person I've met like me and...

86
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,738
This guy really is a crybaby.

87
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:55,681
But I'm glad I met him.

88
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,149
It feels good to know that

89
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:00,739
I'm not the only one out there like this.

90
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:02,975
Shinichi...

91
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:04,594
Shinichi!

92
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:10,009
It's really late, Migi. What... what do you want?

93
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:11,791
This is very important.

94
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:17,070
I wanted to talk to you earlier today, but in
meeting Uda and his parasite, I missed my chance.

95
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:18,794
Did you notice, Shinichi?

96
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:21,479
First, you ran at the speed of a seasoned athlete,

97
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:24,483
and then you jumped more than three meters high.

98
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:26,415
What about it?

99
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:28,451
That doesn't seem odd to you?

100
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:30,135
Then I'll have to elaborate.

101
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,287
But first, about my own body...

102
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:38,006
See? Doing this kind of thing takes practice, you know.

103
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,549
If I divide into two parts like this,

104
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:43,855
each of the halves is still
fully capable of thought and speech.

105
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,667
Wow...

106
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:48,283
But if I start dividing into parts that are too small,

107
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:53,489
our intelligence will diminish to where we're
incapable of thought, much less rejoining together,

108
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,737
and those parts would be unable to survive.

109
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,123
Huh... okay...

110
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:00,355
That's why, whenever I do divide,

111
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,512
a consensus is reached beforehand.

112
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:04,263
And it acts as a mantra,

113
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:06,985
an instinct to come back together as one.

114
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:09,402
Uh, all right then, I think I get it.

115
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,131
Then again, there are places
where even my smallest fragments-.

116
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:14,978
They are still able to survive.

117
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,794
For example, a place where there
is a constant flow of fresh blood.

118
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:22,935
In other words, they can survive inside your body.

119
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,080
In my body?

120
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,616
Are you serious?!

121
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:27,887
Yes, that's right.

122
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:30,546
In fact, the Migi that's talking to you right now

123
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:33,914
is actually only about seventy percent of the original.

124
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:37,077
When I closed the wound in your heart,

125
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,303
I instructed all my parts to return
to your right arm via your bloodstream.

126
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,333
However, once it was restored,

127
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,970
your heart was much stronger than I had expected,

128
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:48,781
so quite a lot of me was dispersed throughout your body.

129
00:08:57,207 --> 00:09:00,420
They've become so small that I
can no longer communicate with them.

130
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:03,503
Unbelievable...

131
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:07,687
Just when I thought you couldn't tell
me anything else that could surprise me.

132
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:12,499
If there had been no physiological
changes, I was going to keep quiet about it.

133
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:15,852
Migi...

134
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:16,936
What is it?

135
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,211
You said throughout my body...

136
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:21,196
Does that mean even in my brain?

137
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:26,193
I don't know. But it's not like those
tiny fragments have any consciousness.

138
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:29,185
I seriously doubt they would try to enter the capillaries.

139
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:30,884
Is something bothering you?

140
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,850
No, I'm sure it's nothing.

141
00:09:34,803 --> 00:09:36,757
I'm probably just over-thinking things.

142
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:42,214
Before, I felt like my heart was going
to explode from everything I was feeling,

143
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:44,945
but I still couldn't cry.

144
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:47,602
It was the same thing today, too.

145
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:51,931
I mean, Uda started bawling his eyes out
when he met someone like him for the first time.

146
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,003
But not me...

147
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,857
How about your host?

148
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:57,030
Does he spend all of his time crying?

149
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:05,798
A hole in my heart...

150
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:11,212
Hey, Maki...

151
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:13,614
Aww, how'd you know I was here?

152
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,099
Tell me somethin'.

153
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:18,278
Do I seem like a normal person to you?

154
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,644
Huh? Of course you do.

155
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:21,629
What do you mean?

156
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:26,874
Oh, come on, what's going on?

157
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,742
You gotta give me something here!

158
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,985
You... You haven't really said anything to me.

159
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:33,779
Huh?

160
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:37,053
Back on the boat, and even now, too...

161
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:39,735
It's like you just sit there with
this terrible look on your face!

162
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,579
It's like...

163
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,800
You're crying inside, but you're holding it all in!

164
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,814
It... it makes me worry.

165
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:50,377
Sorry.

166
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,571
Just... just forget it, okay?

167
00:10:58,446 --> 00:10:59,406
Oh, it's Uda.

168
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:02,317
It's here now! A parasite!

169
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:04,345
And I'm pretty sure it's the one you're looking for!

170
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:09,081
So, is it headed this way?

171
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:12,414
No, it seems to have noticed me and is coming closer.

172
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,221
I'm gonna try to stall it
somehow until you can get over here.

173
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:16,881
No! That's crazy!

174
00:11:16,987 --> 00:11:19,430
If that thing realizes that you still have a human brain,

175
00:11:19,455 --> 00:11:20,871
it's gonna try to kill you!

176
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,852
'Bout another 100 meters!

177
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:26,188
Get outta there! You need to run away right now!

178
00:11:26,288 --> 00:11:27,552
Uh, o-okay I got it!

179
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:30,870
I'll make my way around the
cape and be there as soon as I can!

180
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,607
Shinichi, I'm detecting one parasite.

181
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:50,634
One? It must be Uda.

182
00:11:56,254 --> 00:11:58,094
Come on, it's gonna catch up!

183
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,647
Look, this is the best I can do, okay?!

184
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:05,647
Well, it looks like that one's learned to
hone its host and maximize its physical potential.

185
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,228
There's no way we can beat it.

186
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:08,655
We've gotta get outta here!

187
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,902
No, we can't!

188
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:12,003
Shinichi and Migi will be here soon.

189
00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:14,731
We have to work together to have a chance!

190
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:16,910
Then you gotta go that way.

191
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:20,082
It's the only hope we have of not getting destroyed.

192
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:21,646
Shinichi...

193
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,464
Migi, can you sense the other one yet?

194
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,688
No, I'm tired.

195
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:27,646
Huh?! No, no, not now!

196
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:29,322
I need sleep...

197
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:33,363
Come on, Migi! You can't just
let Uda and his parasite die!

198
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:36,662
Shinichi, You have to listen to me.

199
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:37,682
Hey!

200
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:40,310
If possible, you should run.

201
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:44,362
Choose your own surviv... al...

202
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:49,078
Everything will be fine.

203
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:51,989
I just need to find Uda before it's too late.

204
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:57,322
Oh, crap!

205
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,655
What do we do? There's nowhere else to go!

206
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,102
This is really bad!

207
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:06,491
Even if we get cornered here, you
and Shinichi can still combine attacks.

208
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:16,035
You are the second like this I've met.

209
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:19,214
The second one whose human brain has remained intact.

210
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:23,595
As far as I am concerned, you are
nothing more than an unfortunate mistake.

211
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,469
And you must be removed.

212
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:34,836
Whoa! That's what we're supposed to really look like?

213
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:36,191
That's freakin' awesome!

214
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:41,821
Where could they be? Where?

215
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,216
I'm gonna die!

216
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,865
You are clearly outmatched.

217
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,820
I am completely fused with my host.

218
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:10,977
Your base remains human which
causes you to be much less responsive.

219
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:13,949
She's right. You are totally slowing me down.

220
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:16,584
I can feel the effects of your crappy conditioning.

221
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:19,143
But y'know, her attacks are kinda repeating.

222
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:22,366
It's just like she's targeting
the same spot over and over.

223
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:24,996
She may be strong, but she's not very creative.

224
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,025
This battle is all but done.

225
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:28,894
It is time for you to die now.

226
00:14:44,205 --> 00:14:48,105
In cases when it's difficult to
determine where the parasite ends,

227
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,484
destroying the heart is the best
approach to eradicating one's opponent.

228
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,492
Yes, of course...

229
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:58,140
the heart...

230
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:05,263
Another one of us?

231
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:09,204
Strange... The signal is much too weak.

232
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:13,158
It's as if... the parasite is asleep.

233
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:17,241
You're alive. My attack should have terminated you.

234
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:21,660
Could it be that my targeting was off?

235
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,690
No, that's not possible.

236
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:27,558
You were punctured through the
heart, yet somehow did not die.

237
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:31,239
Obviously, I should have cut off your head as well.

238
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:32,885
Dammit...

239
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:35,121
Even the voice is still the same.

240
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:41,796
I am gonna kill you now, and it's gonna be quick.

241
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,691
Yeah, that's it, come on!

242
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,215
Like the disgusting monster that you are!

243
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,841
You are going to die, too. Like your friend.

244
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,920
"My friend"?

245
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:00,674
What have you done to Uda?!

246
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:03,745
The signal from his right hand is very weak.

247
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,960
It's almost as if it's hibernating.

248
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,690
This human is all alone.

249
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:13,496
What? Impossible!

250
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:17,012
How could normal human agility
be able to evade my attacks?

251
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,830
How is this happening?

252
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:27,427
I can see it... I can see every move it makes!

253
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,086
It's completely different from when I fought Mr. A!

254
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:31,544
There it is.

255
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:34,323
The tentacles move while morphing at the same time!

256
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:38,302
Unbelievable.

257
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:42,687
Uda!

258
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:49,283
He was the only one... The one person in the
world who could understand what I've gone through!

259
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:59,042
I don't understand.

260
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,188
How is he able to move like this?

261
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:08,142
The neck...

262
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,252
Aim for the neck up!

263
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,849
I cannot let it live.

264
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,075
I will kill it!

265
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:17,225
I will kill this goddamn monster!

266
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:24,128
What is this? He can't be human.

267
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:30,195
Don't worry, Mom...

268
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,556
I'm gonna hack that demon right out of you!

269
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,624
You fared surprisingly well for a human,

270
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,409
but now it is time...

271
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:04,726
to die.

272
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:20,473
Uda!

273
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,674
That... that thing wasn't...

274
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,874
really your mom, of course.

275
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:27,593
Even so...

276
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,997
I didn't feel like you should be the one to have to do it.

277
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,670
But how? How can you still be alive?

278
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,156
I could see right through your attack pattern.

279
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:42,231
You aimed in the exact same place, every single time.

280
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,216
So, I just moved the heart and all
the other vital stuff out of the way,

281
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:48,678
and then let you think you had taken me out.

282
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,970
Mom...

283
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:06,441
It's over.

284
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:11,393
It's all over, Mom.

285
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:17,269
Thank you, for everything. Take care.

286
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:19,582
Ah! I'll walk with you.

287
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:24,509
So, then... you're all done here?

288
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:28,676
Uh... Yeah, I am.

289
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:35,382
Well, next time you come, we should do some sightseeing.

290
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,654
No, I won't be coming back here again.

291
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:39,720
You won't?!

292
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:42,579
Well, maybe someday...

293
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:44,872
Maybe someday you'll change your mind.

294
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:54,877
Goodbye...

295
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,449
I wish I could say this better.

296
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,045
How can I put this?

297
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,596
I want you to understand this one important thing, Son.

298
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,948
Right up until the very end...

299
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:15,525
No, even now, your mother loves you very, very much.

300
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:18,440
And I love you and your mom, too.

301
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,546
Dad...

302
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,544
I wanna ask you something 'bout what you saw.

303
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:30,699
Um... The night everything happened...

304
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:34,162
did... did Mom... Did... she...

305
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:36,445
Dad, did she suffer at all, do you think?

306
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:38,318
No...

307
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:41,266
No, it all happened way too fast.

308
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:47,007
Oh... okay.

309
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:54,855
Shinichi?

310
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:06,337
It's him! He's here.

311
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:14,465
Shinichi?

312
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,431
He's here! He's back!

313
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,024
Shinichi, hey!

314
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:24,876
Hey.

315
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:50,214
Next time: "Freezing Point"
