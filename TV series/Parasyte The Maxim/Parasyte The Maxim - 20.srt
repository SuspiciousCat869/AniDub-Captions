1
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:29,352
Hmm...

2
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:38,531
Huh?

3
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,186
Ah!

4
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:13,565
One is dead.

5
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:14,647
Uh...

6
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,350
We got one!

7
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:55,042
<i>One down.</i>

8
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,156
Retrieve the body... Use a different route.

9
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:01,028
Yes sir!

10
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:04,910
<i>Those things aren't really alive...</i>

11
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:07,904
<i>They're just machines driven by demons...</i>

12
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,276
<i>And all it takes to stop a
machine is to destroy the engine.</i>

13
00:03:13,837 --> 00:03:15,384
<i>To destroy the heart,</i>

14
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:19,714
<i>destructive spread is more
important than mere penetrating power.</i>

15
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,203
<i>What we need are shotguns loaded with seven-point-six
millimeter, sixteen-pellet number-one Buckshot shells.</i>

16
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:32,327
What was that? Did you hear that?

17
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:33,521
I heard gunshots.

18
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,557
Somebody's shooting.

19
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:35,667
Hey! You know what's goin' on?

20
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:37,493
Everyone, please remain calm...

21
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,340
The gunman's firing warning shots.

22
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:42,952
He's only trying to prove a point!

23
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:46,106
So for now, we're going to wait for a just few minutes.

24
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,852
Then resume evacuations.

25
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:49,896
<i>Goddamn, humans.</i>

26
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,682
<i>You've fared better than anticipated.</i>

27
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,961
Well now... What is going on here?

28
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:01,480
Evacuations may now continue.

29
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:09,009
Nope. All clear...

30
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:16,078
None here, either.

31
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:19,035
What's going on?

32
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:21,003
This can't be right...

33
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:23,773
Are they onto us?

34
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:25,024
Captain.

35
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:25,574
Hm?

36
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:32,567
The late investigator's notes
mentioned something interesting...

37
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:34,559
although rather vaguely...

38
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:37,987
Telepathy?

39
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:40,305
Yeah yeah, I read about that.

40
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,111
We need to take every precaution.

41
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:44,015
I'm about to send Uragami in.

42
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:46,729
Please, don't hesitate to use him.

43
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,545
I don't trust this guy...

44
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:50,832
Hm?

45
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:53,740
Hold on for just a second...

46
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:55,244
Whatcha got?

47
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,281
I have an update on Hirokawa.

48
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,494
So some people still haven't made it down?

49
00:05:01,674 --> 00:05:02,427
That's right.

50
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,581
It looks like a town meeting was scheduled
in the second floor conference room today.

51
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:10,141
And I doubt the people who're up
there were able to hear the announcement.

52
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:11,842
Don't worry we'll take care of it.

53
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:14,043
We'll send some men to check things out.

54
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,309
Yes, well I don't think they're going to react well.

55
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:19,697
A group of men coming in with guns...

56
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:22,019
It's likely to cause more panic.

57
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:22,998
He's right.

58
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:26,313
We'll go up to the second floor
and bring them back down with us.

59
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:28,901
Looks like they're making their move.

60
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,077
Don't let them leave...

61
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:33,267
Try and stall them.

62
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:34,046
Yes sir!

63
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:37,506
Okay I'm back...

64
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:41,939
You can go ahead and bring in your
psycho killer or whatever that nutcase is.

65
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:44,630
C'mon man.

66
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:46,536
Ya gotta take these cuffs off.

67
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:49,666
What'll I do if things get ugly around here?

68
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:52,524
Look, I'm not gonna run.

69
00:05:52,997 --> 00:05:57,124
I couldn't go anywhere if I
wanted to, there's cops everywhere.

70
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:01,562
Fine... But stay by me.

71
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:04,356
Hey Migi...

72
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,441
We should help out, too.

73
00:06:07,623 --> 00:06:09,586
We can at least sense who the enemy is.

74
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:11,886
That's a bad idea.

75
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,387
Sorry sir... Please just cooperate.

76
00:06:15,284 --> 00:06:17,885
You can't threaten innocent civilians, you hear me!

77
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,456
Hm.

78
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:22,439
Um, excuse me sir...

79
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:25,011
I would like to be evacuated now please.

80
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:27,349
Uh? Uhhh...

81
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,699
I see... So this is it.

82
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:46,614
Uh... Hold on!

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,582
They're all on top of each other.

84
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,191
I can't tell who's who!

85
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,011
Don't break formation.

86
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,159
Please walk single file everyone.

87
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:57,941
What's wrong?

88
00:06:58,321 --> 00:06:59,877
Ah! Ahh!

89
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:02,124
Oh God! They're all over the place!

90
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:02,877
Ahh...

91
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:04,291
One, two...

92
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,350
Wait! Stop right there!

93
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,490
Ahh...

94
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,023
Not that guy...

95
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:12,464
That one's human.

96
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:17,956
Oh, yeah nice shootin' boys!

97
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:20,809
How could you?

98
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,794
How could you just shoot him down?

99
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:24,298
Please stand back, sir.

100
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:25,710
Oh...

101
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:27,282
Get back in line, now!

102
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,288
No... please wait... I... um...

103
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:34,129
Now there's one... Kill it now!

104
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:34,882
Huh?

105
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:48,164
Our equipment took some hits.

106
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,364
The detection system is down!

107
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,314
Please, everyone, don't panic.

108
00:08:04,346 --> 00:08:06,501
Calm down! Please, calm down!

109
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:07,721
Waaaahh!

110
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:13,141
Dammit!

111
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,448
No! Don't shoot!

112
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,129
Ugh!

113
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:19,328
Uhh...

114
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:24,227
Wait! Wait... Where are you going?!

115
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:30,184
Hold it. Nobody leaves.

116
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:32,103
Forget it. Let 'em go!

117
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:33,643
Err... Ah!

118
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,600
Everybody down on the ground now!

119
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:55,947
Put your hands behind your heads.

120
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:58,486
You've five seconds... Do it now!

121
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:00,834
Don't stand, no matter what!

122
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:04,398
If you stand up without permission, you will be shot!

123
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:06,844
Urrh...

124
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,326
Who the hell are you?!

125
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,973
You can't just come in here and tell us...

126
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:21,116
Hmph. Guess he was human. Huh...

127
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:22,644
Uhh... Ooh...

128
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:24,969
Ah! Dear God!

129
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:29,207
This building is crawling with parasites...

130
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,256
And we are going to neutralize every last one of them.

131
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:34,313
So listen very closely.

132
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,767
If you consider yourself to be human...

133
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:39,441
then you need to do exactly as we say!

134
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,659
<i>There's gotta be something we can do...</i>

135
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,718
<i>Anything...</i>

136
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,420
Let's expand our hunting range.

137
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,966
Kisa-ragi Squad has this zone...

138
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:04,539
You see anyone suspicious, shoot them.

139
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:05,084
Sir!

140
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,076
Mutsuki and Satsuki Squad survivors...

141
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:10,727
You're reassigned to my Shingetsu Squad...

142
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,877
And we'll clean up the rest of the building.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,637
Yes, sir!

144
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:17,169
Hey. The lunatic's coming with me.

145
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,947
What... me?

146
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,448
Don't go trying anything stupid...

147
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,154
Or I'll make you regret it.

148
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,049
I'm seeing monsters all over the place out here... Haha...

149
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,063
This is all just self-defense...

150
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:35,811
Or uh... or, or is it...

151
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,586
we have to do our public duty...

152
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,440
It's an emergency, right? It's special... circumstances...

153
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:41,286
Huh? Whatcha babblin' about?

154
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:13,430
Hands behind your head!

155
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,020
No! Stop! Now!

156
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,928
So, why aren't you trying to escape?

157
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,995
I think it would be relatively easy
for you to get through the cordon, Mayor.

158
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:06,095
For you, as well.

159
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,543
Not just yet...

160
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:13,535
I want to watch a little longer, to
learn more about the enemy's battle tactics.

161
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:17,944
What are you planning to do now?

162
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:19,738
I guess...

163
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:24,374
I feel that it's useless to run
away at this late stage of the game.

164
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:27,973
Oh? Very well.

165
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:35,109
<i>Now I can do whatever I wish.</i>

166
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,722
Right, understood... So then, where is Hirokawa right now?

167
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:45,303
Uzuki Squad encountered his group
while en route to the city council wing.

168
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,927
But unfortunately, we lost contact
with them in the second-floor hallway.

169
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:49,771
Tch!

170
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:51,994
We're gonna split up here...

171
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,456
Shingetsu Squad, main wing...

172
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:58,155
Mutsuki and Satsuki Squads,
you head over to the council wing.

173
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:58,906
Yes sir!

174
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:02,554
Hey murderer...

175
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,382
Your assignment's changed,

176
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:07,363
you're going to be accompanying
the Mutsuki-Satsuki joint team.

177
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:11,564
The name's Uragami, Captain.

178
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:14,935
And you're a murderer too, are you not?

179
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:18,602
But sir... you won't be able to identify the enemy.

180
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:22,764
Don't worry about me...

181
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:24,530
it's getting easier now...

182
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:27,378
I'm starting to get the hang of spotting those things.

183
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,466
Uh?

184
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:44,682
Uzuki Squad has been located.

185
00:13:44,794 --> 00:13:48,164
It looks like they've engaged Hirokawa's
group and were completely wiped out.

186
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,732
Heh... Just dreadful...

187
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,394
Ah... Hey... I...

188
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,291
It's not what it looks like...

189
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:09,746
Hmm... Sorry guys...

190
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:12,691
Those're humans... Fornicatin' humans.

191
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:14,594
Jesus Christ. Seriously?

192
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:16,052
At a time like this? Get outta there!

193
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:17,724
Guess they couldn't wait, huh?

194
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:22,403
But'cha know... if I hadn't been here,
they'd both be dead now wouldn't they.

195
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:32,498
Hm.

196
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,484
Oh... thank goodness...

197
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:36,818
You've got to help me!

198
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,029
Fire.

199
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,650
Huh? Yes, but, sir.

200
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:47,724
Uh-uh... Ooh...

201
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,964
How could you tell?

202
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:05,534
He wasn't down on the first floor hall.

203
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:06,454
Huh?

204
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:09,101
Listen to me...

205
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:11,797
just shoot everyone.

206
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,682
The humans had the upper hand right from the start...

207
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:21,892
But the assault force's objective
was never to protect civilian lives...

208
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,562
It was strictly to eliminate the enemy.

209
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:27,377
And by making that their priority...

210
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:30,192
they successfully prevented a panic.

211
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:35,366
And while it's true that some human
lives were unfortunately sacrificed...

212
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:38,347
the parasites were effectively wiped out.

213
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,779
We are actually quite frail.

214
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:54,218
We're nothing more than a life form
that isn't able to survive on its own.

215
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:57,981
So, please... Don't be too hard on us.

216
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:11,137
Seriously, man. I'm practically right up in front here.

217
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,563
What's the point of having you at the rear?

218
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,218
Stop right there!

219
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:19,514
Ah! Please don't shoot me!

220
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:21,352
I'm not one of them! I swear!

221
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:22,667
Shoot him.

222
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:23,169
Huh?

223
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:25,397
AAHH! No!

224
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:28,047
What is you damn problem?! Shoot him now!

225
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:29,052
Aahh!

226
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,306
Tch! The hell were you aiming?

227
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:40,468
Go! After him!

228
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:44,127
Urgh! Aah!

229
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:06,280
So, they're using large shotgun
rounds to destroy the body.

230
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,816
It appears to be a rather effective technique.

231
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:11,599
Hmm...

232
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:13,492
What about him?

233
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:15,181
He sure seems like one.

234
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:21,119
Yeah, yeah... Fine, go ahead and shoot 'im. Why not?

235
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:25,056
Just shoot everybody alright. I don't care anymore.

236
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:26,827
H-huh?

237
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,009
WAAAAAHHH!

238
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:32,855
Hey! What the hell?! Where do you think you're going?!

239
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,978
AAAHHH!

240
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:37,183
This way...

241
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:39,633
There's much more room over here.

242
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:49,333
Dammit, Uragami!

243
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:50,799
Ah!

244
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:55,935
You son of a bitch! This was
your plan all along wasn't it?!

245
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,453
You... You did see that guy back
there, didn't you, are you blind?!

246
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:03,394
You had to see it, right?! Are you
telling me that freak looked human to you?

247
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,768
What did you say?

248
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:17,778
What's this? There aren't more of you?

249
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:21,071
I'll let you have two minutes.

250
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:21,912
Fire!

251
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:34,419
Why doesn't he drop?

252
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:37,254
He-he's not even bleeding!

253
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:40,107
Uh...

254
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,197
Do you... do you hear that?

255
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:45,479
What is that?

256
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:52,135
It's coming from inside him!

257
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,998
Ah...

258
00:18:56,321 --> 00:19:00,921
Well, how kind of you to give me
so much to work with, gentlemen.

259
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,526
Ungh!

260
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:10,058
What in God's name... How in the hell?

261
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:11,550
Go for his arm!

262
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:21,137
Ahh!

263
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:21,877
Ugh!

264
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:34,346
Really now...

265
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:37,468
Some of them are actually still alive.

266
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:39,167
I see...

267
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:42,373
They appear to be equipped with body armor.

268
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:45,546
Uh?

269
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:52,681
A valiant effort...

270
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:55,178
Uh...

271
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,133
But I'm sure you're aware... It was all for naught.

272
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:02,567
You'll be dead in thirty seconds.

273
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:06,853
Hm? What was that?

274
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,985
It looks as though the Mutsuki-Satsuki team is gone.

275
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:11,352
They're all gone.

276
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:12,632
Roger...

277
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,346
Send Yayoi to the council wing.

278
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:18,891
Hehehe...

279
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,513
Enough! Let's get you back, Uragami.

280
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,286
Are you outta your damn mind?

281
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:24,059
Ah...

282
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,312
I said that's enough.

283
00:21:21,643 --> 00:21:23,186
Ah... Hello.

284
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:49,066
Next time: "Sex and Spirit"
