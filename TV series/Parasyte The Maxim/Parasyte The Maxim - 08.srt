1
00:00:02,273 --> 00:00:06,010
As I recall, your host body is
in its late teens, is that right?

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,970
Yes, that's correct.

3
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:10,887
Perfect. I can use you then...

4
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:15,878
Your assignment is to watch the boy and
observe his movements, but do not kill him.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,133
Is there any point to this?

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:21,592
Yes... While he does pose something of a threat to us...

7
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:27,087
he is an exceedingly valuable resource in
gauging the future potential of our kind...

8
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:27,823
Heh!

9
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,412
Shinichi... Izumi...

10
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:39,473
Got it.

11
00:02:16,463 --> 00:02:17,003
Yo.

12
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:19,317
Hm? Mitsuo!

13
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:21,381
Hey, Kana... Ah...

14
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:25,226
You gonna see your boyfriend again?

15
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:26,035
Who?

16
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:28,783
That piece of shit who thinks he's some kinda hero.

17
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,312
Uuh... Just move, I'm going home.

18
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:33,217
Wh-what's with you, Kana?

19
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,046
That hurts, let me go.

20
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:36,490
Wait, hold on a minute...

21
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:39,067
Don't tell me you're actually into that douchebag.

22
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,222
That is really none of your damn business.

23
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:44,746
Hmph...

24
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,304
Check it out. Look.

25
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:56,282
<i>Mitsuo?</i>

26
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:57,882
Hey, loser.

27
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:01,850
So, didja come by here to kidnap another girl?

28
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:03,899
Where's your buddy? Who?

29
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,559
That poser-ass "Shinichi" or whatever.

30
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:08,666
You looking to start some trouble punk?

31
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:11,505
Huh? Perfect timing.

32
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:14,795
Hey, Shinichi! Mitsuo wants to talk to you.

33
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:16,066
Huh?

34
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:17,858
Tsk...

35
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:20,638
Oh right. You again, huh?

36
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:23,230
You n' me. Need t'talk.

37
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,348
This place again?

38
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:30,903
Can we please keep this short?

39
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,510
There's someone I have to meet.

40
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:35,868
So, did you and Kana hook up or what?

41
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:38,563
Huh? Oh, right. Kana's that girl from the other day...

42
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:40,780
Don't you play dumb with me, you asshole!

43
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,142
Listen, you've got it wrong.

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,615
I haven't seen that girl in a long
time, and I was out of town before that.

45
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:47,154
Out of town?!

46
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:49,193
Anyway, you got your answer.

47
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,098
Uh... Screw you!

48
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:51,618
Huh?

49
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:55,737
Mmph.

50
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,413
Uh...

51
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:02,092
Don't... It won't go like before.

52
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,089
Eat shit!

53
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:07,907
Come here!

54
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:09,691
Uhh...!

55
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,441
Err-ya!

56
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:17,696
Uhh...

57
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:19,747
Hey! Ohh...

58
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:22,324
Hey, man... You okay?

59
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,688
Shinichi!

60
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:30,526
Oh, hey! I was just at the school
and Kamijo told me that you... Mm...

61
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:32,356
It's fine...

62
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,543
Nothing to worry about.

63
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:35,346
Err...

64
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,533
Here. You can have your shoe back.

65
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:55,971
Hey, wanna go in? I'm pretty hungry.

66
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:00,951
Uh... Shinichi... did something
happen to you on your trip?

67
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:02,038
Huh?

68
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:05,271
It's just that, you seem a little different now.

69
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,974
I was just using my dad's injury as
an excuse to ditch school for a while.

70
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,575
Uhh...

71
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,209
Hey, uh... You are...

72
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:20,144
Shinichi Izumi...

73
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:21,511
aren't you?

74
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:24,734
Well, who's to say?

75
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:26,501
Ah...

76
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:33,361
Come on... Who else would I be?

77
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,606
And you're... Satomi Murano... aren't you?

78
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:47,821
Mm-hm!

79
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:55,723
<i>Ah! I can sense him. He's getting closer!</i>

80
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:57,886
<i>I'm not sure how I know it,</i>

81
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:01,135
<i>but he'll come right up those stairs any second.</i>

82
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:06,415
There! There he is!

83
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,255
Oh...

84
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:17,938
I'm home.

85
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:21,615
Dad...

86
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:25,478
Ah... Shinichi...

87
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,226
You hungry?

88
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,401
I ate... Did you eat?

89
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:31,898
No need.

90
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,462
Go easy on the drinking there...

91
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,770
You should probably get some food in your stomach.

92
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:37,711
Yeah...

93
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,503
So I was looking online...

94
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:44,191
They recommend hiring a housekeeper for a time like this.

95
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,304
"Time like this"?

96
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:47,884
Well, I mean...

97
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:53,580
Cause Mom... or whoever usually cooks the
meals and stuff isn't around to do it anymore.

98
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:56,182
Look boy...

99
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:57,858
How can you even...

100
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,641
Never mind... Hire a housekeeper...

101
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:04,001
I don't really think I care anymore.

102
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:14,995
I think I have some sorta problem.

103
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:15,956
What's that?

104
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:18,100
I don't know what's wrong...

105
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:20,733
I can't cry...

106
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:23,037
Okay... Is that all?

107
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:25,480
I feel like I've lost something...

108
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:30,030
Like I'm missing an important part... of being human.

109
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,557
Pure foolishness.

110
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,338
<i>Ever since Migi's cells were dispersed
throughout my body, my senses have become heightened.</i>

111
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:53,814
<i>My hearing. It's stronger.</i>

112
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,193
<i>If I really focus...</i>

113
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,564
Oh, my! You mean Mrs. Hashimoto's son?

114
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:02,521
That's right. Can you believe it?!

115
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,225
And now an update on traffic.

116
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:05,704
A collision on Metro Expressway Number Four has...

117
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:11,450
Filthy pigs! Filthy pigs! Pigs, pigs, pigs, pigs!

118
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,326
Something wrong?

119
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:16,791
Uh, oh, no, it's nothing...

120
00:08:17,118 --> 00:08:17,718
Uh!

121
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:19,444
<i>Wait. What was that?</i>

122
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:20,608
Shinichi?

123
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:23,176
I'm sorry, you go on ahead.

124
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:26,138
Uh... Mm...

125
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,963
<i>It's calling out... It's asking for help.</i>

126
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:36,230
Huh?

127
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:43,053
Can we save it?

128
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:46,584
The internal organs have been
crushed, causing irreparable damage.

129
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:48,595
Death will occur within ten minutes.

130
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:49,290
Ohh...

131
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,080
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

132
00:08:55,357 --> 00:08:57,066
<i>There's nothing we can do to help you.</i>

133
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:02,807
<i>Still, this is better than dying
in a dirty, noisy street, right?</i>

134
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,693
Shinichi?

135
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:08,963
Unfortunately, this guy's not gonna make it.

136
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:16,472
Shinichi... I've been pretty worried about you.

137
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:17,346
Why?

138
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:20,377
'Cause there's something about
you that's really different somehow.

139
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,581
You... you used to be more nervous before, you know?

140
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,292
It was kind of cute in a weird way,

141
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:29,111
or maybe comforting, I guess.

142
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,169
Mm...

143
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:33,483
But then, ever since you came back from your trip...

144
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:36,371
It's like... you've just been cold and distant.

145
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:39,448
Maybe I've just been imagining things...

146
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,556
You seem like yourself now.

147
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:42,659
It's dead.

148
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:43,891
Huh?

149
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,979
Its heart stopped.

150
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:50,702
Let's go... We're already running late.

151
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:59,446
Huh! Shinichi?!

152
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:00,266
Hm?

153
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:02,776
I don't believe you, how could you do that?!

154
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:04,618
You just threw it in the trash can!

155
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:07,075
Oh, do you think the janitor will get mad?

156
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:09,271
I'm not talking about the stupid janitor!

157
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:11,895
The puppy... It's cruel to that puppy!

158
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,746
I'm not sure how that can be cruel. The dog's dead.

159
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,841
I know, but Shinichi...

160
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:20,633
It's already gone... It's not a dog anymore...

161
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:23,135
It's just a hunk of dog-shaped meat.

162
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:24,980
Huh?! No!

163
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:26,246
What's wrong?

164
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:28,043
I knew you were different!

165
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,091
Before, you never would've done...

166
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,252
Never...

167
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:33,507
Murano...

168
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,274
<i>Have I... Have I really changed that much?</i>

169
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:50,149
Migi... Migi!

170
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:51,948
What is it?

171
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:54,648
Just then... You heard...

172
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,531
I said something strange to her...

173
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:58,833
What was it I did wrong?

174
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:01,321
I don't think you did anything wrong at all...

175
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,036
From my perspective.

176
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,588
But you are very different now from how you were before.

177
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:07,545
Huh?

178
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:10,819
The statement you just made about the "dog-shaped meat"...

179
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:14,027
Was the sort of thing that I would be more likely to say.

180
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:14,708
Oh...

181
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:16,876
Hm...

182
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:20,051
I guess so...

183
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,257
Thank you, Migi.

184
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:33,452
<i>The dog's carcass will break down and
become nutrients absorbed by this tree.</i>

185
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:39,148
<i>If I had just done this in the first place,</i>

186
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,747
<i>Murano wouldn't hate me so much right now.</i>

187
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:53,941
Uh...

188
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:56,240
Oh, Murano.

189
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:00,692
Ah...

190
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:04,442
<i>Hm... I guess today's too soon.</i>

191
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:06,561
<i>I'll give her some space and try again.</i>

192
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,908
Shinichi.

193
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:08,461
Hm?

194
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:10,214
One of my kind is here.

195
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:10,661
Huh?!

196
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:15,294
Don't tell me Ryoko Tamiya is back!

197
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,540
No. This seems to be someone different.

198
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,907
It can't be Uda and his Parasite, can it?

199
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:24,297
So... does that mean this one's here to kill me?

200
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:26,273
I sense no murderous intent.

201
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:27,242
What do I do?

202
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,156
For now, I think we should meet them in a public place.

203
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:31,783
What? Meet them?!

204
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,800
It's possible this is not an enemy.

205
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:34,367
Uh...

206
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:39,558
Despite being able to sense our presence,
its rate of approach is calm and measured.

207
00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:43,424
I believe this may be another one similar to Ryoko Tamiya.

208
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:46,934
In other words, it's the type
that can possibly be reasoned with.

209
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,055
What's that even supposed to mean?!

210
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:50,301
He's here.

211
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,903
So... You're Shinichi, right?

212
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,582
Yeah who're you?

213
00:12:57,146 --> 00:12:59,486
You're different from how I'd imagined you would be...

214
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:00,943
You seem quite strong.

215
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:03,824
Why're you at my school? What do you want?

216
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,635
Yo, Shinichi. This guy bothering you?

217
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:10,071
Haven't seen you around buddy? Do you just transfer?

218
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:13,294
Don't interfere.

219
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:15,520
Hideo Shimada...

220
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:18,170
That is the name you may use to address me.

221
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,797
Shinichi, I thought that you...

222
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,867
Rather, that the two of you and I could be friends.

223
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:25,684
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

224
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,279
Ah... I must go...

225
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,643
Shinichi, would you please show me the way to Class Three?

226
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,938
<i>Class Three? That's Murano's class!</i>

227
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,308
I'm looking forward to Physical Education...

228
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:39,802
I believe it's a joint session
between our classes today, isn't it?

229
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:40,585
Hm...

230
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,659
<i>If I go all-out, I'd set a world record.</i>

231
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:49,373
Mmph!

232
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,478
Ah! Ten point eight seconds?!

233
00:13:57,054 --> 00:14:00,006
It's kinda weird for a transfer
this time of year, isn't it?

234
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:03,142
I guess so, he said it was because of his dad's job.

235
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:07,293
Aww...! This is total bullcrap,
I wish I was in Hide's class.

236
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:07,971
"Hide"?

237
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:10,181
Hideo Shimada... "Hide"!

238
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:12,356
Seriously, Akiho? What about Shinichi?

239
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:13,551
I thought you liked him?

240
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,230
Yeah. I mean, don't you?

241
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,961
Uh-What...?! Come on, gross he's like a brother to me.

242
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:20,969
Anyway, it doesn't matter because he's with Murano now.

243
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:22,442
Isn't he?

244
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:24,544
Uh! Well... I...

245
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:25,572
Hehehe...

246
00:14:31,546 --> 00:14:36,497
Sports are good training. The more you practice,
the better you become at controlling your body.

247
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:40,661
Why drag this out? You're planning
to attack me once I let my guard down.

248
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:43,058
Your assumption is incorrect...

249
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:46,060
I wonder, if that's what your right hand believes as well.

250
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,990
Just answer me one question...

251
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:51,500
Did Ryoko Tamiya send you to get rid of me?

252
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,324
Ryoko Tamiya?

253
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,319
Ah... she's going by a different name now.

254
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,732
It's true. She is the one who told me about you...

255
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,081
but she didn't send me here to kill you.

256
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:06,255
In fact, you'll be pleased to know
that I don't intend to lay a hand on you,

257
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,724
or anyone in your circle while I'm here at this school.

258
00:15:09,097 --> 00:15:10,134
And furthermore...

259
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,905
I haven't harmed any humans for
quite some time, nor do I need to.

260
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:14,524
Huh?

261
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:18,506
I've been sustaining myself on the
same sort of food that humans eat.

262
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:22,882
If parasites could exist without killing
your kind, there'd be no problem, would there?

263
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,750
Like I'd trust you.

264
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:26,159
The fact is...

265
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:31,886
we've started to explore ways in which we can
coexist alongside humans, within your society.

266
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,594
Given that you two are a bridge between our two races,

267
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:38,773
we were hoping that you would
give the idea some consideration.

268
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:39,806
Fascinating.

269
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:44,240
Everything you've talked about here
today has served to pique my interest.

270
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:45,086
It has?

271
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:45,670
But...

272
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,872
A great deal of it is difficult to believe.

273
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:50,620
Oh... really?

274
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,648
Whatever the case, I do not wish for conflict either...

275
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:55,739
So I'd say that's enough for today...

276
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:57,011
Let's go, Shinichi.

277
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,509
Huh? Why now?

278
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,929
What's the deal?

279
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:10,094
We weren't even done talking to the guy yet.

280
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,282
Shinichi, I'm going to sleep.

281
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:13,628
Huh? You're crashing again?

282
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:15,275
For four hours...

283
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:19,478
There's no telling what will happen if
Hideo Shimada learns of this weakness.

284
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:19,916
Ah...

285
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,739
Oh...

286
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:28,153
<i>Shinichi...</i>

287
00:16:29,132 --> 00:16:30,798
<i>I can't believe he did that.</i>

288
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:35,486
<i>But then again, most people would've
just ignored the puppy in the first place.</i>

289
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:40,029
<i>Maybe... I shouldn't have said
that he's gotten cold and distant...</i>

290
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:40,880
<i>Hm...</i>

291
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:43,861
<i>What should I do?</i>

292
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,491
<i>If he really is thinking about coexisting with humans,</i>

293
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:50,679
<i>then maybe there's a way we can come
up with something to make it work...</i>

294
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:55,062
<i>No! I cannot trust those things. They're merciless!</i>

295
00:16:55,682 --> 00:17:00,092
<i>No matter how intelligent they are, they're
nothing more than compassionless insects!</i>

296
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,330
<i>There's no way I'll ever forget what they've done!</i>

297
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:06,562
<i>One day, I WILL expose them!</i>

298
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:11,497
Uh... about the other day...

299
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:14,239
No, it's fine. Everything's fine.

300
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:15,790
Uh-um...

301
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:18,688
Well that was great...

302
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,121
I sure have a knack for screwing things up.

303
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:26,344
<i>I have... a special power...</i>

304
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:30,212
<i>it gives me the ability to sense the presence...</i>

305
00:17:30,475 --> 00:17:31,641
<i>of my soul mate.</i>

306
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:35,290
<i>There he is.</i>

307
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:37,650
Hello there!

308
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:39,611
Huh? Can I help you?

309
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:41,071
Oh. Wrong person.

310
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:44,557
I'm so sorry... I thought you were Shinichi.

311
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,254
Really? What would make you think that I was Shinichi?

312
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:49,134
Huh?

313
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:51,684
When someone mistakes two people...

314
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,867
it's normally because they look
similar in one way or another.

315
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:58,481
So... How do Shinichi and I seem similar to you?

316
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:00,428
I told you I was sorry.

317
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:04,855
Hey! What are you doing?!

318
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:05,930
<i>I know that voice...</i>

319
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,625
I just want to talk to you for a little bit.

320
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,412
Hey! What're you doing to her?!

321
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:15,103
Ah! Let go! Shinichi!

322
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:18,053
I only wanted to discuss some things with her...

323
00:18:18,193 --> 00:18:21,563
It would appear that this
particular female is rather perceptive.

324
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,463
Listen...

325
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:25,395
If anything happens to anyone close to me...

326
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:27,817
I will be coming after you.

327
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,876
I swear to God I will take you out.

328
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:34,621
Hehe. Shinichi.

329
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:39,322
It's like I keep saying: I don't want to fight you.

330
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:40,415
What's with him...?

331
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:42,594
There's something cold in his eyes...

332
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:47,871
<i>Interesting, his parasite's
signal seemed very weak just then.</i>

333
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,594
Oh, wow!

334
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,228
You're pretty strong, huh?

335
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,187
Uhh...

336
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:55,208
Uh... Oh, Shinichi!

337
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:56,595
Walk me to the station!

338
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,721
I'm scared that creepy guy might be there!

339
00:18:58,895 --> 00:19:00,490
Yeah. No problem.

340
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:01,294
Ah!

341
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:05,460
Mm...

342
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,264
<i>Not again! What the hell?!</i>

343
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,109
What's wrong?

344
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:11,949
Telepathy?

345
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:13,763
Yeah. That's right.

346
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,778
I can tell whenever you're anywhere nearby.

347
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:18,808
But for some reason, I managed
to get it wrong just then...

348
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:22,278
But you did finally show up, so
it's not like I was totally off.

349
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:24,040
Yeah, but...

350
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,770
I'm not so sure that's such a good thing.

351
00:19:26,985 --> 00:19:27,430
Huh?

352
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:31,643
I mean... whatever it is you think you're sensing...

353
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:36,197
it could be some kind of "wavelengths"
being broadcast by dangerous jerks like him.

354
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:38,480
So does that mean you're a dangerous jerk, too?

355
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:39,100
Uh?!

356
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:41,617
Uh, well yeah... yeah I am...

357
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:46,148
So you should probably just stay
away from guys like us, you got that?

358
00:19:46,504 --> 00:19:47,097
Hmm...

359
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:57,435
<i>Well, I think I'll use this face as bait today.</i>

360
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:05,688
<i>Hmm... That sow has had a healthy
upbringing, and its skin has a nice sheen.</i>

361
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:08,483
Hello there, are you lost?

362
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:10,779
Well, I was just...

363
00:20:10,804 --> 00:20:13,901
I'd be more than happy to show
you around, if you'd like me to.

364
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:17,027
Dad.

365
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,931
Yeah, I know...

366
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:21,987
Bed time.

367
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:26,228
'Night.

368
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:28,439
Shinichi...

369
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,473
Tell me, Son...

370
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:34,120
When did you suddenly get to be so strong?

371
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:34,652
Hm?

372
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:38,745
It's like you're made of steel.

373
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:43,624
Like a metal shell with nothing left on the inside.

374
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:44,639
Uhh...

375
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,151
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,289
There we go.

377
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:06,614
Came out even better than I thought it would.

378
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:09,500
Heh... Hmm...

379
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,393
Next time: "Beyond Good and Evil"
