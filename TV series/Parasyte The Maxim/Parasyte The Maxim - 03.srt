1
00:00:04,683 --> 00:00:07,170
You. You in the gray coat.

2
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:10,321
What do you think you're doing?

3
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:18,552
I think you need to keep your
hands to yourself. That is disgusting.

4
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:20,412
Ew, that guy's a pervert!

5
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:23,145
N-no, no! That's not true!

6
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,703
What the hell is your problem! What're you
trying to do? I didn't touch anybody! You're crazy!

7
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:30,420
Why would you say that?

8
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:20,927
This year's Kayama Fantasy
Literature Award, the winner is, uh...

9
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:23,888
It's Dai Yoshimi. "Seventh Transformation," right?

10
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:25,168
Uh-huh. You read it?

11
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:29,221
It's about a guy that somehow gains
the ability to communicate with reptiles.

12
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:31,391
It's completely ridiculous.

13
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,902
Hmm... Huh?

14
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:36,742
Not this again...

15
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:38,652
That brings the total to 84.

16
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:40,490
More Mincemeat Murders?

17
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:43,800
I hate to say it, but it doesn't even surprise me anymore.

18
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:45,853
Dinner was great. Thanks.

19
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,870
But, honey, you didn't even eat half of it!

20
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:50,200
Yeah, sorry.

21
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:53,503
I may be the only person in the entire world

22
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:57,579
who actually knows the truth
behind all these horrible killings.

23
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,566
I just don't know what to do about it.

24
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:00,622
Shinichi!

25
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:03,349
Morning.

26
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:04,649
Morning.

27
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:09,688
You know, Shinichi, you've changed recently.

28
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:10,840
Huh? I have?

29
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:12,036
Yeah.

30
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:14,312
Really? What're you talking about?

31
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:15,697
Shinichi...

32
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:18,384
Huh? I swear I just heard a voice.

33
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,745
Look down here.

34
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:24,148
Migi? That feels really weird, ya know.

35
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:25,459
What's wrong Shinichi?

36
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,705
Uh, nothing. I'm fine.

37
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:29,397
One of my kind is near.

38
00:03:29,503 --> 00:03:30,818
Huh? Again?

39
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:34,330
It's approaching rapidly.

40
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,832
But there haven't been any Mincemeat Murders around here.

41
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:41,737
Perhaps the bodies simply haven't been found yet.

42
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:44,834
It's currently about 70 meters away from us.

43
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:47,765
Sixty meters...

44
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:54,731
Not here...

45
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,717
It's inside the building.

46
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,556
Inside the school...

47
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:11,082
Where is it?

48
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:12,618
WHO is it?

49
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:14,424
Is it a guy?

50
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,772
Or a girl?!

51
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,643
It's in here.

52
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:20,452
Approximately 30 meters away.

53
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:21,651
Thirty?

54
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,039
Don't make eye contact. It will find us.

55
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,609
It's looking for us as well, but it seems
unable to pinpoint our location in the crowd.

56
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:36,434
Welcome, good morning, students.

57
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:40,837
I'd like to introduce our new math
teacher, substituting for Mr. Matsuyama.

58
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,345
HE had to be hospitalized after the
unfortunate traffic accident two days ago.

59
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,262
Now then, I present to you Ms. Tamiya.

60
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,190
I'm Ryoko Tamiya. It's a pleasure to meet you.

61
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,309
It's her.

62
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:00,006
What?!

63
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:05,087
And, as of today, Mr. Yamamoto will be
the new homeroom teacher for Class 3-3.

64
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:07,921
Oh, my God, Murano's class!

65
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,568
Therefore, Ms. Tamiya will act
as assistant homeroom teacher.

66
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:13,261
No eye contact, Shinichi!

67
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:22,787
She just looked at me! Do you see that?!

68
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:26,495
Just look at her... the guys are gonna freak out. Mm-hm!

69
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,894
She found us...

70
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,797
All right, listen up!

71
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:36,306
Once you do your five laps around the
field, be sure to stretch again to loosen up.

72
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:39,213
Then split into two groups and set up a match.

73
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:40,831
You've read up on all the rules.

74
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:42,125
This surprises me.

75
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:47,624
After taking over the host, She has managed to
successfully maintain their position in society.

76
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,990
Plus, she functions as a teacher of humans.

77
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:53,268
She appears to be quite gifted.

78
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:55,297
What are you praising her for?

79
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,409
We have to do something.

80
00:05:57,603 --> 00:05:58,636
What do you mean?

81
00:05:58,768 --> 00:05:59,816
Well, what if we don't?

82
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,539
She's gonna eat everybody!

83
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:03,103
No, I highly doubt that.

84
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,270
She wishes to blend in with human society.

85
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:11,282
I do not believe that she would use anyone
in her immediate social circle as a food supply.

86
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:14,087
Therefore, I believe they should be safe.

87
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,852
You don't know that.

88
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:18,426
We should just observe her for now.

89
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:31,519
With everything that's going on right now,

90
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,255
how can Migi go to sleep?

91
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:35,941
I mean, what if she suddenly tries to...

92
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:42,801
All right, class. I want you to use this
formula to solve problems six through twelve.

93
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:51,655
Mr. Izumi...

94
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,540
Oh, my God!

95
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:53,973
Is there a problem?

96
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:56,794
You don't appear to have made any progress.

97
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,238
Huh?! Uh... No, ma'am.

98
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:00,424
Sorry.

99
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:09,640
Mr. Izumi, would you please visit
me in the counselor's office later?

100
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,466
Thank you.

101
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,321
Whoa... what'd you do?

102
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:20,054
Uh...

103
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,819
Dude, how did you do that?

104
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:25,128
Jesus, what do I have to do to get
myself called to the teacher's office?!

105
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,842
Hellooo? What's wrong with what's sitting right here...

106
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:29,040
Shinichi knows!

107
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:33,434
Whatever. You can't teach me all the
things sweet, mature hottie Ms. Tamiya can.

108
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,794
But I don't understand it...

109
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:37,177
What's she wanna with squirrely ass Shinichi?

110
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,744
Doesn't really make sense.

111
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:40,317
What's that sposta mean?!

112
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:42,124
Why you gotta be such a jerk, huh?

113
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,667
Oh, whatever, Shinichi... You
don't know what you're missing.

114
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:54,742
Shinichi...

115
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,880
She's approximately ten meters away right now.

116
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:00,180
Oh, so you're awake?

117
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:04,679
Excuse me.

118
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:06,491
Please, come on in.

119
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,423
Well then, Mr. Izumi...

120
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,288
You are aware of what I am, yes?

121
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,173
Yeah.

122
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:22,078
"Yeah"? That's no way to speak to your teacher now, is it?

123
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:26,925
Oh, there's no need for you to be so anxious.

124
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:30,465
You should know that I have absolutely
no intentions of killing you right now.

125
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,213
Your right hand should know that.

126
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:37,402
Besides, if we fought in such close quarters,
we'd both end up being mortally wounded.

127
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:40,573
I'd like the opportunity to speak with you a bit more.

128
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,045
You think you have time to
meet with me after school today?

129
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:45,633
Okay.

130
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:46,233
Huh?!

131
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,399
But what if it's some kind of trap?!

132
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:50,858
I am totally against this!

133
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:52,667
How predictable.

134
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,284
Why must humans always be so irrational?

135
00:08:55,998 --> 00:08:56,652
What's that?!

136
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:04,050
If I wanted to kill you, I already would have.

137
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:07,496
I am... curious however.

138
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:10,826
Because I've never seen a case anything like yours before.

139
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,663
I wish to collect more data.

140
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,509
I'd like to exchange information with you...

141
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:18,085
and discuss our future.

142
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,405
"Future"?

143
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:22,744
Well, that's all for now.

144
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,822
Hey, Ms. Tamiya!

145
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,273
Yes?

146
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,310
Uh... do you have any plans this afternoon?

147
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,504
I do. I have some student counseling sessions.

148
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:38,455
Oh, okay.

149
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:40,141
If you'll excuse me.

150
00:09:46,244 --> 00:09:48,749
Hey I'm going to the bookstore, do you wanna come with me?

151
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,548
Uh-huh.

152
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:51,520
Huh? Is that...

153
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:13,665
Shinichi, you should roll up your sleeves.

154
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:16,348
Why should I do that? We're
not getting into a fight, are we?

155
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:18,058
Perhaps, something's coming.

156
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:18,559
Huh?!

157
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,934
Actually, two of my kind are coming.

158
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:23,533
So it really was a trap?

159
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,708
There's no way to know that for sure yet.

160
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:33,830
Shinichi, it would be really helpful right now if
you could slow down your heart rate a little bit.

161
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,559
It's making me feel anxious.

162
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:37,094
I can't do that!

163
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:42,850
Sorry for the wait.

164
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:45,631
I'll keep this short...

165
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,883
Meet Mr. A.

166
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:48,725
Just "A"?

167
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:50,454
Yes, he has no name.

168
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:52,929
What is this creature?

169
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:55,839
Can we even call him one of our kind?

170
00:10:58,314 --> 00:11:02,590
That's enough. There's no merit in killing
one another in a place as public as this.

171
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,166
Interesting... So at this point, you've
only encountered those two types so far.

172
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:11,872
Yeah.

173
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:17,379
Now, I'd like to know... In your opinion,
what exactly do you think we are, Mr. Izumi?

174
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:20,094
Well from everything I've seen...

175
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,966
You're monsters here to feed on the human race.

176
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,417
But you see...

177
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:28,840
Mr. A and I have experimented,
and had sex with each other.

178
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:31,914
Oh, I'm so sorry!

179
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:34,246
Please excuse me.

180
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:35,762
Oh, my God...

181
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,975
And the result might surprise you.

182
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,798
I am now pregnant Mr. Izumi.

183
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:44,015
So then, here's a question...

184
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:47,228
This "thing" that I currently
have growing inside my body...

185
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,497
What do you think it might be?

186
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,891
Oh... well, uh...

187
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:54,639
A human, a normal one.

188
00:11:55,225 --> 00:11:57,200
Good answer. Yes...

189
00:11:57,225 --> 00:12:01,153
The child I am carrying is human, an ordinary human baby.

190
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,178
In which case, what do you think that makes us?

191
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:06,373
I've no idea.

192
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,854
Nor do I really want to find out.

193
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,298
What I DO know is that you eat humans
in order to keep your human host alive.

194
00:12:13,385 --> 00:12:15,091
And that's what we call cannibalism.

195
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,835
Why would you do something like that?

196
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:20,749
Have you ever... tried asking
your little friend that question?

197
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:25,101
I receive nutrients directly through
Shinichi's blood, so I do not experience hunger.

198
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:30,204
Therefore, I am also at a loss to understand
our own kind's alleged necessity for cannibalism.

199
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,128
Our species cannot reproduce,

200
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:35,032
and we engage in a sort of pseudo-cannibalism.

201
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,387
I'm not really sure what to call us.

202
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,066
I've given it some thought,

203
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:41,086
and I consider it strange as well.

204
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:44,711
Are you actually even life forms? Or what?

205
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,126
Either way, I don't think you're from this planet.

206
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,225
I am leaving now.

207
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,420
Whether or not I find out exactly what I
am, isn't going to change anything for me.

208
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,334
I eat when I feel hungry,

209
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,736
and I get rid of anyone in my way.

210
00:12:57,936 --> 00:12:59,093
And that is it.

211
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:07,858
That one is dangerous. He must be eliminated.

212
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:10,768
We didn't merge with our host the same way.

213
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:12,058
Now...

214
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:18,372
Humans do sometimes act illogically,
so I will give you a warning.

215
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:20,654
If you think of me as an enemy,

216
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:24,595
and decide to make some kind of a
scene, the disadvantage is yours.

217
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:26,967
You can't change your face.

218
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:35,498
I've decided it's in my interest
to protect my current human identity,

219
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,440
so I will not behave irrationally.

220
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:40,713
But if I were provoked, an entire classroom...

221
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:48,310
Would all be dead in mere seconds.

222
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:51,353
I believe you have friends in that class, do you not?

223
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,776
Shinichi! Is that you?

224
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:12,459
She's something else. She was capable of
making you suffer an intense amount of fear.

225
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:16,020
Shinichi... That's cold.

226
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:25,703
Huh?

227
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,771
So, uh, yesterday...

228
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:30,277
you took the bus somewhere.

229
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:33,767
Where did you go? Murano was worried about you.

230
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,674
Oh... Nowhere.

231
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:39,952
Shinichi, we are under attack.

232
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:41,980
I sense nothing but pure killing intent.

233
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,091
Ms. Tamiya? Are you okay?

234
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:45,673
Idiot.

235
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,004
Somebody help!

236
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:57,376
Oh, my goodness! Are you all right?

237
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:00,345
There's an intruder. He went that way.

238
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,160
Okay! Get a hold of the police!

239
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,352
And we must evacuate the students at once!

240
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,354
Time for study hall, class.

241
00:15:14,152 --> 00:15:16,049
Who do you think would try to attack us?

242
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,196
Probably the one from yesterday.

243
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:19,587
Excuse me, sir.

244
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:23,699
You are not allowed to be on school property without
a badge from the office! You need to come with me!

245
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:25,415
Sir, I...

246
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:35,723
He just neutralized three obstacles.

247
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:37,477
Are you saying that he killed some people?!

248
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:40,021
I'm not sure. But he's very forceful.

249
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,635
Dear God! This is terrible!

250
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:46,205
We need to get the students as
far away from here as possible!

251
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:49,677
Attention students and faculty! This is an emergency!

252
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,479
There is currently an intruder on campus!

253
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:52,002
What?

254
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,514
What do you think they want?

255
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:54,019
Students are to follow their teachers' instructions,

256
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:54,880
and evacuate the school in groups according to class.

257
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:57,217
Wait, was there supposed to be a drill today

258
00:15:57,242 --> 00:16:00,282
I repeat: There is an intruder on campus!

259
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:03,218
Damn! He's doing this in broad daylight.

260
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:06,439
He has no concern for the consequences of his actions.

261
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:09,107
He doesn't have the same reasoning as Ryoko Tamiya.

262
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:11,451
Guess not. Where is she right now anyway?

263
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:14,446
She is approximately one-hundred fifty meters from here.

264
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:18,116
It would seem that she intends to
observe our fight from a safe distance.

265
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:20,023
That's better than fighting both of them.

266
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:23,196
Make your way to the stairs near Wing C.

267
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,290
Do not approach Wing A under any circumstances.

268
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,825
Ms. Tamiya! She's gone?

269
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:32,697
Okay, come with me kids! Don't push. Don't push!

270
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:35,165
I need everybody to stay in line and keep moving.

271
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,466
Just follow me down to the courtyard.

272
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:38,271
We will have to fight him, Shinichi.

273
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:40,177
Fight him? But why?

274
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:42,199
It's daytime in a crowded school.

275
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:45,462
He walked in here with absolutely
no regard for being seen.

276
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:47,884
If we run, he's sure to follow us.

277
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,090
It's better to finish him here and now.

278
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,284
Plus, right now, we have the advantage.

279
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:55,495
And we also have a plan.

280
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:57,310
Huh, a plan?

281
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,198
Hey, who the heck have you been talking to?

282
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:02,902
Huh?! I'm just thinking out loud.

283
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:07,432
Hey, isn't that him there? That's gotta be him.

284
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:08,464
Huh? He's where?

285
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:09,887
Over there, that old guy.

286
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:13,107
Oh, God! What do you think he wants?

287
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,781
Please, stay in line! Keep moving!

288
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,497
He's trying to pinpoint your...

289
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:21,245
No, he's trying to pinpoint MY location.

290
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:24,523
However, the size of this crowd
is preventing him from doing that.

291
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,027
And then what? What's gonna happen?

292
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:28,645
What if he does find us?

293
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:31,079
Without a doubt, he's going to attack us.

294
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:34,510
He will come full force, affecting
all those who are around us.

295
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:38,408
Fortunately, that will give us an opportunity.

296
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:39,634
Opportunity?

297
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:40,621
Yes.

298
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:43,302
While he's busy attacking all the people around you,

299
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:45,887
I will be able to move in swiftly and surprise him.

300
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:50,171
It's simple, and it has a high probability of success.

301
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:51,331
All those people?

302
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:53,216
That's your plan?

303
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:54,830
Yes, that's the plan.

304
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:58,389
Mr. A will be encumbered by a
rather inconvenient obstacle:

305
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,244
A crowd of confused students.

306
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:02,399
A wall of flesh will protect us.

307
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,050
A "wall of flesh"?

308
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:06,951
I almost forgot what a sicko you are!

309
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,091
Murano!

310
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:11,556
Shinichi?

311
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:12,834
Get outta here!

312
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,104
Did you forget something? I'll come with you...

313
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,512
I said to go! Get away from me!

314
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,118
Uh, I'm really sorry!

315
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,920
Just hurry up and get out of here!

316
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:33,778
What's wrong, Shinichi?

317
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:36,240
Do you not like my strategy to fight Mr. A?

318
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:37,334
Of course I don't!

319
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:39,263
How many need to die to do it?!

320
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:40,390
Does it matter?

321
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,700
It's for the sake of self preservation.

322
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,642
Sacrificing others in order to protect oneself...

323
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:49,116
That's simply the way that all
life forms maintain their existence.

324
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,556
You know, you learned how to speak like us.

325
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:56,154
But you don't understand who we are at all, do you?

326
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,971
I just remembered...

327
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:01,817
Humans are very unique animals
that sometimes commit suicide.

328
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:04,415
It's not like anyone WANTS to die.

329
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:07,910
What is it you're doing?

330
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,114
I have a better option than a "wall of flesh".

331
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:14,436
C'mon, Class 3-2, you need to stay in line!

332
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:15,831
Are you angry, Migi?

333
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:20,127
Angry? No, of course I'm not.

334
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:22,111
I have no time for such things.

335
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,888
Shinichi, how do you think we are different from Mr. A?

336
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:29,238
"Different"?

337
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,701
Well, he's a murderer.

338
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,852
And I'm a decent human being.

339
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,827
He can be someone else. And I can't.

340
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:39,823
There's one of him.

341
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,838
And there's two of us.

342
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:43,058
Is that so?

343
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,708
Do you think Mr. A sees us as two separate entities?

344
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:49,206
I don't understand.

345
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:58,493
Here, this will be your weapon.

346
00:19:58,702 --> 00:19:59,663
My weapon?

347
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:03,141
That's right. Mr. A and I are equally matched in combat.

348
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,316
That leaves one obvious factor.

349
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:07,233
You are going to have to join the fight.

350
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:12,956
If you allow yourself to become flustered during the
battle, it will only hold me back, and we will lose.

351
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,841
But if you are able to fight effectively, we win.

352
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:16,569
Got it?

353
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:19,654
Fight "effectively"? What's that mean?

354
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:23,286
In other words Shinichi, we delegate our roles.

355
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:31,430
Do you think that's really going to work?

356
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,136
It's our best option.

357
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:36,158
All that's left for you to do now is conceal your weapon.

358
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:40,640
The truth of the matter is,

359
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:43,613
Migi is way more skilled at combat than I am.

360
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:47,277
I mean, he's even killed two of his own kind.

361
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:50,856
I guess my only choice is to trust him.

362
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,301
He's here, Shinichi.

363
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,788
Mr. A is within three meters of us.

364
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:55,963
Three meters?!

365
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,929
Huh? But that's impossible! He'd be right here!

366
00:20:58,954 --> 00:21:00,289
Directly below us.

367
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:15,599
Was that meant as some sort of barricade?

368
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:18,537
The only thing you've accomplished
is to block off your escape.

369
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:48,719
Next time: "Tangled Hair"
