1
00:00:01,107 --> 00:00:02,340
Where is it?!

2
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:06,865
Didja fall asleep or something?

3
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:10,922
Yuko!

4
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:17,462
What're you doing?

5
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:19,389
Mr. Izumi!

6
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,215
Just where do you think you're going?!

7
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:22,563
Hey!

8
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:57,099
Try not to move.

9
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:00,597
It will only hurt more if you do.

10
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,963
Ah!

11
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:04,999
Ungh!

12
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:06,932
Ah!

13
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:10,822
Huh?

14
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:34,913
Huh? Hey, look...

15
00:02:35,245 --> 00:02:35,700
Huh?

16
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,263
Uh...

17
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:49,640
Ah!

18
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,006
Oh dear God! Are you alright?!

19
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:03,547
Can you hear me? Speak up! Come on!

20
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:04,673
Are you okay?

21
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:07,206
Gah! What's happening?!

22
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:12,749
Dammit! When I lost control and morphed,
some of the chemicals got inside me!

23
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,791
You saw that thing coming out the window, right?

24
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:18,230
Yeah, man... Let's go take a look.

25
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:21,768
That sound just now.

26
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:23,471
I think it came from the Art Room.

27
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,083
He's on the move.

28
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:26,186
What? Where?!

29
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:29,306
Very strange... I'm not sure it's Shimada.

30
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:30,111
Huh?

31
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:32,215
Its thoughts are disjointed...

32
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:33,406
Or rather...

33
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:35,609
completely incoherent.

34
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:36,326
Hmm...

35
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:40,648
Hey, you two. What was that sound?

36
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:43,170
We think we saw something in the Art Room, sir.

37
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:45,199
You saw "something". Hmph...

38
00:03:45,946 --> 00:03:47,962
All right then. I'll find out what's going on.

39
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:49,522
You guys can go back to class.

40
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:50,306
Huh? Hold on!

41
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:51,381
Sir, wait a second!

42
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:54,272
<i>I have to...</i>

43
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:57,194
<i>I must restore my human form.</i>

44
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:01,136
<i>It's not working.</i>

45
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:03,138
<i>The surface won't respond!</i>

46
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:08,683
<i>This body is stuck in attack mode,
and doesn't seem able to restore itself.</i>

47
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:11,601
<i>It must be corrected...</i>

48
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:15,675
<i>The dead cells are preventing intercommunication.</i>

49
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,025
<i>I have to unify my thoughts.</i>

50
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:22,298
Uh!

51
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:24,216
<i>What it this?</i>

52
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:25,548
<i>What am I doing?</i>

53
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:28,462
Okay son, what's going on?

54
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:31,057
Get that that thing off your head and come with me.

55
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:36,846
Oh.

56
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:38,326
What?

57
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:40,712
He just killed three entities.

58
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:42,962
Ah... Ahh!

59
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:43,728
Huh?

60
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:45,397
Oh my God!

61
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:46,718
Over there! Over there!

62
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:48,404
That thing! That thing's over there!

63
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,964
Huh? Do you know what's going on?

64
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:53,615
OH!

65
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,897
Oh my God! Call the police! Call 'em now!

66
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:00,059
Okay, okay!

67
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:02,703
Migi, can you sense him, where did he go?

68
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:03,842
Give me a minute.

69
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,695
Shimada's signal has become exceedingly scattered.

70
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,201
He's quite fast...

71
00:05:11,248 --> 00:05:13,315
Right now, he's headed toward your classroom.

72
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,824
Ah! The classroom?!

73
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:20,991
Uh...

74
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,113
I can't get through here.

75
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,138
Fighting in these conditions would not be preferable.

76
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:28,955
For now, I recommend we evacuate with the others.

77
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:33,953
I can't believe this is happening again!

78
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:35,647
You mean that "Killer A" lunatic?

79
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,264
Who do you think it is?

80
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:40,805
Well, I guess this time it's
just gotta be "Killer B", huh?

81
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,451
What are you doing?!

82
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,642
You need to leave! Everyone get out of here! Hurry!

83
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:49,043
I think Mr. Sasaki peed his pants.

84
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:51,884
He seems more dangerous than, like, any intruder.

85
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,033
Once you've confirmed that everyone in your class
has made it out, you're to leave campus immediately!

86
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,504
Seriously? What about all our bags?

87
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,161
You can get them tomorrow!

88
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,825
Oh, Mr. Vice Principal!

89
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:05,686
Class 3-3's students aren't out here yet.

90
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:06,125
Uh?

91
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:08,442
<i>That's Murano's class.</i>

92
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,533
Where in God's name are the police?

93
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:12,811
I don't know, they're taking forever.

94
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:18,651
Migi, where's Shimada?

95
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:20,931
So we are going to fight him?

96
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:26,247
Right now, I'm more worried
about what's happening to Class 3-3!

97
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:28,127
Shinichi!

98
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:32,127
Huh?

99
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:39,131
Huh? It's Murano's class!

100
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:41,099
<i>I don't see her.</i>

101
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:44,392
<i>I don't see her. Where is she?!</i>

102
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,187
Fine then... I liked you better before.

103
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:51,830
<i>This can't be how it ends...</i>

104
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:53,606
<i>I can't...</i>

105
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,873
<i>I cannot accept it!</i>

106
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:58,540
Shimada's on the third floor.

107
00:06:58,806 --> 00:06:59,326
Uh!

108
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,556
Shinichi! Calm down!

109
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:26,688
Take it easy...

110
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:28,447
Slow your breathing.

111
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:30,139
What have I...

112
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,686
What the hell have I been doing?!

113
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:34,441
I'm breaking.

114
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,654
My heart's tearing apart...

115
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,477
It's ripping in two...

116
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,888
You'll be okay.

117
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,937
Everything's going to be just fine.

118
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,407
<i>I can't... do this anymore!</i>

119
00:07:49,322 --> 00:07:52,080
But Shinichi. You're different now.

120
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:57,937
It's like you're made of steel. Metal
shell with nothing left on the inside.

121
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:05,072
Hhmm...

122
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:08,177
Have you calmed yourself?

123
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:09,562
Yeah, I'm alright.

124
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,173
<i>I will protect Murano.</i>

125
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:16,085
<i>And to do that, I must take HIM down.</i>

126
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:31,086
Hm-oh...

127
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:35,667
Uh...

128
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:42,178
<i>Sorry, I thought you were someone else.</i>

129
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,277
Migi, where's Shimada now?

130
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,321
About 60 meters from here, on this floor.

131
00:08:58,807 --> 00:08:59,905
Two, far away...

132
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:01,906
And three more close by...

133
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,968
And there's one beast.

134
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,727
That's very impressive.

135
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:07,995
It's coming from over there.

136
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:10,834
Huh...

137
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,312
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

138
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:22,438
Huh... whah...

139
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,129
Murano...

140
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:27,848
I'm here...

141
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:33,481
It's alright. You're okay.

142
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,964
How... how were you able to get over here?

143
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:40,569
You can do it.

144
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:44,224
Right. We're all going together.

145
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:45,416
G-go where?

146
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,454
Well, I came from over there.

147
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:49,505
So we'll go back that way.

148
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:51,102
Huh?! But...

149
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,455
but that's where...

150
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,763
I mean, we can't go that way!

151
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:56,601
That's where they all got cut down!

152
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,802
But it's safe now. He's gone.

153
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:02,654
No! No chance!

154
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:05,198
Wait! If you came that way...

155
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:05,800
Are you...

156
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,910
Oh God... it was you...

157
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:09,559
Ah...

158
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,082
He's one of them!

159
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:13,298
No wait! Come back!

160
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,681
Oh! Ahh!

161
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:18,755
Huh?

162
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:24,224
<i>He's right there.</i>

163
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:38,167
<i>He said they were looking for ways to coexist...</i>

164
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:42,366
<i>but in the end, he murdered them and ate them...</i>

165
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:44,536
<i>His directive.</i>

166
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:50,057
He's here. Uh...

167
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:52,842
Wha... Ahhh!

168
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:53,681
It's okay!

169
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:01,497
Alright, one more jump!

170
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,658
You should be safe over here Murano.

171
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:16,209
But...

172
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:19,077
but how... Shinichi...

173
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:19,908
I know...

174
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:22,341
Something as crazy as this...

175
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,225
it's enough to rattle anyone.

176
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:39,918
No. I'm fine... Just take care of her.

177
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:42,382
But... don't go...

178
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,845
Look... You don't have to worry.

179
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:48,100
Uhh...

180
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:51,483
Uh...

181
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:57,380
<i>This is something... I have to take care of.</i>

182
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:05,882
I'm not sure if we can get back in.

183
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:07,765
Do you still plan to fight him?

184
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,364
We knew what Shimada was, and we did nothing.

185
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:13,937
And that means we're responsible.

186
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:16,412
Which in my book means one thing...

187
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,351
It is up to us...

188
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:22,010
to end this.

189
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,582
You're saying strange things again.

190
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:27,164
Let the police handle this.

191
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:29,808
Under these circumstances, they will prevail.

192
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:34,952
Police! Don't move!

193
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:51,319
Ah!

194
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,321
You damned monster!

195
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,001
Small-arms fire won't be enough to bring him down.

196
00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:03,337
If they want to kill him,

197
00:13:03,471 --> 00:13:06,179
they'll need to decapitate him or destroy the heart.

198
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:11,862
Still, if he's injured badly enough,

199
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:13,677
he will succumb eventually.

200
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:22,073
He's headed where? The roof?

201
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:25,235
Understood. But approach him with extreme caution.

202
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:29,545
Migi, do you think Shimada is really to blame?

203
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:32,825
I think it's best to let the humans use their rather...

204
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,773
arbitrary standards to make that judgment.

205
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:39,703
No. This needs to end now.

206
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,780
Yes... But how?

207
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:44,893
With this.

208
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:48,653
But we must keep a distance of at least 300 meters.

209
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:51,215
Otherwise, Shimada will be able to sense us.

210
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:52,341
I know.

211
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:02,547
<i>Shimada... This can't be just about you...</i>

212
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,589
<i>There's also Ryoko Tamiya and Mr. A...</i>

213
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:08,401
<i>Why the hell are you even here?</i>

214
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:17,214
You're going to need to merge my
strength with your current power.

215
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:18,367
Right...

216
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,395
Migi, you know where to aim this, don't you?

217
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,446
Of course.

218
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:54,370
Shinichi...

219
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:58,395
Uhh...

220
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:14,069
A week has now passed since the massacre
that resulted in the deaths of 17 victims.

221
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:17,328
Several doubts remain regarding
the identity of the presumed killer,

222
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:18,635
a drug addicted student,

223
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,205
who is now known to have been using a false name.

224
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:23,765
I don't understand.

225
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,268
Why are they making such an effort to hide the truth...

226
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,174
They should just show everyone out there Shimada's body.

227
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,475
What happens if they put Shimada's body on display...

228
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,447
and even openly announced that they've
identified a new type of parasitic life form

229
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,058
that's feeding on human beings...

230
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:39,633
What's achieved?

231
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:41,276
"What's achieved"?

232
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:43,228
Public outrage...

233
00:15:43,253 --> 00:15:45,087
And demands to capture the damn things.

234
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,623
How would you capture them?

235
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:47,317
Huh?

236
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:48,833
Ah...

237
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,314
well we humans can't do it alone...

238
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,428
You and I will have to work together with the police.

239
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,333
No way.

240
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:56,704
Migi...

241
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:59,541
I am an ally to myself, and myself alone.

242
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:02,187
I am not an ally to the human species.

243
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:03,915
Yeah, but still...

244
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,170
Even if they discover a parasite
disguised as a human being,

245
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:09,423
it can simply assume another identity.

246
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:12,021
Humans would be unable to apprehend them.

247
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:15,085
Okay then...! So WE should hunt them all down right?

248
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:16,098
And kill them?

249
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:16,713
Uh...

250
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:22,590
Shinichi. I don't have the
same sentimentality as humans...

251
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:27,004
which means that even killing my own
kind has no affect on me emotionally.

252
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:31,071
But try to imagine if my position and yours were reversed.

253
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:31,772
Ah...

254
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:38,403
<i>Talking about such things distresses him.</i>

255
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,422
<i>A common condition of the human race.</i>

256
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:47,244
Up till now, we've kept their
existence secret to avoid mass panic.

257
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:50,128
But it's getting more and more
difficult to keep it hidden.

258
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:53,798
An announcement of this nature
would most certainly lead to chaos.

259
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,363
There are even rumors that the Americans are
attempting to adapt these parasites for military use.

260
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,573
It's time to involve the public.

261
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,330
And how do you intend to make such an announcement?

262
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:06,243
Let me clarify,

263
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:09,240
I'm not saying that we should
reveal the parasites' existence.

264
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:14,814
I mean we could subtly make known a method that
could be used to distinguish humans from the parasites.

265
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,827
But how would we make that "known"?

266
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,170
And we can't even tell each other apart...

267
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:20,654
Who out there's infected?

268
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,040
To explain this matter further,
I'd like to hand it over to Dr. Yui.

269
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:25,406
Mm.

270
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:32,393
Now then, I'd like to start by expounding upon what we've
learned so far about the parasites' unique physiology.

271
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:37,809
These parasitic life forms have
the ability to act as the human brain,

272
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:42,804
not only commanding the entire body, but even
driving functions beyond their normal limits.

273
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:46,256
Their cellular makeup closely resembles that of neurons.

274
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,162
To put things more simply...

275
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:50,457
you could call it "sentient muscle."

276
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:53,775
Ah, "sentient muscle"? Very interesting.

277
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:57,734
There's more. They have the ability
to morph their tissues in an instant,

278
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,703
to stretch out like rubber or become as hard as steel.

279
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:06,010
So you might wonder, how could such foreign
cells as these bind themselves to the human body?

280
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:10,004
The answer is, a near-instantaneous cellular fusion.

281
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:13,987
It's most likely a substance much like how
polyethylene glycol affects the cell membranes...

282
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:16,216
Please skip to how we can identify them.

283
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:17,775
Huh? Ahh...

284
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:20,626
Now then...

285
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:23,469
As they are sentient muscle,

286
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:28,219
when enough of their cells are gathered, their
intelligence level is actually on par with that of humans.

287
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:33,453
On the other hand, what do you suppose happens
if enough of their cells are not gathered together?

288
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:34,272
Hmm...

289
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,103
If deprived of blood flow,

290
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,633
they shrivel up and die,

291
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,660
so they work together to fuse with others of their kind.

292
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:44,859
So if a small enough fragment becomes
separated, it struggles to survive,

293
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:48,819
but its small mass means it lacks
the intelligence to rejoin the source.

294
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:52,507
Now if you were to pull out the hair of
a human, nothing at all would happen...

295
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:55,453
But if you pull out a "hair"
from a camouflaged parasite...

296
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,120
I believe it would violently writhe in pain for a
few seconds before the cells would ultimately die.

297
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:02,670
In other words...

298
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:07,758
Pulling out a strand of hair is one way to
identify whether or not someone has been infected.

299
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,477
Well done, Professor!

300
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:12,680
Good Lord, they could just wear a wig!

301
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:14,369
What do you suggest we do then?

302
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:18,104
A hair sample from any part of the
body will create the same reaction.

303
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:22,627
The main point is to isolate a small
enough mass of cells away from the main body.

304
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:25,864
Well maybe... I guess that makes sense.

305
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,120
Now then, I'm very sorry for the imposition, gentlemen,

306
00:19:29,145 --> 00:19:30,988
but we ask that as you leave this room,

307
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:33,662
you consent to pulling out a strand of your hair.

308
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:35,183
Uh-umm...

309
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,716
While the likelihood is low,

310
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:40,444
we cannot say for sure that we
don't have one of them here among us.

311
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,689
<i>It didn't take as long as you'd
expect... for school to be reopened.</i>

312
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:49,274
Uh...

313
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:51,642
Murano.

314
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,454
Uh... Shinichi.

315
00:19:56,204 --> 00:19:58,794
Are you... are you doing okay?

316
00:19:59,422 --> 00:19:59,933
Mm...

317
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,924
Sorry... Sorry I didn't text you back.

318
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:05,224
That's fine.

319
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:09,623
Are ya ready?

320
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,182
Mm-hm...

321
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:15,023
How's Yuko doin'?

322
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:17,499
Oh, she's much better now.

323
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:19,125
She'll be at school today.

324
00:20:19,923 --> 00:20:20,571
That's good.

325
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:24,388
She really... she really went through a lot y'know.

326
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:26,016
Yeah, she did...

327
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:28,560
But she's always been a pretty strong person.

328
00:20:29,216 --> 00:20:29,799
Mm.

329
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,343
I've been thinking about how much I need to thank you.

330
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:34,663
Oh?

331
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:36,600
Because well...

332
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:38,785
if you hadn't been there...

333
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:41,551
Look that's all behind us...

334
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:44,120
Let's just try to think of happier things now.

335
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:45,620
Shinichi...

336
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:48,094
You know, we jumped from pretty high up there.

337
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,649
And somehow you didn't even get hurt.

338
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,281
Yeah right, I think I must've
been all pumped full of adrenaline...

339
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,656
I mean, I was as surprised as you were.

340
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,676
Yeah, uh-huh...

341
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:00,612
Well I do really mean it...

342
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:02,601
Thanks, Shinichi.

343
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,459
Mm...

344
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:06,480
Huh?

345
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,783
Good morning!

346
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:08,809
Good morning!

347
00:21:11,432 --> 00:21:15,042
<i>The government never did publicly
announce the existence of the parasites...</i>

348
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:18,941
<i>However... a little "fad" started.</i>

349
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:21,749
<i>People started greeting each other differently.</i>

350
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:24,797
<i>Like... a new handshake.</i>

351
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,758
Next time: "The Blue Bird"
