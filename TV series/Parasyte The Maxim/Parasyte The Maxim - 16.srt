1
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:12,369
Okay... as for the detective himself...

2
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:13,968
I'll deal with him...

3
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:16,963
What about the human with the parasite arm?

4
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:20,344
Of course... Miki is heading that way tomorrow.

5
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:30,013
Hm?

6
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,766
Ah! Yoko! Yumi!

7
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,900
Oh!

8
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:16,136
Given your situation...

9
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:19,795
I would imagine that your
combat style must be truly unique.

10
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:23,451
Must be how you've dealt with
my kind so easily up until now.

11
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,725
But what I can't understand is how having a human
brain still intact could actually make you stronger.

12
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:33,261
Judging by the condition of
the body left in our dining area,

13
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,792
it would seem to indicate your
victory did not happen instantly.

14
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:41,319
Hahaha...

15
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,085
What's wrong? Was that not an appropriate moment to laugh?

16
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,896
So, how do you manage to do it?

17
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:51,268
I'd love to get a demonstration
of your special fighting techniques.

18
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:53,400
Man... What's with this guy?

19
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,528
He's creepy as hell and won't shut up.

20
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:56,702
Stay alert...

21
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:59,368
He's only attempting to figure us out right now.

22
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:02,134
And no matter how expressive he may seem to you,

23
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,439
never forget that it's something completely
different from actual human emotions.

24
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:10,520
Ohh... So you talk to each other while you're fighting.

25
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:13,325
And that's an effective system?

26
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,695
You certainly have impressive
speed and motion detection...

27
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:24,436
which means that bringing you back in one
piece could prove to be a rather difficult task.

28
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:26,342
There are too many blades!

29
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,163
So? Make more!

30
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:30,037
I'm afraid it doesn't work that way.

31
00:03:30,312 --> 00:03:32,600
There's a certain minimum size requirement.

32
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:37,401
Ugh!

33
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:43,526
Hehehe...

34
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:48,355
That guy sure is pretty slow.

35
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,356
True, you are faster than he is...

36
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,913
but it's not as if you have all that much stamina.

37
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,879
Yeah. I've been running all day!

38
00:03:57,676 --> 00:03:58,746
I'm really tired!

39
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,267
I agree. I am, too.

40
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,653
That fight was short but very intense.

41
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:06,914
I guess we're pretty pathetic aren't we?

42
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:13,703
Okay, I think we've put some distance between us.

43
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,358
He's a new type of enemy.

44
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:17,511
Three-in-one this time.

45
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:19,741
So what about his legs?

46
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:20,606
His legs?

47
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,772
Well it's like you told me in our last fight...

48
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:25,276
that the human part is the weakness.

49
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:28,072
If we can attack his legs somehow...

50
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:29,741
Aah...

51
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,408
What's wrong? We can't do it?

52
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:33,883
I'm worried...

53
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:37,873
I can't seem to get a feel for
how his parasites are distributed.

54
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,170
But you said there are three of them, didn't you?

55
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,539
So they have to be the head and arms, right?

56
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:45,698
Logically, yes, but something is wrong...

57
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:47,695
Uh...

58
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:50,755
He's here. He caught up to us.

59
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:53,558
Ah!

60
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:59,167
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh!

61
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:00,327
Here we go again.

62
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:01,536
"Again"?

63
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:02,519
Ugh!

64
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,201
I swear. You sure do like to run.

65
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,467
And it's getting kind of old.

66
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,677
I guess I'll have to forget
about leaving your body intact.

67
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:13,943
Okay, it's time to gamble...

68
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,116
Let's aim for the legs, just like you said.

69
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:19,837
I'll block the next attacks
that come toward your right side.

70
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:23,436
You'll need to hold your ground
while dodging attacks on the left side.

71
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,731
And how am I supposed to do that?

72
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,213
Huh?

73
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,546
Peculiar.

74
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:40,491
Haha... Shall we finish?!

75
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,213
Ah!

76
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:48,765
What the-?

77
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:50,075
What was that?!

78
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:54,003
That was a mid-air collision, and
between his own tentacles, no less.

79
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:54,622
Huh?!

80
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:57,303
I see his true nature clearer now.

81
00:05:57,662 --> 00:05:58,714
"True nature"?

82
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:04,276
Indeed... Seeing this new type was quite a shock
at first, but he might turn out to be mostly show.

83
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,447
I sure hope so.

84
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:07,410
As for the three parasites...

85
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,963
they're distributed through more than his head and arms.

86
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:13,442
For instance, that leg I was
able to cut earlier wasn't human.

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,388
It wasn't?!

88
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:18,305
Either way, I'm certain that the
head is, in fact, the control center.

89
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:21,649
And I don't sense independent
thought in his arms' movements.

90
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:23,181
Look out.

91
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,463
I'll run as many times as it takes!

92
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:28,986
I've found a good location.

93
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:30,706
Go into the woods right here.

94
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,232
His control center isn't that competent.

95
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:38,909
There's no cohesion to his bodily movements,

96
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,555
which is why he falls down and runs into himself.

97
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:46,512
Most importantly, his head should be parasitic,
so why doesn't it morph and join in the attack?

98
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:47,804
Good question!

99
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:52,752
I think the head has a hard enough time just
governing the arms and other parasite areas.

100
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:56,605
Meaning, the head has to stay intact
or the entire system falls apart.

101
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,227
So, it's actually not at all that difficult.

102
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,256
In the end, he's just a single enemy.

103
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:02,946
Right... We'll fight here...

104
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,813
Stop running.

105
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,074
Rather than the legs or torso, let's aim for the neck...

106
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,733
Severing the head is the surest way to victory.

107
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:12,066
Y'think we can get to it?

108
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,947
We can! Whenever I give you the signal,
I want you to run directly toward him...

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,080
And at full speed.

110
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:19,044
What?!

111
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,211
You'll just have to trust me.

112
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,198
I'm getting really tired of this.

113
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,370
Now don't you move!

114
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:30,623
Use the trees as a shield and maintain your distance.

115
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:33,573
Dodge his attacks by moving in all directions.

116
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,596
If you avoid him by just using a linear pattern,

117
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:39,440
he'll be able to learn our
movements and predict our next move...

118
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,673
Until suddenly...

119
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:42,139
Now!

120
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,058
Huh?

121
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:46,529
From his perspective,

122
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:49,834
a prey that has done nothing but
run away now is suddenly coming at him.

123
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,589
Parallel becomes perpendicular,
horizontal becomes vertical...

124
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,299
For someone struggling just to control his tentacles,

125
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:58,526
he won't be able to track our trajectory.

126
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:00,734
Haa!

127
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:07,151
Yeah!

128
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:15,245
What's wrong?

129
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,893
I didn't know... that was possible!

130
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,824
Now it's my turn.

131
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:26,404
Uh...

132
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:29,388
Get over here, Miki.

133
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:34,061
Yeah, sorry 'bout that.

134
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:39,067
Irrelevant. As I suspected, you're
better suited to remain a subordinate.

135
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,459
So there weren't really three of them.

136
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,103
What?!

137
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,029
Look. He is now completely one being.

138
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:49,262
In an instant, he took control of the
entire body and became a single life form.

139
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:53,729
But just before that happened, his
consciousness split into five separate pieces.

140
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,410
In other words, there are a total
of five parasites in that one body!

141
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:58,750
Ah-no way!

142
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,662
When the first one was acting as the head,

143
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:05,170
I felt that there were three because he wasn't
capable of unifying all of them at the same time.

144
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:07,154
Yes, that's correct.

145
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:10,004
Only Miki and I can act as the controller.

146
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,075
And only I am able to unify all of us together.

147
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:15,110
Wow...

148
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:16,380
Yes.

149
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,028
But now is not the time to be impressed.

150
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:23,733
It seems we must've come quite
some distance while I was asleep.

151
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:27,281
We've met before... Yes?

152
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,467
It's that guy!

153
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:36,643
He moves different from before!

154
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:50,416
Not even apes can move like that!

155
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:53,154
Being in the woods is now a disadvantage for us!

156
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:05,203
Ugh! Ah!

157
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:21,810
He's quite fast... For a human.

158
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:33,956
Excuse me!

159
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,130
Uh?! No!

160
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:39,037
Let's go.

161
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,728
Ah!

162
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,709
Ah!

163
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:51,363
Well...

164
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:52,721
What?!

165
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:57,024
Very impressive.

166
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:00,076
Ah!

167
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:07,714
Hm? What in the...

168
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:12,342
Aaa... holy... son of ah...!

169
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:17,027
Uh... What do we do?

170
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:29,143
Hmm?

171
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,350
I don't know what's going on...

172
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,155
But I'm getting' the hell outta here!

173
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,598
I can't believe that bastard
just drove off! What the hell?!

174
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:53,016
Are you okay there pal?

175
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,914
My body is feeling weary from the loss of so much blood...

176
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,711
I will need some more.

177
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:02,303
Blood?

178
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,208
I understand your pain all too well. But, sir...

179
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,374
Is there a detective here named Hirama?

180
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:18,389
Hirama?

181
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,013
Yes, Chief?

182
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,566
You can go on now.

183
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:32,660
Kuramori...

184
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:36,594
I'm going to put aside for the time
being how it is you've even come to know...

185
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:37,906
Inspector Hirama.

186
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:42,484
Because I think you know something more important.

187
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:44,024
About the parasites.

188
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,619
Shinichi, you need some new clothes.

189
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,254
We stand out too much. And we need to eat.

190
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,638
I would. But I don't have any money.

191
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,914
Ah! Migi where did you get that?

192
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:11,924
From that truck driver earlier.

193
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,073
Before you say it, I am not human,

194
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:17,564
and I don't want to hear any lectures
about your human laws and morals.

195
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,540
You're my hand, y'know?

196
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:22,813
I did this out of necessity to preserve my own life.

197
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:26,592
Listen, even though you and I are
completely different life forms...

198
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:28,247
we have developed an alliance...

199
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:29,996
and we must respect one another.

200
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,602
With that in mind,

201
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:34,418
what do you think is the common purpose that unites us?

202
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,341
To survive.

203
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,622
Yeah, but it's still stealing.

204
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:41,422
Indeed.

205
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,986
Police have now revealed more information about the
grisly slayings of Mr. Kuramori's wife and daughter,

206
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:49,675
Hm? What tha? "Kuramori"?

207
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:53,643
Furthermore, Kuramori's office,
which handled private investigations,

208
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:57,157
burned to the ground the same night in
what is believed to have been an act of arson.

209
00:13:57,182 --> 00:14:01,240
Police have said that they plan to question Kuramori
about any possible connection between the two incidents.

210
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:04,311
They must have decided he's
too dangerous to be kept alive.

211
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:07,094
His family was probably just collateral damage.

212
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,358
Most likely their primary target, the detective, escaped.

213
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,297
I have to get a hold of my Dad!

214
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:20,180
Shinichi? It's late, where are you?

215
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:21,268
Everything okay?

216
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:23,061
Dad, listen to me.

217
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,080
You need to get out of the house... Right now!

218
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,372
Tell me what's going on, Shinichi.

219
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,245
A lot of things...

220
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:32,185
I can't come home for a while.

221
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,939
Why not?! Talk to me, tell me what's going on!

222
00:14:34,964 --> 00:14:35,746
But Dad...

223
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,876
<i>There's no way I can tell him everything I know!</i>

224
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:41,773
<i>I have to hurry. I gotta get him outta there!</i>

225
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:47,081
Okay. Look, Dad...

226
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:51,351
Haven't I... Haven't I been a good
kid and followed the rules and anything?

227
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,444
And y'know, ever since Mom's been
gone I've tried really hard to help out,

228
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:57,153
and be someone you can trust...

229
00:14:57,723 --> 00:15:01,378
Dad, I promise, this isn't some kind of stupid prank.

230
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,540
So, Dad, please!

231
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,057
You have to get out of the house right now!

232
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:07,634
A monster is coming!

233
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:10,069
And it's the same one that killed Mom alright!

234
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:10,616
Huh?

235
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,494
Shinichi please tell me that you're safe.

236
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,718
Yes, Dad. I am.

237
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:18,346
All right then...

238
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:20,017
I'll leave here for now, son...

239
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:22,393
Your father believes in you, okay?

240
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:26,548
That's good... Thanks, Dad.

241
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,743
My name is Hirama.

242
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:34,419
My sincere condolences for
the loss of your wife and child.

243
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:38,512
Currently, they're still being
examined for forensic evidence,

244
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,762
but what I've already seen has confirmed my beliefs.

245
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:45,014
Right now, I'd like to hear what your thoughts are.

246
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,966
You need justice!

247
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:49,748
Hm?

248
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:52,547
Justice, huh?

249
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:53,660
That's right.

250
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,061
Since I was a boy...

251
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:01,573
I've always admired the great detectives...

252
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,904
Heh... You know, like... like Sherlock Holmes...

253
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:09,658
but things don't always go as planned,
I managed to become a PI at least...

254
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,203
Okay now listen here...

255
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:19,597
You could be... a great detective.

256
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,388
Can we... can we avenge their deaths?

257
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,968
Of course we can!

258
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:30,111
I... I have some information.

259
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:30,730
Mm-hm.

260
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:34,358
But I'm afraid I'm a little messed up right now.

261
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:36,495
Can I have something to write with...

262
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:39,274
and go somewhere I can calm down first.

263
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:40,991
Absolutely.

264
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:45,496
No, this isn't telepathy.

265
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,695
How many times is this now?

266
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:50,819
It's our sixteenth time to meet in your dreams...

267
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:53,094
Though I'm sure you'll just forget again.

268
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:57,715
Yeah but, you don't look anything at
all like the Migi I know in the real world.

269
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,828
You say the same thing every time we do this.

270
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:05,504
But then, you don't look like the
Shinichi that I know in reality, either.

271
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,546
What, you're already going?

272
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:14,756
I've now determined that there's simply no way for
me to communicate with the thirty percent of my cells

273
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:16,896
that still remain scattered throughout your body.

274
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:20,255
So there's no point in meeting in your dreams anymore..

275
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,655
More importantly, our current situation in the real world

276
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,073
is such that there's no time
to lose on such trivial matters.

277
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,264
I should go.

278
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,372
Is that so?

279
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:31,285
You'll remember when you wake up.

280
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:32,682
Migi!

281
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:34,732
Huh?

282
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,507
What was I...

283
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:42,993
It's cold...

284
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:47,952
You mean both of them were failures? Unbelievable.

285
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:52,823
The real failure was on my part in allowing
the two of you to deal with the investigator.

286
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:58,520
Killing the family without getting rid of him first
shows your complete ignorance regarding human nature.

287
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,825
The room was dark when we got there...

288
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:04,575
At any rate, it will be simple
enough just to kill him next, correct?

289
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,124
You underestimate the humans a little too much.

290
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:14,735
True, individually, they seem like incapable creatures...

291
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:17,451
But that is not the case.

292
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,823
You need to recognize something that's very important...

293
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:27,531
The human race is actually a single life form
comprised of billions of separate parts.

294
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:30,122
In addition to their individual brains,

295
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:32,854
they possess a single, collective "consciousness."

296
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:35,246
And when we oppose that...

297
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:37,592
we are truly defeated.

298
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:39,295
<i>"Defeated"?</i>

299
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:41,715
<i>Is she truly one of us?</i>

300
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:43,994
<i>Something's different...</i>

301
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:46,089
<i>Something's not right.</i>

302
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:50,774
<i>Shinichi wasn't at school again today...</i>

303
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:54,853
<i>And yesterday, he was acting
like something was going on again...</i>

304
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,573
Murano.

305
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:56,033
Huh?

306
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:57,855
Got something for ya...

307
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,873
Here... Shinichi forgot it and left it behind.

308
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:03,031
You should totally go take it back to him.

309
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,573
Wha... But I...

310
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,819
It'll be a chance for you two to patch things up.

311
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,369
If you won't take it back to him, then I will!

312
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,530
Mr. Kuramori?

313
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:22,969
He duped us.

314
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:26,735
It's not like he's a suspect,
so why do you think he'd run off?

315
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:27,435
Huh?

316
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:35,928
A list of partners...

317
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:38,383
Reiko Tamura!

318
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:41,689
<i>Yoko, Yumi...</i>

319
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:44,232
<i>I will avenge you with my own hands!</i>

320
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:47,636
<i>Reiko Tamura, you're dead.</i>

321
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:51,049
<i>Reiko Tamura...</i>

322
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:54,085
<i>No. She is not one of us.</i>

323
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,876
<i>She's dangerous...</i>

324
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:57,360
<i>She's a threat...</i>

325
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,775
<i>a threat to our kind.</i>

326
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:05,542
<i>You are such a mystery...</i>

327
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,705
<i>In a world of so much confusion.</i>

328
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:11,915
<i>Why was I...</i>

329
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:16,513
<i>No. Why were we... born?</i>

330
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:23,283
<i>I didn't think so...</i>

331
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:25,628
<i>Where are you?</i>

332
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:29,585
<i>And are you safe, Shinichi?</i>

333
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,079
<i>It was you.</i>

334
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:41,331
<i>You are the one who dragged me into this hell!</i>

335
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:44,115
<i>Three of them.</i>

336
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:47,045
<i>And their intent seems less than peaceful.</i>

337
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:52,765
<i>Where's she going?</i>

338
00:20:54,477 --> 00:20:55,253
<i>All right...</i>

339
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:59,026
<i>While I still have the chance...</i>

340
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:11,395
Good evening, Tamura.

341
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:13,939
We can try to hide them,

342
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,340
but they can't be suppressed, can they?

343
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,963
The strongest signals that we emit
are those which harbor animosity...

344
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,134
I know of your intentions.

345
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:24,949
Get on with it.

346
00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:49,146
Next time: "The Adventure of the Dying Detective"
