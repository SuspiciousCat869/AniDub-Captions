1
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:20,970
Mitsuo?

2
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:23,460
What's his problem?

3
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:24,860
Ah...

4
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:29,565
Hey, don't!

5
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:30,327
Shut up!

6
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:33,815
If I wanna fight this jackass,
it's none of your damn business.

7
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:41,659
Shimada?

8
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:48,854
Huh?

9
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:56,600
I went easy on you this time
because I'd prefer to avoid trouble.

10
00:00:56,986 --> 00:01:01,303
However, if you decide to show up again
and pick a fight with me for no reason...

11
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,729
I'll end you.

12
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:03,355
Yes!

13
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,314
Shinichi?

14
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,926
You... are Shinichi Izumi, aren't you?

15
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:11,653
Huh?

16
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:14,584
I, uh...

17
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,683
Oh, sorry! My mistake, I'm sorry.

18
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,545
Uh! What?! Yeah, that's me!

19
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,625
Who... who're you?

20
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:25,122
I'm Satomi. Satomi Murano.

21
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,374
We both took our entrance exams in the same room.

22
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:31,091
Oh, sorry, that's right!

23
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:34,024
I was so nervous that day I didn't notice anything else.

24
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:37,198
Well, I'll see you in April then.

25
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:39,611
Maybe we'll be in the same class!

26
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,700
Yeah, maybe so.

27
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,726
His parasite's "signal" is weak again.

28
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,725
I wonder why? Is it sleeping?

29
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,197
Perhaps if I emit a signal of my own,

30
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:12,137
it should respond reflexively.

31
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,295
Especially, to murderous intent!

32
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,925
Interesting...

33
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:31,104
Mm, mm, mm, that Hide. He's kinduv a hottie, huh?

34
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:33,258
Oh! I, uh, don't really, um...

35
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:35,200
Oh, c'mon, don't even try to hide it.

36
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,742
I know you drew his face in your sketchbook, Yuko.

37
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,030
Akiho, that is mine!

38
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:42,825
I mean, he's super cool, isn't he?

39
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:45,079
I think we have a new hottest guy in school.

40
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,081
I bet he's a model. Do you think he's a model?

41
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:49,348
S'like he's not real. Like he's fake or something.

42
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,920
Oh, Yuko, do me a favor. Draw
a picture of him for me, too.

43
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:54,502
Ha! Thanks!

44
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:00,751
"Fake"?

45
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,941
Why? What do you mean I can't tell anyone?

46
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:11,397
In this situation, our greatest fear
is that we would cause wide-spread panic

47
00:05:11,422 --> 00:05:13,080
due to a lack of credible information.

48
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:17,754
When people stop trusting one another,
it inevitably leads to discrimination and fear.

49
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,986
And soon after that... misinformation
and mass hysteria will follow.

50
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:26,065
That's my son, Shinichi.

51
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,050
Uh, hello there. How are you?

52
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,448
In any case, we still have no
way to distinguish them from us.

53
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:43,105
And given that, there's simply nothing
to be gained by going public at this time.

54
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:46,447
We are truly sorry about the loss of your wife.

55
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:49,889
Nevertheless, to be blunt about
the current state of things,

56
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:57,302
this is a problematic situation of having a few thousand
violently dangerous killers roaming around the country.

57
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:01,499
Please, take a look.

58
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,954
Yes... That's exactly what the thing looked like.

59
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,818
So, it's able to morph into just about anything it wants.

60
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,781
It seems the rumors have become widespread.

61
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:26,880
It appears so.

62
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:29,910
That outcome could have easily been foreseen.

63
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:34,787
But if we continue this practice of
preying on them like mindless insects,

64
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:38,499
we will all eventually be hunted
down and completely wiped out.

65
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:44,062
Our species is truly weak...
Our imperfections are troubling.

66
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:48,632
It's hardly surprising that you would have
pondered over and worried about such things.

67
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:50,855
I only have one question.

68
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:54,083
I want to find out the real reason.

69
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:57,009
Why is it we parasites even exist?

70
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:59,674
The answer to that is quite simple.

71
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,047
The human race has now become toxic to the planet Earth,

72
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:05,764
which has created a need for balance.

73
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:11,427
So what you're saying is this thing
I'm currently nurturing within me

74
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,691
is a poison?

75
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:19,813
So I guess they left, huh, Dad?

76
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:23,559
"Mass hysteria..."

77
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,081
I need to tell you... the truth.

78
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:33,772
It's about...

79
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,837
It's about your mother, Son.

80
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:40,723
I sat there quietly and listened.

81
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,053
I nodded as my father spoke.

82
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,721
And told him nothing about what I knew.

83
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:50,115
Then, finally...

84
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,527
Dad told me outright for the very first time.

85
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:56,188
That Mom...

86
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:58,100
was dead.

87
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,868
We've asked Professor Bigg Mouth for his opinion
on when to brush your teeth. Morning or at night!

88
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,170
Professor Bigg Mouth, please stop that!

89
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:12,548
Aww, he's asleep again!

90
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,736
Hmm?

91
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:20,295
What is this? That's just nasty.

92
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:22,912
Ah! Gimme that!

93
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:25,022
It's part of an investigation.

94
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,650
Oh, is that what your suspect looks like this time?

95
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:31,036
How could THIS possibly be a suspect? It's a monster!

96
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:34,480
Anyway, what's going on, Yuko? Do you need something?

97
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:35,257
Yeah...

98
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:39,147
Could you take a look at something for me?

99
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:44,085
This your friend? That's pretty nice work.

100
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:46,974
You're getting better and better at this.

101
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,501
So, do you sense anything?

102
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:53,507
Like, his personality or like his attitude?

103
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:57,837
Since you draw faces for a living, I just
thought maybe you could tell me about him.

104
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,403
Come on, Yuko.

105
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:01,742
It doesn't really work like that, y'know.

106
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:03,897
Oh, 'kay.

107
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:21,410
He's alone again today. Is he waiting for someone?

108
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:24,511
Or maybe he's watching someone...

109
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:27,382
Hey! Look out!

110
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:35,686
Hey, buddy!

111
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:37,850
Dude, are you all right?

112
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:41,420
Yes.

113
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,939
I... I don't believe what I... what I just saw.

114
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:57,318
Man, I really have to patch things up with Murano today.

115
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:09,193
Murano!

116
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:12,465
About the other day,

117
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,562
that was... that was nothing serious.

118
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:17,761
That girl was just...

119
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,569
she was... making fun of me.

120
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:21,944
So, I mean...

121
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:22,733
Shinichi...

122
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:26,170
Jesus, Migi. Now's not the time! Uh...

123
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:31,237
I sense Hideo Shimada projecting murderous intent.

124
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,790
I believe I made myself clear, but if you insist.

125
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,515
I'm sure that you'll agree,

126
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:42,236
we should find somewhere away from prying eyes.

127
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,318
He has four to six targets.

128
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:46,431
Most likely all human.

129
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:49,961
The probability that this will
turn into a massacre is quite high.

130
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,198
Shinichi?

131
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:55,617
If you wish to intervene, I can give you their location.

132
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:57,016
What would you like to do?

133
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,882
What choice do I have?

134
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:01,933
Shinichi?!

135
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,967
Man, I don't think I've ever
met a guy so eager to get pounded.

136
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:16,057
Hmpf! Maybe he doesn't really understand
how much trouble he's actually in here.

137
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,757
Listen up, nobody touches him. I'M takin' him down.

138
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:21,512
It's okay. You can all attack together.

139
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,834
I'm afraid a distraction is on his way here.

140
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:34,374
If you want to do this, do it now.

141
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:35,700
They're right over there.

142
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:43,198
This guy again?!

143
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,570
He just jumped three meters.

144
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:49,056
Is his parasite empowering him? That doesn't make sense.

145
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:52,898
So, Shimada! It looks like you've
finally shown what you really are!

146
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:54,500
Let me guess...

147
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,883
This means that you want to fight me then.

148
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:01,275
Look, I didn't ask to be involved with any of this.

149
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,155
Turns out, I'm the victim here.

150
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:04,919
Aren't I?

151
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,824
You should go.

152
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,301
I'll take care of things around here.

153
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:14,649
Oh? Well, I'll leave it to you then.

154
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,195
You frickin' serious?

155
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:25,408
You're just gonna run away?

156
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,244
Well now, aren't you the big hero?

157
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:31,586
Pretty nice of you to get your ass kicked for you buddy!

158
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:33,699
My "buddy"?

159
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,413
You idiots have no idea what you're getting into.

160
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,995
So, why don't you just go home?

161
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:43,670
And don't ever go after that guy again.

162
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:47,790
I'm talkin' to you.

163
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:52,289
You are the leader of all these guys, aren't you?

164
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:57,285
What the... How did he know that?

165
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:00,231
There's no way he's ever met Yano before.

166
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,207
Heh, what'cha looking at, pretty boy?

167
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:21,440
Morons without a clue shouldn't be mouthing off like that.

168
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:25,990
If they won't listen to reason,
then I'll have to try something else.

169
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:29,778
Let's go!

170
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:33,757
Uh, Yano? Hey, dude, where ya going?

171
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,680
He'd kill me. If we fought, he'd kill me.

172
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:52,880
Murano...

173
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:56,532
Here.

174
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:00,306
Thank you.

175
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,834
What is it?

176
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:10,344
I was curious about what happened to those males.

177
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:12,907
That doesn't concern you anymore.

178
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,269
Did you use your new friend?

179
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:18,368
I imagine you beat them all senseless, didn't you?

180
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,378
I did no such thing!

181
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:22,834
Look! Just go!

182
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:32,945
Ow!

183
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:35,232
Oh! Sorry!

184
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,409
Um, did something happen between you and Shimada?

185
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:42,401
Can't stand that smug bastard!

186
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:45,677
He tries to act like he's all
harmless, but he is full of shit!

187
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:48,141
Shinichi...

188
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:50,783
You're acting different again.

189
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:54,075
And you've never been the type
of person to talk like that.

190
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,334
It's just not right.

191
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:59,320
"Not right"? What do you mean?

192
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,513
Well, it's like...

193
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:05,605
The Shinichi I know just isn't this kind of person.

194
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:10,408
When you act like this, it feels like you're forcing it.

195
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:12,521
Yeah, well, I'm not, okay?

196
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:17,328
Either way, you're a completely
different person than the one I knew.

197
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:22,307
You have changed.

198
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:24,177
I guess that maybe I have.

199
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,715
But still, I'm not forcing it.

200
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,650
So who is it you're trying to be?

201
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,191
You just snap your fingers and change who you are?!

202
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:36,036
Are you...

203
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,880
Are you still...

204
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:39,457
Shinichi?

205
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,712
SHUT UP!

206
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,686
Fine then... I liked you better before.

207
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:03,061
It's because of the hole in my chest, isn't it?

208
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:06,157
Or the hole in your back, depending on your perspective.

209
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:10,137
In my opinion, however, you've
actually grown stronger as a life form,

210
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:11,970
if not so as a person.

211
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:14,964
You're able to maintain your composure.

212
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:18,824
You recover quickly from sways in
mood, and your thoughts are quite logical.

213
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:22,702
When viewed by others, it's no wonder
they would perceive that you've changed.

214
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:25,432
Migi, you don't even know what you're talking about.

215
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:29,514
In any case, this mental
resilience is a definite plus for you.

216
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,472
Is this supposed to be your
attempt at trying to cheer me up?

217
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:39,153
Perhaps. But if need be, I will consider
alternative ways to improve your psyche.

218
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,172
Well, how very nice of you.

219
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,709
I know what I saw...

220
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,650
It was real.

221
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,217
He changed clothes.

222
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,432
Where's he going?

223
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:39,770
Oh, my God, his face...

224
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:46,564
How can he do that?

225
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:49,901
He can turn into someone else?

226
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,290
That's impossible!

227
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:53,986
That's like...

228
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,349
No... It can't be!

229
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:04,507
I'm home.

230
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,157
Oh, hey there, Yuko.

231
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:07,995
Are you still in your school clothes?

232
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,250
I need to ask you something.

233
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:18,154
The truth is, we don't have a
clue what these things really are.

234
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:21,257
Some of the theories are that they could be aliens,

235
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:23,414
or mutants, or even bio-weapons.

236
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:25,736
But there's one thing you do know for sure, right?

237
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,971
That they can change their faces.

238
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,105
Yeah, that's what the witnesses all say.

239
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:35,289
Also, these things can speak our
language, and they kill people for food.

240
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:40,127
Do me a favor, be extra careful
if you're out walking at night.

241
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,160
Now granted, their numbers are relatively
low compared to the whole human race,

242
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:47,059
so it's pretty doubtful you'll
even run into one, but, y'know.

243
00:18:47,165 --> 00:18:49,038
Yeah, I guess so.

244
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:55,445
If only we could just catch one of these things alive.

245
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,589
Killing people for food?

246
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:00,755
Is that what Shimada's doing?

247
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,554
I should tell my brother.

248
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:06,950
But what if it turns out I'm wrong about him?

249
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,450
Okay...

250
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:13,554
I'll just have to ask you myself, Shimada.

251
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:32,901
Hmm...

252
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:35,701
These aren't gonna work.

253
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:41,289
Perfect!

254
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:52,374
So, what did you want to talk to me about?

255
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:54,931
I'm not sure if you know who I am,

256
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:58,535
but I've kinda had my eye on you since you got here.

257
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:00,456
I watch you all the time.

258
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,649
And that's how, well...

259
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:05,835
I saw you.

260
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:11,851
Now I don't wanna believe you're
from another world or anything,

261
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:14,792
but there are some crazy rumors out there.

262
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:16,694
If you really, do, um...

263
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,477
kill people... and... and eat them...

264
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:22,404
Yuko...

265
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:25,200
If... If you do...

266
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:27,546
then I'm asking you to go away.

267
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:28,982
And don't ever...

268
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,716
come back here again.

269
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,463
I... I mean it!

270
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:35,973
I don't want anyone else to get hurt!

271
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,790
Have you told anyone else about this?

272
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:41,182
Tell me!

273
00:20:43,328 --> 00:20:46,267
Do you really do all those
horrible things to people, Shimada?

274
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,103
So you see, modern and classical
Japanese are actually quite different.

275
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,048
You have to learn the rhythm of the verbs in order to...

276
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:00,601
Not good...

277
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:03,534
Not at all.

278
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:06,086
No...

279
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:07,932
Shimada!

280
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:09,379
No...

281
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:22,388
That son of a bitch!

282
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:48,570
Next time: "What Mad Universe"
