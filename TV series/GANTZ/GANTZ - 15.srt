soul's fate is determined.

From here, you shall
rise to heaven

Oh no, not really.
Go on, learned Priest.

00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,333
So what you're saying
is that I'm dead?

'Cause I gotta say,
I sure don't feel dead.

that you just died!

from one of his friends,

Why are you here anyway?

312
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,291
[SEI]
Oh, no particular reason.

313
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,958
It just looks kind of
boring in that room.

314
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,291
I saw your tears...

315
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,041
And the truth is,
they kinda touched me...

316
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,250
So if there's something
bothering you,

317
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,791
I'd like to help if I can.

318
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,208
What I need is to get laid...

319
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,041
Huh? What did you say?

320
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,833
I said "get laid."
That's what I need.

321
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,916
And you said you'd
help me, right?

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,916
[gasps] Oh, come on!
Are you out of your mind?!

323
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,541
Yeah... Right...

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,333
--Okay...
--[KURONO] Huh?!

325
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,041
So do you wanna do it now?

326
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,375
[KONTA] "What you do with your
new lives is for me to decide.

327
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,958
So there you have it."

328
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,750
What in the hell is that shit
s'posed to mean? I don't get it!

329
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,916
The phrase "new lives"
intrigues me...

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,750
What does it mean
by "new lives"?

331
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:23,000
[IKE] Well, I want to know who
this "me" who'll decide is!

332
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,875
[SEI]
No, not there...

333
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,625
--There!
--[KURONO moaning]

334
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,583
[SEI]
Yeah... There.

335
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,916
[BOTH grunting, moaning]

336
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,333
[SEI]
Yes!

337
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,125
[TAMAO]
"Ferocious Alien"?

338
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,958
[KONTA]
I don't get it.

339
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,000
It must mean something...

340
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,375
[TOMAO]
It means this is bullshit!

341
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,958
[IKE] There's a TV show
called "Ferocious Shogun"...

342
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,250
[KATO] That sphere's going
to open up at any second,

343
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,541
so be careful.

344
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,583
[MIYAFUJI] You seem to
know an awful lot here.

345
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,208
Just how do you fit into this?

346
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:05,541
[BOTH grunting, moaning]

347
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,291
[KATO]
It's not just me.

348
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,125
Actually, all of us on this
side of the room know it.

349
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,541
Or to be more precise,
we've been here before.

350
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,791
But I have to warn you that
we only know a little more

351
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,333
about the rules
than you guys do.

352
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,625
[BOTH moaning]

353
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,458
[KURONO groans]

354
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,583
[ALL gasp]

355
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,791
I think you should go
change first this time.

356
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:34,208
[panting]

357
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,250
I've heard of dying and
going to heaven but...

358
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,250
This isn't what I expected.

359
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,875
We're not dead, you know.

360
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah, right. But if I am,
it still felt good as a corpse.

361
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,250
I said we're not dead.

362
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,208
[footsteps]

363
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,708
Now you're dead.

364
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,916
Yeah, but... who cares?

365
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,625
--[SEI moans]
--[KURONO grunts]

366
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:49,541
[TOKUGAWA] To destroy a place of
worship is simply intolerable!

367
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:53,208
This place is neither the
present world nor the next!

368
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:56,583
Hey! What do you think you're
doing?! You can't do that!

369
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:00,041
Next time, "I Will Do It!"
