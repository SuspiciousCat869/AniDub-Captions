[GAME SHOW CONTESTANT] Hey,
can't you give us a good idea?

00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,708
[GAME SHOW HOST] If you
watched the video carefully,

00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,166
then you'd know the answer.

00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,416
I'll repeat the question
one more time. What is...

00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,458
We have to make it
back alive. All of us...

Right. All together!

Okay, one at a time.

No, not really, but I--

[HARUYA]
But what?! Maybe you should stop

Fuck that.

[KISHIMOTO] Please, ma'am.
You really should put them on.

tell us what we're doing here?

I'll tell you once
you're all dressed.

You'll need the suits
to survive what's next.

with a straight face?

But what's more important
is my suit...

00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,583
Um, Kato?

00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,958
[KATO]
Huh?

37
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,708
[TETSUO] So. You're telling
us that we all have to

38
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,458
put on these suits
if we want to survive.

[KATO]
Uh-huh.

But you also said you
aren't the leader here, right?

And what's your point?

Well, I have to make sure these
guys get home safe, y'see?

43
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,208
I guess you could say
I'm their leader.

44
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,708
The rest of you nimrods
can go to hell,

but the four of us
stick together.

And I'm the one who
decides if these three

47

wear the suits or not. And the
next time you order us around...

Then you'll do what?

to say to Tetsu or not?

I'd like you to ask them
to wear the suits.

And that's not an order.

[NISHI] Well, I guess that
takes one out of contention.

159
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,666
'Cause we've got
one dead man already.

160
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,250
Hey! It happened again!

161
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,833
Huh? You mean
the ghost that steals

162
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,666
the plastic prize capsules?

163
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,375
[CLERK A]
Well... Look.

164
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,041
Oh, yeah, right. You opened
them yourself, didn't you?

165
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,250
[CLERK A]
But it's not me!

166
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,791
I don't care about
the candy or the prizes!

167
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm telling you, it's a ghost!

168
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,333
[CLERK B]
Yeah, whatever.

169
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,791
It's on the blink again.

170
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,250
No way.

171
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,625
[CLERK A]
Look! Over there! It's...

172
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,208
[CLERK B] It's from
the last customer, right?

173
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,833
Go ahead and ring it up.

174
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,958
What kind of ghost would pay
for it's stuff and leave?

175
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,875
[CLERK A] I'm telling you,
it's gotta be a ghost!

176
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,791
But where did...

177
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,250
...it go?

178
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,750
[KURONO]
It's at... my place...

179
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,791
I left it there...

180
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,958
What a pussy!

181
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,041
Looks like he's crying!

182
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,041
If they're that important...
you should put them on.

183
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,875
And I told you, we're not
gonna wear that shit!

184
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,791
[KURONO]
If that's the case,

185
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,875
maybe I could steal
one of their suits...

186
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,416
[KATO]
We don't have time for this!

187
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,083
We could be transported
any minute now!

188
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,500
That's right...

189
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,916
For god's sake, why didn't
you say something sooner?

190
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,625
[KURONO] I tried to,
but you wouldn't listen!

191
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,458
[door clatters]

192
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,916
Hey, where ya goin'?

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,333
Heh? I gotta shit for real now.

194
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,625
[KURONO]
All right... Now's my chance!

195
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,291
[KISHIMOTO] You! Isn't
there something we can do?

196
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,291
Right...

197
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,958
[KURONO] Just a little more...

198
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,083
Crap!

199
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,416
[NISHI]
That's theft, you know.

200
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,291
[HARUYA] Hey punk, what in the
hell do you think you're doing?!

201
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,000
It's not like you're
gonna wear it, fat ass!

202
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,833
But that doesn't mean
I'm gonna let you steal it!

203
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,083
[KURONO] That's probably
what would happen.

204
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,458
There's no way
I'd get away with it.

205
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,666
Damn it! I am in such deep
shit, I'm treading water!

206
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,875
[KATO] I'm asking you
nicely... to lend it to Kei.

207
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,125
Huh? Are you outta
your fucking mind?

208
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,000
[KURONO]
Kato...

209
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,708
C'mon. If you don't want it,
then there's no reason

210
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,750
you can't lend it
to him, now is there?

211
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,208
Like hell! It's mine, asshole!

212
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,000
Just let him borrow it, Haruya.

213
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,875
Don't tell me what to do!

214
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,250
Even if I don't wear it,
it's still mine.

215
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,791
Your butt-buddy's outta luck!

216
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,500
But if you don't--

217
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,625
[NISHI]
It's no use.

218
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,625
[KATO]
Huh?

219
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:46,250
Another person's suit
wouldn't do you any good.

220
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:50,416
[KURONO] If that's the case...
then I really am a dead man!

221
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,833
There's got to be something...

222
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,125
Some way for Kei
to survive this thing!

223
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,375
I wouldn't tell you
even if I did know.

224
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,625
Is there? Is there
a way?! Tell me!

225
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,833
You mean "Please
tell me," don't you?

226
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,666
All right. Please tell me.

227
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,375
I dunno... Should I?

228
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,458
Stop jerking my chain!
Tell me now!

229
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,708
Oh, die with dignity.

230
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:15,916
You son of a--

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,833
You're dead! Every last
one of you is dead!

232
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:30,250
But can you really
trust me? Huh?

233
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,916
Why, you stupid little shit!
Hey, let go of me!

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,833
Ow! What in the fucking hell
is in those gloves?!

235
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,041
[NISHI]
God, you're fucking pathetic.

236
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,708
Even if you are dead,
with human refuse like you,

237
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,166
it wouldn't make any difference
at all in the real world.

238
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,500
So there's no point in
moaning and whining

239
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:55,291
about who lives or who dies.
It just doesn't matter.

240
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,083
So what you mean is,
that you're dead, too?

241
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,916
Who cares? The people here
aren't your teammates,

242
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,333
so there's no need
for a leader.

243
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,875
The truth is we're
nothing but rivals...

244
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,625
All of us competing
for survival.

245
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,041
Did you hear that,
Mr. Let's-All-Make-It-Back?

246
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:16,000
It's just bullshit! And you're
still nothing but a hypocrite.

247
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,916
Last time, you
head-butted a Yakuza

248
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,166
and nearly choked him
to death, didn't you?!

249
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,625
Why would someone who wants
all of us to make it back

250
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,500
do something like that?
Who are you kidding?!

251
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,500
They call those "violent
impulses," you know.

252
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,000
Can't you use that
thick head for thinking?

253
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,041
Or would you rather just hit
people with it?

254
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,416
And you, Tit-Girl!

255
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,916
Me what?!

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,125
"Isn't there something
we can do?"

257
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,291
That kinda shit
really pisses me off.

258
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,833
As if shaking those money-makers
means we're gonna do

259
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,708
whatever you say.

260
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:50,041
Face it... A woman like you
is as helpless as a little baby.

261
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,208
You can't do anything
for yourself, can you?

262
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,250
But if you get in trouble,
you can just wave

263
00:15:55,333 --> 00:16:00,541
a tit at him, right? That's what
you think, isn't it? Isn't it?!

264
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,708
[NISHI]
And you, Mr. Boner!

265
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,750
[gasps]

266
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,708
Are you that scared
of dying again?

267
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,541
You oughta be ashamed,
crying like that.

268
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,708
Remember how I thought you had a
little bit of potential

269
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:17,541
last time? I was wrong. You
should be the first one to die.

270
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,958
Why?! And so what
if I was afraid?!

271
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,708
[NISHI] I'm telling you,
it's disgraceful.

272
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,208
That kinda shit doesn't
phase me at all.

273
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,333
[wails]

274
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,166
Hey, you little brat! Shut up!

275
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,875
I'm sorry, but do you think
you could keep it down a bit?!

276
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,750
Hmph. You two are practically
pre-filled body bags.

277
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,291
You have no chance of
surviving on your own.

278
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,875
Oh dear...

279
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,541
You're just like Tits here.

280
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:47,125
Dead meat for sure unless
you rely on somebody else.

281
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:51,375
And who will you depend on?
It's not gonna be me, Grandma.

282
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,583
And since we're on that subject!

283
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,791
You spoil that grandchild
of yours rotten

284
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,083
without thinking about
the consequences.

285
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,041
You think it's okay to
warp his personality

286
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,083
just because he's cute? Huh?!

287
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,500
You know he won't grow up
to be a respectable adult,

288
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,500
but that's not your problem,
because you'll be dead by then,

289
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,583
won't you?! So that
makes it okay to let

290
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:14,250
a spoiled, rotten egg stink up
society, huh? Am I wrong? Am I?!

291
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,291
Honestly, this isn't even funny.

292
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,875
What's funny is these bikers
ass fucking each other

293
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,916
--over who's the boss!
--Say what?!

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,166
Heh! You're just
a bunch of punks.

295
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,250
The garbage of society. Hah!

296
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,875
And then you go on and on

297
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,208
with all this stupid
"I'm the leader" bullshit!.

298
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,166
Who's the king of the
trash pile? Who cares?!

299
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,291
You're still garbage!

300
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,166
And you. I bet you're the type
all the girls go crazy for.

301
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,833
But is there a
single thing going on

302
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,458
underneath that
trendy hairstyle?

303
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,541
Tell me, do you even know
what the internet is?

304
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,625
Have you ever used a
cell phone for anything

305
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,000
but chatting with girls?

306
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,791
I'm not an idiiot.

307
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:56,416
No? Then let me ask you
a question, smart guy:

308
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,125
When you read a newspaper,
where do you start?

309
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,125
[HOJO]
The TV listings, of course.

310
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,875
[NISHI] Are you kidding me?!
You really are an idiot!

311
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,250
Still, I guess you're better
off than the biker trash.

312
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,458
Those morons probably
can't even read the paper.

313
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,666
[gasps]

314
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,125
What the fuck?

315
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,541
So did ya hit him?

316
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,208
I-I don't know. It just
made some weird noise.

317
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But it doesn't matter if
this stupid piece of shit

318
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,208
works or not. I'll fuck you up!

319
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,125
Stop waving it around! No!

320
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,458
Oh, shit!

321
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,250
[KOSUKE yells]

322
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:54,791
Oh, you didn't just fucking
shoot at me! Did you?!

323
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,666
Aw, man. That
thing's just a toy.

324
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,791
Oh yeah? You just watch!

325
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,583
There's always a time lag!

326
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,125
[whimpers]

327
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,291
Don't you fuck with us,
you little shit-wad

328
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:16,458
[screaming]

329
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,416
[RYOTA sobs]

330
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,291
Listen, assholes.

331
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,625
That's what happens when you
point a gun at me! Got it?!

332
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,958
And what's more, I'll snuff you
without a moment's hesitation!

333
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,875
Any of you! Imprint that
on your tiny brain stems!

334
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,125
And if any of you
cretins slow me down,

335
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,833
I'll kill you without
a shred of remorse.

336
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,791
Especially you.

337
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,125
Look at that. She's
relying on you already.

338
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,791
[KATO] I don't get it. How come
nothing happened to you

339
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,166
when you were shot?!

340
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,500
[NISHI] I'm not answering
anymore questions.

341
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,875
[KATO]
Was it your suit?

342
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,000
Gantz!

343
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,750
Hurry up and get on
with this already!

344
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,291
What are you waiting for?!

345
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,291
[gasps]

346
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,750
Kei!

347
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,000
Huh?!

348
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,083
[KURONO screams]

349
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,125
[KURONO]
Straight from the get-go!

350
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:43,208
[mechanical whirring]

351
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,000
[screeching]

352
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,333
[TETSUO]
Who the hell is that?

353
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,041
Huh? What are you
staring at me for?

354
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,500
I see, you're a robot,
aren't you?

355
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,125
You're one hell
of a piece of work.

356
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,375
Next time: "Yuzo."
