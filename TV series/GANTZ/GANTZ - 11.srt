must've burst.

It doesn't make any sense.

Maybe there are more of them.

But... How can we be sure?

What about that
radar device that he had?

224

I bet that's it;
he should still have it.

one of these?

You mean you have one, too?

229

on?! Kinji's head got blown off!

And he didn't even get
near that fuckin' alien!

we couldn't go back
