00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,250
I can't imagine
beating this guy,

but I know I can
get away from him!

make it out of this with just

two or three broken bones,
I'll be lucky...

What...?

00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,416
You want me to
shoot him... with this?

That's right. With that.

275
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,541
And if I do, what then?

00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,333
You'll see. Just do it.

In order to save one life,

286
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,625
you must throw
another life away.

287
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:53,166
And to throw that
life away, you must kill.
