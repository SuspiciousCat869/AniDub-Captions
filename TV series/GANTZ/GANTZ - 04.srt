1
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,500
[KURONO]
Drop your stuff!

2
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,083
[KATO]
I've got to keep the umbrella!

3
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,583
[KURONO]
Huh?! Are you out of your mind?!

4
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,708
[KATO]
It's for my kid brother!

5
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,125
He went to school without one!

6
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,583
Oh, fu--!

7
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,291
Wouldn't you love...
to kill him?

8
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,333
[KURONO gasps]

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,583
[KISHIMOTO]
Huh...?

10
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,041
[gasps]

11
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,166
[NISHI]
C'mon, hurry it up!

12
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,625
[NISHI] He had no problem
killing the others, right?

13
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,000
Including your
boyfriend over there.

14
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,541
Just look...

15
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,625
No!

16
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,166
[KURONO whimpers]

17
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,583
[yells]

18
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,875
[NISHI] C'mon!
What're you waiting for?!

19
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,958
Are you some kind of pinhead?

20
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,625
He's not human.

21
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,125
He's more like...
a dangerous animal

22
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,291
and you're doing
a public service.

23
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,541
And the suit makes it feel
all the better right?

24
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,875
Don't deny it. You can do
all these amazing moves.

25
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,041
It feels good...

26
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,791
[KURONO]
You saw that? You were there?

27
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,958
[NISHI] I told you
I was hangin' out.

28
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,833
I saw you goin' at it.

29
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,583
It feels good destroying
things, doesn't it?

30
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,083
The suit makes
you feel stronger.

31
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,583
[KURONO]
What the hell are you implying?!

32
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,666
[NISHI]
Oh, come on! Just admit it.

33
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,916
Beating the crap out of
this creep felt awesome.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,750
It was better
than sex, wasn't it?!

35
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:37,000
[KURONO] Oh no...
Don't look at me like that.

36
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,041
Stop looking at me! Please...

37
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,208
That isn't true!

38
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,750
I-It wasn't like that!

39
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,458
It turned you on, didn't it?
How 'bout corpses? Pictures...?

40
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,125
I'm not like that you freak!

41
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,125
I may buy girlie mags and
watch porn, but that's it!

42
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,500
All that crap
you're talking about

43
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,208
is way too sick
and twisted for me!

44
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,875
Oh, god, what am I saying?!

45
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,583
[NISHI]
Yep. Knew it.

46
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,166
I could see it.

47
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,250
In your eyes from the moment
I first saw you across the room.

48
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,875
You're just like me...

49
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,500
Deep down you really
wanna see it.

50
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,500
[NISHI]
So here's your chance.

51
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,375
The real thing.

52
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,375
Death.

53
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,750
[KURONO]
No. I don't...

54
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,916
I... don't...

55
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,708
I do not!

56
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,666
You lie.

57
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,041
And don't compare me to you.

58
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,666
All that's different is
that you're in denial.

59
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,041
Just another hypocrite.

60
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,875
[KURONO]
A hypocrite?

61
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,875
I'm not sure what you mean...

62
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,375
...but I sure as hell
don't want someone like you

63
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,291
calling me that,
you sick, little freak!

64
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,833
I guess you're not as
smart as I thought you were.

65
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,250
What a disappointment.

66
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,500
At least my view of the world

67
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,458
didn't come out of comic
books and video games.

68
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,291
You're living in a fantasy!

69
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,250
You just don't get it, do you?

70
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,250
If I were like that, I wouldn't
have survived in this world

71
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,041
for as long as I have...

72
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,166
[KURONO]
What does that mean?

73
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,583
[NISHI]
Oh... nothing.

74
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,291
[KURONO]
Oh yeah. Play dumb, again!

75
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,625
That's what you do whenever
something's important, isn't it?

76
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,125
[NISHI]
Not really.

77
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,291
[NISHI]
Okay, to prove that

78
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,958
I'm not caught up in
that stupid fantasy crap,

79
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,875
let's talk about
something that's real.

80
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,916
Just... what do
you mean by real?

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,416
For example, let's say
that there's someone

82
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,875
about to die right
before your eyes.

83
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,833
Someone who there's no point
in even trying to rescue

84
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,458
because they're going
to die at any moment.

85
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,458
That's something that
we could all witness

86
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,666
in our everyday lives, right?

87
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,250
Perhaps in something
like a horrible

88
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,291
traffic or train accident.

89
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:42,000
Now, in that situation, what's
the first thing you think of?

90
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,083
That you've got to find
a way to rescue them?

91
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,208
Yeah, right.
You're first thought is

92
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,833
"I might be able to
see someone die today."

93
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:53,125
And it's not just freaks who
think that way; it's everybody.

94
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,041
It doesn't matter whether
it's a plane crash or a war.

95
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,833
When you see that
stuff on the news

96
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,958
your heart is
pounding, isn't it?

97
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,416
Why is it, I wonder...
that the news programs ratings

98
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,208
always go up when they
run stories like that?

99
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,250
It's because it's
just human nature.

100
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,333
They're all secretly
hoping they'll get a chance

101
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,958
to see a dead body.

102
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,291
It's an excitement
that defies all logic.

103
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,708
You're sick!
A sick little freak!

104
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,750
[NISHI]
Like I care...

105
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,500
You see, when I jumped,

106
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,958
I realized that it's
all the same in the end.

107
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:29,208
[KURONO] If this is the
way it's gotta be...

108
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,625
[NISHI]
You know I'm right, don't you?

109
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,291
In the end even
death is no big deal.

110
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,291
And I'm perfectly
fine with that.

111
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,750
Sure you are!

112
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,458
But you're only able
to talk so tough

113
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,500
because you're still alive!

114
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,916
And what makes you
think we're alive?

115
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,708
[NISHI] It just doesn't
make a difference.

116
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,583
I really was going let
you score the points

117
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,458
for shooting him, you know...

118
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,375
[NISHI]
Oh well. Whatever.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,291
[yelling]

120
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,333
[NISHI] Strangely beautiful,
don't you think?

121
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,583
This is what death is like.

122
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,583
[NISHI]
The gun that transports them...

123
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,916
...is the gun that kills them.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,500
Transports them? But, where?

125
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,000
[NISHI]
Where? Somewhere there.

126
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,000
[KURONO]
So, you know all about this?

127
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:52,375
Well, I don't know everything.
But, I know more than you.

128
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,708
Oh, do you. So what's next?

129
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,750
[NISHI]
First we return to the room.

130
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,791
[KURONO]
And then what?

131
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,541
[NISHI]
Then you're free to go.

132
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,750
You can even go
home if you like.

133
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,083
[KURONO gasps]

134
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,250
We can go home?! You mean,
we're not really dead?

135
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,166
[NISHI]
No, we're alive.

136
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,083
Just wait, you'll see.

137
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,166
[KURONO]
We can go home?!

138
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,583
We can really go home?!
I didn't--

139
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:22,416
[KISHIMOTO whimpers]
No! Kato!

140
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,083
Hold on please!

141
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,333
Kato!

142
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,708
[KURONO] Nishi! We were
brought back once! Can't we--

143
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,250
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,583
But only those who're still
alive at the end of the mission

145
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,000
can return to the room.

146
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:42,166
[KURONO] But-But if he's
not-not dead yet! Kato! Kato!

147
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,500
[KISHIMOTO]
Kato, please!

148
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,875
Did you hear him?
We can go home!

149
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,208
It's over!

150
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,041
[KURONO]
God. Listen to her.

151
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,916
And this is a girl
who puked on me!

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,500
[NISHI]
Hey, he's a lost cause.

153
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,000
No, he's not!

154
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,750
Actually, the sad thing is,
it doesn't matter how badly

155
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,291
your body's been hurt
if you survive the game.

156
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,916
If you make it back alive,
it's all fixed.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,208
Yeah, right!

158
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,791

Uh. Wait a second.

255
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,958

256
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,583
Why did all this happen?

00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,125

You said "fire away,"
didn't you?!

I can't answer vague
questions like that

because I only know limited
details about the situation.

Why you--!

272
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,125
The truth is I'm just an
ordinary middle school student.

273
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,333
I first came to this
room a year ago.

274
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,375
Don't you see?

275
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,000
C'mon, use your imagination!

276
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,416
The truth is... that I don't
know when this was all started,

277
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,791
but I've had to live through
many nights like this.

278
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,583
And long before I came here,

279
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,458
this room was bringing people
together a few at a time,

280
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,958
people who should've
been dead by all accounts.

281
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,583
And if they happen to die
during the course of a mission,

282
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,791
it brings in others
to replace them.

283
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,291
In the year since my first game,

284
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,375
I've seen dozens like you die.

285
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:02,708
I've seen people die in
the most spectacular ways.

286
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:06,791
While I've managed to
survive through it all.

all the people who've died.

295
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,625
[NISHI] They were a particularly
dumb bunch, of course.

296
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,333
But you fortunately were
different from them.

297
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,125
You realized the importance
of the suit as if by instinct,

298
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,125
and that's why you survived.

299
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,750
[KURUNO] It's his
calmness pisses me off.

300

Is he really still--?

301
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,250
[KATO]
So why didn't you tell us?!

302
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,500
If you had explained all
of this at the beginning,

303
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,416
then more of us
might have survived!

304
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,291
In fact you intentionally fed us

305
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,333
a story that was
completely false!

Why didn't you tell
us what was going on?

312

Because I knew that
while they were dying,

313
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,250
the target would drop its guard.

Next question. A while ago,
you said that we were alive.

348
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,583
But, if we were alive, then
why couldn't anyone see us,

349
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,083
or anyting that we did.
It was like we were ghosts.

350
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:59,083
So, I'm going to ask you
once more. Are we really alive?

351
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,125
[NISHI]
Yes, we are.

You're not shitting us?

were rescued just moments

supposed to die.

Is that what you want me to say?

356
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,708
Is it true?

357
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,708
[NISHI] It could be. The way
I see it, there was a person,

358
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,416
an original. But that
original really is dead.
