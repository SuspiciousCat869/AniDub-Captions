00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:13,333
[FEMALE TEACHER] So, if triangle
ABC is a right triangle,

2
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,541
and AC equals one,

3
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:20,750
then BC equals the square root
of three, and AB equals two.

4
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:26,708
This also means that BA
equals DB, and BD equals two.

5
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,625
And since triangle BAD
is an isosceles triangle,

6
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,458
it also follows that its
base angles are equal.

7
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:38,916
So BDA equals BAD.

8
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,125
Therefore, BDA is--

9
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,166
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
Teacher!

10
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,333

Man, you're such a horn dog!

14
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,500
Is making it with a girl
the only thing you think about?

Ha, ha! Shut your hole,

You just wish I did... ho!

stand up and prove you don't!

All right class, that's enough!

Ah. Yes, ma'am?

Damn! His office closes at five.

What'll I do?

At this rate, my husband

me, young man,

Is this the right platform
for the train to Hinodedai?

have to ask me, Grandma?

Sorry, Granny, I may look nice,

that most people

just aren't worth my time.
Like those two--

I bet they've never had a
single deep thought between 'em.

and social climbers.

away from someone like him,

the better...

always play together.

00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,083
You've probably heard of me.

309
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,375
[KURONO]
Heh, yeah, right.

310
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,625
And... you?

311
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,041
Dude. I told you.
Not playing. Pass.

312
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,083
[KURONO] Oh, sure,
make me look like an idiot

313
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,375
for going along with this crap!
Introduce yourself, you ass!

314
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,666
Hey, anyone got any smokes?

315
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,708
[KURONO] And I bet you
smoke like a girl, too.

316
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,666
I'm Joichiro Nishi.
Eighth grade. And I fell.

317
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,583
[KURONO]
What a freak.

318
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,541
And why are you staring at me,
you little psycho?

319
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,583
Okay, no one's got
any cigarettes then?

320
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,375
[YAMADA]
All right, good. And...

321
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,250
Um... next?

322
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,625
Um, please, sir?

323
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:47,041
[YOSHIOKA] He's a Yakuza.
Like me. No more questions.

324
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:51,583
[YAMADA]
Oh. Okay. Is that everyone?

325
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,875
[DOG panting]

326
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,958
I guess so...

327
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,333
[DOG whines]

328
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,125
[KATO] Kei, there's something
different about you.

329
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,000
[KURONO] Yeah? Besides being
dead like you, you mean?

330
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,458
The Kei I remember
had more of an edge.

331
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,958
Back when we were kids...

332
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,291
...I didn't think there was
anything you were afraid of.

333
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,375
That's why we thought
of you as our leader.

334
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,541
Me? Your leader?

335
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,375
[KURONO]
Oh, man, when was that?

336
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,333
Either you're laying it on thick
or my memory's fucked.

337
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,833
What caused that change?

338
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,416
[KURONO]
Well, you've changed a lot, too.

339
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,208
Yes, but remember those
games of tag we used to play?

340
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,583
Yeah...

341
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,500
[KATO] Whether you were
running away or chasing us,

342
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,166
you were so fast it was amazing.

343
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,833
I remember how you'd jump down
a whole flight of stairs.

344
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,375
Okay, enough!

345
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:40,208
Oh, and there was one time,
it was totally awesome...

346
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,875
I don't remember exactly why,

347
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,541
but all the tough kids from
school had you cornered.

348
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,291
And you just jumped off the
overpass and landed on the roof

349
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,958
of a passing truck!

350
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,375
It just blew me away,
and I remember thinking,

351
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,208
"I wanna be like him."

352
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,458
So, when my grades went south

353
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,250
and I got sent to the school
with all the hoods and punks.

354
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,500
I patterned everything
I did after you.

355
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,666
[KURONO]
Oh, give me a break!

356
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,625
Are you trying to
tell me it's my fault

357
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,166
you turned out like this?

358
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,416
[KATO] Huh?! Kei, are you
seeing what I'm seeing?!

359
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,583
Ah! What the fuck?!

360
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,333
[YAMADA] I don't believe it!
Here comes another one!

361
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,375
[INAMORI]
Yeah! Looks like a girl!

362
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,000
Do you think...
this is how we got here?

363
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,666
Kei, is she...?

364
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,125
Not now!

365
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,458
[KURONO] Oh, jeez, I will
not get a stiffie, I will--

366
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,916
Aw, fuck!

367
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,375
[INAMORI chuckles]

368
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:47,291
Yeah! These coochie shots are
all going up on my web page.

369
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,458
[INAMORI] Hey! Hey!
What do you think you're doing?!

370
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,791
You're blockin' my view!

371
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,125
[YAMADA]
Uh, excuse me,

372
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,458
but I don't think you
should be doing that!

373
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,791
[KURONO]
Mmm?

374
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,416
Uh! But I... just...

375
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,833
[INAMORI]
You're just what, peckerhead?!

376
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,125
Hey! She's bleeding!

377
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,750
But... there aren't
any cuts on her wrists.

378
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,000
Do you see this, Kei?

379
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,625
[YAMADA] A suicide.
In the bathtub I guess.

380
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,458
Is she alive?

381
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,375
Yeah, I can hear her heartbeat.

382
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,625
[YAMADA]
Um, you know...

383
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,833
Y-You could have checked
her pulse at the wrist.

384
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,250
Oh, yeah...

385
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,916
[INAMORI] Yeah, so stop
playing musical crotch with her,

386
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,333
you sleaze.

387
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:29,166
What? Why can't she...
I mean... couldn't we... just...

388
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,083
[DOG panting]

389
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,916
[INAMORI]
Yoo-hoo!

390
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,541
What's... happening?
What's going on...?

391
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,833
[KURONO] What's with her?
Does she think she's dreaming?

392
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,291
I know I do.

393
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,125
You stay here... All of you!

394
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,000
[KURONO]
Stay here? But...

395
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,041
Oh, hell, don't tell me
you're gonna--

396
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,708
Holy shit!

Stop!

00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,041
[KURONO] I know I should help
her, but what's the point?

403
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,583
Who in the hell could go up
against that monster?!

No! Please!

NO!

[INAMORI]
That's not a good idea...

409
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,375
[KISHIMOTO]
Nooo!

410
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,541
It's hard to find such a brave
young man these days.

411
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,333
Hey, I don't see
you helping her!

412
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,833
Because that yakuza would
kick my cancer-filled ass.

Just back off and I'll let go!

Otherwise I'm gonna keep
squeezing until something gives!

he's gonna kill him!

won't do it again!

[KURONO]
Do you remember who you were?

437
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,583
When darkness spawns monsters in
the middle of a neighborhood,

438
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:55,666
when the targets snarl in fury
and blood covers the streets,

439
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,666
could your old self have
faced... the fangs of darkness?
