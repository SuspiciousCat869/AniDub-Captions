Uh...

162
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,875
Do you want something?

163
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,958
Well, I've never done something
like this before, but...

164
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,916
Uh... I kind of like you, and...

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,125
[KISHIMOTO sighs]

166
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,791
Please wait!

167
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,333
[KISHIMOTO]
Are you... hitting on me?

168
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:52,250
Uh, no. It's just... I usually
don't do stuff like this...

169
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,416
I mean, I...

170
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,833
[KISHIMOTO]
What's your name?

171
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,708
Uh--

172
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,500
You have one, don't you?

173
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,916
Uh... Um... Kurono. Kei Kurono.

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,208
It's Kei?

175
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,708
Yeah. Just like yours, right?

176
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,250
[gasps]

177
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:12,250
Hang on... And just exactly
how do you know my name is Kei?

178
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,375
[KURONO]
Uh... Um...

179
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,708
[KISHIMOTO]
Do you know my last name?

180
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,291
[KURONO]
It's Kishimoto.

181
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,583
[gasps]

182
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,958

Mom! Mom!

184
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,708
[KURONO]
Wait!

185
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,750
You look exactly like this girl
I used to live with!

186
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,416
This girl I knew used to live
with me at my apartment.

187
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,291
She was great and...
I liked her, but...

188
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,458
But then she...

189
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,125
One day, she was killed.

190
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,916
And I... look like her...?

191
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,750
And have the same name...?

192
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:00,333
That's just creepy!
Let alone impossible!

193
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,875
[KURONO]
Yeah... You're right.

194
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,541
[KURONO]
It sounds creepy as hell.

--[YOSHINO] Kurono!
--[gasps]

197
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,541
If you know
what's going on here,

198
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,458
just explain it to us now.

199
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,583
And not one more word
about my affair, got it?

200
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,166
[KURONO] I can't explain it
as well as Kato did.

201
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,833
Well, let's see...

202
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,291
That black ball is gonna open

203
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,750
and there'll be all
these weapons inside.

204
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,791
[BUSINESSMAN]
Weapons?

205
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,291
[FURUTA]
What do you mean, "weapons"?

206
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,666
Big guns.

207
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,916
You mean the real kind
you shoot people with?

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,916
[KURONO]
Yeah.

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,083
Kurono, what are
you talking about?

210
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,666
That doesn't make any sense.

211
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,750
No, what doesn't make sense
is that it'll tell us

212
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,083
to go out and kill some aliens,
and we'll go out and do it.

213
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:03,791
[BUSINESSMAN]
Huh?

214
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,291
Oh, please.

215
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,000
You're talking about some
dumb-ass roleplaying game shit,

216
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,041
--ain'tcha kid?
--[chuckles]

217
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,166
I'm sorry to interrupt this
fascinating conversation,

218
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,041
but I think it's time
to go home now.

219
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,041
I'm not lying.

220
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,541
And if we don't
kill them, we die.

221
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,833
Um, now that you mention it,
didn't we all come to this place

222
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,958
after... uh... passing away?

223
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,083
But no matter how you look at
it, we're obviously alive now.

224
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,708
[TEENAGER] Yeah, man.
I can see Tokyo Tower.

225
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,125
That's right.

226
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,708
It's rather hard to think
that we're actually dead.

227
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,416
So, what's really
going on here, Kurono?

228
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,833
I told you.

229
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,375
[KURONO] Dammit, Kato,
I'm not good at this kinda shit.

230
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,250
What should I do next?
They don't believe me!

231
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,958
[FURUTA]
Look, why don't we just go ahead

232
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,541
and introduce ourselves.

233
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,833
We could explain how we died,
the circumstances, the places,

234
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,250
and whatnot, and then
we might be able to piece

235
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:59,083
all this together, right?
I'll even go first, okay?

236
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,166
I'm Giichi Furuta, age 50.

237
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,500
I run a bookstore
by the train station.

238
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,625
--And I died when I was hit by--
--But did you really die?

239
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,125
How should I know?! That's why
we're trying to get to

240
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,208
the bottom of this whole mess!

241
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,833
Anyway, I died in a car
accident. I got hit by a car

242
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,083
while I was chasing a
shoplifter. So who's next?

243
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,791
How 'bout you? The one
who was having the affair.

244
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,041
Who, me?

245
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,750
This is the only way
to find out the truth.

246
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,416
You don't need to go
into any sorta details.

247
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,083
Yoshino Uehara. I'm 26.

248
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,291
[KURONO] What?! You're 29 if
you're a day, you fuckin' liar!

249
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,083
[YOSHINO]
I teach high school mathematics,

250
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,375
and I'm also his
homeroom teacher.

251
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,958
His name is Kurono, a tenth
grader, and a poor student.

252
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,416
And how did you die?

253
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,625
Uh... Well, that's really...
kinda touchy...

254
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,666
I think I got stabbed,
but I'm not sure.

255
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,833
[KURONO]
Because you were

256
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,750
porking someone else's
husband maybe?

257
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,250
I'm Daichi Nozaki,
and I drowned.

258
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,333
[FURUTA]
And you're how old?

259
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,333
Seventeen. Unemployed.

260
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,208
Well, in that case,
shouldn't you be in school?

261
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,208
[NOZAKI] That's none of your
goddamn business, is it, baldy?!

262
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,791
Ryuji Kajiura.
Twenty-eight years old.

263
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,375
I do some odd jobs
here and there.

264
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:18,708
The kid's Hajime Muroto. He's
16. I'm... taking care of him.

265
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,791
I guess you could say
that I'm his guardian.

266
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,125
I'm pleased to
meet you, everyone.

267
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,083
[KURONO]
He's my age?

268
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,291
[MUROTO] I died in an accident.
A car accident.

269
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,208
Oh, the same as me, huh?

270
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,291
Do you suppose that
they could be related?

271
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,375
[FURUTA]
Hmm... well...

272
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,250
Um, can I say something here?

273
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,666
[FURUTA]
Sure, go ahead.

274
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,375
I've got the feeling that
maybe we really are dead,

275
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,000
and I've got proof.

276
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,708
For months, I've been
followed by some guy

277
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:48,166
who's been stalking me. He
stabbed me a little while ago.

278
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,416
When he attacked me,
I fought as hard as I could,

279
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,625
but his knife...

280
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,833
Look at this book.

281
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,375
[gasping]

282
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,208
His knife must've gone through
the book when he stabbed me.

283
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:05,166
Isn't that some kind of proof?
I know it's just a book, but...

284
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,750
But if I'm not dead,
then why would I be

285
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,916
carrying something like this
around with me?

286
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,875
Oh, and I'm Miki Kanda.

287
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,875
I'm 20 and a college student.

288
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,583
Ah... So in that case,
we would have a total of

289
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:20,333
two car accidents--no, make that
three car accidents--

290
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:24,041
two stabbings, and a drowning.

291
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,291
I wonder if the car accidents
and the stabbings

292
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,875
are connected somehow.

293
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,791
[YOSHINO] What about you,
Kurono? How did you end up here?

294
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,583
A few weeks ago,
I got hit by a subway train.

295
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,750
Kurono, you've been at
school every single day!

296
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,291
That can't be possible.
Now, stop this outrageous lying!

297
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,750
I'm telling the truth!

298
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,000
And didn't I tell you that
you wouldn't understand it?!

299
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,000
[BUSINESSMAN] Um, excuse me,
but I should mention

300
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,208
that I jumped in front
of a subway train, too.

301
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,500
[gasps]

302
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,958
Um, my name's Naozumi Saito.
I just turned 38,

303
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,375
and up until last year,
was employed by one of Japan's

304
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:00,166
most prestigious banks.
Well, it's kind of embarrassing,

305
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,958
but I got rightsized, so I
started a business of my own,

306
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,583
and got into debt.

307
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,125
Well, a pair of bill
collectors were after me,

308
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:12,416
so I jumped off the platform
in front of the express.

309
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,583
But since I've been here, I
mean, aside from wondering about

310
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,958
what's really going on,
I'm actually kinda relieved.

311
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,875
All I care about is that
I don't have to run

312
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,375
from those
bill collectors anymore.

313
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,458
I shoulda done it months ago!

314
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,333
[gasps]

315
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,916
[screams]

316
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,458
[SAITO]
Of course, the weirdest thing is

317
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,708
how calm I feel about it.

318
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,666
You! Wipe that
smile off your face!

319
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,791
[SAITO]
W-W-What the...?

320
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,916
I'm sick of listening to you!
It makes me sick!

321
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,166
Wh... Are you crazy?!

322
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,875
Leave him alone, Kurono!
Knock it off!

323
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:54,000
[SAITO whimpers]

324
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,958
Kurono! I want you to put
that man down, right now!

325
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,750
You killed yourself,
didn't you, you coward?!

326
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,625
Yeah, sure! I guess so.

327
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,500
Well, you got your fucking wish.

328
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,750
But as everyone who comes
in here gets killed,

329
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:10,166
every single one of 'em,
you have no idea how many!

330
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,916
Some of them got here by
killing themselves like you,

331
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,833
but they changed! They tried
to find a way back, but...

332
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,291
...they still died!
They tried to escape!

333
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:24,916
To find a way out!
But they all died anyway!

334
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,166
From now on, you keep
your fucking mouth shut!

335
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,708
You got that?!

336
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,916
Right! I apologize! [yelps]

337
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,750
[KURONO] Whether you wanna
believe it or not,

338
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,500
a massacre is about to begin.
And when it does start,

339
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,416
I guarantee that some
of us are going to die.

340
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,041
I thought we were already dead.

341
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,916
[KURONO]
Shut up! Shut up and listen!

342
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,708
If you wanna survive, I can try
to help you!

343
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:58,250
But I can't help you unless
you're prepared.

344
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:03,500
Okay. So we just have to follow
your lead on this, right?

345
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,125
[KURONO]
Uh... Yeah.

346
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,333
Well, now... I'll be the first
to admit

347
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,625
I don't understand all this,

348
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,916
but I don't think
he's making it up.

349
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,416
All right then, Kurono.

350
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,625
Now, I'm not saying
I'm buying this completely,

351
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:19,958
but just to be sure, what should
we expect to happen next?

352
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,083
Let's see... First--

353
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,041
[music starts playing]

354
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,583
[gasping]

355
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,916
All right, Gantz.
What alien is it now?!

356
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,875
No matter what you bring on,
I'll fucking kill it!

357
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,250
Come on, show me now!
Which alien is it, Gantz?!

358
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,666
[gasping]

359
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,083
What in the fuck...?

360
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,250
Me?

361
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,250
That can't be right!

362
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,416
[NOZAKI] Okay, it's not like
he's done anything bad.

363
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,333
He did tell us
about the weapons,

364
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,291
the aliens, and everything.

365
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,833
But... it looks like
we won't be able to go home

366
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,125
unless we kill this guy, right?

367
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,291
Next episode, "Kurono Alien."
