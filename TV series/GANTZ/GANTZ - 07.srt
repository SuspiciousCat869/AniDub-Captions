[REPORTER]
This morning, once again,

2
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,583
we have a special follow-up

3
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,708
on those two missing
high school boys.

4
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,625
[AYUMU]
Okay, see you later!

5
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:53,458
[KATO]
See ya!

6
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,250
[AYUMU laughs]

7
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,125
[REPORTER] The two boys
suddenly disappeared

8
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,458
in the subway.

9
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,208
Since then, we've been
looking into this incident

10
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,125
from every possible angle.

11
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,250
However, the identities of the
two missing high school boys

12
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,708
have yet to be determined.

13
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,458
If you want to know my opinion

14
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,208
of most of these high school
students today...

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,708
...they're nothing more
than a bunch of

16
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,875
good-for-nothing degenerates!

17
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,625
Two punks disappear, and now
that's all they can talk about!

18
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,708
It's outrageous!
Simply dreadful.

19
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,166
[REPORTER] However,
we believe that by tracing

20
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,708
the sales receipts of
the adult magazine...

21
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,416
[KATO'S AUNT]
And I'd better not find out

22
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,625
that you're up to
anything strange like that.

23
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,041
I refuse to let you bring
that kind of shame

24
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,458
down on this house.

25
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,833
[KATO]
Excuse me...

26
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,125
[KATO] Could we
please eat something now?

27
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,166
[KATO'S AUNT]
What?! Don't make me laugh!

28
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,875
Do you have any idea why
I made you sit down there?!

29
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:58,666
This little monster tracked
mud on my carpet yesterday!

30
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,750
It took me half
the day to get it out,

31
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,750
--so why should I cook for you?!
--[KATO] Stop it!

32
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,500
There's no way that his socks
could've been that dirty!

33
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,916
Don't you talk back to me!

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,916
You free-loading punks!

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,958
[KATO growls]

36
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,500
[KATO'S AUNT gasps]
Let go of me!

37
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,416
Why are you looking
at me like that?!

38
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,125
Look, you can do
whatever you want to me...

39
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,791
...but let my little brother
have some breakfast!

40
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,458
I told you to let go of me!
Take your hands off me now!

41
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,375
I'll let you go this time...

42
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,708
But first, I want you to promise
me that you won't ever

43
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,416
hit my little brother again.

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,375
How dare you?!

45
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:36,875
This is my house, and if you
don't like it, you can get out!

46
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,416
[REPORTER]
Stay tuned to this station

47
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,208
for information on new
developments as they occur.

48
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,333
[AYUMU] So my brother said
he'd make me a new one...

49
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,666
[KATO]
Ayumu...

50
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,500
Your brother's no good at all...

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,166
[KISHIMOTO sighs]

52
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,208
[KURONO]
What's with her?

53
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,208
[KISHIMOTO]
So... Is this okay?

54
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,708
[KURONO] What?
You want that for breakfast?

55
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,250
[KISHIMOTO]
Well...

56
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,000
You've at least gotta eat some
bread or chips or something.

57
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,458
[KISHIMOTO sighs]

58
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,458
Look, it's only pet food,
after all. This'll be fine.

59
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,708
[KURONO sighs]
Well, it's not fine with me.

60
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,125
[KISHIMOTO]
Please, you don't have to...

61
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,833
[KURONO]
Don't worry.

62
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,375
Do you have enough money?

63
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,666
What?

64
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,125
Kurono, how are we
supposed to pay for it?

65
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,791
Aren't you almost out of cash?

66
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,875
[KURONO]
That was a damn good point,

67
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,250
but she didn't have to
be so harsh about it...

68
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,250
Hey, don't worry. I've got it.

69
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,708
Yeah, right.

70
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,833
[OLD LADY] Excuse me...

71
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,166
Could you show me
the way to Hinodedai?

72
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,250
Huh?

73
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,583
Which platform should I take?

74
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,875
You... No fuckin' way!

75
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,500
[OLD LADY]
You can have these for free...

76
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,166
...if you point me to
the right platform.

77
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,791
Where do I go?

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,500
[KISHIMOTO]
Hey! Kurono!

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,250
[KISHIMOTO]
Hey, wait, isn't that...?

83
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,083
Look, just hold your questions,
okay? There's no time.

84
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,458
Huh? Time for what?

00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,000
[KURONO]
That old bag...

86
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,916
When we got called to
that apartment the other day,

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,875
she kept trying to talk to me!
Didn't you see her?

88
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,375
[KISHIMOTO]
Huh?

89
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,458
[KURONO] I think we'll be 
getting a call from Gantz soon.

90
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,416
Anyway, we have to learn
how to use these

91
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,208
so we'll be ready
no matter what.

I'd really rather not look
at your pale behind

longer, now, will we?

for me to get a bigger one.

[TETSUO]
A bigger what?

132
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,833
[HARUYA]
Bike, dipshit!

133
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:29,125
When a biker says a bigger one,
he means a bike!

00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,416
[TETSUO sighs]

135
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,916
[HARUYA] I thought
I could break the engine in

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,750
before the Hachioji race
on New Year's Eve.

137
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,083
[TETSUO]
Uh-huh...

138
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,916
[HARUYA]
Hey, I'm serious, dammit!

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,250
[TETSUO] I didn't say
you were lying, did I?

[HARUYA] Fuck, Tetsu!
What's up with you these days?!

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,333
Huh?

142
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,416
Since you had that kid,
you've been acting like a pussy.

D'ow! Shit! Fuck, man!

What the fuck?!
What the fuck is your problem?!

00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,916
[TETSUO] I'll tell you
what my problem is!

It's your big,
fat mouth, fat ass!

So who's the pussy now?!

Go on. I dare ya to say it.

Jeez, it was just a joke, Tetsu!

Hey, Kosuke, I guess it's time

151
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,375
we got off of Tetsu's
old lady, huh?

152
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,791
Yeah, but you know, if he'd
gotten off her a little sooner,

153
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,166
He wouldn't be playing
"Biker Daddy."

00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,000
...having a kid, huh?!

158
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,625
Yo, what in the fuck's
wrong with you, man?!

159
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,333
Calm down, Tetsu!
We're just kidding!

160
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,166
[TETSUO]
Hmph.

161
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,041
[FOREMAN]
Hey, ladies?!

162
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,625
Break time's over!
Get back to work!

163
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,125
[KINJI and KOSUKE]
Yessir...

164
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,083
[KURONO]
Huh...?

165
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,333
[KISHIMOTO]
Um... Is this right?

166
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:05,291
Yeah, that's it! I mean,
that looks just fine.

167
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:09,375
[KURONO] Wow, I bet those guys
who go to those cosplay sites

168
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,958
would cream their
jeans over this!

169
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,333
[KISHIMOTO]
Uh, is there something wrong?

170
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,166
[KURONO]
N-No, nothing.

171
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,541
But, uh, you haven't worn one
of these before, have you?

172
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,833
[KISHIMOTO]
N-No...

173
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,333
Well, um, they're pretty
important, y'see...

174
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,333
Because when you have
one of those suits on,

175
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,833
I think your chances of
survival go way up.

176
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,208
So, you need to get
used to wearing one.

177
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,041
[KISHIMOTO]
Well, how does it work?

178
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,666
Well, uh...

179
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,083
You do know, right?

180
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,416
Uh...

181
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,875
[KURONO]
I-I can't tell her that...

182
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,250
Well, Kurono, how do I use it?

183
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,125
Well, you just...put it on...

184
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,416
And then I guess you just
give it your all, you see?

185
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,041
At least I...
think that's all...?

186
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,208
If that's all it takes, couldn't
you have just said that

187
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,375
instead of making
me change clothes?

188
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,041
Oh, well...
You gotta point there...

189
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,583
Hey!

190
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,166
I think you just wanted to watch
me undress, you little perv!

191
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,416
Ugh! I am not a perv!

192
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,208
And I've gotta get to school.

193
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,625
What? You're going?

194
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,708
Yeah, do I have a choice?

195
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,000
[sighs]

196
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,333
I'm jealous...

197
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,250
Of what?

198
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,750
At least you can go to school...

199
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,708
You know, if I was you,
I'd be glad I didn't have to go.

200
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,000
[KISHIMOTO] Yeah, but...

201
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,500
You only think that way
because you can go.

202
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,083
[gasps]

203
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,083
[KISHIMOTO]
Can I...

204
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,541
...maybe meet you somewhere
after school's over?

205
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,500
[KURONO]
Could this be my lucky day?!

206
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,125
[KISHIMOTO sighs] There's
someplace I need to go...

207
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,541
[KURONO] All right!
I'll go wherever you want!

208
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,125
Dinner? A movie? Or...

209
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,708
[KURONO chuckles]

210
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,041
I just want to see the place
where I used to live again...

211
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,583
Huh?!

212
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:04,625
And I want to see how the
other me... is doing now...

213
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,791
[KURONO]
That's what she wants to do...?

214
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,125
It that too weird?

215
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,375
No. You're as normal as I am.

216
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,375
[KISHIMOTO]
Hmm. You're not so bad.

217
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,833
[KURONO sighs]

218

I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,541

You'll be worse than sorry, kid!

220

[DELINQUENT B] So, what
do think we do with him, huh?

221
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,166
I got it. Let's pants
the little bitch.

222
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,208
Ah...!

223
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,416
You heard me. Drop 'em, now!

224
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,666
But I said I'm sorry!

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,833
[DELINQUENT B]
Stop whining...

226
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,750
It's not like you have
anything to show.

Come on, guys!
Don't do this!

Please, stop! Stop it!
Oh, let me go!

Hey, Kato!

[DELINQUENT A]
Hmph!

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,750
[DELINQUENT B] Ugh,
I think we gotta get to class.

233
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,500
[STUDENT A]
Thanks, you saved my life!

234
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,500
No problem...

00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,708
I didn't know what to do.

00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,208
I thought those guys
were gonna kill me.

00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,000
Let's go in...
Class is gonna start.

238
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,041
[STUDENT A]
Yeah...

239
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,833
[DELINQUENT B]
Man, we gotta do somethin'

240
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,083
about that tenth grader.

No shit, asshole.

Well, then, let's get to it.

Today?

00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,833
[DELINQUENT A]
Yeah, today.

245
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,166
[DELINQUENT B] Let's hit
him in the head with a bat,

246
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,750
and everyone take turns
wailing on him!

247
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,875
[DELINQUENT C] Yeah,
then we'll strip him down...

248
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,000
[DELINQUENT A]
Huh?! Why would we do that?

249
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,041
[DELINQUENT B]
To shove the mop up his ass!

250
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,791
[DELINQUENTS laugh]

251
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,916
So, uh, does this guy
have a pretty face?

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,166
Onizuka!

253
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,458
Hey, dude, this is the
eleventh graders' john!

254
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,208
I could... fuck his ass good.

255
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,708
And I've shit wherever I've
pleased since the tenth grade.

256
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,333
So, just who is this
mothafucka anyway?

257
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,416
Oh, he's a real fuckin' nut-job.

258
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,375
The one who's always
hanging out with the nerds.

259
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,541
Oh, so he's the wimpy type, huh?

260
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,541
No, he's fuckin' huge.

261
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,833
I'd say the bastard's
well over six foot tall.

262
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,625
I tell you one thing, he doesn't
scare easy, that's for sure.

263
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,833
Then his ass is mine.
Count on it.

264
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,541
[STUDENT A]
Hah! [laughs]

265
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,041
Oh, man...

266
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,416
[DELINQUENT A]
Yo! Kato!

267
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,208
[KATO]
Huh ?

268
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,458
We got business. Come on!

269
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,291
[KATO]
So... What do you want with me?

270
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,250
There's a bunch of eleventh
and twelfth graders

271
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,041
that are planning on jumping
you after school today.

272
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,916
And one of the twelfth graders
is a heavyweight boxer,

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,791
who just so happens
to be queer...

274
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,666
He says he's gonna fuck you.

275
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,750
I thought you should know.

276
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,625
[STUDENT A]
O-Oh! Kato!

277
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,166
Hey, are you all right?

278
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,083
Of course.

279
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,500
You sure?

280
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,291
Don't worry about it.
Now lets get back to that game.

281
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,458
[TEACHER] When Philip
the Second was assassinated,

282
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,250
Alexander was crowned as king.

283
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,916
Now, if you'll turn
to page 34...

284
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,583
[HOJO] Look, how many times
do I have to tell you?

285
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,083
I'm just not into chicks
with large breasts.

286
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,958
Oh, wow, he's gorgeous!

287
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,125
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL B] What?
You've never seen him before?

288
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,583
That's Hojo Masanobu.
From East Setagaya High.

289
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,791
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL A] Wow...
He looks just like a model.

290
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,250
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL B]
Where have you been?

291
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,875
He used to work for one of
the top male talent agencies

292
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,166
up until last year.

293
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,375
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL A]
Last year? Why'd he quit?

294
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,291
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL B]
Rumor has it that his agent

295
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,791
wanted to do him.

296
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,625
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL A] Ooh,
yeah, I've always heard stories

297
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:43,708
about stuff like that...

298
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:44,750
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL A]
Ooh~!

299
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,833
Take it easy.

300
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:09,083
It's just a book; nothing
to get all worked up about.

301
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,166
[MIKA]
Uh... Uh... I'm sorry...

302
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,583
I didn't mean to react like
that. You can have the book.

303
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,458
I was just looking at it,
I didn't wanna buy it.

304
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,291
Here, take it.

305
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,041
Ah! Oh, no... I-I couldn't.

306
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,750
[SEI]
Just take the book.

307
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,208
Um, well, thank you.

308
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,416
Man, you're jumpy.

309
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,000
Is... it that obvious?

310
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,125
Could it be...
you're being stalked?

311
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,333
How could you know about that?

312
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:41,541
Well... I'm just... perceptive
about things like that.

313
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,666
Well, I'll be okay. It just has
me a little shaken up, y'know?

314
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,583
So, have you informed
the police yet?

315
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,125
[MIKA]
Not yet...

316
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,125
I think I may have to
if it gets any worse,

317
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,375
but I'd really rather not.

318
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay. Well, watch your ass.

319
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,083
Are you really sure
you don't want this?

320
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,375
You can have it.

321
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,958
No, you keep it.

322
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,333
I find that the books that you
read are far more interesting

323
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,916
if you read them when you want!

324
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,500
Thank you, then.

325
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,666
Hey, have you been waiting long?

326
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,875
Not too long.

327
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,166
[KISHIMOTO]
So, what were you looking at?

328
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,041
[KURONO] Uh, never mind...
Come on, let's go...

329
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,583
[KISHIMOTO]
What're you in such a hurry for?

330
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,625
I'll bet it was a
dirty book, wasn't it?

331
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,041
[BOTH gasp]

332
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,041
[HOJO] Ladies... Could one
of you loan me your bike?

333
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,708
I'll pay you 10,000 yen.

334
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,125
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL B]
What?!

335
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,208
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL A] Um,
my boyfriend's bike is outside,

336
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,708
but... what do you need it for?

337
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,375
To ditch a stalker.

338
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:38,958
She's right behind me.
She won't leave me alone.

339
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,250
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL A] She looks
like the chick from "The Ring."

340
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,750
What a freak.

341
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay, look: I'll try asking
my boyfriend about his bike,

342
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,083
but in return, can I sit
behind you in class?

343
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,333
Wait a second!

344
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,708
[HOJO] Okay, okay.
That's fine with me...

345
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,208
But it's not like a date, okay?

346
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,375
Really?!

347
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,250
[SHOPLIFTER]
Oh! H-Hey!

348
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,458
[FURUTA]
Hold it right there!

349
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,958
[SHOPLIFTER]
Ow! That hurts! Let me go!

350
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,333
I'm not gonna call the police,

351
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,791
but you're going to listen
to what I have to say!

352
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,125
[SHOPLIFTER groans]

353
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,875
Just how long do you
think you can keep this up,

354
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,458
you little malefactor?!

355
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,791
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL A] Come on,
just for a little bit...?

356
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,166
You're crazy!

357
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,916
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL A]
I'll make it worth your while...

358
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,416
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL B]
Yeah... We both will...

359
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,125
[DELINQUENT A]
Hey!

360
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,708
[ALL gasp]

361
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,625
[ONIZUKA]
Huh?

362
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,583
[ONIZUKA] Man,
what the fuck are you doing?!

363
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,625
[ONIZUKA grunts]

364
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,875
[ONIZUKA screams]
Shit!

365
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,666
[KATO grunting,
ONIZUKUA squealing]

366
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,708
[squelching]

367
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,000
[AYUMU]
Masaru, it's my fault...

368
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,708
[KATO]
"You are already dead."

369
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,416
Ken's the toughest...

370
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,041
[KATO grunting]

371
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:18,125
[wet thudding]

372
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,416
Whatever. It really
doesn't matter anyway...

373
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,791
[KATO yelling]

374
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,208
[blows landing]

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,333
[DELINQUENTS gasp]

376
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,583
Oh, man... We're fucked.

377
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,791
[STUDENT A snickers]

378
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,875
Aw, man! You totally
kicked my ass!

379
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,500
[STUDENT A] Well, if there's one
thing I'm good at, it's shogi!

380
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,541
[KISHIMOTO'S ORIGINAL]
I'll be right back!

381
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,333
 
You've gotta be kidding me!

382
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,041
[TETSUO]
There you go... Upsy-daisy!

383
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,500
Don't throw up! Ha, ha, ha!

384
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,291
I'm going out to get cigarettes.

385
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,875
Well, could you get some milk?

386
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,583
More milk? Again?

387
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah, babies drink a lot of it.

388
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,875
So, are you ready
to go home, dear?

389
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,083
With your new toys?

390
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,583
Do I have ta?

391
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,041
[KAYO]
Hmm...

392
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,708
Almost time... It might
even be tonight...

393
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:48,041
[KISHIMOTO]
So many new people drawn in,

394
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,250
and this game of death
goes on forever.

395
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,291
Will the newcomers
be able to understand?

396
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,250
Can they even survive?

397
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,541
And if they can't,
what will they do?
