1
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,458
Stop this this instant!

2
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,958
[KAJIURA]
Hmm?

3
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,041
Just what in the Sam Hill
do you two think you're doing?!

4
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,750
[KAJIURA] Like I said, we're
trying to kill the Kurono Alien.

5
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,708
And that girl doesn't have
anything to do with it!

6
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,333
--Let her go!
--[gasps]

7
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,500
Why don't you tell Kurono that?

8
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,125
Things are like this
right now because

9
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,041
he had to go putting up a fight.

10
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,375
[FURUTA]
What?! B-But--

11
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,875
[gasps]

12
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,583
What the hell...?

13
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,958
Kishimoto!

14
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,333
He's seeing things.

15
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,083
More hallucinations?

16
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,625
Kurono! Tell me what you see!

17
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,958
Kurono, it's too late.
It's time to give up.

18
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,791
You know you won't make it.

19
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,333
Fuck you, Gantz!

20
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,208
You can't possibly think I'm
gonna fall for this shit again!

21
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,625
Death is the only thing
left for you.

22
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:36,000
Kiss my ass! I'm not
gonna die for you.

23
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,583
None of us...
wanted to die, Kurono.

24
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,666
[KURONO gasps]

25
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,875
[KISHIMOTO] Why are you the only
one of us still alive, Kurono?

26
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,208
It's not fair!

27
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,666
Shut up, damn you!

28
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,375
[KISHIMOTO] You think you're
the only one who wanted to live?

29
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,291
We all wanted to live!

30
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,833
Kato, Sei, and
everyone else is dead!

31
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,708
Why were you saved
and not us, Kurono?

32
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,791
It's not true, damn it!
It's a fucking lie!

33
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,791
I don't think it's true either!

34
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,916
[ALL]
Huh?

35
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,875
[KISHIMOTO, MIKA]
Can't you all see that Kurono

36
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,041
must've lost everyone
that meant anything to him?

37
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,708
That terrible pain
must be the reason

38
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,208
that he's acting like this now.

39
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,875
Shut up! Shut up, you dumb slut!

40
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,500
What if it's all the truth?!

41
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,083
What if Kurono
really isn't an alien?!

42
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,458
What if the real
bad guys are the Gantz

43
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,333
and these two Kurono
warned us about!

44
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,458
Shut up or I'll kill ya!

45
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,125
Then go ahead
and kill me, damn it!

46
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,541
I've already died once,
so who cares?!

47
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,166
Pull the trigger!
Just do it already!

48
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,250
Both of you keep talking
about who's an alien,

49
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,958
but all you really
wanna do is kill Kurono!

50
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,291
Am I wrong?

51
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,083
You said this is
so we can survive,

52
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,666
but all you really
wanna do is kill somebody!

53
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,125
You just wanna kill anybody,
isn't that right?!

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,791

[KISHIMOTO]
Kurono...

56
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,791
We will get out
of this together.

57
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,291
'Kay?

58
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,750
We will go back together.

[KAJIURA] Hajime! Don't let
him get away, you little shit!

Get off your ass

Yes, okay, sir.

Right!

Hey, wait! Huh?

Hey!

You, uh... really aren't
some kind of alien, are you?

Of course I'm not!

Did you two really kill
those bums like he said?

fuckers are sick, Pops?

94
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,458
[FURUTA]
And shooting them proves what?

00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,333
Put it down!

00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,791
Come on, we don't
have time for this!

97
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,333
Answer the question!

98
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,083
Did the two of you kill
those homeless people

99
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,208
at the temple or not?

100
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,916
[MIKA]
Wait... Stop.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,166
You wanna stop?

102
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,791
I dropped something back there.

103
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,166
Oh, fu--! What was it?

104
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,125
My book. I have to
go back and get my book.

105
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,333
[KURdONO] Forget it!
It was all bloody anyway.

106
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,875
I know it sounds stupid,
but it's important to me.

107
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,250
There's this wonderful line
on the first page.

108
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,041
I just wanna finish
reading the rest of it!

109
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,458
Is it worth dying for?

110
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,666
[MIKA]
"No labyrinth is inescapable."

111
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,041
[KURONO]
What?

112
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,791
That's what it says on
the first page of the book.

113
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,166
The name of the book is
<i>Labyrinth</i> by Miranda Foster.

I'm waiting for an answer!

116
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,125
So maybe we killed
a few, what of it?

117
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,708
[ALL gasp]

118

We're talkin' about killin'
a coupl'a drunk-off-their-asses

119
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,416
pieces of
human garbage, Old Man!

120
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,291
Does anyone really give a fuck?

121
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,083
[FURUTA]
And you... You did it, too?

122
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,625
Well, actually, I, um...

123
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,291
[YOSHINO]
Did you or didn't you?!

124
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,125
Hell yeah, he did.

125
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,000
[MUROTO gasps]

126
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,583
His eyes say so.

127
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,750
I had no choice!

128
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,500
He made me kill them,
I swear it!

129
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,791
I didn't wanna kill
those poor people!

130
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,500
What the fuck?
You little goddamn liar!

131
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,708
I told him I didn't wanna
kill homeless people, but--

132
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,166
Mr. Kajiura always
forced me to go out with him

133
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,250
and do all
those horrible things.

134
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,416
[MUROTO]
I really didn't mean to.

135
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,916
One time, Mr. Kajiura
went out of control.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,541
And before we knew it,
we were surrounded

137
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,375
by these angry homeless people.

138
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,791
They were the ones who attacked
us with the metal baseball bats.

139
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,250
I had to fight them!

140
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,166
Just cut the bullshit,
you lying little cocksucker!

141
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,458
You're a worse murderer
than I've ever been!

142
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,291
That's not true. I got scared
and tried to run away,

143
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,666
so I just swung the bat
all over the place.

144
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,500
I accidentally hit
one of 'em on the head,

145
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,208
but it was self-defense!

146
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,708
I swear the whole thing was
an accident, please believe me!

147
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,375
So what do you think?
Do you believe him?

148
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,166
I'm still not sure.

149
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,458
But whether he's lying or not,
he's still a minor.

150
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,875
Which means...

151
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,500
Um, which means it's not
too late to let him start over?

152
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,125
What he's doin' now ain't
self-defense, you jackass!

153
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,125
[FURUTA]
But he's--

154
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,625
[YOSHINO]
Nozaki's right, dammit!

155
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,833
Are you done preachin' yet,
you clutch of assholes? Huh?

156
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,125
[KURONO] And this woman...
just let you have it?

157
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,125
Yes, there was a beautiful
strength about her.

158
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,916
She said I needed it.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,375
And she had a bike helmet
with her name on the back.

160
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,333
Sakuraoka... S. Sakuraoka!

161
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,583
[KURONO gasps]

162
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,958
I... see.

163
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,166
[MIKA]
It's strange.

164
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,583
But I feel like it's
all connected somehow.

165
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,583
And yet, she's...
out there somewhere,

166
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,666
and I'm trapped
in this labyrinth!

167
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,500
In any case, I feel
like I have to try

168
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,333
and get that book back for her.

169
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,875
She gave it up for me, and I'd
feel awful if I just left it.

170
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,875
--[glass shatters]
--[gasps]

171
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,041
Please... Please
stop it, Mr. Kajiura...

172
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,916
Stow it! Your stupid act
is really pissing me off!

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,708
If you'd like,
I'd gladly accompany you

174
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,000
to the police station
to turn yourself in.

175
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,166
What?! Just who in the fuck
do you think you are?!

176
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,166
At least I'm not a monster
that preys on children!

177
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,291
That poor boy's just a minor!

178
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,875
And you've been forcing him
to help you kill people!

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,083
You already know how to
use these suits, right?

180
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,000
[MIKA]
What?

181
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,875
No, I don't.

182
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,375
[gasps] Hey! What are you doing?

183
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,958
[KURONO]
Don't worry.

184
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,583
You used it when that
psycho was giving you

185
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,833
the hot towel
treatment, remember?

186
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,833
Wait downstairs,
and you'll be fine.

187
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:04,875
[MIKA]
Downstairs?

188
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,125
But I told you I had to--

189
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,208
Don't worry.

190
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,958
I'll get your book.

191
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,166
[MIKA gasps]
Wait! [screams]

192
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,958
[KURONO]
Watch that first step!

193
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,166
[MUROTO sobbing]

194
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,250
Put the weapon down, dammit!

195
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,125
For his sake and all of ours,
just surrender!

196
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,416
He's right!
Please stop this, sir.

197
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,250
[KAJIURA]
Ya know what, Old Man?

198
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,833
You're down to
my very last nerve.

199
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,333
'Cause there's nothin'
that pisses me off

200
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,291
as much as bein' preached at!

201
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,541
Oh-ho!

202
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,833
Teacher! What are you doing?

203
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,958
[YOSHINO] I was willing to shoot
my own student to save my life.

204
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,875
Don't think I'll hesitate
to shoot you.

205
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,166
Put your gun down now!

206
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,750
[FURUTA]
Stop it, everyone! Just stop it!

207
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,083
This book that Mika
had is about situations

208
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,041
like this that seem hopeless!

209
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,000
[KURONO gasps]

210
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,500
Come on!

211
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,041
There's a line on the first page
I want you to think about.

212
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,083
And the point is...?

213
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,583
Will you just listen?!

214
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,583
It says, quote:
"No labyrinth is inescapable."

215
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,000
Do you understand the
meaning behind that line?

216
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,958
Oh for God's sake, you old fuck,
that's just a stupid paperback!

217
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,541
And they're called
labyrinths because

218
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,125
you can't get out of them!

219
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,208
I can't believe that a man
your age doesn't know

220
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,041
the difference between
facts and fiction.

221
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,125
[FURUTA] What does my age
have to do with it?!

222
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,458
There's nothing wrong with
believing in something!

223
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,250
[SAITO] Look, I know
you run a bookstore,

224
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,125
but now's not the time
for yammering about

225
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,708
this new age mumbo-jumbo!

226
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,875
[FURUTA]
You're wrong!

227
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,375
If there's a way out
of every labyrinth,

228
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,666
there must be a way
out of this game.

229
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,375
I'm absolutely sure of it!

230
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,458
So could you put the guns down?

231
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,666
I've already pointed a gun
at one of my own kids,

232
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,458
if I make it back... how am
I supposed to live with that?

233
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,666
[KURONO] You humiliated me
regularly anyway;

234
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,916
don't do something
stupid, you bitch!

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,583
You know what, bitch?!
I'm just gonna kill you!

236
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,916
I'll shoot!
Your brains'll go splat,

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,833
and then I'll
stomp on what's left!

238
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,875
[BOTH gasp]

239
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,166
[KAJIURA]
Oh, motherfucker!

240
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,541
Kurono, look out!

--[KURONO] Damn it!

00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,375
Calm down and back off!

254
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,666
[FURUTA]
If you go after those guys now,

255
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,250
it'll just turn
into another brawl!

256
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,708
So use your brains!

257
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,958
They've got the teacher,

258
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,458
so it'll take 'em a while
to get downstairs.

259
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,250
Let's plan this out first.

260
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,583
[KURONO]
Yeah, right.

261
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,833
--[KAJIURA] Move it, you cunt!
--[YOSHINO yelps]

262
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,250
Why did Kurono try to
rescue us after what we di--

263
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,916
[KAJIURA]
Why don't you shut up?

264
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,541
He could've escaped,
but he came back.

265
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,750
What was I thinking when

266
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,083
I pointed a gun at him
in the first place?

267
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,791
Oh, god... Kurono, I'm sorry.

268
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,458
I'll rape your corpse if you
don't shut up, you bitch!

269
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,500
[FURUTA] So Mr. Saito,
you say you're familiar

270
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,250
with this building's
layout, right?

271
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,458
[SAITO]
Uh, me...? Well...

272
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,791
[FURUTA]
When we were up on the roof,

273
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,500
you sounded like you knew
this place real well.

274
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,250
Look, I've only been to this
place a couple of times.

275
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,458
With my old office
supervisor, you know?

276
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,458
All we need to know
is where's the best place

277
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,791
to corner that pair
of psychopaths.

278
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,791
[SAITO] Probably the bar
on the first floor.

279
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,083
It has higher counters
than the topless place,

280
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,416
so if they started
shooting at you,

281
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,250
there's a better chance
of finding something

282
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,666
to hide behind.

283
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,041
In that case, let's herd 'em
down to the first floor,

284
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,125
dry-gulch the fucks,
and grab the teach!

285
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,666
[NOZAKI]
And what if they use her

286
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,916
--as a shield again, smart guy?
--If they do, then I'll try

287
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,416
talking them out of it, okay?

288
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
And what makes you think they're
gonna listen to you now?!

289
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,583
Which part of "psycho"
don't you get?!

290
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,500
The ones who are gonna get
dry-gulched is us!

291
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,958
Well, killing
each other won't help.

292
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,500
By the way, what happened
to the other girl? The coed.

293
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,625
Oh, she's fine. I just showed
her a quicker way downstairs.

294
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,291
[FURUTA]
Let's get one thing straight.

295
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,166
We can't go around
killing people,

296
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,375
so I want you to fire
warning shots only.

297
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,833
It's a bit late for that, Pops.

298
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,500
We can do it.

299
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,708
Have faith.

300
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,458
[SAITO]
I have faith we'll get killed!

301
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,208
[sighs]

302
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,833
Jeez, will you come off
the gloom and doom trip?!

303
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,208
I swear, how can
he be so negative...

304
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,541
[NOZAKI]
Hey, Kurono.

305
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,750
You mind if I ask you
a personal question?

306
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,083
[KURONO]
Fire away.

307
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,958
You could've run away from us
easily back there,

308
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,166
so what did you come back for?

309
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,208
For my teacher.

310
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,583
I've always admired... her tits.

311
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,708
[NOZAKI]
Huh?

312
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,666
[laughs]

313
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,083
Man, that's a good one, dude.

314
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,208
Don't just stand there!

315
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,166
Blast the door so
we can get out of here!

316
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,041
Who in the hell do you think you
are, bossing me around?

317
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm killing you when we
get back, you little shit!

318
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:05,958
Ooh...

319
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,958
[YOSHINO]
Kurono, I'm so sorry.

320
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:13,791
[KAJIURA gasps]

321
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,958
Oh, what the fuck now?

322
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,791
We're not gonna make it in time!

323
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,083
Jump between the landings
and you'll learn

324
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,708
how to use the suits at
the same time like this!

325
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,375
Come on, everyone jump down!

326
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,541
[FURUTA]
Right!

327
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,250
I'll shoot this time;
I swear I will!

328
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,000
You haven't got the balls, cunt!

329
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,875
[laughs]

330
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,916
[YOSHINO yelps]

331
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,500
Let the lady go!

332
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,833
[KAJIURA]
Oh, shit!

333
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,041
[KURONO]
Good, we've got 'em cornered.

334
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,166
Let's go!

335
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,541
Okay, I'm going in
to rescue my teacher.

336
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,458
It's too dangerous
for someone your age!

337
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,500
Let me do it!

338
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,375
No way. I have
the most experience

339
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,750
with the weapons and the suit.

340
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:11,791
I have to do it.

341
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,375
[FURUTA]
But if you'll just listen--

342
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,666
[KURONO]
No, you listen.

343
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,833
You wanna be the leader?
Great. I'm no good at it.

344
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,166
We had a great one before,
and we need one now.

345
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,625
You've got a conscience
and care... about all of us.

346
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:29,208
Just like Kato.
You can keep us focused.

347
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,833
And that's something that
I'll never be good at.

348
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,541
We need someone who's...
trying to get all of us home.

349
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:40,458
[KURONO] I refuse... to let
Gantz jerk us around anymore!

350
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,000
You know... You kinda
look like someone...

351
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,750
[KURONO gasps]

352
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,833
Now that you mention it...

353
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, forget I said it.

354
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,458
Then let's do this.

355
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,875
[ALL gasp]

356
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,250
[KURONO gasps]

357
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,875
Motherfucker...

358
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,375
You bastards!

359
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,708
Why can't we have
a little fun, huh?

360
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,583
The bitch is
already dead, right?

361
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,666
Hey, I didn't do it!

362
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,833
Mr. Kajiura swung
a knife at her!

363
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,166
He used this... knife...

364
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,458
Oops!

365
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,041
That does it!

366
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,958
When we get back, I'm gonna
carve your lying little ass up

367
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,416
the same way you did her!

368
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,791
Yeah, cut the bullshit act, kid.

369
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,750
What could cause that boy
to do something like that?

370
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,250
He's what they call
a "sexual predator."

371
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,500
But he's--

372
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,833
If you say one
more thing about that

373
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,500
bloodthirsty little loon
being a kid, I'll hurl!

374
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,458
Ah, the hell with all
this hostage crap!

375
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,000
This human shield business
is too much work.

376
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,625
[gasps]

377
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:58,958
Take the bitch!

378
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,791
[YOSHINO groans]

379
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,916
Kurono, dear,
please forgive me...

380
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,416
I was crazy to think
I should shoot you.

381
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,125
[YOSHINO] When you...
got hard-ons in class,

382
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,541
I knew you were
fantasizing about me...

383
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,083
[gasps]

384
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,500
Why does everything
come back to my dick?

385
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:25,458
Actually, I got off...
on how hard I got you.

386
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,166
I'm sorry!

387
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:36,000

That was wicked!

Where... did they go?
Did they get away?

401
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,333
Are you all right, sir?

402
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,125
[NOZAKI] All right?
If you'd bother to look,

403
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,583
you'd have seen our shit's
already hit the fan.

404
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,166
[MIKA gasps]

405
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,541
I told you that I'd get it back.

406
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:42,250
And I promise, we'll
protect you. We all will.

407
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,458
Isn't that right, Mr. Boss-Man?

408
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,875
Well, I hope you have more
of a plan than that.

409
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,958
Oh, trust me, since
that train ran over me,

410
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,416
I've learned to plan
for the unexpected.

411

[gasps]

412

[MIKA]
You're...

413
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,666
[KURONO]
Huh?

414
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,833
[MIKA]
You're that guy!

415
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,625
[FURUTA]
Hey, everyone, look at this.

416
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,916
It looks like they're
leaving a trail of blood.

417
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,291
Ms. Uehara might have given us
the chance to stop her killers.

418
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:11,416
[MIKA]
What?! You mean... she's dead?

419
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,083
[gasps] Oh my god...

420

[KURONO yells]

421
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,250
This whole fucking thing
has been a grudge match

422
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,875
between me and the Gantz.

423
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,708
I don't know how it'll end,
but I promise you this:

424
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,291
Before it's over,
those two are gonna die.

425
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,583
No, not until we've
heard them out first.

426
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,375
[KURONO]
What?! Damn it!

427
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,708
You'll never make it
out of this labyrinth

428
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,750
with that attitude, Old Man!

429
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,416
I could care less
about the big one,

430
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,708
but that boy deserves
a chance just like you did!

431
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,541
And I will bring him back!

432
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,625
[SAITO] Screw this! I'm past
the point of caring anymore.

433
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,791
[KURONO gasps]

434
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,083
Mr. Saito?

435
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,375
I'm gettin' sick and tired of

436
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,083
this old fuck tellin' me
what I have to do!

437
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,708
To hell with this
inescapable labyrinth shit!

438
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,875
If you wanna go on,
you can do it without me!

439
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,375
Forget it! It'll be too
dangerous if we're separated!

440
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,000
[SAITO]
I said, I'm not going, dammit!

441
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,375
And if you try to make me,
you old prick,

442
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,250
I'll blow your balls off!

443

[ALL gasp]

444
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,166
I-I really will do it!

445
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,958
I really will pull the trigger!

446
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,625
[MIKA]
I won't lose...

447
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,833
I won't die!

448
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,166
I won't die... ever.

449
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,500
I'll never die!
