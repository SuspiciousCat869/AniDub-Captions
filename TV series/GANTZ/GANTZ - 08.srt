for my practice exam tomorrow?

Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

Give me a minute.

4
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,958
Here's something special
for you to wear tomorrow.

5
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,083
[SHIORI] Oh, Mom! This is so
cute! Where'd you get it?

6
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,916
[KISHIMOTO'S MOM]
At Mikato! I splurged.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,291
It's a very important day
for you, dear.

8
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,208
Thanks, Mom! I love it!

9
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,416
[KISHIMOTO'S MOM] Just remember:
I'm counting on you

10
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,916
to get a good score on the test.

11
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:26,375
[KISHIMOTO'S MOM] Wow, Kei!
You got an A+ on your exam!

12
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,583
I knew you could do it.
Didn't I tell you?

13
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:33,000
Good job! You've made
your mother so happy.

14
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,916
I love you, Kei. You know
you're my pride and joy.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,375
Now, let's see if we can
try a little harder.

16
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,125
You can do it if
you keep studying.

17
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:47,458
I'm not worried. I
have faith in you, Kei.

[KISHIMOTO'S MOM]
Yes, that's right...

19
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,750
I'm just glad she passed.
This was her safety net school.

20
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,625
If she couldn't even get
in there, I'd have been

21
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,541
too embarrassed to
set foot outside.

22
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:03,250
Uh-huh... She's just like
her father, not very bright.

23
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,541
I just don't know
what to do with her.

24
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,666
What? Shiori? You know
how gifted Shiori is.

25
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,250
Her teacher said she'd
have no trouble passing.

26
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,791
We're all so proud of her.

[KISHIMOTO sighs]

31
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,625
[KURONO]
She's so calm.

32
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,833
I can't believe she's not
freaked out about this.

33
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,666
I mean, why are
there two of them?

34
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,875
[KURONO] So... What do
you think you'll do now?

35
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,791
[KISHIMOTO] I dunno. But for
some reason, I feel relieved.

36
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,375
Huh?

37
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,875
[KISHIMOTO] I feel as though...
my whole life I've been living

38
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:38,208
for my mother's sake...
Always trying to please her...

39
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:43,583
Trying to be a good girl...
I was always studying so hard.

40
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:50,416
But there was no point to it.
She never gave me a chance.

41
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,291
Not once.

42
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,666
[KURONO]
So...

43
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,916
In any case, I don't
know what my other self

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,291
is going to do from
now on, but...

45
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:06,333
This girl here is just going
to live her own life. And!

I'm in love! I've
found someone I love!

Wha--?

48
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,541
And I'll live!
For his sake and mine!

49
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,875

still got plenty of condoms!

Do you know where
Kato's house is?

56

[KURONO]
No, I don't.

57

Oh. That's okay! I've get the
feeling that I'll see him soon.

No, no. Everything's fine.

that Kenshiro never dies?

Huh? Yeah, because
he's the toughest.

66
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,666
Yeah, but no matter what...
it's still really wrong

to hit people
and stuff, isn't it?

68

[AYUMU]
Just because you're tough

69
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,416
doesn't mean you can do
whatever you want, right?

70

Yeah...

00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,666
Sure, right.
What's with you tonight?

Please don't die on me, okay?

What're you talking about?

74

It's just that... I want
to live alone with you.

75
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,375
So... don't die, okay...?

when Mom and Dad...

156
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,083
[KATO]
Huh? Uh...fine?

157
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,625
[KURONO] Kato, don't take
her away from me...

158
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,833
[KISHIMOTO]
I wanted to see you.

[blows landing]

Bastard!

00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,458
[HOJO] I'm through
fucking around with you!

162
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,791
Get off the bike!

163
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,250
Get the fuck off!

164
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,916
[SADAKO]
Here? On the expressway?

165
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,416
How am I supposed to get home?

166
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,375
[HOJO]
Who gives a shit?!

167
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,375
[HOJO] I just want you
off this bike! Now!

168
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,625
[SADAKO]
Why are you so mean to me?

169
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,583
[TETSUO'S WIFE]
I guess...

170
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,708
...I must've inhaled too much
paint thinner or something.

171
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,166
Why?

172
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,458
I can't breast feed the baby...

173
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,166
I can't...

174
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,291
[TETSUO]
What about regular milk?

175
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,333
That'll be all right,
don't you think?

176
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,291
Huh?!

177
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,583
[TETSUO]
What the fuck?

What the fuck?!

starting all over again...

[KURONO]
Yep. Just like before...

184
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,833
Where is this place, Grandma?

185
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,875
Well... I don't know.

186
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,500
[KURONO] And the new people
are doing exactly what we did

to this place...

[RYOTA] Grandma,
I don't like this place!

is goin' on?! Answer me!

going on, you bastards!

[KURONO]
Guh...

198
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,250
[KURONO] It'd be pointless
to explain anything...

Even WE didn't believe it...

Well? I'm gettin' pissed!

Sorry. I know zilch.

be fuckin' with us...

Damn. This is pointless.

210

I get it! This is a hospital...

211
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,291
We did get the shit
kicked out of us.

212

[TETSUO] Oh, right!! Does this
look like a hospital to you?

And none of us have
a scratch on us.

the part that I know.

That's enough!

here will get a weapon

250

and be transported to
a different location.

Maybe I have lost my mind...

00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,916
But that's exactly
what will happen...

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,458
Is this some sort of game?
A reality show on TV?

257
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,416
[KATO] No. You're not on TV,
and it's not a game.

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,125
So what happens next?

259
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:16,166
All right. We have to capture
what appear to be aliens.

260

to capture them.

But aliens aren't real, Grandma!

This guy IS out of his mind!

The people who were
here last time

didn't take it
seriously, either.

And all of them are dead now!

Where are these "aliens?"

Man, I am so lost.

Who could possibly believe this?

00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:56,083
You tell them, Kei.
Tell them how the suits work.

275

Well, there's really
nothing to them...

What the fuck is that?

Sounds like a

I dunno...

to listen to me or not.

00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,458
So, who died and made
Kato the class president?

314
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,250
Nobody did.

315
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,166
And it's not a position that
I really want, either.

316
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,083
Then why are you
spilling the beans?

317
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,583
Because I want us to
come back alive...

318
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,375
I mean, all of us.

319
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,208
You said we're faxed
copies, right?

320
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,250
Duplicates of the originals?

321
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,666
And your point is?

322
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,375
"You are already dead."
Remember that?

323
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:34,541
When I was growing up, I used to
admire that kind of bullshit.

324
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,958
But now...

325
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,541
Now it really pisses me off.

326
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,958

327
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,791
[KURONO]
Oh, fuck...

328
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,416
[KURONO]
My suit...

329
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,375
[KURONO]
My suit... it's not here!

330
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,166
[KURONO]
What am I gonna do?

331
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,916
[KURONO]
What am I gonna do?!

332
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:50,833
[KURONO] Oh, shit! I forgot
my suit. I am so fucked!

333
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,041
What will I face next?!

334
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,458
What IS that thing?

335
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,000
I don't know what's real.

336
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,625
I'M the one who's
gonna get killed.
