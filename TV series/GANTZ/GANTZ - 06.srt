[KISHIMOTO]
And... When I went home...

315
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,750
I... still existed.

316
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,875
[KISHIMOTO]
What am I... What am I?

317
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:36,375
I have no place to go.
No house to come home to.

318
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,958
No parents...

319
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,333
[KISHIMOTO]
I'm sorry, Kurono.

320
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:46,458
This isn't the time
for me to throw away...

321
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,000
...my virginity.

322
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:53,666
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

323
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,500
We're at the subway once more.

324
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,333
And once again, our morning news
starts off with more information

325
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,875
about those missing
high school boys.

326

[REPORTER]
Since the boys disappeared,

328
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,958
this story has been investigated
from many different angles.

329
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,875
But the identities of
the missing students

330
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,708
still remain a mystery.

331
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,291
However, authorities believe
that tracing the sales route

332
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,458
of a certain umbrella
and adult magazine

333
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,583
will yield some promising leads.

334
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,416
And we suspect even more
surprising developments

335
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,791
are in store in the near future.

336
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,041
And yet, so many questions
still remain unanswered.

337
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,041
What has happened to the boys?
Where are they now?

338
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,000
And why did they
disappear so mysteriously?

339
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,208
From the scene, this has been
your special morning report.

[KURONO]
In the end...

341
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:46,000
Two virginities remained
intact last night.

342
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,166
So when will Gantz...
call again?

343
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,333

Domestic violence...

344
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,500
...milk and necessities...

345
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:55,375
...stalkers... shoplifters...
bikers... an idol...

346
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,500
...and obsession.

347
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,958
Shall we get down to business?
