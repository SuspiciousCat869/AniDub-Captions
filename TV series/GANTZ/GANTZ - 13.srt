I'm not... going out like this!

Damn...

[KATO]
Kei!

185
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:17,916
[KURONO groans]
I... I think so...

186
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,166
Oh-- Oh, thank God...

187
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,000
Thank God...

188
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,625
[TETSUO]
So... is it over... now?

189
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,208
[HOJO] I think so...
It stopped counting down.

[KURONO grunts]

194
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,958
[KATO]
I guess, this...

195
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,000
--...is all that's left of us.

this the wrong way,

00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,750

--Perversions and all.
--[TETSUO] Hey!

200
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,166
Can we leave now? Or what?

201
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,000
[KATO] Well... I think we
have to wait for our scores.

202
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,041
[TETSUO]
Scores?

203
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,041
Screw the scores.

204
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,250
[gasps]

205
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,958

207

[KISHIMOTO]
Huh? There, look! It's starting.

208
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,750
[HOJO]
Huh...?

209
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,291
[KURONO] "Do something"?
C'mon, he's a dog!

210
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,083
[DOG whines]

211
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:40,041
So we're sitting here getting
scored... But for what?

212
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,000
If what that Nishi kid
told us is the truth,

213
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,875
when your score
reaches 100 points,

214
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,250
you supposedly get to go free.

215
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,958
[HOJO gasps]
What the hell?

216
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,333
So this really is
some kind of game?!

217
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,041
Aw... Another boob joke?!

218
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,541
It says 90 points to go, so...

219
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,125
Does that mean I'll
be free at 100?

220
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,458
Oh!

221
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,958
I guess that's five points each.

222
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,250
Because I've killed
two of 'em so far.

223
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,166
[KISHIMOTO]
What?!

224
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,541
I-I mean, you fought so
many of those things!

225
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,500
[KATO]
Yeah, I fought them...

226
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,458
But unlike you, I only
killed one of them.

227
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:25,000
I get it! The more you kill,
the sooner you're set free.

228
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,041
So I don't just
have to survive...

229
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,083
I have to keep on killing.

230
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,833
[KURONO]
Sadako? Who's that?!

231
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,041

Yeah.

[HOJO gasps]

235
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,458
So who here's the homo?

236
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,500
[HOJO] Maybe one of the
guys who died was gay.

Stay the hell away from
me! I-I-I'll kill ya!

even touch you!

Yeah, right!

Aww... C'mon, Kato!
So what if he's gay?

248
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,625
But I'm not! I'm not gay!

249
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,500
[TETSUO]
Oh, my turn?

250
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,041
[TETSUO]
Hey, what's this shit about?

251
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,416
[TETSUO] What the fuck?
Now how did he score so high?!

252
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,958
That's incredible, Kei!

253
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:39,791
That's great! Thirty-eight
points! But how?

254
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,333
"The errand boy"? Me?!

255
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,708
[TETSUO]
Whoa! It actually opened!

256
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,875
[TETSUO]
So can we go home now?

257
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,416
[KURONO]
I wonder where she's going...

258
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,125
[KATO] Well I'm sure
it won't be too long

259
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,750
before we'll all be meeting
up again in that room.

260
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,500
So I guess, I'll see ya.

261
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,791
[KISHIMOTO]
Uh, Kato?

262
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,625
Um, you wouldn't happen to uh...

263
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,583
...to live by yourself
by any chance, would you?

264
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,166
[KATO]
Uh...

265
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,416
Well, actually my brother and I
live with one of our relatives.

266
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,625
Why...?

267
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,500
[KISHIMOTO]
Oh! It's nothing!

268
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:34,125
Really! I... was just
curious, that's all!

269
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:34,916
Okay!

270
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,791
[KURONO]
Uh...

271
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,583
[KURONO]
Damn...!

272
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:45,500
Somehow... I managed
to survive again...

273
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:49,166
But right now...
surviving kinda sucks.

274
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,416
[TETSUO]
Children need to drink milk

275
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,666
in order to grow up
strong and healthy.

276
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,291
You could say that
milk and breast milk

277
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,291
are two of humanity's
greatest treasures.

278
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,083
All right, enough of this crap!
I don't wanna die!
