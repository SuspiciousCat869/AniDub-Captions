1
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,666
[KATO] The next 30 minutes
will decide everything!

2
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,416
We're not just
fighting to go home,

3
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,125
we're fighting for survival.

4
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,416
If we don't kill all of them,
none of us will live either!

5
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,541
So, no matter what happens now,
we've got to keep fighting.

6
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,541
We've come too far to give up!

7
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,125
[KATO] Remember, focus on
staying alive and we can win!

00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,833
Let's go!

00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,041
Hey, Kei, are you
and Sei a thing now?

10
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,166
[KURONO] Dammit! Don't say stuff
like that in front of Kishimoto!

11
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,791

12
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,791
We will be if we live
though this, right?

13
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,416
Oh, then I guess we're all just
going to have to live then,

14
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,750
won't we?!

15
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,125
At least it's good to know
someone else believes

16
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,250
that all of us can
get back home alive.

17
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,958
Well, since Kei already killed
the "boss" of this game,

18
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,708
eliminating the rest of
them should be easy!

19

happy for you guys!

So where do you live, again?

[KONTA] Higashi Nagasaki,
on the Seibu line.

[TOMAO] Oh! That's close
to Ikebukuro, right?

[HOJO] No, honestly, you're
actually kinda cute.

So in that case, uh, how 'bout
if I, uh, came by tomorrow?

31
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:13,916
Tomorrow, yeah. Yeah, I could--

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,916
Okay, let's go!

Damnit!

What kind of a monster
would do something like this?

36
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,458
I guess those two
assholes got him...

37
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:32,958
You sound so sure.

38
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,833
Couldn't this have been
the work of the statues?

39
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,291
Statues might have beaten him,

40
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,958
but they wouldn't take
such pleasure in it.

[KATO crying]

Why did we bother?

43

What was the point in even
trying to save his life?!

44

You can't give up, Kato.

But why keep going on?

I mean, what's the
fucking point?!

47
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,916
We've been trying so hard
to make it back together.

48

But now the priest is dead,
and so's the military guy!

No matter what we do,

it's the same as last time
and the time before that!

I've never understood
any of this!

But this is the
most senseless yet!

53
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:14,291
Why?! What in the hell
have we been fighting for?

54
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,708
This man was killed, and his
only crime was being homeless!

55
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,958
We've suffered and bled
for this stupid game!

56
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,416
But what kind of place are
we fighting to get back to?

57
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,875
A world where no one bothers
to help a homeless man

who's fallen on the tracks?

59

00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,500
get their heads smashed in
for no reason at all?

[KURONO]
Kato! Get a fucking grip!

62
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,750
Do you remember what
you said to us earlier?

63
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,833
You said you wanted to go
home more than any of us.

64
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,625
[KURONO] 
If that's still true,

65
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,500
then going back is your
only option, right?

66
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,583

rest of us...all of us.

where I belonged.

wanna go home.

Huh? Oh, you mean Kurono.

So no hard feelings?

No, Kurono and I are... just a
little too different, you know?

all with the X-gun.

we should attack them

[KISHIMOTO] This feels...
right for some reason.

It used to make me happy
when someone told me

that I'd done the right thing,
that I'd been good.

But after I started school,

it stopped meaning
anything to me.
