[KISHIMOTO]
Oh, jeez! What's with this dog?!

2
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,791
Bad dog! Bad dog!

3
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,916
Hey... are you feeling okay?

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,625
[KISHIMOTO]
Ugh! Don't do that!

5
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,791
S-Stop it! Get down...
I mean away from me!

6
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,791
Somebody, help!

7
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,666
[KATO] Here! Put this on
before I attack you myself.

8
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,875
[KURONO]
What's the deal with that dog?

9
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,541
I mean, I've heard stories about
these single working girls

10
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,583
and butter but...?

11
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,291
[KURONO]
So what is it?

12
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,833
It's like some kind of message,
but it can't spell worth shit!

13
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,750
It says that,
"Your lives are now over

14
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,375
and what you do with your
new lives is for me to decide,

15
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,791
so there you have it."

16
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,916
Hey! What the...?

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,958
Is this thing trying
to screw with us?!

18
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,458
[NISHI]
It may sound screwy,

19
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,666
but if you stop to think about

20
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,500
everything that's
already happened to us

21
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,333
it's not all that funny, is it?

22
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,125
[INAMORI]
Uh-huh...

23

"Please go eliminate this
target now, you bastards.

24
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,625
The Greenonion Alien.

00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,291
Traits: Strong, smelly.

26
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,208
Likes: Green onions, friendship.

27
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:06,333
Catch phrase: 'Green onions
are enough for me!'"

28
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,208
What the hell is this?

29
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,500
[YAMADA] I think this is
some kind of game.

30
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,750
[SUZUKI] Does this mean
it's going to let us out?

31
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,000
[KURONO screams]

32
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,875
[INAMORI]
Yeah, baby! [laughs]

33

They look real! Woo-hoo!

[YAMADA gasps]
Someone's in there!

35
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,625
[INAMORI] Whoo, I've heard of
being behind the eight ball,

36
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,125
but inside it?

37
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,125
[KURONO]
Oh, give it up already.

38
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,791
It's probably just a
dummy to fake you out.

39
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:41,541
[KATO] I don't know... For a
fake, it looks pretty real.

40
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,333
[KURONO]
Huh...?

41
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,833
[KURONO]
Hmm? "Kato-cha"?

42
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,583
Bad spelling or a pun?

43
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,875
Kato! I think this
might be for you.

44
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,750
Wasn't there a
singer called that?

45
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:58,916
[KATO]
Cosplay?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,333
[INAMORI]
Vinyl! Cool!

47

Here, you try it on.

00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,583
Oh... screw you.

49
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,458
They don't really shoot! Crap!

yourself, nothing happened.

I'm... outside...

Oh, holy shit! But can I--

C'mon, c'mon!

I'm playing dress-up!

[YAMADA]
Hey, which train system is that?

91
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,416
[SUZUKI] I couldn't see
which line it was,

92
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,000
but if we follow the tracks, we
can find the nearest station.

[KURONO]
Why is she following him?

94

I went to her rescue, too.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,416
[SUZUKI] If I can get back
into the political arena,

96
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,416
I still got a chance
to turn things around.

97
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,250
All I need is a chance
to mop the floor

98

with that cocky,
little Prime Minister.

99
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,583
[YOSHIOKA]
I know what I need...

to get the plumbing scrubbed.

get to go home after this.

I've still got all
those tests to grade.

[NISHI] Hold on,
before we go any further...

107
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,833
It is my duty to tell you that,
unbeknownst to most humans,

108
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,916
there are alien criminals
secretly living here on Earth.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,625
We have all been recruited by a
secret government organization,

110

and now it's our job
to get rid of these aliens.

like the greys and stuff?

114
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,500
[SUZUKI] Sonny, the current
government doesn't have

115
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,541
that kind of money.
And I should know.

116
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,041
Then go ahead and
doubt me, grandpa,

117
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,375
but for each one we kill,
we get ten million yen.

to be pulling our legs.

123
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,875
Nope, I got it
straight from my dad

[INAMORI]
Who?

127
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,916
Nishi's one of the top dogs
in the Information Bureau.

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They say he's
as sharp as a knife

129
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,375
and that he never tells a lie.

How can this be?

Because, old man, the bureau's
never told you politicians

the truth about anything.
You're just for show. A pawn.
