this is happening,

It's not just me.

Actually, all of us on this

Because we've been here before.

No...

You don't know, huh?

87
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,208
Then do you at least know who
"sponsors" this hunt of yours?

88
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,125
[KATO]
Who "sponsors" it? I don't know.

89
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,875
I see. So there are great
gaps in what you know.

90
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,375
I'm afraid so.

91
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,208
Right. But you still
expect me to believe that

92
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,750
we're going to
put on these suits

93
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,958
and go out and hunt aliens
for a big black ball?

94
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,541
Yes. That's correct.

95
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,625
And these things we'll
hunt... these aliens...

96
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,708
They're from space?

97

Quit screwin' with us!
You mean aliens and shit?

99
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,958
Probably...

100
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,541
On the other hand,

101
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,416
that ball did draw people out
of the air with a laser beam.

102
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,541
And there's no human technology
that can do that, is there?

103
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:23,250
So that just leaves aliens or
an act of Divinity, doesn't it?

104
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,791
It's a dream! Who cares
if it's divine or not?

105
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,666
[MIYAFUJI]
No, as far as I can tell

106
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,333
this is really some kind of
teleportation device,

107
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,833
just like in the movies. I don't
know exactly how it works,

108
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,333
but it's possible that
it can teleport a person

109
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,083
to a different place,
the second the person dies.

110
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,250
Ha! That's ridiculous!

111
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,708
You said that we'd die if we
didn't wear these suits, right?

112
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,250
Let's just say that...

113
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,416
...your chances aren't
so good without it.

114
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,208
In that case, I'll wear it.

115
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,333
The game's starting!

116
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,208
Hold on, look at the clock.
It's different!

117
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,958
It's 30 minutes longer.

118
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:06,500
The first two games both lasted
60 minutes. So does that mean...

119
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,083
...that wthis time,
we're going up against

120
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,833
something even
worse than before?

121
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,375
[KURONO]
Still, it's no big deal.

122
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,208
It's just 30 minutes
more; I'm up for it!

You see? They're all being
pulled back down to Hell.

124
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,416
Listen to me, if you don't put
on the suits now, you'll die!

125
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,625
Put 'em on!

126
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,000
Put on one of those gay
things? Forget that!

127
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,958
Yeah, only an otaku or
a fag would wear that!

128
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,125
I don't hear anyone else
saying their prayers!

129

Actually that shit's
pretty gay, too.

Yeah, and I'm not even Buddhist!

131
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,208
They're not leaving
us any choice.

132
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,291
We're really gonna have
to do this by ourselves.

133
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,958

gives me this strength.

the suit also protects me.

You don't have to wear them,
but at least take them with you.

Okay, so where are we?

00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,833
it creeps me out.

155
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,708
[TOKUGAWA] Yes, divine
judgment has now begun.

They're falling into
the pits of Hell!

You don't mean "Hell" like
in the Old Testament, do you?

158
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,375
Hellfire and brimstone?!

159

Save me! I haven't had
a chance to confess yet!

Aah! I thought this was a dream!

161
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,166
It's okay, you're only
being sent outside.

162
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,041
You're not going to Hell.

Namu Amishinrai...

164

[KATO] Look, you don't have
to wear them right now.

165
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,750
But hold onto the
suits and the weapons!

166
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,875
And wherever we end up,

167

don't try to leave
or go anywhere else.

168
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,875
Kato, there's
something that I--

169
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,750
I'll see you outside.
Please don't worry.

170
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,041
Everything'll be fine.

See?! Now do you fools see
what happens when you ignore

172
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,750
the words of a priest
who knows these things?!

173
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:25,000
Now you will burn in the
eternal flames forever!

Well, if you say so...

I don't get it! What's
the big deal about here?

182
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,250
Well, at least we
can walk home now!

183
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,125
Wait! It's important
that we all stay together!

184
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,458
[KONTA]
Right...

keep feeding us this shit?

Hey, dude, have you been crying?

Don't be ridiculous!

[MIYAFUJI] You know, given all
the weird stuff that's happened,

191
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,125
it might be wise to accept
what's happening and go with it.

[IKE]
Screw that!

I'm finding a station and
catching a train home.

this late, right?

Wait, you can't leave!
It isn't safe!

Yeah? Why not?

Weren't you listening to what
Kato said earlier? There's--

00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,958
Oh, yeah, "ferocious aliens,"
right. That's not half as scary

us, aren't they?

207
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,000
[SEI] Wait. Are you saying that
they're supposed to be aliens?

208
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,375
[KATO]
I honestly don't know.

209
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,958
But the Gantz always
pits us against

210

different kinds of aliens.

211
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,791
As far as we know,
these could be anything.

[MUROTO, KAJIURA laughing]

Ah... My little nose
tells me they're...

The one thing I
don't undertand is

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,250
who would want to play such
an elaborate joke on us?

[KURONO] They're not gonna
believe anything you say.

229
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,958
And since the Gantz gave us
an hour and a half this time,

230

if you go any further!

be divine judgment!

That smell of alcohol
represents a life of excess!

It could be brandy
or maybe whiskey!

It's not divine
judgment, goddamn it!

like a game, it's quite real.

some protection
and added strength.

that you must pull both triggers

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,250
The X-gun?

307
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,583
Yeah, the X-gun.

308
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,041
[MIYAFUJI]
What's an X-gun?

309
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,750
We decided to call this
the X-gun for two reasons.

310
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,458
It has an X-ray-like display

311
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,958
and it makes an X shape
when you fire it.

312
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,833
Actually, Kato came
up with the name.

313
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,583
[KURONO] What the fuck?
When did he start namin' things?

314
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,375
And how the hell does
she know about it?!

315
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,666
Of course, X-gun's not
an official name...

316
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,166
I just call it that.

317
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,500
It's not bad. And actually,
I like the sound of "X-gun."

318
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,875
So now that you've named it,
just what can we do with it?

319
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,291
[KISHIMOTO]
Well, with the X-ray part,

320
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,500
you should be able to see
through an object, right?

321
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,458
[KATO] That's right.
If they're living creatures,

322
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,291
we should be able to see
their bones like in an x-ray.

They're really alive...

327
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,500
And we're supposed
to fight them?

How can we do that without--?

He can't... He can't shoot it.

any other choice left!

These things are really aliens?

332
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,916
[TOMAO] Yeah, are they
gonna move or what?

333
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,250
So what now?

334
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,041
Since they're not moving, can't
we just take them out right now?

Maybe we can trap them!
