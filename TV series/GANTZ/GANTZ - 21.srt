165
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,916
Are you afraid of me?

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,041
I can't blame you
for being suspicious.

167
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,291
C'mon, put the gun away.

168
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,708
[KATO]
No!

This is amazing!

171
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,583
It feels totally
fucking awesome!

172
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, yes! It feels great!

173
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,375
I can do anything,
and you can't stop me!

174
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,541
You don't have a
chance of beating me.

175
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,458
Oh, by the way, this statue
has something to ask you.

176
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,291
Who in the fuck are
you people anyway?

177
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,208
Why do you exist here?

178
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,500
Who sent you?

179
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,083
We never did a
goddamn thing to you.

180
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,291
Now I'm the only one left!

181
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,875
[VISHNU STATUE] Are you just
gonna stand there and ignore me?

[KATO]
The gun has two triggers!

186
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,958
Could one of them be...
for locking onto a target?

187
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,791
[KATO]
It's no good.

188
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,291
I can't get closer, but I can't
keep on dodging either!

[VISHNU STATUE]
Hey, you're pretty spry.

190
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,708
You wanna try doing this
for about an hour?

191
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,041
I've got all day, Kiddo.

192

You go to hell!

00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,833
[VISHNU STATUE]
Stop! It's me, Miyafuji!

204
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,541
You're not gonna
sacrifice me, are you?

205
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,416
You bet your ass I am!

I'm sorry...

I guess... it really
did rain, Big Brother.

213
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,916
Don't you think you beat me yet!

214
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,916
You little hypocrite!

215

There's no way I
can really beat him.
