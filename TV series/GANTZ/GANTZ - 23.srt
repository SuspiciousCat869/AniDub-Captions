those suits on. Hurry!

Stop fuckin' around, Gantz!

Gantz? Who the hell is Gantz?

23

This is Gantz!
This fuckin' thing here!

So, is this lucky or what?

Huh?

Those guys who shot
us think so, too.

Heh. So if we make it
back to the real world,

30
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,375
it'll be like hitting the
game of life's reset switch.

--Am... I wrong?
--[KURONO shouting]

[MUROTO] Plus, we can kill all
the others before we go back.

33
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,458
I mean, it's not
a crime to kill people

34
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,250
who are already dead, is it?

35
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,666
All six of them. Six...

36
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,041
[MUROTO] Or make that seven,
you slimy fuck.

37
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,375
You've been making me
do all your dirty work.

I'm gonna love this.

[KAJIURA] Heh.
You little murdering freak.

40
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,125
The juvenile laws may
protect you from the cops,

41
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,083
but you're not safe from me.

42
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,541
Stop acting like
you're running the show.

43
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,291
[chuckles] Okay, we'll play
this part a little longer.

44
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,291
If those stupid sheep
swallow our little act,

45
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,208
they'll play right
into our hands.

46
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,458
And we'll get to kill
all we want later.

47
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,125
Oh, you know acting...
is my forte.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,583
So let me get this right.

49
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,458
If the rest of us all wanna
make it back to our real lives

50
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,041
in one piece, we're
gonna have to fight you?

No, that's not it!

52
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,791
Up until this time, one of us
has never been the target!

53
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,000
But that picture--
It is you, right?

54
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,583
[KURONO] No! Like I said,
Gantz is fucking me over!

55
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,416
But Kurono...
Exactly what is Gantz?

Oh, that... The big black ball.

00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,833
Now wait just one minute!

00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,708
This is a kid
we're talking about!

60
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,500
And a buncha grown-ups
are supposed to

61
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,000
gang up on him and kill him?!

62
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,458
That's just crazy!

63
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,791
So you're saying you'd
do it if he was an adult?

64
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,916
[FURUTA]
Hmph! Don't be absurd!

65
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,708
And where have you two been?

66
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,291
In the bathroom.

67
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,625
So, have you guys decided
anything out here yet?

68
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,666
We've been going
around in circles.

69
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,541
Well, okay.

70
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,583
How 'bout we try this?

71
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:07,291
Let's ask our new friend here
to give us a little proof.

72
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,125
More proof?

73
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,458
That's right.

74
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,958
There must be something
that could make us believe

75
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,666
this story about monsters
and weapons or whatever.

76
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,458
So do you have any proof?

77
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,083
I just showed you the power
of this suit, didn't I?

78
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,416
Yeah... But that could'a
been a trick, you know?

79
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,958
Any kinda proof will do.

80
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,916
That is, anything as long
as it's convincing enough.

our own what we should do.

163
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,083
Damn straight!

164
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,041
'Cause I sure as hell
don't trust this fuck!

165
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,291
Piss off!

166
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,458
Look, if our lives are
really on the line here,

167
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,458
then we need to stay
calm and carefully

168
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,291
talk our way through this.

169
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,916
Well if you ask me, I think
we should trust Kurono.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,250
Trust a guy who shoots
at us without warning?

171
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,041
Well, how about this, then?

172
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,291
We all saw for ourselves the
power these suits seem to have

173
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,791
when our little friend was
hassling Mr. Saito there.

174
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,291
Why don't we all put
them on, just to be safe?

175
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,333
And to be even more safe,

176
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,958
we keep Kurono here
under an armed guard.

177
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,208
Makes sense, right?

178
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,125
What?!

179

--[gun cocks]
--[gasps]

180
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,500
It's all right, I'll keep him
covered while you change.

181
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,125
Hurry up and put on
those suits quick, okay?

182
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,250
And don't forget to grab a gun!

183
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,958
Come off it! I don't have a
reason to shoot anyone here!

184
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,250
Yeah? And just how
do we know that?

185
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,083
You just took a shot at us!

186
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,208
You bastard...!

187
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,208
Right, let's all get changed.

188
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,666
We can take turns in
the hallway for privacy.

189
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,125
Hang on! I think that
we should trust him!

190
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,750
I think we should get dressed.

191
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,916
It'll save a lot of time if the
two of us get dressed together.

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,791
Wait a minute.
I thought you were...

193
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,375
Yes, his teacher.

194
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,208
But none of that's going
to make a difference

195
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,416
if I die out there.

196
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,750
I have no intention
of using this, myself,

197
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,541
but it might not be a bad idea
to protect yourself, young lady.

Okay, we're all dressed.

201
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,625
So, if we can go
by what he said,

202
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,958
we're supposed to be
transferred somewhere--

know where we are?

Well, as I recall, this
building has ten floors.

There's a fairly expensive
European-style bar on the first,

and from the second floor on up,
it's all adult entertainment.

We're not going to
do anything to you,

so come on down and
give us the gun.

gonna talk to you politely

if you're pointing
a gun at them!

231

Give it here, and come on down!

a risk in my book.

it out together!

you talking about?!

just let me outta here!

322
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,291
Hey, weren't you the
one who was saying

323
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,416
what a relief
it was to be here?!

324
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,916
[SAITO]
Uh...

325
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,833
Okay, let's just all calm down.

326
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,291
Arguing amongst ourselves isn't

327
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,583
going to accomplish
anything at all!

328
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,125
And as for you two over there,

329
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,083
why did you start shooting?!

330
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,583
Because we wanna
survive, of course.

331
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,500
Don't you wanna
survive, Old Man?

332
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,875
'Cause we sure do.

333
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,250
[FURUTA] You're talking
about two different things.

334
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,166
And you shouldn't
be using that gun!

335
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,291
[MIKA]
He's right!

336
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,708
Everything that's
happened so far

337
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,125
could have a lot of
different explanations.

338
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,000
We still don't know if Kurono's
really our enemy or not!

339
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,500
[YOSHINO]
But we have no choice!

340
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,000
Huh?

341
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,416
[YOSHINO]
We all want to survive.

342
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,916
So that means we have to--

343
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What other choice do we have?!

344
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,041
[MIKA gasps]

345
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,458
But you're... Kurono's teacher.

346
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,375
And you're getting on my nerves!

347
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,708
Fine! I'm his teacher!
Who gives a shit?!

348
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,291
Now just hang on, dammit!

349
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,541
Not all of us agree that
we have to kill 'im.

350
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,833
If we stop and think it through,

351
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,250
there must be a way
of getting through this

352
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,708
without killing anybody!

353
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,875
And what if the
other way is wrong?

354
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:15,500
What if your fucking noble
intentions get us all killed?

355
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,333
[FURUTA] For God's sake, are
you even listening to yourself?!

356
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,750
Look, if none of you wanna
shoot him, you can stay here.

357
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,125
The two of us'll handle it.

358
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,458
[NOZAKI]
Huh?

359
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,458
Hey!

360
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,250
[FURUTA] Hey, wait a minute!
Come back here!

361
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:42,500
[water running]

362
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,166
You've given me shit,
Gantz, oh yes.

363
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,166
But I won't lose to you.

364
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,958
[KURONO]
I won't lose to anyone!

365
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,458
Kurono! I don't have any
personal issues with you,

366
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,416
but since it's either my ass or
yours that's on the line here,

367
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,333
guess who loses?

368
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,916
[FURUTA]
Please, don't do this!

369
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The time for talk
is over, baldy!

370
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:11,958
[ALL gasp]

371
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,333
[KURONO yells]

372
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,291
[ALL scream]

373
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,500
[panting]

374
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,208
Kurono! No! Don't do this!

375
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,625
[MUROTO]
Son of a bitch!

376
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,166
[yells]

377
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,625
[MUROTO screams]

378
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,416
Die, Kurono!

379
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,458
[KURONO] You're not runnin'
this show, fuckwad!

380
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,416
And I'm gonna whip
your evil ass!

381
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,208
[KAJIURA groans]

382
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,875
[MUROTO screams]
Help! He's gonna kill me!

383
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,541
[YOSHINO]
Kurono! Stop!

384
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,041
Hi, Teach...?

385
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,416
[YOSHINO] You never listened
in class, so listen now.

386
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,958
If you make one more move...

387
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,791
...I'll blow you away.

388
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,625
No, wait! Put the gun down!

389
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,375
[YOSHINO]
Now, get your ass over here!

390
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,416
Now!

391
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,541
[pants]

392
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,125
Just what are... you doing?

393
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,875
None of us here wants to
believe that we're dead,

394
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,666
but I believe it! And...

395
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,916
...if someone's promising me I
can live by killing you, then...

396
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,125
...I'll do it.

397
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,375
I'll do it!

398
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:38,333
You would... really shoot me?

399
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,583
You bitch!

400
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,875
What the hell am I
supposed to do, dammit?!

401
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:52,666
[MIKA screams]

402
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,041
Okay, Teach, that's
enough for now.

403
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,375
I'll take over the
lesson from here.

404
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,833
But-- But I--

405
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,166
Just step the fuck
away from him, you cunt!

406
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,708
So, Kurono, are you still
gonna fight me now?

407
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,666
You're taking her hostage?

408
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,958
For God's sakes, man,
what are you doing?!

409
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,916
That girl isn't
involved in this!

410
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,166
Let her go!

411
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,458
Now, you know that
I can't do that.

412
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,208
We still have to kill the
Kurono Alien, don't we?

413
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,708
I have to do this!

414
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,708
[KAJIURA]
Kurono! What's it gonna be?

415
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,541
If you keep fighting, I'm gonna
hafta fuck this bitch up.

416
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,000
Are you okay with that?

417
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:36,708
[MUROTO chuckles]

418
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,000
What a fucking idiot!

419
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,416
Can't he think of something
better than this?

420
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,208
This is for your own good, kid.

421
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,375
Stop tryna fight with us, okay?

422
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,416
Give yourself up, and
I let her go unhurt.

423
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,375
You bastard!

424
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,500
Please, Kurono, I--

425
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,958
[KAJIURA]
Stop fucking around with us!

426
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,958
Everybody else here
wants to survive...

427
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,166
...don't we?

428
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,583
[MIKA whimpering]

429
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,083
[YOSHINO] Life is like
a maze, a labyrinth.

430
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,583
Once you get lost,
there's no easy way out.

431
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,625
Oh, well. It's not like
it matters anymore.

432
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,708
Next episode,
"No Labyrinth is Inescapable."
