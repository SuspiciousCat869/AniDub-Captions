[KURONO panting]

00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,291
[KURONO]
What a mess...

4
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,958
No wonder my suit's
so totally fucked up.

5
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,000
Huh?

6
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,291
But with some luck,
maybe I can...

7
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,916
[MUROTO crying]

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,125
It hurts!

9
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,458
My fucking mouth hurts!

10
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,083
I have to stand up
for myself and fight!

11
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,958
I have to get out of this alive!

12
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,875
[beeping]

13
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,208
[KURONO]
It is still working!

14
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,208
Two of 'em...

15
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,625
No way.

16
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,875
Come on, let it be
Furuta and Mika.

17
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,791
Stay alive, you two!

18
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,166
I'm coming.

19
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,875
I'm coming for you!

20
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,833
Just hold on, dammit.

21
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,291
[MUROTO gagging]

22
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:04,875
[MIKA] Killing someone is
the last thing I want to do.

23
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,166
But I'm going home!

24
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,333
You're hurting me,
you stinking cunt!

25
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,250
[MIKA screams]

26
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,875
[MUROTO laughs]

27
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,916
You got all cocky,
didn't you, bitch?

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,458
I bet you thought you
were really hot shit.

29
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,791
Well, guess what?

30
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,291
If the guy doesn't wanna
fuck you, you're dead!

31
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,791
[KURONO]
Stop it!

32
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,708
[KURONO] Can't you think of
anything except killing,

33
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,416
you sick little shit?!

34
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,875
Shut up, you alien!

35
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,791
[KURONO]
I wanna get out of this alive,

36
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,083
and I'm taking Mika
back with me!

37
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,916
What the--?! Are you
just fucking stupid?!

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,625
Try and kill me so I can
shoot you, dammit!

39
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,250
[KURONO]
Well, I don't wanna kill you!

40
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,041
Maybe all you wanna do
is kill, but not me!

41
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,500
Shut your mouth!

42
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,875
You're full of shit!

43
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,833
Stop hiding from me!

44
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,583
Dammit, where are you?!

45
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,916
[KURONO]
Afraid?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,541
What's a cold-blooded
killer like you afraid of?

47
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,250
--You son of a bitch!
--[MUROTO groans]

48
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,416
[KURONO] How many people
do you have to kill?!

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,250
[MUROTO]
Please!

50
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,416
I swear I'm not acting now!

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,583
This really isn't
an act, honest.

52
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,791
I'm begging you, Kurono,
just give me another chance!

53
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,541
[KURONO] I wonder how many
people would be alive right now

54
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,583
if it wasn't for that
pathetic little act of yours.

55
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,166
If only everybody else
had listened to me!

56
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,625
Instead, they just set
themselves up for you,

57
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,541
so you could kill them!

58
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,125
Well, payback's a bitch!

59
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,541
[MUROTO]
Please don't-- [screams]

60
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,083
[KURONO] Mika... Are you
still hanging in there?

61
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:43,416
[MIKA] No... Everything's
starting to go black.

62
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,750
But you know what, I really...

63
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,083
...did it this time.

64
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:53,500
I regretted not fighting back
when that man took my life.

65
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,125
But I did it this time.

66
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,916
I fought him with
everything I had.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,041
So this time, I don't
have any regrets, Kurono.

68
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,833
I finally stood up
for myself at last...

69
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:08,958
Hang on, Mika.

70
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,875
Once Gantz transports us back,

71
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,208
it'll be as if you were
never hurt at all.

72
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,083
Hold on and you'll be fine!

73
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,083
Really?

74
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,666
[KURONO]
Yes! So don't give up!

75
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,500
Sounds good to... me, Kurono...

76
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,541
I'll try...

77
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,041
[KURONO gasps]

78
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:30,708
Furuta... gave his life for me.

79
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,791
And he tried his best.

80
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:40,333
[MIKA] He tried to show
that kid... right from wrong.

81
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:44,750
And that's how he ended up.

82
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:49,000
He tried to help others
until the very end.

83
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:53,291
I didn't know there were
people like him anymore.

84
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,458
He was a good guy, all right.

85
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,291
[MIKA]
Please...

86
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,458
What?

87
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:05,250
Promise me... that
you'll make it back.

88
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,750
[gasps] What are you saying?!

89
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,416
We're both going back together--

90
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,333
[MUROTO] I've got you now,
you fucking alien!

91
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,458
And you're not getting
away this time!

92
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,416
Mu-Muroto, you little...!

93
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,250
Thought I was out, did you?

94
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,416
I knew you'd drop
your fucking guard.

95
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,708
And you know what?

96
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,166
I've been watching
you help this cunt

97
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,958
the whole goddamn time!

98
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:29,208
That's how cowards like me
beat heroes like you!

99
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,000
And I am a coward, you know.

100
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,000
Ever since I was a kid,
I've been scared.

101
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,625
Do you have any
idea what it's like

102
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,166
to spend every waking
moment afraid?

103
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:38,958
Do you?!

104
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,250
[KURONO yells]

105
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,166
[MUROTO] Afraid someone's
going to hurt you?!

106
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,291
Well, now you know how
I felt my whole life,

107
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,958
and it sucks, doesn't it?!

108
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,750
How do you like it, Hero?
Can you handle it?!

109
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,708
I couldn't!

110
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,083
And now I'm going to
get my revenge...

111
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,041
...on every adult who
used to slap me around,

112
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,250
every adult who used me,

113
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,041
I'll break their legs and arms,

114
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,541
snap their fingers,

115
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,875
tear off their ears,

116
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,708
and rip their hearts
through their assholes!

117
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,416
And... that accomplishes what?

118
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,375
[MURUTO gasps]
So that's it!

119
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,625
You're little cloaking device?

120
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,500
You sneaky little shit.

121
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,000
You wanna kick my ass now,
Mr. Super Fucking Invisible?!

122
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,083
Well, you're not fucking
with me anymore!

123
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:21,958
No one is!

124
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,333
[KURONO screams]

125
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,666
[MUROTO] No one's ever
gonna hit me again.

126
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,791
[laughs] Oh, no... Not anymore.

127
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,666
The rest of humanity may
look down on me like a roach,

128
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,750
but it's Kajiura and filth like
him that made me what I am!

129
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,916
And it's your society that lets
people like me do what we do.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,541
You act like killing
is so horrible.

131
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,541
But whenever you don't
get what you want,

132
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,791
you torture and
you maim and you kill.

133
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,291
Do you know... what
true fear really is?

134
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:57,208
It's fearing the time...
when your own mother gets home

135
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,583
because you know
that the bitch is

136
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,333
going to find some
new way to hurt you.

137
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,166
It's wondering if
today's the day

138
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,666
she's finally going
to end your life.

139
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,625
You know, my dad told me once

140
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:11,500
how my mother was a good,
kind, and caring woman.

141
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,583
"She'd never do something
like that to you," he said.

142
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,541
And when I told him the truth,

143
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,791
he beat me till my bones broke!

144
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,916
I went to the one person in the
world who could protect me!

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,166
And what did I get for it?!
Sixteen more broken bones!

146
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,958
[KURONO]
Cry me a river.

147
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,041
So you think you can
justify your killing

148
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,416
just because you were
beaten as a kid?!

149
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,958
Blame it on what you want,
who the fuck cares?!

150
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,250
Stay back, dammit!

151
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,333
You stay away from me!

152
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,791
I've got a suit, too!

153
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,666
If you even try to touch me,
I'll crush your damn ribs!

154
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,125
I'll break every bone you have
and kill you if I have to!

155
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,541
And you just love
killing, right?

156
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,958
Let's see you try.

157
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,750
Or do you have
the balls, fucker?

158
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,708
I didn't wanna kill
any of those people!

159
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,708
Stop trying to blame me!

160
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,958
Excuse me?

161
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,750
If you killed them,
you get the blame.

162
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,416
I thought Gantz was
sick and twisted,

163
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,750
but you take the cake!

164
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,041
And at least the Gantz
isn't in denial.

165
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,166
I don't care what
Kajiura made you do.

166
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,833
You still had a choice!

167
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,458
Do you think anyone will
forgive the things you did?!

168
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,750
Just because someone
else ordered it?!

169
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,250
Well, sure. That's how it works
when countries go to war, right?

170
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,291
Haven't you ever watched the
news or read a goddamn paper?!

171
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,375
What in the hell are
you talking about?!

172
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,791
It doesn't matter if
it's in Asia or Africa,

173
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,791
if it's Chechnya
or the Middle East,

174
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,583
armies are nothing
more than people

175
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,791
ordered to kill
other people, right?

176
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,500
And what about the Americans?

177
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,125
What about Iraq?

178
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,375
That war has killed thousands
just to get a few terrorists!

179
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,708
And you have the nerve to judge
what I've done next to that?!

180
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,666
Next to the thousands
that society kills,

181
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,416
the ones I've killed
don't count for shit!

182
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,958
[MUROTO] So how can you fault me
for killing just a few people?

183
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,791
Where do you get off?!

184
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,750
Give me a fucking break!

185
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,833
[KURONO groans]

186
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,916
It's none of your business!

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,375
People are killing each
other all over the world.

188
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,666
Why is it such a big deal if

189
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,291
I wanna cut a few from
the herd as well?!

190
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,666
Come to think of it,

191
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,708
you've played this game
before, Mr. High-And-Mighty.

192
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,125
I'll bet you've killed
a few, yourself.

193
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,083
I've never killed another
person, you bastard!

194
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,500
So it's okay to kill as
long as it's not human?

195
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,791
I had good reasons.

196
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,958
And I only killed
after people I knew

197
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,666
and cared about
had been murdered.

198
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,208
You idiot!

199
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,416
Killing is still killing!

200
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,500
I just kill others
before they can kill me.

201
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,708
And I'm only trying to kill you

202
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,083
because the Gantz told me to!

203
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,750
Just cut the "it's okay if
someone orders it" crap!

204
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm not buying!

205
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,791
Haven't you been running
around killing things

206
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,458
because the Gantz told
you to, hypocrite?!

207
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,416
Haven't you?!

208
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
[KURONO groans]

209
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,958
[KURONO] But I never killed
a human, dumb shit.

210
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,666
[MUROTO] You're saying
Kajiura wasn't human?

211
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,958
[panting]

212
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:10,333
Kajiura... wasn't
even human anymore.

213
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,291
And the only reason
I was fighting him...

214
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,958
...was to save the others!

215
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,833
So now you're going to kill me?!

216
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,125
To avenge the deaths of
all those other turds?!

217
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,916
What fucking bullshit!

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,333
The truth is that you
want to kill me, too!

219
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,250
All you want is to get home!

220
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,875
The same as me!

221
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,041
[KURONO]
You know, Kajiura told me that

222
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,666
you and I have the
same kind of eyes.

223
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,500
But I don't ever wanna be put
in the same category as you!

224
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,708
[MUROTO] Then why didn't you
kill me sooner? Huh?!

225
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,416
[KURONO]
Oh, I should have...

226
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,958
And I was going to earlier.

227
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,750
But people like Kato and Furuta

228
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:53,000
helped me see that trying to
get back together was important.

229
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,000
And as much as it sickens me,

230
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,916
that meant you, too!

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,458
Because the truth is,

232
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:04,041
that killing something never
solves a goddamn thing!

233
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,500
Not for you!

234
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,791
[KURONO chuckles]

235
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,166
But this time,
the clock's on my side.

236
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,291
I've had it up to here with
your fucking lectures!

237
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,333
[gasps]

238
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,125
[BOTH grunting, yelling]

239
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,500
[MUROTO chuckles]

240
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,833
[MUROTO screams]

241
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,208
Muroto!

242
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:08,375
[screaming continues]

243
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,458
[KURONO]
Muroto!

244
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,541
[KURONO]
Damn! I can't stop it!

245
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,875
Help me!

246
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,750
[FURUTA] If there's a way
out of every labyrinth,

247
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,875
there must be a way
out of this game.

248
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,250
I'm absolutely sure of it!

249
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,875
You're right, Furuta,
there is a way out!

250
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,291
[KURONO]
Muroto!

251
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,500
[KURONO]
You'll be okay.

252
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,083
Gantz will heal you
if you can stay alive.

253
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,583
[MUROTO laughs]

254
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,125
[KURONO gasps]
Muroto?

255
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,875
[laughing continues]

256
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,708
These suits are fucking awesome!

257
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,750
My hair's not even singed.

258
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,208
I finally understand
how all of this works.

259
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,666
With this, I'm invincible!

260
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,125
[KURONO groans]

261
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,750
[chuckles]

262
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,416
[MUROTO] It's a crazy
fuckin' world, ain't it?

263
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,041
A psycho killer like me
gets to go home safe,

264
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,958
while trusting
soft-asses like you

265
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,791
and Furuta get to
stay here, dead!

266
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,375
You're just like him.

267
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,708
You're going to die regretting
you ever trusted anyone!

268
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,166
[KURONO] You're wrong;
I won't have any regrets.

269
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,791
And I won't die!

270
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,791
[MUROTO screams]
What the fuck?!

271
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,041
Bastard! You said you
didn't kill people!

272
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,458
But you're gonna kill me?!

273
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,666
Oh, I wish I could
just kill you!

274
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,708
But since I know that
you're still a human being,

275
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,916
I'll just send you up there!

276
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,666
No! Have mercy, please!

277
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,500
Help me!

278
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,833
This was the right way.

279
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,500
It had to be.

280
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,041
Come on, Mika!

281
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,458
Please be alive!

282
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,541
Speak to me!

283
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,625
[MIKA gasping]
I... remembered...

284
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:56,166
I knew... that
I'd seen you when...

285
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,250
You saw me? When was that?

286
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,416
Keep talking.

287
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,750
I saw you...
All of us were there...

288
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,958
...watching, when you...

289
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,750
[KURONO]
Hang in there. Come on, Mika.

290
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,750
When was this?

291
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:15,583
At the... subway... station...

292
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,791
The station?

293
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,250
You mean you were there?

294
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,958
When Kato and I were killed?

295
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,541
Come on, stay with me!

296
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,916
[KURONO]
Stay with me!

297
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,541
We'll go back soon!

298
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,583
So you saw us on the subway?

299
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,750
Don't die on me yet.
Come on, Mika!

300
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,000
Goddammit, Gantz!
What're you doing now?!

301
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,291
We can make it!

302
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,916
The game is over now!

303
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,166
Start the damn transfer!
Do it, Gantz!

304
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,291
[KURONO gasps]
What the fuck is this?

305
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,625
[KURONO]
You still wanna do this, Gantz?

306
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,666
Do you?!

307
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,666
[KURONO]
You son of a bitch!

308
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,583
You're really gonna
take it this far, huh?

309
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,750
[ANNOUNCER]
Your attention please.

310
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,375
We are currently
experiencing major delays

311
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,541
due to the heavy rain.

312
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,833
M-Mika...

313
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,333
Now I understand.

314
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,500
You really did see me here.

315
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,625
[gasps] That's Nozaki.

316
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,208
And Furuta!

317
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,416
Is that...?

318
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,916
Oh my god, Kato!

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,541
Kei! It really is you!

320

[KURONO]
Oh, what the fuck?

321
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,375
Are you outta your mind?

322
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,583
This is no time to be acting
like a hero, you idiot.

323
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,458
What are you trying to prove?
That you can do it by yourself?

324
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,583
[KURONO]
Damn... What did you two idiots

325
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,625
think you could
do by yourselves?

326
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,500
What can you do... when
you're all by yourselves?!

327
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,291
[KURONO grunts]

[ANNOUNCER] The next train
will be arriving at Platform 2.

329
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,416
Please stand behind
the yellow line.

330
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,583
All by ourselves, huh?

331
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,875
We suffered and bled
for this stupid game!

332
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,625
But what kind of a place are
we fighting to get back to?!

333
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,208
A world where no
one bothers to help

334
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,708
a homeless man who's
fallen on the tracks?!

335
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,875
A place where
innocent human beings

336
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,916
get their heads smashed
in for no reason at all!

[train horn blares]

338
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,333
Kei! Start running!

339
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,291
[KURONO] Mr. Furuta,
what can I do by myself?

340
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,291
[KISHIMOTO]
But there's something

341
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,333
I want you to understand,

342
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,000
and that's that
I really like you.

343
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,500
I really do think...

344
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,458
[SEI] It's supposed
to come in next week,

345
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,166
over at the bookstore
by the train station.

346
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,541
Kei, I don't know
what's going to happen,

347
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,000
but if something does, would
you get that book for me?

348
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:09,125
Promise me... that
you'll make it back.

349
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,166
[KURONO] Kato, what can
I possibly do by myself?

350
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,791
What can I do... on my own?

351
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,208
[KURONO]
What can I do all alone?

352
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,708
What can one person possibly do?

353
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,666
[MIKA]
We were all watching you then.

354
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,250
But we couldn't help you.

355
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,875
We... wouldn't help you.

356
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,291
But this time, please live!

357
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,625
Live for us!

358
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,916
Kei! Are you all right?!

359
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,333
[MIKA]
Kurono... we'll be fine...

360
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,541
...as long as you live!

[train horn blaring]

362
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,500
[MIKA]
So many must've died.

363
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,291
So many people who must've
been important to you.

364
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,416
[KATO]
You can do it, Kei! Go for it!

365
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,166
You have to... make it, Kurono!

366
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,625
[OLD WOMAN] I wanted to
thank you, young man.

367
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,375
After you told me to
find it on my own,

368
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,750
I tried really hard, and
sure enough, I did find it!

369
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,291
Thank you so much for
all of your kind help.

370
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,791
I wish you good luck
as well, young man.

371
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,750
[KURONO]
I won't die.

372
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,708
Do you hear what I'm saying?

373
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,125
I will... not... die... Gantz!

374

Bang.
