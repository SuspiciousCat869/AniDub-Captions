329
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,583
How could you...?

330
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,833
How could you?!

331
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,708
[MUROTO]
It hurts!

332
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,958
[KURONO yelling]

333
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,875
You really wanna die!

334
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,458
[KATO]
We can make it back, Kei.

335
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,208
We can make it back
if we work together.

336
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,833
I knew that you
would never give up,

337
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,541
and that kept me going.

338
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,166
We will all go
back together, Kei...

339
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,833
...alive.

340
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,791
[KURONO]
You're right, Kato!

341
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,875
[gasps]

342
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,750
[MIKA]
He was right...

343
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,333
Words alone aren't enough.

344
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,625
They won't defend you.

345
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,041
In the end...

346
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,791
...you have to stand up
for yourself and fight!

347
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,958
[KAJIURA groans]

348
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,416
[chuckles]

349
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,833
[KURONO]
Kato... we will go back alive...

350
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,541
...all of us!

351
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,750
[KURONO]
You're a bastard, Gantz.

352
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,541
A sick sadistic piece of shit!

353
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,291
Well, screw you, Gantz!

354
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,625
Screw you and the
whore you came from!

355
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,750
I'm not giving up!

356
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,083
Final episode, "Please Live."
