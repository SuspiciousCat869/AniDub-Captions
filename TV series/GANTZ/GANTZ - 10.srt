Aw, what the fuck? He ain't
disappearing anymore!

Come on, kid, what gives?

[KISHIMOTO] Hey, do you
think that thing is broken?

180
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,541
He stopped disappearing.

181
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,375
[KURONO] That thing
could see him anyway,

182
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,041
so I guess it really
doesn't make any difference

Hey, did you hear that, Haruya?

189
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,375
Yeah. I guess he's the one who
doesn't "get it" now, ain't he?

How can we help YOU?

Just shut up and help me out!

Shut the fuck up! After the
way you talked to us earlier?!

You can just stay there
and fucking die! DIE!

And speaking of death,

we're all dead anyway, right?!

So what difference
does it make?!

Hey, kid! Looks like this
isn't just a game, is it?

216
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,333
I get the idea you're in a lot
of trouble about now.

217
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:56,458
But you did, in fact, blow
Kouske's fucking head off!

218
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,500
And I hope you haven't
forgotten that!

219
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,750
You murdered another person!

220
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,666
Give us a sign that you have
some remorse about that!

221

There's nothing more
disgusting than a murderer

sad life! You hear me?!

for murdering Kosuke

in cold blood?! Are you going to
show any kind of remorse

225
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,875
for what you did?!
Say something! Come on!

What?!

Are you really gonna help
that little shit out

229
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,000
if he just apologizes?

230
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,000
And just what does that mean?

231
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,375
Yeah, what do you mean?

232
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,125
Surely, you don't...

233
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,625
Give me a break. He's just
trying to save

234
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,500
his own pathetic skin.
The only thing that bastard's

235
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,791
ever really given a rat's ass
about is his goddamn score!

236
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,833
Are any of you honestly
willing to help out

237
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,791
a piece of shit like that?!

238
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,416
Well, since I'm not like your
indecisive fuckin' "leader,"

239
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,541
this is about owning up
to moral responsibility.

240
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,416
His and ours.

241
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,083
Do any of you...

242
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,416
Any of you...

243
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,958
...really understand
the preciousness of life?

244
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,291
How rare and valuable it is?

245
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,291
Does it mean anything?

246
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,666
You don't get it, do you?

247
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,000
Look, I'm not saying that I'm
gonna believe what he says,

248
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,291
but at this rate, that kid's
a dead man for sure.

249
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,458
So, what now, huh?

250
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,541

Now, don't get me wrong.

255
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,208
None of this means I'm gonna
save the little murderer

256
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,333
just because he apologizes.

257
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,958
I'm saying I might consider it
only if he does.

258
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,416
He's treated all of us like
shit, myself included.

259
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,375
But, even so, I'd help him
as long as he says, truthfully,

260
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,333
that there's some remorse in his
heart for all the rotten crap

261
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,000
that he's done.

Huh? But why?

he might die again...

much about life, but...

all going back together.

tell me how to use this suit!

[KATO]
If he dies...

296
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,791
...nobody will be able
to tell us what's going on.

297

Wait a second... You're really
gonna help that son of a bitch?

Kato, don't do it, please!

If Nishi can't beat it,
how can you?!

Yeah, Kato...
It's... not a good idea!

301

How does it work?

302
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,916
Well, you should...

303
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,166
...be okay, as long as
you stay focused, but...

304
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,625
Thank you, Kei.

305
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,041
I want... to go home.

Wh... What?

I want to go home...

310

Huh? He disappeared!

Now he's being shot!
