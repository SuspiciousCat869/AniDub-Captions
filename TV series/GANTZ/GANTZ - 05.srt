00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,708
a human fax machine.

161
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,166
We're copies.

[KISHIMOTO'S MOM]
Shiori?

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,041
[KISHIMOTO'S MOM]
This is Shiori, right...?

165
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,916
Who... Who is this?

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,750
Who am I speaking to?!

You'll catch your death if
you sleep out here! Heh, heh!

170
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,750
That's right. It was
on this very platform

171
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,708
that two local high school
students suddenly disappeared.

172
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,333
They were helping a man who
had fallen on the tracks.

173
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,833
[KATO'S AUNT]
This isn't funny!

174
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,916
He came home soaking wet!

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,916
I'm sorry. I was going to meet
him at his school but I--

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,291
[KATO'S AUNT]
Rain's very dirty.

177
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,250
I'll have to wash his
clothes separately.

178
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,625
You've got to think
about these things!

179
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,750
Although, I guess
it's not surprising.

The two of you are
just a couple of

182
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:35,875
I know that.

[KATO'S AUNT]
Oh, for Pete's sake!

184
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,458
My brother and that woman

185
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,125
just had to run off and
get hitched, didn't they?

186
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,375
They just had to pop
out a couple of runts

187
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,416
and then up and die! But
did it ever occur to them

188
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,750
to stop and think about the
burden I'd have to bear?!

I'll go with two hundred grams.

I'm not very hungry right now.

192
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,416
Okay, you keep an eye
on the house for me.

[KATO]
Yes, ma'am.

Uh, Momma? Aren't you
going to take Masaru and--

[KATO'S AUNT scoffs]
Absolutely not!

196
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:10,916
[AYUMU]
Masaru...?

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,250
[TV ANNOUNCER]
Wouldn't that be considered

198
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,833
police evidence, Taka?

199
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,166
Actually, no, they're not even
convinced this is a case, yet.

200
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,500
So, they're saying
this isn't even worth

201
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,958
considering as evidence.

202
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,208
[AYUMU]
Masaru?

203
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,458
That's my umbrella.

204
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,708
[KATO] When I get paid
for my part-time job,

205
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,041
we'll go out for steak.

206
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,166
Um, I liked that umbrella.

207
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,500
[KATO]
Huh?

208
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,416
One of the kids at school
told me that the "A.K."

209
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,208
looked really cool. So I
told him just how you did it.

210
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,875
I told him that you
carved it with a boxcutter.

211
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:56,750
[AYUMU] So, um. Just where...
were you yesterday?

212
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,583
Did you leave my
umbrella in the subway?

213
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,041
[AYUMU]
Is... something... wrong?

214
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,208
An eyewitness described
the first boy

215
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,541
as being tall and muscular,

216
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,833
while the second was of
a medium height and build,

217
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,375
although a bit sketchy-looking
in appearance.

218
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,208
According to the same witness,
it was the "sketchy" one

219
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,958
who dropped the adult magazine.

220
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,000
It's being reported
that the police are now

221
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,541
using this information as
a lead to help uncover

222
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,166
the boys' whereabouts.

thousand. you fuckin' nerd.

want me to do?

[MATSUMURA]
Oh, come on!

263

for me to tag you!

316
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:43,000
You gotta be shitting me!
No one's got that kind of money.

317
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,916
No. I won't pay you. No!

318
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,250
[TACHIBANA]
Huh?

319
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,000
How often... do you brush?

320
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,958
Any cavities?

321
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:29,375
[KURONO] Compared to the
Greenonion Alien, this guy is...

322
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,791
Well, uh... I'm starting
to get the feeling

323
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,208
this guy's actually scarier.

324
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,375
[KURONO grunts]

325
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,625
[TACHIBANA] You got a big,
dumb mouth, kid.

326
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,000
Now... Try saying that again!

327
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,250
[TACHIBANA]
Oh, come on. Say it again.

328
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,000
Who is it that's not
gonna pay, little bitch!

329
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,208
[KURONO]
Shit!

330
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,000
Why can't I use this
goddamn cosplay suit?

331
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:58,583
Now that I'm thinkin' about it,
those tits were really--

332
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,916
--[TACHIBANA grunts]
--[KURONO groans]

333
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,166
[KURONO] Hey! Why am I
thinkin' about that now?!

334
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,750
At a time like this?

335
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,791
[TACHIBANA grunts]

336
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,833
[KURONO] Aw, fuck.
I've stopped feeling pain.

337
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,083
[KURONO sighs]

338
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,250
I wish... I could
see her again.

339
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,125
You think maybe...
Heh, heh, heh...

340
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,541
We went a little
too far this time?

341
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,291
He's stopped movin'.

342
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,291

343
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,000
[TACHIBANA]
Yeah...

344
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,708
[grunts]

345
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,000
[KURONO breathes weakly]

346
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,875
[KURONO]
Come to think of it...

347
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,583
Last night, she was
wearing my clothes.

348
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:47,250
That means... at the
time... she was...

349
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,125
[KURONO]
Oh, shit.

350
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,208
Huh?

351
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,125
What the fuck is this?!

352
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,500
[YONEKURA]
What's the matter?

353
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,083
[TACHIBANA]
This little fag's got a hard on!

354
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,333
[gasps]

355
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,125
[KURONO]
Oh, wait!

356
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,875
I... think it's
starting to work!

357
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,250
Got the wrong idea, kid!

358
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,458
I'll fuckin' kill you!

359
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,541
[gasps]

360
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,666
I'm not... paying you.

361
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,666
Say what? You can't
be that stupid.

362
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,083
Tachibana,
it's okay to kill him.

363
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,666
What... in the fuck?!

364
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,250
[KURONO] I could crush
his arm like this!

365
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,291
[shouts]

366
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,833
[KURONO]
Should I crush it?

367
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,000
[YONEKURA] What are you
waiting for, Tachibana?

368
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,916
I said you could
get rid of him now.

369
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,666
[TACHIBANA grunts]
Damn it!

370
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,708
Let... go of me!

371
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,291
[groans]

372
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,416
[YONEKURA]
Hasta La Vista, dipshit.

373
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,458
Don't fuck with me you little--!

374
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,708
[TACHIBANA grunts]

375
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,916
[BOTH gasp]

376
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,458
[TACHIBANA groans]

377
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:20,041
And now , the one of
you who isn't a punk...

378
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,333
You can go home now.

379
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,500
Dude. What the
fuck just happened?

380
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,041
[heatbeats]

381
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,583
[KURONO]
Aw, damn it!

382
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,250
My hands... won't stop shaking.

383
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,708
[gasps]

384
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,458
[KURONO]
No way!

385
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,333
Is this for real?

386
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,458
[KATO] We all have
something to protect.

387
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:52,541
Fear, anger,
impatience, violence.

388
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,000
All of these exist
outside of the room.

389
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,333
Violence exists all around us.

390
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,833
Isn't that right,
little brother?
