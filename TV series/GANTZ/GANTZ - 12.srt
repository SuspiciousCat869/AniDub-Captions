1
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,125
[KURONO]
This... could be really bad...

2
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,708
[RYOTA]
Grandma, where are we going?

3
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,583
I'm finally taking you
home to your mother, dear.

4
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,541
[KURONO]
Yeah, this is very bad...

5
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,791
Kurono, I...

6
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,416
[KURONO] I'm actually
getting used to this.

7
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,416
I don't feel sick anymore.

8
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,375
I'm not even... scared or
sorry when I see people die.

9
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,250
Did you just say something?

10
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,500
Are you all right?

11
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,083
Ah, it's nothing...

12
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,958
[KURONO]
This is Japan, right?

13
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,333
And we're in the middle
of a residential area...

14
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,750
So why does it feel
like a warzone?!

15
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,875
A-And what am I doing
with this thing anyway?

16
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:24,541
All I do know... is I better
make sure to hold onto it.

17
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,375
If I don't, it's gonna be bad.

18
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,333
[TETSUO]
So... What do we do now?

19
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,583
[HOJO] You said there's
more of them, right?

20
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,791
[KATO]
Yeah.

21
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,458
Hold on. Where'd the
old lady and the kid go?

22
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,291
Where did--

23
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,250
They're gone!

24
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,750
[HOJO]
Oh, great.

25
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,083
If Grandma Senile and her
annoying brat run into an alien

26
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,083
on their own, they're both
going to be dead meat!

27
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,333
Hey, cry me a fucking river!

28
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,375
Why should we give a
fuck about that old bag

29
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,625
and her annoying little shit?

30
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,958
Because it's right!

31
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,375
And kids are supposed to
be like that, you dumbass!

32
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,250
Yeah?! Well, why don't
you shut the hell up?!

33
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,375
You're not the fucking
boss around here!

34
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,791
Or have you forgotten
that Kosuke and Kinji

35
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,250
got their heads blown off?

36
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,125
And you couldn't do a
fucking thing about it!

37
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:16,166
So tell me, who in the hell do
you think you are, asshole?!

38
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,375
[retches]

39
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,958
It's just like the guns.

40
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,541
I guess here even
puking has a time-lag.

41
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,791
Kurono, that's not
in good taste!

42
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,541
How can you be the big man if
you can't hold your lunch? Huh?

43
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,291
Go fuck yourself.
And instead of talkin' smart,

44
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,875
how 'bout you
gimme back my tooth?!

45
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,500
Come get it, fat boy!

46
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,791
--[KATO] Enough!
--[ALL] Huh?

47
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,125
If you wanna be free
from this, listen up!

48
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,125
I'm going to try to find and
destroy that other Suzuki Alien,

49
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,500
do you understand?

50
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,458
And I'm going to try to find
the old lady and the boy

51
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,916
while I'm at it.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,416
And if any of you want to
make it through this alive,

53
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,666
then you've got to help me out!

54
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,458
You said something before...

55
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,583
...about freeing
ourselves from this...

56
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,500
I think you mentioned a score.

57
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,333
I don't know if that
part's true or not,

58
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,500
but we'll never find
out unless we try.

59
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,458
It's our only choice.

60
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,708
To be straight up with you,

61
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,000
I'd really rather not
trust you with my life.

62
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,166
But seeing as how that stupid
biker got his head blown off

63
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,458
for no reason...

64
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,916
Just where did that happen?

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,500
If ya head back that way,
there's a pay phone that's

66
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,875
covered with Kinji's fuckin'
brains. That might be it.

67
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:23,916
[HOJO]
I get it!

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,166
You die if you
leave this area.

69
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,541
It's about one square kilometer.

70
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,416
But how is that even possible?

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,416
You don't think there's a
bomb or something like that

72
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,708
planted inside of each
of our heads, do you?

73
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,375
And why would someone wanna
keep us here like that?

74
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,416
Does any of this shit
make any fuckin' sense?

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,458
Unfortunately, I'm just as
clueless about it as you are.

76
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,375
What I don't get is how
we're supposed to find

77
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,041
two of those monsters in
a square kilometer block

78
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,500
in just an hour!

79
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, we did last time.

80
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,375
But that doesn't mean we'll
be able to do it every time.

81
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,875
Then again...

82
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,958
We do know that Nishi'd survived
a lot of rounds before us.

83
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,833
[HARUYA]
Ha! That little turd?!

84
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,958
He took out Kosuke
easily enough.

85
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,083
Look, the fact is that we
have to find that other alien.

86
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,916
And right now, we're
wasting precious time!

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,166
Kei, you're not wearing
a suit this time.

88
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,791
So I want you to
stay somewhere safe.

89
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,666
--[KURONO] Huh?
--[KISHIMOTO gasps]

90
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,916
[KISHIMOTO sighs]

91
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,208
[KURONO]
Aw, look at her now.

92
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,708
Just a minute ago,
you were looking at me

93
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,416
like you thought I was cool!

94
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,958
Damn, you're flakey!

95
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,166
--[gun cocks]
--[KURONO gasps]

96
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,250
Okay, junior, now you
do what I tell you to.

97
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,166
[KURONO]
Huh?

98
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,750
[HARUYA]
Not the right answer!

99
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,875
What the hell are you doing?

100
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,333
[HARUYA]
I'll tell you what I'm doing,

101
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,666
you dipshit, fuckin'
has-been of a leader!

102
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,208
I'm taking your damn gun.

103
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,625
God, that hurt... Huh?

104
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,791
Hurry up and hand it over!

105
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,750
[TETSUO] You're a worthless
piece of shit, you know that?

106
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,125
[HARUYA]
Hey, you!

107
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,208
What do you think you're
doin'?! Get back over here!

108
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,875
[HOJO]
Damn it. Where are they?

109
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,541
[KATO] Who? The old lady
or the Suzuki Alien?

110
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,000
[HOJO]
Either of them.

111
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,166
Why don't we ask that taxi
driver for some help?

112
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,750
Because in case you
haven't figured it out,

113
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,416
we're completely
invisible to everyone

114
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,416
until this whole thing is over.

115
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,708
So then... does that mean
we really are dead?

116
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,291
[RYOTA wails]

117
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,958
Now where in the world
do you suppose we are?

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,041
[RYOTA crying] I'm hungry!
I can't walk anymore!

119
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,416
Oh... You poor thing...

120
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,625
[HARUYA]
Who the fuck told you to stop?

121
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,750
[KURONO groans]
That really hurt!

122
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,583
Are you crying?
You make me sick!

123
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,541
Ow!

00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,958

Son of a bitch...!

125
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,625
Start walking, kid. Move it!

126
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,875
[KISHIMOTO]
Hey, um, Kato?

127
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,750
[KATO]
Mm-hmm?

128
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,750
Is it true you can't use a gun?

129
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,250
[KATO sighs]

130
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,208
I really think that you should.
Just to be safe, you know?

131
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,583
[KATO sighs]

132
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,166
I mean, I... know you're
trying to do everything that

133
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,791
needs to be done without them,
but... I just... think that--

134
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,166
If you'd pulled that
trigger a little sooner,

135
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,583
that kid would be alive.
Think about that.

136
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,750
That isn't what I was
trying to say at all,

137
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,916
so don't put any
words in my mouth.

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,208
I'll just say this: Females have
stronger survival instincts.

139
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,541
I don't think
that's true at all!

140
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,041
No, you're right.
And... I agree.

141
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,291
But, Kato!

142
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,916
I have to be prepared to do it.

--[beeping]
--[ALL gasp]

145
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,666
[KISHIMOTO]
But which one?

146
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,291
Is it the Suzuki Alien or
the old lady and the boy?

147
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,500
[HOJO]
I can't tell.

148
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,416
We'll know soon enough.

149
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,458

00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,583
Haven't ya figured that
damned thing out yet?!

154
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,041
[KURONO] This isn't mine,
so I think it works differently.

155
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,708
So if it were yours,
you'd know how to use it.
