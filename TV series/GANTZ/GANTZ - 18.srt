go out with me?

162
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,250
[KURONO]
Uh--

163
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:15,583
Oh! Oh, I see.
The age thing. Or wasn't I...

164
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,666
...you know.

165
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,333
[KISHIMOTO] There's something
I want you to understand.

166
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,375
And that's that
I really like you.

167
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,458
I'm serious. I really do think
that you're a great guy.

168
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,791
I mean, I know you're
not at all like Kato...

169
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,375
But even so...

170
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,750
Well, if... you don't
mind the fact that I'm--

171
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:39,791
Oh, I don't.

172
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:50,458
Well, I just... got
my driver's license.

173
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,416
We could drive some place.

174
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,000
[KURONO]
Sounds fun.

175
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,375
[SEI sighs]

176
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,750
You know, you're
an amazing marksman

177
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,125
to have made all those
incredible shots.

178
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,916
What is this thing?

179
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,041
What kind of
nightmare are we in?

180
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,041
[BOTH gasp]

181
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,458
Dude! Up there!

182
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,500
[KONTA]
Huh?

183
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:46,750
[DOG whines]

184
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,708
[KONTA] Aw, shit.
What should we do, man?

185
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,708
[TOMAO]
Do you think it's pissed at us?

186
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,458
How the fuck should
I know? Am I a statue?

187
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,875
But unless I'm wrong...
it's floatin' right at us!

188
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,583
That guy has balls...
big hairy ones.

189
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,875
[KURONO gasps]

190
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,000
Why's that weird fat guy
starin' at me like that?

191
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,333
It's creepin' me out...

192
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,166
It could be that he's gay.
You are cute, after all.

193
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,708
[KURONO sighs]
He's gay?

194
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,708
The only reason he could
do things like that

195
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,833
is because he's wearing
one of the suits.

196
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,125
You've got one of those
suits on, Poindexter,

197
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,833
and it looks like
you're not doin' shit!

198
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,000
Actually, since you
brought it up...

199
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,500
Last time, he killed most
of them without a suit on.

200
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,541
[OKAZAKI]
Whoa...

201
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:04,291
Enough "gaydar." Who the
hell cares? Just move on...

202
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,125
[TOMAO]
Okay...

203
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,416
Now what?

204
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,041
Well, it looks small
enough for us to handle...

205
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,625
Are you kidding?! That
thing's over six feet tall!

206
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,166
Small my ass!

207
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,083
Chill. What I meant is that
it's smaller than the other one!

208
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,333
Should we get help?

209
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,166
Nah, it's cool. I think
I can handle this one.

210
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:36,541
[STATUE chanting]

211
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,541
Oh, man. And now he's
spewing nonsense at us.

212
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,500
He's all yours, dude.

213
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,125
[chuckles]

214
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,458
[SEI gasps]

215
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,416
[KURONO gasps]
Kishimoto!

216
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,166
Kishimoto... Kei?

217
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,208
[KISHIMOTO]
Huh?

218
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,708
I, uh...

219
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:02,708
[KISHIMOTO]
Mm-hmm?

220
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,458
It's strange, Kei...

221
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,333
Could you...?

222
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,583
What?

223
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,416
[KISHIMOTO gasps]

224
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,375
Kishimoto... is fine, okay?

225
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,541
I know calling me
Kei is confusing.

226
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,166
Um, yeah... It kinda is.

227
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,458
I like the way you say
"Kishimoto"... Okay?

228
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,750
Um, anyway, could you be the
sniper next time we go out?

229
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,916
[chuckles]

230
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,708
[KONTA yells]

231
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,666
Gotcha! [growls]

232
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,125
[TOMAO] Whoo! That's
awesome, dude! Kick his ass!

233
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,000
[KURONO gasps]

234
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,166
[ALL]
Huh?

235
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,416
[JJ]
Hm? [gasps]

236
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,583
[JJ]
Jesus H. Christ...

237
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,333
[OKAZAKI]
It's big...

238
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,041
But it's just a big
statue of Buddha, right?

239
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,708
I mean, we got a whole
bunch of guns over here.

240
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,500
We're gonna shoot
the shit out of 'em!

241
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,958
Oh, sweet Jesus. I don't
wanna die. I don't wanna die!
