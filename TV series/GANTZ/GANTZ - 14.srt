[TETSUO]
Hmph!

2
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,125
[TETSUO] Ah, hey there.
Is this Mr. Iwaki?

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:22,458
Heh, yeah it's me. I got some
pretty cool shit to show ya.

4
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,833
[KURONO]
Yeah, I have money.

5
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,708
Huh? Of course,
I've been going to school!

6
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,916
And, no, I haven't
been skipping class!

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,375
Ugh, look. I gotta go or
I'm gonna be late, okay?

8
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,458
[KURONO]
She thinks I'll be fine

9
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,666
as long as she
throws money at me.

10
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,708
[KURONO gasps]

11
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,166
--[KURONO] Oh, not again!
--Good afternoon.

12
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,750
The apartment building you
see here has been abandoned

13
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,958
since the collapse of the
bubble economy of the 1980s.

14
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,125
Apparently this building, which
one housed a popular restaurant,

15
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,083
suddenly collapsed last night.

16
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,208
--The incident is expected to...
--Was that your mother?

17
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,208
Duh!

18
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,458
What'd she say?

19
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,666
Nothing really, she was
just calling because

20
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,333
--she feels like she has to.
--[ANCHOR] There's been no

21
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,208
--Uh-huh...
--explanation for the collapse.

22
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,541
We've also been informed
that the second-floor roof

23
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,916
of a residence located
about 200 meters

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,375
from the apartment
building also collapsed...

25
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,875
[KURONO] What was all that
shit about last night?

26
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,625
I thought we'd become at
least a little closer...

27
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,833
I guess we just did
it to save Kato...

28
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,500
This sucks...

29
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,333
[ANCHOR]
Now, the latest on that story.

30
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,958
[REPORTER] Tonight, two
boys--are they missing or not?

31
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,416
And the only clue...

32
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,291
[KURONO] God, are they still
talking about that, too?!

33
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,125
Oh, except now of course
it's become the story about

34
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,333
the high school students
"with the adult magazine"!

35
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,375
Well, you shouldn't have left

36
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,250
your magazine
behind, should you?

37
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,916
At least, I'm <i>assuming</i>
it's yours.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,875
After all, Kato wouldn't be
reading something like that.

39
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,625
And what makes you so sure?

40
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,125
Because he told us that he's
staying his relative's house

41
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,916
with his little
brother, remember?

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,833
He's too thoughtful for that.

43
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,458
[KURONO]
Yeah... Kato's a total saint.

44
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,958
Plus, he has too much
else to worry about.

45
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,666
[KISHIMOTO] I mean, he has to
take care of his little brother.

46
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,125
And when we're all
at that apartment,

47
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,208
he worries about us so much.

48
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,958
I think he's just an
extremely caring person.

49
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,458
[KURONO] Hmph. Or maybe
he just likes to butt in.

50
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,583
Well, sometimes people
need to do that!

51
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,083
If it weren't for Kato,
where would we all be now?

52
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,333
Think about that!

53
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,833
Yeah. Are you forgetting
who pulled the trigger?

54
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,625
[KISHIMOTO] Well, yeah,
that's true, but...

55
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,833
[KURONO]
Now that I've been there twice,

56
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,375
I understand one
thing perfectly.

57
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,833
Being caring doesn't mean
shit if you wanna survive.

58
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,541
Kato can babble all he wants
about us going back together,

59
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,333
but it's not that easy.

60
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,125
[KISHIMOTO] Yeah, in the
end... I agree with you.

61
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,625
[gasps]

62
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:58,291
[KISHIMOTO] No, really.
I think you're right.

63
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,125
And... that's good.

64
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,833
[KURONO]
What the hell's up with her?

65
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,375

breakfast like that?!

And by the way, I know you
came in the house yesterday

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,500
with muddy shoes! Look what
you've done to the damn foyer!

71
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,791

with you, but no longer!

has the nerve to
ask me for breakfast

00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:43,125

some breakfast for him.

So you could please--

Oh, did you now? Forget it!

Please stop! That's enough...

think you are, huh? Huh?!

at me like that.

Please stop hitting him!

Kato was just trying his hardest
to help everyone else survive...

108
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:26,791
He's the kind of guy that values
all the life around him equally.

Not this bullshit again.

stole some books again.

It's the third time this week!

And from what I've heard now,

129
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,500
he's selling the
books he shoplifts.

[deep breath]

131
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,833
I'm sorry. May I help you?

132
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,791
[SEI] I was wondering about the
book I ordered the other day.

133
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,916
Right... Let me see here...

134

[YOSHIDA]
Uh, what's your name, ma'am?

135
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,166
Sakuraoka. Sei Sakuraoka.

136
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,750
[KISHIMOTO]
Huh...

137
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:34,375
What a beautiful name. I wonder
what kanji she uses to write it.

138
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,541
[YOSHIDA] Let me see...
Oh, yes, I remember.

139
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,333
Miranda Foster's <i>Labyrinth</i> ,
that's right.

140
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,833
I'm afraid it's a very
hard title to find

141
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,458
since it's extremely rare
and seldom reprinted.

142
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,541
Any guess as to when
you might get it?

143
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,333
Oh, well... Hopefully,
I'll have it some time

144
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,333
around the end of next week.

145
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,958
But I'll be sure to call
you when it comes in.

That's great. Thank you so much.

It's kind of a long story...

151

story behind this piece of shit!

Come on, you gotta be shittin'.

155
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,791
Who the hell would want this
piece of shit, you moron?

156
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,541
So... is that a no, then?

157
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,166
Are you saying you ain't
got my money, loser?

158
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,375
That's too bad. Give it up now!

159
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,291
Are you gonna take
it to the grave?

160
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,291
[IWAKI]
What did you just say?

161
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,416
See, you don't
need any money, man,

162
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,583
'cause you're gonna
be dead real soon.

163
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,708
[gasps]

164
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,958
Nobody... can fuck with me!

165
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,541
[laughs]

166
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,166
--[KIDS laughing]
--[KID] Pick me up! Pick me up!

167
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:31,791
[KATO]
This is it.

168
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,291
[AYUMU]
Huh?

169
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,250
[KATO] I was able to save up
enough money for this place

170
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,958
at my part-time job.

171
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,500
This is our home now.

172
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,541
Huh?

173
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,750
Yes! Yes! We did it!

174
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,875
I'm so sorry, Ayumu.

175
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,791
[AYUMU]
Huh? What for?

176
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,625
If I'd saved more, we could
have moved out sooner...

177
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,583
Are you kidding?
This is awesome!

178
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,500
From now on, I won't have
to put up with her beatings.

179
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,250
And that's what's
important, right?

180
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,500
[gasps]

181
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,708
Oh, Ayumu...

182
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,541
We'll make it together,
Big Brother.

183
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,583
I'll go get a job
and help out, too!

184
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,833
[KATO] Don't be silly!
You still have to go to school!

185
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,916
But wait... What are
we gonna sleep on?

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,125
[KATO] Oh, one of my friend
has a couple of old futons

187
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,125
that he can give us.
I'll go get them now.

188
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,500
[AYUMU]
Hey, I'll come, too!

189
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,416
They're too heavy for you
to lift by yourself!

190
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,833
[KATO]
I'll be fine, all right?

191
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,750
You just stay home and watch TV.

192
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,833
And since it's our place,
you can even watch anime.

193
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,375
[AYUMU]
Can I really?!

194
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,875
Yep, and you can
watch it every day!

195
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,333
[laughs]

196
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,291
[KISHIMOTO]
Well, here's the change.

197
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,000
Ya know, it's getting expensive
shopping in convenience stores

198
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,250
all the time, and I'd be
happy to cook as long as

199
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,458
it's nothing fancy.

200
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,375
Aw, don't worry about it.

201
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,708
[KURONO]
I mean...

202
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,500
It's not like we're
livin' together or anything.

203
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,333
I could cook tomorrow
if you'd like.

204
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,000
[KURONO]
It's fine!

205
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,791
What are you so mad about?

206
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,375
I'm not mad, damn it!

207
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,750
Well, you sure are
acting like you are.

208
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,750
[KURONO] And I be you
wouldn't be nagging me like this

209
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,291
if I were Kato!

210
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,000
[KATO]
Great. They're still here.

211
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,458
[baby cries]

212
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,083
[TETSUO] You know,
it looks like I'll be makin'

213
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,375
a little more money
startin' next month.

214
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,541
[WIFE]
Oh, really...?

215
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,125
[TETSUO] Ya wanna move?
To a bigger place?

216
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,791
We don't have that
kind of money.

217
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,708
[TETSUO chuckles]
We'll be just fine.

218
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,791
[WIFE]
Right...

219
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,291
[TETSUO]
Hey! Enough with your bullshit!

220
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,958
--All right?
--[WIFE] My bullshit?

221
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,833
[TETSUO] Yeah! And what
the hell are you doin'?

222
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,166
You're not producin' milk!

223
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,958
What else am I gonna do?

224
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,625
My husband wastes his money
on his fucking cigarettes

225
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,708
but never buys a damn
thing for his baby.

226
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,125
[TETSUO] What the hell
are you talkin' about?

227
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,375
I got a call from the
construction site, and they said

228
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,833
none of you assholes
showed up for work today.

229
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,708
They also said not to
bother coming back!

230
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:07,166
It's so fucking pathetic.
They fired all four of you.

231
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,416
Did you get the umbrella
from your friend, too?

232
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,833
Yeah. That's right.

233
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,708
Your friends are really cool.

234
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,666
[KATO]
Yeah... I guess they are.

235
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,041
Okay, it's all done!

236
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,416
Look.

237
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,458
Oh, that's so awesome!
It's just like the old one!

238
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,583
I'm afraid I kinda
spent all our money

239
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,833
getting us this new place but...

240
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,500
I'll start saving up again.

241
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,625
[AYUMU]
It's cool.

242
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,125
Heh, I'm gonna sleep
with this tonight!

243
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,000
But then you'll have
dreams about the rain.

244
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,041
That's all right
with me, Big Brother.

245
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,083
Now I can't wait for it to rain.

246
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,666
[AYUMU] Okay, good night.
I'm going to sleep now.

247
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,583
[KATO]
Ayumu...

248
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,916
Uh-huh?

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,541
I just... hope you
sleep well tonight.

250
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,958
[KISHIMOTO]
Hey, Kurono?

251
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,208
When I was killing time at
the bookstore this afternoon,

252
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,875
I noticed this beautiful
girl at the counter.

253
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,125
[KURONO]
Uh-huh?

254
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,750
[KURONO]
What the fuck do I care?

255
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,541
[KISHIMOTO]
Her name was Sei Sakuraoka.

256
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,000
It looked like she had ordered
some book called <i>Labyrinth</i> .

257
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,000
[KURONO]
Really...

258
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,791
[KISHIMOTO] All I've been
reading are study guides

259
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,208
and collections from
the great masterpieces.

260
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:26,583
So it made me wonder... what
kind of book <i>Labyrinth</i> might be.

261
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,500
[sighs]

262
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,083
Do you read books like that?

263
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,125
I'm afraid not. I don't
go for that nerd stuff.

264
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,875
[KISHIMOTO] I wonder what
Kato's doing right about now.

265
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,625
[TETSUO]
What are you talking about?

266
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh come on, now. It's like now
I'm asking you to give up

267
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,791
your bike, God forbid.
As if you would.

268
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,250
And speaking of that,
where were you last night?

269
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,791
What the hell do you mean?

270
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,375
You never came back last night,

271
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,291
and I don't know how many
times I tried calling you!

272
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,500
Why the hell did you
turn off your cell?!

273
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,416
I told ya, I was
out of the area!

274
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,166
Yeah, sure. I bet you
were out fuckin' around

275
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,125
with your boy Haruya again. And
all your friends' cell phones

276
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,000
were off lat night, too?
Is that a coincidence?

277
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,083
I was not fuckin'
around with my friends!

278
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,750
Then why was your goddamn
phone turned off?!

279
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,416
You wouldn't uderstand,
even if you tried to listen!

280
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,791
That's bullshit!

281
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,791
No, actually, you're bullshit!

282
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,208
And I was not-- I wasn't--
A-All fuckin' night!

283
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:32,375
[WIFE] So there was that much
hot snatch out there, huh? Huh?!

284
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,791
[KISHIMOTO yawns] I bet
Kato has a lot on his mind.

285
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,333
He seemed so troubled.

286
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,666
[KURONO]
Ugh, gimme a break!

287
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,416
I thought you were agreeing
with me this morning!

288
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,250
[KISHIMOTO] But even so,
he was trying so hard

289
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,083
to save all our lives...

290
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,125
[KURONO]
Oh yeah, he was trying.

291
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,166
But if you think about it, he
really wasn't all that helpful.

292
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,708
[KISHIMOTO gasps]
What?!

293
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,583
Why do you say awful things
like that? It just isn't true!

294
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,875
[KURONO]
Oh, really?

295
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,666
[KISHIMOTO] Yeah!
There's one for every person

296
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,916
in this world, you know?

297
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,291
[KURONO]
What?

298
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,583
[KISHIMOTO] A role.
Everybody has a role to play.

299
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,166
[KURONO]
Huh?

300
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,083
It's like how it was your
role to beat the aliens.

301
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,041
While Kato concentrated
on protecting everyone.

302
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,541
It all balances out.

303
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,875
[KURONO]
Whatever...

304
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,958
[KISHIMOTO]
But honestly, I think that...

305
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,333
...both of you... are amazing.

306
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,750
And Kato's just... the
kind of guy who values

307
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,333
the lives of everyone
around him equally.

308
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,583
[KISHIMOTO] He's caring
and strong... like no other.

309
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:38,125
I don't know... He's just
different from everyone else.

310
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,916
[KURONO]
Just what are you trying to say?

311
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Huh?

312
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,625
What the hell are you saying?!

313
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,583
Are you saying...
that just because

314
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,333
you couldn't reach my phone
for one fucking night,

315
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,625
that I must be cheating on
you or some shit? Huh?!

316
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,291
Fine then, Mr. "Out of Area,"
why don't you prove to me

317
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,416
you weren't fucking
around then, okay?!

318
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,750
Because I can't,
you goddamn bitch!

319
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,833
I... was just...

320
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,875
Are you really trying
to intimidate me

321
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,208
with a fucking toy gun?
Give me a break, ass wipe.

322
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,333
You bitch... I'll kill you!

323
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,750
Oh, bring it on! Go ahead,
shoot me, big man!

324
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,000
[WIFE]
Oh, this is bullshit!

325
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,666
How are we supposed to
live with no money?!

326
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,000
And who's gonna give a
low-life biker like you

327
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:22,375
a job in this economy?
Huh? Come on, answer me!

328
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,541
Answer me!

329
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,541
Just make up your
mind and answer me!

330
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,541
Why are you so damn indecisive?!

331
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:32,166
Look... I'm sorry! I didn't
mean to... sound that way.

332
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,041
You move into my place
out of the blue,

333
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,500
but I don't even
get to touch you!

334
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,583
And it's always, "Kato this,
Kato that. Oh, Kato!"

335
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,833
[KISHIMOTO]
Hey! Now wait a minute!

00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,958
[KURONO]
Kato! Kato! Kato!

337
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,416
I know what you were thinking.

338
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,916
Last night, when you asked
Kato if he lives by himself.

339
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,791
Okay. What did I mean?

340
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,666
You were asking because
you were thinking about

341
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,791
moving in with him,
instead of me, right?

342
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,125
Except I never said that, did I?

343
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,083
[KURONO]
Ugh!

344
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,333
You might as well have.

345
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,041
It's perfectly obvious
you're just using me.

346
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,333
I can't believe how
stupid I've been!

347
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,666
Why don't you just get out?!

348
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,875
Why don't you just get
the hell out of here now?!

[BABY cries]

350
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,708
What the hell
am I doing, anyway?

351
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,250
What in the hell am I
doing with you, anyway?!

352
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,791
Free food, free rent.
And for what?!

353
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,625
I guess you're right.

354
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,708
It's not like my keeping up with
my education means much to you.

355
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:35,416
I don't understand the way
this world works at all, Kurono.

--everything all better, is it?
--[KURONO] Oh, fuck!

[KISHIMOTO]
And you're right...

360
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,625
I know that life isn't
supposed to be that easy.

[KURONO]
No! Whoa, hold up!

But there's something

I want you to understand.

364
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,166
And that's that
I really like you.

365

I really do think...
that you're a great guy.
