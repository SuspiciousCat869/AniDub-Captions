1
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,791
- ( sighs ) MADE IT.

2
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,208
I BROUGHT US
SOME MEAT DUMPLINGS, KAORU.

3
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,666
I GOT THE VERY LAST TWO.

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,666
HEY, KAORU, WHERE'D YOU GO?

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,666
SHE'S NOT BACK AT THE PLATFORM?

6
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,875
WHERE WERE YOU?

7
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,833
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO STAY HERE
AND WATCH OUR STUFF FOR A WHILE.

8
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,416
- I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU
HAD TO DO SOMETHING?

10
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,916
- ( clicking )

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,416
- ( gasps )

12
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,208
- Announcer: LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

13
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,916
WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE
SOURCE OF THE POWER FAILURE.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,666
PLEASE REMAIN SEATED.

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,333
- I HOPE IT ISN'T
SOMETHING MAJOR.

16
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,500
IF THE TRAIN'S DELAYED WE WON'T
GET BACK TO KYOTO TONIGHT.

17
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,416
OH, KAORU, NO!

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,208
DID YOU CAUSE THE POWER FAILURE?

19
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,625
- UH...
- DON'T LIE!

20
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,791
- ( laughing )

21
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,583
- ( theme song playing )

22
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

23
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,250
- WE'D APPRECIATE IT IF

24
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,291
YOU'D LET US STAY FOR THE NIGHT
SINCE OUR TRAIN GOT DELAYED.

25
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,875
- IF YOU DON'T MIND.

26
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,500
- OH, SO YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST
SHOW UP ON OUR DOORSTEP, HUH?

27
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,875
- NO, OF COURSE WE DON'T MIND.

28
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,125
MAKE YOURSELVES
AT HOME, YOU TWO.

29
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,416
- DON'T SAY THAT!

30
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,583
- THANKS, BIG BROTHER,
WE WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE.

31
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,416
- NOT AT ALL, WE PROMISE.

32
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,541
- I'M SURE YOU WON'T.

33
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,166
- BROTHER SEIJI IS STILL
AT THE HOSPITAL

34
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,666
WITH GRANDPA RYUUHEI?

35
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,791
- TURNS OUT GRAMPS HAD SOME
SCRAPES TOO FROM THAT NIGHT.

36
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,083
HE JUST WAITED 'TIL I WAS IN THE
CLEAR TO SAY ANYTHING, OLD GOOF.

37
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,833
- AND HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- ME? OKAY.

38
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,083
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
HE'S DOING JUST FINE!

39
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,916
- REALLY? I THOUGHT THE DOCTOR

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,125
SAID TO TAKE IT EASY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,875
- SHUT YOUR TRAP, SHORT STUFF!

42
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,958
- WELL, THAT WASN'T VERY NICE.

43
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,458
- ARE YOU STILL IN ANY PAIN?

44
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,666
- NOT REALLY, AS LONG AS
I DON'T MOVE AROUND TOO MUCH.

45
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,833
- WELL, LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, OKAY?

46
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,500
- IF HE NEEDS ANYTHING,
I WILL GET IT FOR HIM!

47
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,625
- HEY, KOUHEI, DID YOU HEAR
SOMETHING JUST NOW?

48
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,583
- ( both growling )

49
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,041
- ON YOUR MARKS! LET'S MAKE
THIS A CLEAN FIGHT, LADIES.

50
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,625
- DON'T ENCOURAGE THEM, HAIJI.

51
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,541
- AW.

52
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,458
- I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THIS.

53
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,208
- THANKS, KAORU,
YOU JUST READ MY MIND.

54
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,958
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
WAS ONE OF YOUR GIFTS.

55
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,000
- WAIT A MINUTE, THIS IS OUR
TEA. SHE STOLE THAT TEA FROM US!

56
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,625
- ( sighs ) COME ON, HAZUKI.

57
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,458
- IF THESE GRUBBY FREAKS START
GRUBBY-HANDING OUR STUFF

58
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,000
AND MOVING IT ALL AROUND,

59
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,291
WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND
ANYTHING IN THE KITCHEN AGAIN!

60
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,625
- YEAH, LIKE WE CAN
FIND ANYTHING IN THERE NOW.

61
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,416
- HE DOES HAVE A POINT, MASTER.

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,958
- Haiji: TRUE OR FALSE. THE
CHOPSTICKS ARE IN THE DRAWER.

63
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,208
- Kouhei: FALSE. FOUND 'EM
IN THE FRIDGE THIS MORNING.

64
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,625
- AND THE SOY SAUCE.
ON THE TABLE, CORRECT?

65
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,333
- IN THE FOYER
UNDER AN ORNAMENTAL FAN.

66
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,750
- A WORLD OF PAIN!

67
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,250
- ( both exclaim )

68
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,291
- ANYWAY, IT'S NOT REALLY
YOUR KITCHEN AT ALL,

69
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,625
IS IT, LITTLE MISS MOOCH?

70
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,708
- DID SHE JUST... DID YOU
JUST CALL ME A MOOCH?

71
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,916
- WELL HEY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW. IT
DOES UNDERSTAND HUMAN LANGUAGES.

72
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,833
- THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
FOR A DEMON.

73
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,208
- ( gasps )

74
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,833
HOLD IT, FOUR-EYES!
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?

75
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,000
- ( whimpers )

76
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,083
- BROTHER KOUHEI!

77
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,458
THE DEMON-GIRL'S
YELLING AT MY SISTER.

78
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,708
- SAY "DEMON"
ONE MORE TIME, SPELL-GIRL!

79
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,750
- HAZUKI, CUT IT OUT.

80
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,750
- DON'T YOU SAY "CUT IT OUT"
TO ME, YOU TRAITOR!

81
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,041
YOU'RE MY SLAVE
AND YOU'RE TAKING

82
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,708
THEIR STUPID SIDE AGAINST ME!

83
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,625
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. COME ON!

84
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,333
- FINE! THEN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT!

85
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,583
MAYBE THEY CAN STAY.

86
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,375
THEY'RE PROBABLY BETTER
COOKS THAN ME ANYWAY.

87
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,333
- HAZUKI, PLEASE, DON'T BE
LIKE THAT OH, WHOA, OUCH!

88
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,416
- ( gasps )

89
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,875
- ( gasps ) KOUHEI!

90
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,208
- ( whimpers )

91
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,958
- DO YOU FEEL DIZZY?
- DO YOU NEED TO LIE DOWN?

92
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,791
- SHOULD I GO GET A DOCTOR?
- WHERE DOES IT HURT?

93
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,625
- All: FEEL BETTER?

94
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,875
- OH, DEFINITELY.

95
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,541
THE THERMOMETER REALLY
DID THE TRICK, THANKS.

96
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,208
- All: REALLY? I'LL GO
GET ANOTHER ONE!

97
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,833
- GET BACK HERE, I WAS JUST
KIDDING! AND QUIT FREAKIN' OUT!

98
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,583
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M AN INVALID,
GIRLS. I JUST NEED SOME REST.

99
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,750
- Haiji: THIS'LL
KNOCK HIM OUT, MASTER!

100
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:50,916
- WHAT IS THAT STUFF?

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,958
- ( grunting )

102
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,708
- All: WHOA!

103
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,583
- I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
I'M DRINKING THAT, HAIJI!

104
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,583
- IT'S GOOD FOR YA.
PUTS HAIR ON YOUR CHEST.

105
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,125
- I FEEL BETTER! REALLY!

106
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:05,833
- Man: HAVE A GOOD NIGHT!

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,416
- ( motorcycle engine starts )

108
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,250
- All: WOW!

109
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,791
- REAL PIZZA DELIVERED RIGHT TO
YOUR DOOR. IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.

110
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,666
-IT'S THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL THING EVER.

111
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,416
- AND JUST THINK. IF WE'D GONE
HOME WE NEVER WOULD'VE SEEN IT.

112
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,166
- GOOD THING OUR TRAIN
BROKE DOWN.

113
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,375
- I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
GET SO EXCITED OVER PIZZA.

114
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,666
YOU TWO ARE EASILY IMPRESSED.

115
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,791
- ( both giggling )

116
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,333
- THEY'RE COUNTRY
BUMPKINS, KOUHEI.

117
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,375
- ( scoffs )

118
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,791
- ( whimpers )

119
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,416
- WOULD YA LAY OFF THEM ALREADY?
JUST FOCUS ON DINNER.

120
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,583
- ALL RIGHT, THEN! HAIJI
AND I CLAIM ONE WHOLE PIZZA!

121
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,750
- ( snoring )

122
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,791
- OH, MY I BELIEVE YOUR
SHIKIGAMI'S GONE AND

123
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,583
GOTTEN HERSELF A LITTLE
SLOSHED, HAZUKI.

124
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,041
LOOKS LIKE WE COUNTRY BUMPKINS

125
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,083
AREN'T THE ONLY
UNCIVILIZED ONES, HUH?

126
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,625
- WHY DON'T YOU WAKE UP
AND DEFEND YOURSELF?

127
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,291
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME,
YOU LUSH!

128
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,875
- ( laughs ) TAKE A
LOOK AT THIS, KAORU,

129
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,500
IT'S A DRUNKEN LITTLE ELF!

130
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,958
WHAT'S WRONG, KAORU?
WHAT IS IT?

131
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,875
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING FOR, KID?
ARE YOU OKAY?

132
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,500
- ( whimpering )

133
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,833
- KAORU, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

134
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,375
- ARE YOU OKAY?
COME ON, TALK TO US!

135
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,333
- ( continues whimpering )

136
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,666
- WHAT IS IT?
- ARE YOU CHOKING?

137
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,541
YOU ALLERGIC? WHAT'S WRONG?

138
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,333
- IT'S JUST THAT...

139
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,541
THIS PIZZA'S SO GOOD!

140
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,625
- ( sighs )

141
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,458
IT IS OUR FIRST ONE.

142
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,791
- OH. WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE LIKIN' IT.

143
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,250
( laughs )

144
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,875
- CRYING OVER PIZZA?

145
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:33,375
SUCH A PATHETIC BACKWATER
THING TO DO. WHAT A HEADCASE...

146
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,333
- WE'RE BOTH GLAD
YOU LIKE IT, KAORU.

147
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,916
SO I TAKE IT YOU WANT
ANOTHER SLICE.

148
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,666
- ( all laughing )

149
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,583
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE PRETTY LUCKY
TO BE ENGAGED TO KOUHEI.

150
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,625
- ( giggling )

151
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,875
( screams )

152
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,541
- OH, RELAX. YOUR GLASSES
FELL OFF, THAT'S ALL.

153
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,916
- ( sniffles )

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,166
- COME ON! YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CRY AGAIN, ARE YOU?

155
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,875
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE!

156
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,625
- YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T KILL
YOU TO BE A LITTLE NICER

157
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,000
TO THE TWINS, BRAT.

158
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,833
- I DON'T MEAN TO BE
SO RUDE ALL THE TIME,

159
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,750
BUT THEY KEEP
PISSING ME OFF.

160
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,458
YOU JUST NEVER NOTICE IT
WHEN THEY DO MEAN STUFF TO ME.

161
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,458
- THEY'RE STILL
JUST KIDS, HAZUKI.

162
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,916
OH. WAIT. SO ARE YOU.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,916
- HEY, I'M WAY MORE MATURE
THAN THEY ARE!

164
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,708
TAKE THIS STUFF TO THE
BATHROOM FOR ME, WOULD YA?

165
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,083
- WHAT? YOU WANT ME
TO BRING THE ENEMY CLEAN TOWELS?

166
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,916
FAT CHANCE, MISTER.
YOU'RE THE SLAVE. YOU TAKE 'EM!

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,416
- JUST TAKE THEM, HAZ, OKAY?
I DON'T FEEL TOO GOOD.

168
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,166
I THINK I OVERDID IT
A BIT TONIGHT.

169
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,666
- BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE
OKAY THOUGH, AREN'T YOU?

170
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,875
- YEAH, I'M SURE I'LL BE
JUST FINE IN THE MORNING.

171
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,625
I'M FEELIN' A LITTLE BIT
LIGHTHEADED IS ALL.

172
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,875
I THINK I'LL TURN IN EARLY.

173
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,750
- THEN SLEEP IN TOMORROW.

174
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,458
- THE TWINS WANNA
STOP IN AND SEE GRAMPS

175
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,291
AT THE HOSPITAL TOMORROW
MORNING BEFORE THEY LEAVE.

176
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,208
THEY'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE THEM OUT THERE.

177
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,500
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
MOVE AROUND TOO MUCH.

178
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,375
- DON'T WORRY. I'LL TAKE THE
CAR. I'M SURE IT'LL BE FI...

179
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,458
OKAY, THAT DOES IT,
DEFINITELY TIME FOR BED.

180
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,166
- TOMORROW...
TOMORROW IT HAPPENS.

181
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,750
- YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO
TAKE US, BROTHER KOUHEI.

182
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,125
- I'M DRIVING A CAR.
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

183
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,333
( groans )

184
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,708
- STANDING UP SHOULD
BE EASY, TOO.

185
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,291
- ( whimpers )

186
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,750
- WELL, I CAN'T HAVE YOU TWO
GETTING LOST OUT THERE, CAN I?

187
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,041
TOKYO'S A DANGEROUS CITY.

188
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,875
- BROTHER KOUHEI!

189
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,208
- HUH?

190
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,416
- WHAT THE HELL?

191
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,541
- IT'S A CAT.
- ARE YOU SURE, SISTER?

192
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:58,125
- OF COURSE I'M A CAT. WHAT DO
I LOOK LIKE, A TOASTER OVEN?

193
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,125
- WAIT A MINUTE. IS THAT...
- THE DEMON-GIRL?

194
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,916
- DON'T CALL ME "DEMON-GIRL"!

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,125
- HAZUKI, WHY ARE YOU OUTSIDE?

196
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,500
AND WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU WEARING?

197
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,708
- I'M WEARING MY
ANTI-SUN CAT SUIT!

198
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,083
( imitates meowing )

199
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,125
NOW I CAN TAKE THE LOBOTOMY
TWINS TO THE HOSPITAL

200
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,375
AND THE SUN CAN'T GET TO ME.

201
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,833
SO YOU CAN STAY HOME.

202
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,125
- SO YOU'RE A...
- A CAT!

203
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,250
- JUST CHECKING.

204
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,291
- I'LL BET THAT THING COMES

205
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,916
COMPLETE WITH FLEAS
AND HEARTWORM.

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,500
- I HAD TO MAKE A COSTUME
OVERNIGHT! WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

207
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,083
GLITTER AND SEQUINS?

208
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,333
NOW YOU GET BACK TO BED, KOUHEI!
BRATTY AND DUMMY, YOU FOLLOW ME.

209
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,500
- ALL RIGHT, HAZUKI.
HOLD ON, ONE MORE QUESTION.

210
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,041
- NOW WHAT?

211
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,708
- DO YOU, UH, KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING?

212
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,500
- THE HOSPITAL, DUH!

213
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,208
- THE HOSPITAL'S IN
THE OTHER DIRECTION.

214
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,125
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE MADE A COSTUME

215
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,708
WITH BIGGER
EYE-HOLES, GENIUS.

216
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,208
- THERE ARE NO EYE HOLES!

217
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,000
IF THERE WERE EYE HOLES I'D
BE BURNED TO A CRISP BY NOW!

218
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,708
- SO HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO LEAD THEM ANYWHERE?

219
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,791
- I THINK "PLAN" MIGHT BE
TOO STRONG OF A WORD HERE.

220
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,541
- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
- HAIJI, I NEED YOU!

221
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,125
- HERE! WHAT'S UP?

222
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,166
- I WANT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
- RIGHT-O!

223
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,916
- HIKARU, KAORU.
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE.

224
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,666
AND HURRY UP!

225
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,750
- ( both sigh )

226
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,333
- FINE.

227
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,458
- IF HAIJI'S LEADING US THEN
WHAT DO WE EVEN NEED HER FOR?

228
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,208
- SOME KIND OF PUNISHMENT?

229
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,000
- NOW, STAY ALERT!
WHEN I SAY, "CHECK IN,"

230
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,083
I WANT YOU TO SAY
YOU'RE STILL WITH ME.

231
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,291
- CHECK IN!
- ( both ) WE'RE STILL WITH YOU.

232
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:32,125
- CHECK IN!
- STILL WITH YOU!

233
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,208
- ( sighs ) I HOPE THEY
DON'T KILL EACH OTHER.

234
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,500
- Kinkel: IT'S TRUE OF EVEN
THE MOST STUBBORN MARES.

235
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,125
EVENTUALLY THEY ALL BREAK.

236
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:21,416
- MAN, IT'S HOT! WHAT'S THE
TEMPERATURE TODAY, ANYWAY?

237
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,875
- HOTTEST DAY THIS WINTER,

238
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,416
BUT THERE'S A COOL BREEZE
FOR PEOPLE NOT IN CAT SUITS.

239
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,458
THINK ABOUT SOMETHING
ELSE. WANNA PLAY I SPY?

240
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,583
- NO.

241
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,916
- ( indistinct chatter )

242
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,500
- ( people laughing )

243
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,375
- EVERYBODY'S STARING.
- I'M SO EMBARRASSED.

244
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,583
- HIKARU? KAORU?
ALMOST TIME TO CHECK IN!

245
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,541
- DON'T CALL OUT OUR NAMES
LIKE THAT, IT'S HUMILIATING!

246
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,666
AT LEAST WE REMEMBERED TO

247
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,250
PUT THAT INVISIBILITY
SPELL ON HAIJI.

248
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,583
IF PEOPLE COULD SEE HER
FLOATING AROUND IN FRONT OF US,

249
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,083
WHO KNOWS HOW THEY'D REACT?

250
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,625
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
WE'VE GOT A WALKING,

251
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,125
TALKING FRANKENSTEIN
CAT LEADING THE WAY!

252
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,125
- YOU'RE JUST BEING PARANOID.
NOBODY'S EVEN LOOKING!

253
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,083
- OF COURSE THEY'RE ALL LOOKING,
WHAT ARE YOU, FREAKING BLIND?

254
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,083
- ( people laughing )

255
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,916
- HEY, DO YOU HAVE ANY
EXTRA CHANGE IN THERE?

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,583
- I HAVE A LITTLE.

257
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,958
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA! HUH-UH.

258
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,250
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TICKET
OR I CAN'T LET YOU THROUGH.

259
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,708
- BUT I'M A CAT!
- A CAT, HUH?

260
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,958
- YOU CAN'T EXPECT A CAT
TO CARRY AROUND LOOSE CHANGE.

261
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,791
- WELL, I EXPECT A LOT
FROM TALKING CATS.

262
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,208
- OH. MEOW.

263
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,208
- NICE TRY, KIDDO, BUT NO WAY.
- MEANIE.

264
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,875
- HERE, THIS IS FOR
THE CAT, OKAY?

265
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,166
- REALLY? YOU GUYS ARE ACTUALLY
GONNA PAY FOR THIS NUT-JOB?

266
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,958
- ONWARD! MEOW.
- WE'RE SORRY, SIR.

267
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,125
- THERE ARE PLACES FOR
PEOPLE LIKE YOU, YOU KNOW.

268
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,750
THEY HAVE PADDED WALLS!

269
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,250
- HIKARU! KAORU!
OVER HERE!

270
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,583
- STOP USING OUR REAL NAMES!

271
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,833
- HEY, I THINK THAT'S
THE HOSPITAL! WHAT IS IT?

272
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,916
- ( breathing heavily )

273
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,125
- YOU OKAY, MASTER?

274
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,875
- NO. I'M DYING!

275
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,500
- AW, WHAT'S THE MATTER,
DEMON-GIRL?

276
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,708
YOU HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING UP?

277
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,000
- ( grunts angrily )

278
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,125
- IT'S ALL RIGHT TO
ADMIT DEFEAT, YOU KNOW.

279
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,708
- HURRY UP, YOU LAZY BUMS!
LET'S GO!

280
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,416
MEOW, MEOW, MEOW! MEOW,
MEOW! MEOW, MEOW, MEOW!

281
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,666
- OKAY, SHE'S COMPLETELY INSANE.

282
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,833
- ( elevator bell dings )

283
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:43,000
- OH, SWEET AIR-CONDITIONING!

284
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,708
HEY, AREN'T YOU TWO FORGETTING

285
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,125
TO THANK ME FOR
BRINGING YOU HERE?

286
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,458
- SAY THANK YOU.
- HMPH!

287
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,375
- ( grunting )

288
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,166
COME ON, HIKARU.

289
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,541
SAY, "THANK YOU, HAZUKI."

290
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,333
- THANK YOU, HAZUKI.

291
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,000
- IT WAS MY PLEASURE, HIKARU.

292
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,041
- LET'S HAVE SOME JUICE, HAIJI.
- JUICE!

293
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,041
- I WONDER WHAT
THAT'S ALL ABOUT.

294
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,500
- I GUESS SOMEBODY ON THIS FLOOR
JUST TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

295
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,208
- All: OH, NO!
WHAT IF IT'S...

296
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,583
GRANDFATHER!

297
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,541
- OH, I'M SORRY, ARE YOU
RELATIVES OF HIS?

298
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,708
- WHAT HAPPENED?

299
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,500
WE THOUGHT THEY WERE
MINOR INJURIES...

300
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,625
- YES, WE THOUGHT SO TOO.

301
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,875
- HE LOOKS BAD.
- WILL HE BE OKAY?

302
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,375
- WHERE'S SEIJI MIDO?

303
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,625
- HUH? OH, YOU MEAN THE MAN
WHO WAS WITH HIM EARLIER?

304
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,833
HE LEFT A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

305
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,208
BEFORE ANY OF THIS HAPPENED.

306
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,666
- WHERE'RE YOU GOING?
- Kouhei: WHERE'S SEIJI?

307
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,750
- I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN MAKE IT UP HERE, KOUHEI?

308
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,166
- YEAH. I'LL BE THERE.
I'LL GET A TAXI OR SOMETHING.

309
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,458
- OKAY, BE CAREFUL.

310
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,041
OH, AND DO YOU HAVE SEIJI'S
CELL PHONE NUMBER?

311
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,333
I DON'T HAVE IT MEMORIZED.

312
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,208
- WHAT'S KOUHEI SAYING, HAZUKI?
- I'LL CALL.

313
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,208
- Operator: THE NUMBER
YOU ARE TRYING TO REACH

314
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,958
IS TEMPORARILY OUT OF RANGE.

315
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,416
PLEASE HANG UP AND TRY
YOUR CALL AT ANOTHER TIME.

316
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,458
- I CAN'T REACH SEIJI'S CELL.
- TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON.

317
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,541
- WAIT, I BET HE WENT TO THE
PUBLISHING HOUSE FOR A WHILE.

318
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,166
MAYBE I COULD FIND HIM THERE!

319
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,833
- LET ME GO, I CAN RUN FASTER!
- BUT DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

320
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,916
YOU STAY HERE WITH GRANDFATHER.
I'LL BE BACK WHEN I FIND HIM.

321
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,125
- BUT!

322
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,583
- COMING!

323
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,291
- OH, I FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT!

324
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,083
I THINK IT'S EVEN HOTTER
THAN IT WAS BEFORE!

325
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,041
- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
- OH, I'M GONNA FAINT!

326
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,041
NO! THIS IS NO TIME
TO WUSS OUT. LET'S GO, HAIJI!

327
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,833

SUPER WARP SPEED!

328
00:16:55,916 --> 00:17:00,291
- AH! HAIJI! THAT'S TOO FAST,
I CAN'T KEEP UP!

329
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,833
SERIOUSLY, I'M GONNA FALL DOWN,
HAIJI! PLEASE! SLOW DOWN!

330
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,833
I CAN'T RUN IN THESE
STUPID CAT PAWS!

331
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,916
( screaming )

332
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,708
( groaning )

333
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,458
IT'S A GOOD THING
CATS HAVE NINE LIVES.

334
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,625
- HAZUKI, WE SAW YOU FALL,
YOU ALL RIGHT?

335
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,083
- OF COURSE I'M ALL RIGHT.
CATS ALWAYS LAND ON THEIR FEET.

336
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,166
NOW WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

337
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,791
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE WITH GRANDFATHER,

338
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,916
NOT WORRYING ABOUT
SOME STUPID CAT!

339
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:40,041
ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH DILLYDALLYING.
IT'S TIME TO GO. WHERE'S HAIJI?

340
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,333
( groaning )

341
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,166
I'M OKAY. I'M OKAY.
HAIJI, ARE YOU THERE?

342
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,291
- UH-HUH.

343
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,250
- GOTTA FIND SEIJI.
GOTTA FIND SEIJI.

344
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,708
- JUST A MINUTE.
- LET HER HELP YOU, FIRST.

345
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,333
- I CALL ON SHINA-TO-BE,
GODDESS OF WIND.

346
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,666
LEND ME YOUR POWER.
GIVE ME YOUR BREATH.

347
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,458

348
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,583

349
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,000

350
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,791
OH, THAT FEELS SO GOOD!

351
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,291
- HE'LL STAY WITH YOU UNTIL
YOU TAKE THE CAT SUIT OFF.

352
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,583
- HIS KI GIVES OFF
A KIND OF COOLING ENERGY.

353
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,333

354
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,000
- I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY FIRST.

355
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,625
THANK YOU.

356
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,708

359
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,875
- REGULAR WARP SPEED
IS FINE! HAIJI!

360
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,500
- ( both giggling )

361
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,666
- ALL RIGHT, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GET BACK INSIDE.

362
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,333
- UH-HUH.

363
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,750
- ( breathing heavily )

364
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,750
- SO, YOU'D LIKE
TO SEE SEIJI MIDO?

365
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,708
- YES! IT'S URGENT!

366
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,166
- I, I SEE. URGENT.
AND MAY I ASK HOW YOU KNOW HIM?

367
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,250
- NO! JUST GET YOUR
SKINNY BUTT ON THE PHONE!

368
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,875
- YES, MA'AM.
I'LL CALL RIGHT AWAY.

369
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,541
- GRANDFATHER!
- IS HE ALL RIGHT?

370
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,833
- AH! SEIJI! HAZUKI! HELLO!

371
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,291
- BUT YOU WERE SO SICK BEFORE.

372
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,541
- HAZUKI TELLS ME YOU
TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

373
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,625
- ( laughs )

374
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,541
- WELL...
- IT WAS ALL AN ACT.

375
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,500
- Hazuki: AN ACT?
- YOUR TEMPERATURE LOOKS NORMAL.

376
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,875
NOW I DON'T WANT ANY MORE
FALSE ALARMS LIKE THIS.

377
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,458
YOU'RE TOO OLD
TO BE FAKING SICK.

378
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,833
- ( laughs ) RIGHT.

379
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,333
- GOOD LUCK WITH THIS ONE, GUYS.

380
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,041
- SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

381
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,458
- GRANDPA RYUUHEI HAS
THE HOTS FOR THAT NURSE.

382
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,958
- HE WANTED TO MEET THE NURSE
WHO WAS ON DUTY TODAY,

383
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,291
SO NATURALLY HE FAKED
GOING INTO A COMA.

384
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,166
- ( laughs )

385
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,666
I HAD NO IDEA EVERYONE WOULD
TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY, THOUGH.

386
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,208
WHAT A LARK!
WHAT A BUNCH OF FOOLS.

387
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,250
YOU ALL THOUGHT
I WAS DYING, DIDN'T YOU?

388
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,750
- WE HAD OUR HOPES, ANYWAY.

389
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,375
- DOESN'T HE EVER TAKE
ANYTHING SERIOUSLY?

390
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,625
- NOT REALLY. NO.
- EXCEPT NURSES.

391
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,875
- ( continues laughing )

392
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,291
- HAZUKI? YOU DOING OKAY, KID?

393
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,583
- YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE SHAKEN
UP, CHILD, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

394
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,750
- ( all exclaim )

395
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:02,500
- GRANDFATHER RYUUHEI!
- UH, YES, CHILD?

396
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,000
- I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE
FEELING SO MUCH BETTER.

397
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,625
- ( stuttering ) THANKS.

398
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,291
- AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

399
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,583
( evil laughter )

400
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:18,083
- WHAT THE...

401
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,208
- EWW!

402
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,166
- SO, TAKE CARE.
- YEAH. YOU TOO.

403
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,833
- WE'LL SEE YOU.

404
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,958
- I THINK SHE KINDA
LIKES YOU NOW.

405
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,708
- BACK AT YA!

406
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,125
- ( all giggling )

407
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,583
- ( giggling )

408
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,458
- WELL...

409
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,708
KOUHEI IS STILL HER FUTURE
HUSBAND, AND NOT YOUR SLAVE,

410
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,041
SO DON'T GO GETTING
ANY LONG TERM IDEAS, GOT IT?

411
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,916
- YES. THAT'S RIGHT.

412
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,416
- AND OUR NAME FOR YOU HASN'T
CHANGED. IT'S STILL "DEMON"!

413
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,083
- KOUHEI IS AND WILL
ALWAYS BE MY SLAVE!

414
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,250
AND DON'T CALL ME A DEMON!

415
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,000
- ( theme song playing )

416
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

417
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,166
- Hikaru: BROTHER KOUHEI! LOOK!

418
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,125
YOU GET A NEW CAMERA
IN THE NEXT EPISODE!

419
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,166
- I DO? WHAT KIND? WHERE?

420
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,166
- Hikaru: JUST KIDDING!
- Kaoru: JUST KIDDING!

421
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,708
- Hikaru: OH, NOW DON'T LOOK
LIKE THAT. IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

422
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:11,625
UH-OH. HE REALLY IS MAD. YOU'D
BETTER APOLOGIZE TOO, KAORU.

423
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,416
- I'M SORRY, BROTHER KOUHEI.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU ANGRY.

424
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,541
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S
WORKING. HE'S STILL MAD AT US.

425
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,666
LET'S JUST SAY THE NAME OF THE
EPISODE AND GET OUT OF HERE.

426
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,666
- Kaoru: EPISODE 12.
"I'LL NEVER FORGIVE HIM!"

427
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,416
IS HE STILL MAD?

428
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,708
( whimpers )
