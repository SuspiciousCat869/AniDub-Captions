1
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:29,250
- Hazuki:
I CAN HEAR IT, FEEL IT.

2
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,875
I CAN SENSE IT IN EVERYTHING.

3
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,625
FROM BEYOND THIS OLD SCENERY

4
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,875
THAT THE NIGHT WINDS
BLOW SLEEPILY THROUGH.

5
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:41,291
MY FROZEN TIME IN THIS WASTELAND
IS FINALLY COMING TO AN END.

6
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,583
I'M WAITING FOR YOU.

7
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,375
- ( theme song playing )

8
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

9
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,291
- ( camera clicking )

10
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,375
- WAS THAT A GIRL?

11
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,416
( gasps )

12
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,750
- ( camera clicking )

13
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,833
- THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I EVER SAW HER.

14
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,208
IF THAT GIRL'S NOT
IN THESE PICTURES,

15
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,916
I'M GONNA COMPLETELY LOSE IT.

16
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,458
- KOUHEI!

17
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,583
- HIROMI, HEY.

18
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,333
- GOOD MORNING.
YOU GOT THE PICTURES?

19
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,125
- ( sighs )

20
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,666
- SOME OF THESE SHOTS
ARE JUST AMAZING.

21
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,416
THERE ARE GONNA BE A LOT OF
HAPPY FACES BACK AT THE OFFICE.

22
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,250
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
DO IT? SOMETHING CREEPY

23
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,541
IN EVERY PICTURE.

24
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,958
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE A MAGNET
FOR THE PARANORMAL.

25
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,708
- ( sighs )

26
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,625
- WHAT ARE YOU SO DOWN ABOUT?
- IT DIDN'T COME OUT.

27
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,625
- HUH? WHAT DIDN'T?

28
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,791
- I WAS JUST SURE
I GOT THAT SHOT.

29
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,375
- DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
BEATING YOURSELF UP

30
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,416
OVER ONE LOST PICTURE, WHEN YOU
HAVE ALL OF THESE GREAT ONES.

31
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,291
YOU HAVE GOTTA STOP WITH THE
HALF-EMPTY, WOE-IS-ME ROUTINE.

32
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,750
IT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE, AND YOU'RE
TOO GOOD FOR IT, ANYWAY.

33
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,000
WHY DO YOU THINK I RECOMMENDED
YOU TO OCCULT MAGAZINE

34
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,083
THE SAME DAY I WAS HIRED, HUH?
OUT OF PITY?

35
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,958
- HMM.

36
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,458
- WELL, SOME PITY, OF COURSE.

37
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,458
BUT MOSTLY IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE TALENTED, BABE.

38
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,916
YOU'RE MADE FOR THIS WORK.

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,125
- WELL, I DON'T WANNA DO
ALL THAT CRAZY STUFF.

40
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,875
I JUST WANNA TAKE
NORMAL PHOTOGRAPHS.

41
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,125
- NORMAL? AND WHAT IS NORMAL
TO YOU, HUH?

42
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,625
- ( sighs ) WELL, NOT GHOSTS.

43
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,833
OH, MAN. YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HER.

44
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,625
- KOUHEI? EARTH TO KOUHEI.

45
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,125
- SORRY I'M RUNNING LATE.

46
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,000
- ( gasps )

47
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,208
SENSEI, YOU'RE HERE!

48
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,125
I WAS WONDERING WHEN YOU
WERE GONNA SHOW UP!

49
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,666
- I WANTED TO GET HERE EARLIER,

50
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,750
BUT I HAD TO CHECK OUT A FEW
THINGS DOWN AT THE TOWN LIBRARY.

51
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,958
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH.

52
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,708
YOU'LL THANK ME
LATER, I PROMISE.

53
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,416
- WAIT. YOU WERE RESEARCHING
AT THE TOWN LIBRARY?

54
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,083
DOES THAT MEAN YOU
CAN READ GERMAN?

55
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,625
- OF COURSE.

56
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,375
THE GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE IS
BASICALLY THE SAME AS ENGLISH.

57
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,000
EASY TO DECIPHER.

58
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,583
- OH, BUT IT'S STILL IMPRESSIVE.

59
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,000
I MEAN, I KNEW YOU WERE JAPAN'S
LEADING SPIRITUAL MEDIUM,

60
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,250
BUT NOW I FIND OUT
YOU'RE A SCHOLAR?

61
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,333
- I'M SURPRISED HER
NOSE ISN'T BROWN.

62
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,916
- YOU SAY SOMETHING?

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,333
- NOT ME.

64
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,458
SO, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING
INTERESTING AT THE LIBRARY

65
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,583
FOR YOUR NEXT ARTICLE, SEIJI?
ANY NEW LEADS?

66
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,083
- I DID.

67
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,958
ACTUALLY, I MANAGED TO DIG UP
QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION

68
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,458
ON THE SCHWARTZ QUELLE CASTLE.

69
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,125
- ( sighs )

70
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,208
HE'LL COME AGAIN.
I JUST KNOW IT.

71
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,791
TONIGHT IT HAPPENS.
TONIGHT I LEAVE THIS PLACE.

72
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,083
FINALLY.

73
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,041
( giggles )

74
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,166
THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE
PERFECT. I KNOW IT WILL.

75
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,541
- ( bats screeching )

76
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,333
- VIGO.

77
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,750
- I TRUST YOUR BATH WATER IS AS
YOU LIKE IT, MISTRESS LUNA.

78
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,791
- I AM NOT LUNA.

79
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,875
- MY APOLOGIES.

80
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,625
I SIMPLY NOTICED THE FULL MOON
WAS HANGING, SO I ASSUMED...

81
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,458
- IT'S OVERCAST OUTSIDE.

82
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,000
MY TOWEL.

83
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:07,916
- Seiji:
SCHWARTZ QUELLE CASTLE

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,291
OVERLOOKS THE
SCHWARTZ WALD LAKE.

85
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,750
WHEN THE BUBONIC PLAGUE
TORE IT'S WAY ACROSS EUROPE,

86
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,291
GERMANY WAS NOT SPARED.

87
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,000
IN FACT, THE DISEASE STRUCK
THIS REGION ESPECIALLY HARD,

88
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,708
KILLING THOUSANDS AND
DISPLACING THOUSANDS MORE.

89
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,250
IT'S WHISPERED IN
SOME CIRCLES THAT

90
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,916
THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD WIPED
OUT BY THE BLACK DEATH,

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
WANDER THE HALLS OF THAT CASTLE,

92
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,291
AND ALL THOSE THAT
ENTER IT'S WALLS

93
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,750
WILL ENCOUNTER THOSE
FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

94
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,041
MANY WHO'VE ENTERED
HAVE LOST THEIR MINDS.

95
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,375
MANY OTHERS SIMPLY DIED
FROM THE FRIGHT OF IT ALL.

96
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,291
- Hiromi: HUH. SO, THAT MUST
MEAN THAT THE GIRL KOUHEI SAW

97
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,666
ON THE CASTLE THAT NIGHT WAS
ONE OF THOSE PLAGUE VICTIMS

98
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,333
DOOMED TO WANDER
AROUND FOR ETERNITY.

99
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,375
THAT'S SO SAD.

100
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:50,125
- SHE'S NOT A GHOST! SHE WAS A
NORMAL PERSON LIKE YOU OR ME.

101
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,875
- BUT NO ONE LIVES THERE.

102
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,500
NOT TO MENTION THAT YOU SAW HER
ON THE ROOFTOPS OF THE CASTLE.

103
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,958
A LITTLE GIRL ALL THE WAY
UP THERE? NOT A CHANCE.

104
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,083
IT'S A GHOST
OR SOME KIND OF ILLUSION.

105
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,166
- I KNOW WHAT I SAW, OKAY?
SHE WAS REAL.

106
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,291
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO SEE GHOSTS. YOU KNOW THAT.

107
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,250
- I AGREE WITH KOUHEI.

108
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,500
I DON'T BELIEVE THE GIRL
HE SAW WAS A GHOST.

109
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,666
IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT

110
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,625
THERE'S ANOTHER
EXPLANATION FOR ALL THIS.

111
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,541
- YEAH, MAYBE.

112
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,875
I MEAN, HE'S THE BEST
PSYCHIC PHOTOGRAPHER AROUND,

113
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,541
BUT HE'S NEVER SEEN A GHOST
BEFORE. SO, WHY SHOULD HE NOW?

114
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,541
WAIT, DOES THAT MEAN SOMEONE

115
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,500
ACTUALLY DOES LIVE
IN THAT CASTLE?

116
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,916
- Seiji: THAT, I DON'T
HAVE AN ANSWER FOR,

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,458
BUT IT'S WORTH INVESTIGATING.

118
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,791
- I THINK WE SHOULD GO
TAKE A LOOK. DON'T YOU, KOUHEI?

119
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,041
- OH, WE'RE GOING INSIDE?

120
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,916
KOUHEI, WHAT
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS?

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,291
YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS THE SMOOTHEST
OPERATOR, YOU KNOW.

122
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,875
- I THINK I CAN MANAGE
TO CLIMB A LADDER.

123
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,833
( exclaims )

124
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,083
- AND HE'S DOWN.

125
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,166
- ( laughs ) ALL
THIS MIST OUT HERE

126
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,583
MUST HAVE MADE IT KINDA SLICK.

127
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,833
- HE'LL KILL HIMSELF.

128
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,416
- DON'T WORRY, HE'LL BE FINE.

129
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,375
ALTHOUGH, I DON'T CARE MUCH FOR
THIS CLOAK AND DAGGER ROUTINE,

130
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,666
TO TELL YA THE TRUTH.

131
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,458
UNFORTUNATELY, ENTRY
TO SCHWARTZ QUELLE CASTLE

132
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,708
IS FORBIDDEN
TO FOREIGNERS,

133
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,291
SO, I'M AFRAID WE DON'T
HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE.

134
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,875
- YOU REALLY THINK HE'LL WALK
OUT OF THERE OKAY, SENSEI?

135
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,125
- SURE, WHY NOT?

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,541
- LADDER'S DOWN, GUYS.
I'M GOING IN.

137
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,250
- KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED, KOUHEI!

138
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,833
- YEAH, UH, I HEAD NORTH.
IS THAT RIGHT?

139
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,041
- THAT'S IT. AND USE YOUR
CAMERA AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

140
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,333
WE NEED TO GET AS MANY PICTURES
AS POSSIBLE, YOU GOT IT?

141
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,375
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
SEE YA IN A BIT.

142
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,166
- ( bats squealing )

143
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,083
- ( screams )

144
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,500
- ( thudding )

145
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,291
- Hiromi: FIGURES.

146
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,666
- AH, THAT WAS AWESOME.

147
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,250
GOOD THING I DIDN'T LAND ON MY
CAMERA. I'D BE OUT OF A JOB.

148
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,041
UNREAL! THIS PLACE IS NUTS.

149
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,000
- ( camera clicking )

150
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,583
- ( sighs )

151
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,208
- UH, SENSEI?

152
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,958
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT
KOUHEI BEING IN THERE ALL ALONE.

153
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,625
I MEAN, HE'S ALL READY
FALLEN TWICE.

154
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,416
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO IN AFTER HIM.

155
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,041
- WELL, ACTUALLY, THAT MIGHT
NOT BE SUCH A SMART MOVE.

156
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,250
- WHY NOT?

157
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,666
- THIS IS NOT JUST
YOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL

158
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,250
HAUNTED CASTLE, HIROMI.

159
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,375
LET ME SHOW YOU.

160
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,791
STEP ACROSS THIS LINE AND TELL
ME WHAT YOU FEEL.

161
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,250
- OH. OKAY.

162
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,958
( gasps )

163
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,125
WHOA, WHAT JUST
HAPPENED TO ME?

164
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,666
- YOU CROSSED THEIR BARRIER.
- BARRIER?

165
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,250
- THERE'S A SPIRITUAL BARRIER
SURROUNDING THIS CASTLE.

166
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,708
IT'S STRENGTH IS MASSIVE ENOUGH

167
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,375
THAT THE MOST INSENSITIVE
PERSON CAN FEEL IT'S POWER.

168
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,625
EVEN SOMEONE OF MY EXPERTISE
COULD BARELY PUT A DENT IN IT.

169
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,958
LUCKY FOR US
WE HAVE A KEY OF SORTS.

170
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,333
KOUHEI.

171
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,291
THE BARRIER WON'T EVER
HAVE AN EFFECT ON HIM.

172
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,666
- IT WON'T? WHY NOT?

173
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,416
- SIMPLE. HE CAN'T 
SEE THE SPIRITS.

174
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,958
HE CAN'T SEE THE
DISTURBANCES THEY CAUSE.

175
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,541
THEY CAN TAUNT HIM
ALL THEY WANT,

176
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,333
BUT THEY CAN'T FRIGHTEN HIM.

177
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,125
HE NEVER HAS A CLUE
THAT THEY'RE AROUND.

178
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,291
- ( screams )

179
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,375
- I GUESS THAT MAKES
SOME KIND OF SENSE.

180
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,833
BUT WHY DID YOU
SEND HIM NORTH?

181
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,666
- BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THE POWER IS COMING FROM.

182
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,958
I SENSED IT WHEN WE GOT HERE.

183
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,625
SOME WHERE IN THE
NORTHERN PART OF THE CASTLE

184
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,958
IS THE SOURCE OF THE
BARRIERS' SPIRITUAL ENERGY.

185
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,625
IF KOUHEI MANAGES
TO LOCATE IT,

186
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,458
THEN WE MAY BE ABLE TO SHUT IT
DOWN SOMEHOW AND GET INSIDE.

187
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,625
AND IF SOMEONE'S LIVING
IN THERE, CONTROLLING IT ALL,

188
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,833
WELL THEN, WE'VE GOT
OURSELVES A HELL OF A STORY.

189
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,541
- YEAH, THAT WOULD BE PERFECT!

190
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,125
- YOU KNOW, COME TO THINK OF IT,

191
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,791
WE COULD PROBABLY EVEN SPREAD
THIS STORY OUT OVER TWO ISSUES.

192
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,166
IF WE WORK IT RIGHT.

193
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,791
- YOU'RE A GENIUS!
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

194
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,583
- MAYBE. WE'LL SEE IF IT WORKS.

195
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,000
- ( camera clicks )

196
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,750
- MAN, THE SHUTTER SPEED
IS TOO SLOW.

197
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,541
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK. I SHOULD
HAVE BROUGHT THE OTHER CAMERA.

198
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,625
- ( shrieking )

199
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,166
- I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE

200
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,000
WOULD WANNA LIVE IN
THIS CREEPY MANSION.

201
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,208
- ( gasps )

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,958
- JUST MY LUCK. PLEASE TELL ME
I REMEMBERED THE BACK-UP FILM.

203
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,166
- Hazuki: WHO'S THERE?

204
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,458
- ( gasps )

205
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,416
- YOU'RE SCARING ME.
WHO ARE YOU?

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,458
- YOU, I SAW YOU.

207
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,666
- YOU'RE JUST A NORMAL
HUMAN, AREN'T YOU?

208
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,208
I'M SURPRISED YOU MADE IT
THIS FAR.

209
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,791
- DO... DO YOU HAVE A NAME?

210
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,833
- WELL, OF COURSE I DO, SILLY.
MY NAME IS HAZUKI.

211
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,208
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

212
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,625
AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
IF I MAY ASK?

213
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,083
- OH, YEAH, I'M KOUHEI MORIOKA.

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,541
- KOUHEI.

215
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,583
YOU'RE MY BIG BROTHER, KOUHEI.

216
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,458
- ( gasps )

217
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,666
- WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU LOOK FRIGHTENED.

218
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,750
- BIG BROTHER, KOUHEI?

219
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,041
- ( giggles )

220
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,750
- ( wind blowing )

221
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,916
- THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE
GOING ON IN THERE.

222
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,958
I DON'T KNOW THIS FEELING.

223
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,083
- REALLY? YOU'RE FROM JAPAN?
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

224
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,250
- WHY?

225
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,750
- WELL, THE LAST THING
I EXPECTED TO FIND

226
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,958
WHEN I CAME TO GERMANY

227
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,458
TO TAKE PICTURES WAS
A GIRL FROM BACK HOME.

228
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,166
IT'S JUST SORTA ODD,
THAT'S ALL.

229
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,375
- ( giggles ) FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

230
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,625
I CAME HERE FROM JAPAN LIKE YOU.
I JUST GOT HERE SOONER.

231
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,500
- I WAS JUST GONNA ASK YOU THAT.
HOW DID YOU GET HERE, ANYWAY?

232
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,791
- WELL, I...

233
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,041
- NO, I... I MEAN, I...

234
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,416
SORRY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME. I'M AN IDIOT.

235
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,708
- ( chuckles awkwardly )

236
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,666
- HEY, WERE YOU THE ONE I SAW

237
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,791
SITTING ON TOP OF THE
CASTLE LAST NIGHT?

238
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,666
- I DON'T KNOW.

239
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,416
IT MIGHT'VE BEEN ME.

240
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,666
DID YOU SEE ME?

241
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,041
- YEAH. ACTUALLY, THAT'S KINDA
WHY I CAME BACK HERE TONIGHT.

242
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,791
I WANTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

243
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,625
YOU MADE QUITE A PICTURE
UP THERE, YOU KNOW.

244
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,833
AND I, UH, I WAS HOPING I COULD
GET SOME SHOTS AROUND HERE.

245
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,500
YOU KNOW, OF YOU,
WITH THE CASTLE.

246
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,750
- YOU MEAN...

247
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,791
YOU MEAN YOU REALLY CAME HERE
JUST TO SEE ME, BIG BROTHER?

248
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:52,583
- UH, YEAH. I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY IT LIKE THAT.

249
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:56,583
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD
COME ALL THIS WAY FOR ME.

250
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,375
I GUESS YOU MUST REALLY...

251
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,125
( gasps )

252
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,166
I'M SORRY. HOW EMBARRASSING.

253
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,583
- NO. DON'T APOLOGIZE.
IT MUST'VE BEEN ROUGH,

254
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,166
BEING STUCK HERE ALL BY YOURSELF

255
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,083
IN A PLACE LIKE
THIS FOR SO LONG.

256
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,750
BUT HEY, I'M HERE NOW.
AND LIKE I WAS SAYING BEFORE,

257
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,375
I'D LIKE TO GET A FEW SHOTS
OF YOU FOR MY PORTFOLIO.

258
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,208
IF YOU DON'T MIND
POSING FOR ME, THAT IS.

259
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,791
- OH, NO. I DON'T MIND.
- GREAT!

260
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:30,333
- UM, BUT, UH, BEFORE THAT.

261
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,416
YOU TRAVELED ACROSS
THE WORLD TO SEE ME,

262
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,416
THE LEAST I CAN DO IS
OFFER YOU A WELCOMING PRESENT.

263
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,375
- A PRESENT? AW, COME ON. YOU
DON'T HAVE TO GET ME ANYTHING.

264
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,458
- OH, NO. I INSIST.

265
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,208
I'LL BE SO DISAPPOINTED
IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT IT!

266
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,083
- WELL, IN THAT CASE...

267
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,166
( clears throat ) YES.
THEN I HAVE TO ACCEPT.

268
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,041
IN FACT, I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE WHAT IT IS.

269
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,750
I ALWAYS LOVE SURPRISES.

270
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,041
- ( giggles ) OH, ME TOO!

271
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,791
- ( laughs )

272
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:02,958
- AND NOW...

273
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,875
YOU ARE MINE.

274
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,625
- ( gasps )

275
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,916
- HAZUKI, I...

276
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,291
- WHY DID HE PUSH ME OFF
RIGHT AT THE END?

277
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,000
THAT TOTALLY BLEW
MY CONCENTRATION. THAT JERK.

278
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,583
- HAZUKI, PLEASE.

279
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,333
- THIS IS THE ONE CHANCE I HAVE
AND I CAN'T LET IT SLIP AWAY.

280
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,458
PULL IT TOGETHER, HAZUKI!

281
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,000
- ( inhales deeply )

282
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,708
- I'M SORRY, I JUST... I CAN'T.

283
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,083
- YOU'RE MEAN.

284
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,250
I'M NOTHING BUT AN INNOCENT
GIRL AND YOU HATE ME.

285
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,708
- UH, NO. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

286
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,583
IT'S JUST YOU MOVED SO FAST,
I WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD.

287
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,125
THAT'S ALL. SORRY.

288
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,416
- YOU'RE CRUEL!

289
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,875
- HEY, WAIT, THAT'S NOT FAIR!
GIVE ME A BREAK!

290
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,875
IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING,
I'M SORRY!

291
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,750
- IF YOU WANNA
HATE ME SO MUCH, GO AHEAD.

292
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,583
( sobs ) I DON'T DESERVE
YOUR KINDNESS.

293
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,916
- WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,541
I CAME ALL THIS WAY UP TO
THIS PLACE TO SEE YOU.

295
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,041
YOU'RE THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE.

296
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,416
NOW, WHY WOULD I HATE SOMEONE
I WORKED SO HARD TO FIND?

297
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,750
PLEASE, STOP CRYING.

298
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,666
- YOU'RE SURE?

299
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,791
- I'M POSITIVE. I HAVE NO REASON
TO WANNA HURT YOU.

300
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,500
YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING
BUT NICE TO ME.

301
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,291
- THAT'S SO SWEET!

302
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,625
- ( sighs )

303
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,416
- GOT HIM.

304
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,833
NOW, BIG BROTHER, IT'S TIME
TO GIVE YOU MY PRESENT.

305
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,750
THAT IS, IF YOU'RE READY.

306
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,208
- Vigo: I MUST PUT AN END
TO THIS GAME, MISTRESS.

307
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,500
- ( gasps )

308
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,208
- ( both screaming )

309
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,083
- WHAT'S UP WITH THESE
FREAKING VINES?

310
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,500
- KOUHEI?
- YES.

311

- DON'T, PLEASE,
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

313
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,500
VIGO.

314
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:21,125
- THE MASTER CLEARLY INSTRUCTED
THAT I DO ALL I CAN TO GUARD YOU

315
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,208
AT EVERY TURN, MISTRESS.

316
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,875
PLEASE, I BEG YOUR PARDON
FOR MY INTRUSION.

317
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,708
- I SHOULD'VE BEEN
PAYING ATTENTION.

318
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,208
HIROMI! STAY BACK!

WHAT AN INSENSITIVE YOUNG MAN.

325
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,583
THE QUESTION WE MUST ANSWER NOW
IS WHAT TO DO WITH HIM.

326
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,458
WE COULD LEAVE HIM HERE
TIED UP,

327
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,750
EASY PICKINGS FOR WHEN
THE CROWS COME AROUND.

328
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,541
OR BLOW HIM TO PIECES. AND
GIVE THE RATS A MIDNIGHT SNACK.

329
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,958
- WHAT?

330
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,375
- GODS OF THE FOUR SEAS,
GUARDIANS OF US ALL.

DISPERSE THIS EVIL!

00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,500
( chanting )

333
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,583

ME. I'LL BE FINE.

344
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,166
I'LL BE ABLE TO PULL KOUHEI OUT.

345
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,416
I CAN PROTECT HIM,
BUT I CAN'T PROTECT YOU, TOO.

346
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,916
YOU HAVE TO GET AS FAR AWAY
FROM HERE AS YOU CAN!

347
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,041
RUN!

348

- I DON'T THINK SO.
BUT WHO THE HECK WAS THAT GUY?

354
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,291
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE'RE ALL ALONE NOW.

355
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,916
SO, SHALL WE PICK UP
