00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,666
- Announcer: MILE HIGH AIRWAYS,
FLIGHT 402 FOR NARITA AIRPORT

2
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,250
WILL BE DEPARTING AT 9:45 PM.

3
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,416
PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
YOUR BOARDING PASS READY

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,208
AND NO MORE THAN
TWO CARRY-ON ITEMS.

5
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,958
BOARDING WILL BEGIN
AT GATE 17 IN FIFTEEN MINUTES.

6
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,375
- OH, HI, THERE. HOW CAN I BE OF
ASSISTANCE TO YOU THIS EVENING?

7
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,416
- WELL, IT MIGHT
SOUND A BIT ODD,

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,166
BUT I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO LOOK
DEEPLY INTO MY EYES.

9
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,666
- I'D LIKE A TICKET, PLEASE.
- OF COURSE.

10
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,458
- ONE WAY TO JAPAN, FIRST CLASS.
- RIGHT AWAY.

11
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,000
- THIS IS GONNA BE EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

12
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,750
- ( theme song playing )

13
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,833
- I'M FINALLY GOING HOME.

15
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,333
THE DAY FATHER TOOK ME
TO THAT DARK CASTLE,

16
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,333
I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

17
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,583
ONE OF THE CLEAREST
MEMORIES I HAVE

18
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,000
IS THE EXPRESSIONLESS LOOK
IN MY FATHERS' EYES.

19
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,166
AND THE SADNESS IN MY MOTHER'S.

20
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,750
MAMA?

21
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,333
MAMA, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

22
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,958
- IT'S COLD OUT HERE.
GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM.

23
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,000
- PLEASE, DON'T GO.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,083
MAMA, WAIT!

25
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,833
( gasps )

26
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,291
( crying )

27
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,458
( screaming ) MAMA! MAMA!

28
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,583
SHE NEVER RETURNED. I HAVEN'T
SEEN HER SINCE THAT DAY.

29
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:35,041
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE SHE
LEFT. I HOPE SHE HASN'T CHANGED.

30
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,625
- ( chuckles ) CHECK!

31
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,375
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT ME.

32
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,083
- I'M OUT OF THE SHOWER.
WHO'S NEXT?

33
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,083
HEY, WHERE DID KOUHEI
AND HIROMI GO?

34
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,291
I THOUGHT THEY WERE HERE.

35
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,000
- HIROMI WENT HOME
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

36
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,458
- AND I THINK KOUHEI IS
UPSTAIRS IN HIS ROOM.

37
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,916
- UPSTAIRS? THANK YOU.

38
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,041
- DOES SOMETHING ABOUT
THAT GIRL STRIKE YOU AS ODD?

39
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:15,541
- HMM. THAT'S MY BATH TOWEL
SHE'S GOT WRAPPED AROUND HER.

40
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,041
- ( sighs ) YEAH,
MAYBE THAT'S IT.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,541
- ( growls )

42
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,416
- NOTICE ME ALL READY!

43
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,166
- OH. SORRY. HEY THERE,
HAZUKI, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

44
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,083
- I DEMAND YOU THROW
AWAY THAT CAN.

45
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,666
- UH, WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

46
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,000
- ( growls )

47
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,458
I'M THE ONE WHO ASKS THE
QUESTIONS AROUND HERE, NOT YOU!

48
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,333
- KOUHEI'S ALWAYS BEEN
A STUBBORN KID.

49
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,625
- GRANDPA!

50
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,291
- ( screaming )

51
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,416
- SO, MY BOY. YOU'RE
QUITE THE LADIES' MAN,

52
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,833
IF THEY AREN'T HUMAN.

53
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,583
- HUH?

54
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,875
- IF YOU LOOK AT THE TEETH,

55
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,083
YOU'LL SEE OUR YOUNG
FRIEND HERE IS A VAMPIRE.

56
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,916
- SHE'S A VAMPIRE?
GIMME A BREAK.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,625
WHOA. SHE'S GOT FANGS!

58
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
- UH-HUH.

59
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,166
- THAT WAS SO RUDE!

60
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,875
- SORRY. IT'S MY FIRST TIME
MEETING ONE OF YOU.

61
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,375
- I'D LIKE FOR YOU
TO LOOK DEEPLY INTO MY EYES.

62
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,500
- HMM?

63
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,791
OH, LOOKY THERE. THEY'VE GOT
A BEAUTIFUL SHIMMER TO THEM.

64
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,083
- IT'S NOT WORKING
ON ANY OF THESE GUYS.

65
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,208
- OH, MY DEAR, I'M AFRAID YOUR
HYPNOSIS DOESN'T WORK ON ME.

66
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,583
SEIJI AND I ARE BOTH
UNDER EXCEPTIONAL SPELLS

67
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,791
THAT COUNTER SORCERY,

68
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,416
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

69
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,375
- WHAT ABOUT HIM? I CAN'T
SEEM TO GET ANYTHING TO WORK.

70
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,500
- WELL, HE'S
SPIRITUALLY RETARDED.

71
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,833
SPIRITUAL MATTERS CAN'T GET
THROUGH THAT THICK HEAD OF HIS.

72
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,875
THAT'S WHY SPELLS,
CURSES, AND THE LIKE

73
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,750
JUST DON'T WORK ON HIM, YOU SEE?

74
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,166
- GEEZ THANKS A LOT, GRAMPS.
SO I'M RETARDED, HUH?

75
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,083
- YOU KNOW HOW I HATE TO LIE.

76
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,458
- ( both laugh )

77
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,416
- WILL YOU TWO CREEPS
STOP LAUGHING AT ME?

78
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,166
( sneezes )

79
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,250
- HERE, PUT THIS ON.

80
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,083
YOU SHOULDN'T BE RUNNING AROUND
IN JUST A TOWEL.

81
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,416
YOU'RE GONNA
CATCH YOURSELF A COLD.

82
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,083
- I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP!
- HEY! GEEZ.

83
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,208
OW.

84
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,333
- WATCH YOUR STEP.
THAT'S A NASTY SHORT FUSE.

85
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,958
- A VAMPIRE...

86
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,791
- Ryuuhei: A VAMPIRE FEEDING
OFF THE BLOOD OF HUMANS

87
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,000
SURVIVES ONLY IN DARKNESS.

88
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,041
THEY ARE THE OVERLORDS
OF IMMORTALITY,

89
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,208
AND IT IS SAID THAT THE POWERS
THEY POSSESS ARE STARTLING.

90
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:52,375
BUT A VAMPIRE HAS WEAKNESSES.
SUNLIGHT, GARLIC, AND THE CROSS.

91
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,000
IT'S ALSO SAID THAT
WHEN A HUMAN HAS

92
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:58,916
HIS BLOOD SUCKED BY A VAMPIRE,
HE BECOMES ONE.

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,416
I MAY BE GENERALIZING A BIT,

94
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,083
BUT THIS CHILD ISN'T ANYTHING
LIKE THE CLASSIC VAMPIRE.

95
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,416
SUCH AN INNOCENT ANGEL!

96
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,000
- NAH-UH. I AM NOT!
I AM NOT AN INNOCENT ANGEL.

97
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,250
I HAVE COMPLETED
MY BLOOD PACT,

98
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,791
AND I AM VERY PLEASED
WITH MYSELF.

99
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,416
- YOU'VE FINISHED
THE BLOOD PACT?

100
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,083
WELL THEN, THAT MEANS YOU'VE
SUCKED THE BLOOD OF A MORTAL.

101
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,166
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND DIRTY.
I THINK OF IT AS A KISS.

102
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,708
- JUST A KISS, HUH?

103
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,833
HEY, WAIT! I KNEW SOMETHING
WAS OFF WHEN YOU KISSED ME!

104
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,791
YOU WERE GOING FOR MY BLOOD,
WEREN'T YOU?

105
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,500
- SO WHERE EXACTLY IS IT
THAT SHE BIT YOU, KOUHEI, HMM?

106
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,833
- RIGHT HERE.

107
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,166
- THOSE LOOK LIKE
THEY MIGHT BE INFECTED.

108
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,375
- YEAH, IT STILL HURTS.

109
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,416
- AND YET APPARENTLY
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

110
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,541
THAT YOU'RE NOTICING THEM.

111
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,000
- KOUHEI?

112
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,875
OUR BLOOD PACT IS SUPPOSED
TO BE COMPLETED BY NOW.

113
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:45,666
WHICH IS WHY I CAN'T GET
WHY YOU WON'T FOLLOW MY ORDERS!

114
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,916
- LET'S NOT DO THIS
AT THE TABLE.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,958
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
I TRIED EVERYTHING.

116
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,208
- WELL, WHAT EXACTLY
IS KOUHEI SUPPOSED TO BE TO YOU?

117
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,791
- HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE MY SLAVE.

118
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,000
- ( laughs )

119
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,416
- THAT'S THE LIFE FOR YOU, BOY!
GO ON, NOW!

120
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,583
BE THIS YOUNG GIRL'S SLAVE!

121
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,708
- GIVE IT A REST.
- WELL, HE'S GOT A POINT!

122
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,541
- GO AWAY!
- YOU GO AWAY!

123
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,833
- HAZUKI. TELL ME.

124
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,125
OUT OF CURIOSITY,
ONCE YOU MADE KOUHEI YOUR SLAVE,

125
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,500
WHAT WERE YOU PLANNING
TO DO WITH HIM?

126
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,166
- WITH THE MOUTH ON THIS GIRL,

127
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,916
I'D SAY WORLD DOMINATION
IS RIGHT UP HER ALLEY.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,500
( laughs )
I'M NOT TOO FAR OFF AM I?

129
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,083
- COME ON GRAMPS,
THIS IS SERIOUS!

130
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,125
- IT'S JUST THAT I MADE
A PROMISE TO SOMEONE.

131
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,708
- A PROMISE TO WHO?

132
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,666
- MY MOTHER THE DAY SHE LEFT ME.

133
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,541
MAMA! MAMA!

134
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,625
EVEN THOUGH WE SEPARATED,

135
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,291
I PROMISED TO MEET HER
IN JAPAN SOMEDAY.

136
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,583
- Woman: KOUHEI, DARLING,
COME HERE.

137
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,166
I HAVE TO RUN SOME ERRANDS.

138
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,458
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STAY HERE
BY YOURSELF UNTIL I GET BACK?

139
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,166
- THAT'S WHY I ASKED
FOR KOUHEI'S HELP

140
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,875
TO BREAK THE BARRIER
AROUND THE CASTLE.

141
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,541
I NEEDED HIM TO HELP ME
FIND MY MOTHER HERE IN JAPAN.

142
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,708
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO DO IT.

143
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,791
- CONSIDERING THE SITUATION,

144
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,625
I'D SAY YOU DIDN'T
HAVE MANY OPTIONS.

145
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,208
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

146
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,500
YOU MADE A PROMISE TO SOMEONE

147
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,750
WHO ABANDONED YOU FOR
TWO YEARS AT A CASTLE.

148
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,291
- Seiji: THAT'S ENOUGH.
- YOUR MOTHER LIED TO YOU.

149
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,625
- Ryuuhei: STOP IT, KOUHEI.
- SHE ABANDONED YOU!

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,791
- SHE'S MY MOTHER!
SHE WOULD NEVER ABANDON ME!

151
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,458
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A MEAN JERK!

152
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,625
AND I HATE YOU, BIG BROTHER!

153
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:29,916
- WHATEVER.

154
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,833
- YOU'RE NOT GOING AFTER HER?

155
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,666
- NO. WHY WOULD I?
- SHE'S A CHILD, KOUHEI.

156
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,833
- NO, ACTUALLY SHE'S A VAMPIRE.
SHE SHOULD BE JUST FINE.

157
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:53,875
- ( crying )

158
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,666
- ( dinging )

159
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,375
- Ryuuhei: IT'S FOUR A.M.

160
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,708
- Seiji: NOT LONG
BEFORE SUNRISE.

161
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,791
- WHEN VAMPIRES ARE
EXPOSED TO SUNLIGHT,

162
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,833
IS IT LIKE IN THE MOVIES?

163
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,791
- PRETTY MUCH. THEIR
BODIES BLISTER AND BURN,

164
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,500
THEN THEY BURST INTO FLAMES.

165
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,833
AND USUALLY EXPLODE
OR TURN TO ASHES.

166
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,500
SOMEONE'S HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS.

167
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,000
- I'M JUST GOING FOR A DRIVE.

168
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,541
- ( engine starts )

169
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,125
- KOUHEI, JUST FOLLOW THIS.

170
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,125
I PUT A STRAND
OF HER HAIR ON IT.

171
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,458
- GRAMPS, I--

172
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,166
- HURRY THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF TIME BEFORE SUNRISE.

173
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,416
- I'LL FIND HER, GRANDPA.

174
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,583
- ( tires screeching )

175
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,125
- SHE'S A SMART LITTLE GIRL.

176
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,125
I'M SURE WHEN THE SUN COMES UP
SHE'LL FIND A PLACE TO HIDE.

177
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,500
- I HOPE SO.

178
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,500
THAT BOY HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH
OVER THE PAST 14 YEARS.

179
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,125
THEY'VE BOTH LOST MOTHERS.

180
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,333
- I'M COMING, HAZUKI.

181
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,208
- Count Kinkel: BRING HER BACK.

182
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,208
- Elfriede: I'LL
LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.

183
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,708
- MASTER?
- Count Kinkel: WHAT IS IT?

184
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,583
- HOW?

185
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,875
- SHOW NO MERCY.

186
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,750
- AS YOU WISH.

187
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,583
- YOU WILL NOT ESCAPE ME,
MISTRESS LUNA.

188
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,166
- Kouhei: MOTHER?

189
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,916
THAT WAS 14 YEARS AGO.

190
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,916
- KOUHEI, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,208
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

192
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,833
- I HAVE TO RUN SOME ERRANDS.

193
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,291
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STAY HERE
BY YOURSELF UNTIL I GET BACK?

194
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,166
- I WANNA GO WITH YOU!
- I WON'T BE GONE LONG.

195
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,125
YOU'LL BE FINE, KOUHEI.

196
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,708
- WAIT, MOTHER, PLEASE!

197
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,291
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME THAT
YOU'LL COME HOME, OKAY?

198
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,833
PLEASE, MOM?

199
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,708
BUT SHE DIDN'T COME BACK.
SIX MONTHS LATER,

200
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,041
I WAS TAKEN ASIDE AND TOLD
THAT MY MOTHER HAD DIED.

201
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,875
I TRIED TO MAKE HER PROMISE.

202
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,250
SINCE THEN, I'VE FELT
ABANDONED, DISCARDED.

203
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,833
LIKE I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
LIKE THE WORLD WAS AGAINST ME.

204
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,625
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH HAZUKI.

205
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,083
NOTHING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED
TO ME COULD BE HER FAULT.

206
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,791
AND I TOOK IT ALL OUT ON HER.

207
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:43,916
WHY COULDN'T I HAVE JUST KEPT

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
MY BIG MOUTH SHUT FOR A CHANGE?

209
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,458
- ( tires screeching )

210
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,833
- HOW COULD HE SAY THAT?

211
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,708
HOW COULD HE TELL ME THAT
MY MOTHER ABANDONED ME?

212
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,458
( sobs ) HE DOESN'T
KNOW MY MOTHER!

213
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,916
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ME!

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,958
- ( laughs )

215
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,041
- OH, I HATE HIM!

216
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,166
I HATE HIS STUPID
FACE! I HATE IT!

217
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,666
I HOPE IT FALLS OFF THAT
THICK SKULL OF HIS.

218
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,208
( grunts )

219
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,500
EVERYTHING IS KOUHEI'S FAULT.

220
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,916
IF HE IS RIGHT.

221
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,083
IF MY MOTHER HAS ACTUALLY
FORGOTTEN ME, LEFT ME ALONE.

222
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,208
THEN WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

223
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,458
IF THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
I WOULD EVER SEE HER,

224
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,916
WHERE DO I GO NOW?

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,583
WHERE IS MY HOME
IF IT'S NOT WITH MY MOTHER?

226
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,833
( gasps )

227
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,833
THE SUN'S RISING.
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

228
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,125
WHERE DO I GO NOW?

229
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,166
- ( crow caws )

230
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,000
- HAZUKI, THERE YOU ARE!

231
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,333
- YOU CAME AFTER ME.

232
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,041
- HEY, DON'T RUN OFF ON ME
LIKE THAT, OKAY?

233
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,041
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
THE SUN'S ABOUT TO COME OUT.

234
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,666
WE NEED TO GET YOU INSIDE.

235
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,833
YOU'RE A VAMPIRE.

236
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,541
YOU NEED TO THINK
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

237
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,083
THERE'S NO DARK CASTLE
AROUND HERE TO HIDE IN.

238
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,208
- ( sobs )

239
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,875
JUST GO AWAY.
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

240
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,375
I DON'T NEED ANYONE'S HELP.

241
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,166
I'M A PERFECTLY CAPABLE WOMAN!
I'LL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF!

242
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,416
( gasps )

243
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,583
- LEAVE ME ALONE!
- HOLD ON!

244
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,916
- I CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE!
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE!

245
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,416
- YOU TOLD ME YOU MADE
A PROMISE TO YOUR MOTHER

246
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,875
THAT YOU WOULD MEET
IN JAPAN, RIGHT?

247
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,583
WELL, WE NEED TO MAKE
SURE THAT HAPPENS,

248
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,500
AND I'M GONNA HELP YOU
THE WHOLE WAY.

249
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,875
WE'LL START TONIGHT, OKAY?

250
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,583
- HUH? THANK YOU SO MUCH!

251
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,000
- SO I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS DEEP
IN THE MOUNTAINS BEFORE.

252
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,166
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE
THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY?

253
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,666
- TRUST ME. I REMEMBER
HOW TO GET HOME.

254
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,000
MY INSTINCTS ARE PRETTY SHARP,
YOU KNOW.

255
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,000
- THE ONLY THING SHARP
ABOUT YOU IS YOUR TEETH.

256
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,125
- OH, SHUT UP!

257
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,041
HEY, ISN'T THERE
ANYTHING WE CAN DO

258
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,791
ABOUT MY TRAVELLING
ACCOMMODATIONS?

259
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,625
- IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
SUNLIGHT WON'T REACH.

260
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,416
IT'S EITHER THIS
OR WE TRAVEL AT NIGHT.

261
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,666
- YOUR CAR IS TOO SMALL!
- HEY, AT LEAST IT'S PAID OFF.

262
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,541
- IT'S CRAMPED
AND HOT BACK HERE.

263
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,500
LOOK, THERE'S
JUNK EVERYWHERE.

264
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,916
OH! OH, GREAT, I JUST
KNOCKED OVER... OH, GROSS!

265
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,666
- ( laughing )

266
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,916
- IT'S SMELLY AND IT'S GETTING
ALL OVER EVERYTHING!

267
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,958
- SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU
SQUIRMED AROUND BACK THERE

268
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,625
SO MUCH THAT YA KNOCKED
OVER MY SPARE OIL-CAN.

269
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,666
- THIS IS GONNA STAIN MY DRESS.
YOU HAVE TO PULL THE CAR OVER.

270
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,625
- I CAN'T.
THE SUN'S STILL SHINING.

271
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,333
- YOU'RE SUCH A MAN!

272
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:12,750
- YOU KNOW IT, BABY!
- JERK! MORON! MAGGOT! PIG!

273
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:21,416
- CREEP! STUPID-HEAD! DIRT-BAG!
SLEAZE-BALL! TROGLODYTE!

274
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,041
- ALL RIGHT, IF THIS IS WHERE
YOU SAY IT IS.

275
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,041
- ( growls )

276
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,250
- OH, VERY LADY-LIKE. YOU'RE
REALLY A HIGH CLASS GIRL,

277
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,500
YOU KNOW THAT, HAZUKI?

278
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,250
- LADYLIKE? YOU
STUFFED ME IN A TRUNK

279
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,125
AND LOOK AT MY POOR DRESS.

280
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,083
THERE'S NO WAY THIS STAIN
IS EVER GONNA COME OUT!

281
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,958
- IT'S SO QUIET UP HERE.

282
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,916
SO, THIS IS REALLY WHERE
YOUR MOTHER LIVES?

283
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,416
HAZUKI, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

284
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,125
HEY, WAIT! FINE.
GO ON, THEN. SEE IF I CARE.

285
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,416
WHERE DID THAT
LITTLE BRAT RUN OFF TO?

286
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,041
IF SHE GETS EATEN BY A BEAR
OR SOMETHING, IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

287
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,458
MAN, THAT'S ONE BIG WATERFALL.

288
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,250
AND WHAT'S WITH ALL THAT WEIRD
STEAM COMING OFF IT LIKE THAT?

289
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,250
IT'S NICE. MUST BE A HOT SPRING.

290
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,500
( gasps )

291
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,208
- HEY!

292
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:50,583
- THIS FEELS SO GOOD.

293
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,458
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

294
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,791
- I'M TAKING A BATH, STUPID!

295
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,375
I DIDN'T WANNA SEE MY MOM

296
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,666
WHEN I WAS ALL STINKY AND
WEARING A STAINED DRESS.

297
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,833
I WANNA LOOK MY BEST.

298
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,083
- WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME

299
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,541
THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED
TO STOP THERE?

300
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,041
- WHY SHOULD I, SLAVE?

301
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,291
- PUT A SOCK IN IT
FOR A BIT, WILL YA?

302
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,250
- RIGHT AND YOU THINK
I'M A BRAT.

303
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,208
- THERE IT IS!
- WHERE?

304
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,333
- UNTIL I WAS LOCKED AWAY
IN THAT HORRIBLE CASTLE,

305
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,500
THAT'S THE HOUSE
I LIVED IN WITH MY MOTHER.

306
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,291
- IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE'S HOME, DOES IT?

307
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,000
IT'S PITCH BLACK.

308
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,541
I THINK WE MAY BE OUT OF
LUCK HERE. WAIT, HAZUKI!

309
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,041
- ( doorbell rings )

310
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:56,041
- MAMA? MAMA, OPEN UP, IT'S ME!
IT'S HAZUKI! I'M HOME!

311
00:18:56,125 --> 00:19:00,333
( sobs ) PLEASE,
LET ME IN! NO.

312
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,833
WHY AREN'T YOU HERE?

313
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:07,833
- HAZUKI.

314
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:08,958
- ( rustling )

315
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,041
- HUH?

316
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,333
- HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

317
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,625
- ( meows )

318
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,000
- I KNOW YOU.

319
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,375
- COME BACK!
- WAIT!

320
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,500
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

321
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,958
- ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS WHERE IT IS?

322
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,166
- ( meows )

323
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,125
- WHOA. WHAT'S GOING ON?

324
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,875
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. IT'S YOU!

325
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,083
- WAIT, THAT'S YOUR MOTHER?

326
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,541
HOW CAN WE SEE HER IN
A GLOWING ROCK?

327
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,916
( gasps )

328
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,791
- MY DEAR DAUGHTER.
ARE YOU DOING WELL?

329
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,583
- UH-HUH. I'M FINE, MAMA.
I'M JUST HAPPY TO SEE YOU!

330
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,250
- YOU'VE BROUGHT MY
DAUGHTER BACK TO ME.

331
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,166
I CAN'T BEGIN TO
THANK YOU ENOUGH.

332
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,041
- HEY, NO PROBLEM.

333
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,125
- I'VE MISSED MY
DAUGHTER SO VERY MUCH.

334
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,000
AND I'VE BEEN SO
WORRIED ABOUT HER.

335
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,583
BUT FOR THE TIME BEING,
I CAN ONLY APPEAR IN THIS FORM.

336
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,916
I'M SORRY, HAZUKI.

337
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,166
I LONG FOR THE DAY THAT I CAN
HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS AGAIN.

338
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,708
BUT UNTIL THAT TIME,
YOUNG MAN,

339
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,291
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO
TAKE CARE OF HER FOR ME.

340
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,333
- YES, MA'AM!

341
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,833
- ( chuckles )

342
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:11,833
- I'M READY TO GO.

343
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,458
- TELL ME HOW IT WENT FIRST.

344
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,708
DID YOU AND YOUR MOTHER HAVE
A NICE TIME CATCHING UP?

345
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,166
- MMM-HMM.

346
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,083
- UH, YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT
TAKING THE CAT HOME, RIGHT?

347
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,000
- BUT MAMA SAYS THAT
IF I KEEP HIM WITH ME,

348
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,833
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO COME
VISIT SOMETIMES.

349
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,166
- WELL, OKAY THEN.

350
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,958
- I WONDER WHAT MY MAMA MEANT
BY THAT LAST THING SHE SAID.

351
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,291
IT WORRIES ME A BIT.

352
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,208
- HAZUKI, DEAR.
THERE WILL COME A TIME

353
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,708
WHEN YOU WILL FIND SOMEONE
WHO YOU TRULY LOVE.

354
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:55,916
WHEN THAT DAY ARRIVES,

355
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,708
YOU MUST NOT SEAL THE
BLOOD PACT WITH HIM.

356
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,708
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
NEVER WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE.

357
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,500
- BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

358
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:08,125
I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO
TRUST HER UNTIL I DO.

359
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,625
DON'T YOU THINK, HAIJI?

360
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,666
- ( meows )

361
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,750
- ( yawns ) MAN, I'M TIRED.

362
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,458
- WHAT A STRIKINGLY
HANDSOME BOYFRIEND

363
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,250
YOU HAVE THERE, MISTRESS LUNA.

364
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,166
- ( theme song playing )

365
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

366
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,708
- Hazuki: OKAY, BIG BROTHER,
I HAVE ANOTHER RIDDLE FOR YOU.

367
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,500
WHY DO SQUIRRELS SPEND
SO MUCH TIME IN THE TREES?

368
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,125
THIS IS ONE THAT I HAPPEN
TO AGREE WITH COMPLETELY.

369
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,083
YOU SHOULD KNOW THE ANSWER.

370
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:12,041
FULL, FULL, FULL MOON!
TIME'S UP!

371
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,583
ON THE NEXT MOON PHASE,

372
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,833
"BIG BROTHER,
I FEEL LIKE KISSING."

373
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,541
WHY DO SQUIRRELS SPEND
SO MUCH TIME IN THE TREES?

374
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,916
DUH! TO GET AWAY FROM
ALL THE NUTS ON THE GROUND!

375
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,833
- ( giggles ) WAIT A MINUTE.
SQUIRRELS LIKE NUTS!
