1
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:14,041
- Hazuki: MAMA?
- Woman: WHAT IS IT, SWEETHEART?

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,916
- Hazuki: UM, I KNOW I'M NOT
A LITTLE KID ANYMORE,

3
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,291
BUT CAN I PUT MY HEAD
IN YOUR LAP? AND SLEEP?

4
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:36,916
MAMA, I LOVE YOU.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

5
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,458
- ( lightning bolt )

6
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,666
- I'M SO HAPPY.

7
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,416
- Kinkel: CLING TO YOUR
DREAMS, CHILD.

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,083
THEY ARE MY GIFT TO YOU,
WELCOMING YOU BACK TO THE FOLD.

9
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,208
I WENT TO GREAT PAINS
TO FIND YOU,

10
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,333
AND SOON I WILL HAVE MY REWARD
AS YOU CEASE TO BE HAZUKI

11
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,125
AND BECOME MISTRESS LUNA.

12
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,875
- Elfriede: COUNT KINKEL,
MY MASTER.

13
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,708
- WHAT IS IT, ELFRIEDE?
I PERMIT YOU TO SPEAK.

14
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,666
- FORGIVE MY
INTERRUPTION, MASTER.

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,541
BUT OUR VIGO HAS
BEEN DESTROYED.

16
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,541
- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

17
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,916
- THERE WERE MORE
CONJURORS THAN EXPECTED.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,125
THEY CAUGHT US BOTH OFF GUARD.

19
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,041
I'M COUNTERING THEIR
ATTACK AS WE SPEAK,

20
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,083
BUT ONE OF THEM MAY BE
HEADING TO YOUR FLOOR.

21
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,583
PLEASE BE CAREFUL, MY MASTER.

22
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:33,875
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, SLAVE.
GOOD NEWS, CHILD.

23
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:37,666
I NEED MORE TIME BEFORE
YOU AWAKE AS MISTRESS LUNA.

24
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,375
YOU MAY ENJOY YOUR DREAMS
A LITTLE LONGER.

25
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,916
- ( thunder rumbling )

26
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,083
- ( theme song playing )

27
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

28
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,708
- Kouhei: RIGHT ON SCHEDULE,
ELFRIEDE. JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

29
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,791
- Elfriede: I MUST
DESTROY COUNT KINKEL.

30
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,583
YOU MAY HELP ME, IF YOU DESIRE.

31
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,875
- DESTROY HIM? I THOUGHT YOU
TWO WERE ON THE SAME SIDE.

32
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:53,958
- NOT QUITE.

33
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,125
- SO MUCH FOR
GETTING USED TO THIS.

34
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,833
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU VAMPIRES,
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY MANNERS?

35
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,458
- IT WAS JUST A LITTLE KISS.

36
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,000
- TELL THAT TO THE
HOLES IN MY NECK!

37
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,125
YOU'VE GOTTA WARN ME
WHEN YOU DO THAT!

38
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,375
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,875
YOUR FANGS ARE STILL WET
WITH KOUHEI'S BLOOD.

40
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,291
OBVIOUSLY YOU EMBRACE
WHAT YOU ARE.

41
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,833
- WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO DESTROY
ONE OF YOUR OWN KIND?

42
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,416
- I'M A VAMPIRE, YES.

43
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,291
BUT IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN
THIS WAY FOR ME.

44
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,125
I'M NOT ONE OF THE BLUE BLOOD,
BORN UNDER VAMPIRE LINEAGE.

45
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:23,500
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I WAS
PURELY HUMAN, JUST LIKE YOU.

46
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,875
I AM A LUDO, A HUMAN VICTIM
WHO WAS CHOSEN

47
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,416
TO BE TURNED VAMPIRE BY
HER MASTER'S KISS.

48
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,083
VAMPIRES LIKE ME ARE BOUND
TO THE ONES WHO BITE US.

49
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,375
WE ARE THEIR SLAVES.

50
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,583
POWERLESS TO DISOBEY,
CHAINED TO THEIR COMMANDS.

51
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,000
THEIR REIGN OVER OUR MINDS
IS SO FAR REACHING,

52
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,750
WE'RE NOT EVEN CAPABLE
OF TELLING THEM LIES.

53
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,333
COUNT KINKEL HAS BEEN MY MASTER,

54
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:49,791
THE ONE I'VE OBEYED FOR FAR
TOO LONG. BUT NOT ANYMORE.

55
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,583
EVERYTHING'S CHANGED NOW THAT
KOUHEI'S COME INTO THE PICTURE.

56
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,125
- ( gasps )

57
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,291
- YOU ARE DIFFERENT
THAN MOST, KOUHEI.

58
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,750
OUR BITES HAVE NO
EFFECT ON YOU.

59
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,333
SURELY YOU MUST'VE REALIZED THAT

60
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,125
FROM YOUR EXPERIENCES
WITH MISTRESS LUNA.

61
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,458
SHE DRINKS YOUR BLOOD, BUT YOU
HAVE NOT BECOME HER SLAVE.

62
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,250
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER
CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR

63
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,083
SUPERNATURAL ESTRANGEMENT THAT
MAKES YOU IMPORTANT TO ME.

64
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,083
JUST AS YOU CANNOT
BECOME A SLAVE,

65
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,750
ANY LUDO WHO TASTES
YOUR BLOOD IS RELEASED

66
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,500
FROM HER MASTER'S POWER AS WELL.

67
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,875
- YOU MEAN KOUHEI'S MADE YOU
FREE NOW THE WAY HAZUKI IS?

68
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:23,333
- I'D HEARD OF THIS BEFORE.
THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

69
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,125
BUT ONLY AS LEGEND, A STORY
LUDO TELL THEMSELVES

70
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,625
TO HELP THEM FALL ASLEEP.

71
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,000
BUT I'VE EXPERIENCED
IT MYSELF NOW...

72
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,666
- AND I KNOW HE IS REAL.
- COMPELLING, INDEED.

73
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,250
- I HAVE PLACED MY
LIPS ON HIM TWICE

74
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,541
SINCE I DISCOVERED WHAT
HE TRULY WAS.

75
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,166
THE FIRST WAS TO
MAKE MYSELF FREE.

76
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,375
BUT TONIGHT I DRANK HIS BLOOD TO
GIVE MYSELF STRENGTH FOR BATTLE.

77
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,666
- HMM. SO WE HAVE COME ON
THREE SEPARATE PATHS,

78
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,625
BUT THEY ALL LEAD TO
THE SAME PLACE.

79
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:54,250
ELFRIEDE, YOU'RE HERE TO FIGHT,
TO ENSURE YOUR NEW FREEDOM.

80
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,916
- AND KOUHEI, YOU'VE COME
TO SAVE A LITTLE GIRL.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,250
- AND YOU?

82
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,041
- I'VE COME TO ASK
THE COUNT A QUESTION

83
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,125
I'VE HAD FOR OVER TEN YEARS NOW.

84
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,666
- THEN, GOOD THING I HAVE THIS.

85
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,541
- YOU CAN DO THIS, KOUHEI.

86
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,333
- Kinkel: SO YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO DESTROYED VIGO.

87
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:30,958
- IS THAT YOU, COUNT?

88
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,041
( gasps )

89
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:54,458
- NICE TRAP. YOU'RE VERY NIMBLE
FOR A WRINKLED, OLD MAN.

90
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,041
- FORGIVE THE RUDE GREETING.

91
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,208
BUT I HAVE A QUESTION AND I WANT
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE LISTENING.

92
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,208
- WELL, I'M ALL EARS.

93
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,958
- CHIZURU MIDO.
DOES THAT NAME RING A BELL?

94
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,666
- ( laughs )

95
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,083
I HOPED YOU WERE GOING TO ASK
ME SOMETHING INTERESTING.

96
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,166
- ANSWER ME! DO YOU KNOW HER?

97
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,750
- THERE IS NOTHING I DETEST MORE

98
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,333
THAN BEING REMINDED
OF UNPLEASANT THINGS.

99
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,250
- JUST MY LUCK.
NO LIGHTS HERE EITHER.

100
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,750
THE WHOLE CIRCUIT
MUST BE TRIPPED.

101
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,000
HAZUKI, ARE YOU IN HERE?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

102
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,125
ELFRIEDE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A BACK BEDROOM.

103
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,458
( exclaims )

104
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,333
NEXT TIME I AM DEFINITELY
BRINGING A FLASHLIGHT.

105
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,375
HUH?

106
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,500
HAZUKI!

107
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,208
OH, COME ON, WHAT THE HELL?

108
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:28,000
OH. PLEASE. NO! IT'S JUST LIKE
THE CASTLE ALL OVER AGAIN!

109
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,333
- ( laughing )

110
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,250
NOW. LET'S SEE HOW WELL
YOU CAN DEFEND, OLD MAN.

111
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,000
- CHIZURU IS MY DAUGHTER

112
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,333
AND SHE WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED
WITH YOUR KIND!

113
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,625
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!

114
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,416
- ( laughs )

115
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,833
YOU MUST BE HARD OF HEARING!

116
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,875
I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT
TO REMEMBER HER!

117
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,625
- ( groaning )

118
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,166
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

119
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,583
HAVE I BEEN TOO ROUGH ON
YOUR AGED AND FRAGILE BONES?

120
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,166
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT QUITTING
BEFORE I'VE HAD ANY FUN.

121
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,666
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. I'M IN
THE MOOD FOR A GOOD RACE.

122
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,416
IT'S TOO BAD YOU'VE JUST
COME TO A DEAD END.

123
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,458
I SEE. THIS ISN'T CHASE.
IT'S HIDE AND SEEK.

124
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,875
- I SUMMON YOU, ARMADEL.

125
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,791
- ELFRIEDE, I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

126
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,666
- ( grunts )

127
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,166
DAMN IT!

128
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:17,208
GRAMPA'S DOIN' ALL HE CAN.
EVEN ELFRIEDE'S PITCHING IN!

129
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,916
AND JUST LOOK AT ME.
I'M ALL ALONE.

130
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,250
I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE POWER TO
BREAK SOME STUPID VINES!

131
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:27,125
( grunting ) DAMN IT!
DAMN! DAMN!

132
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,666
( screaming )

133
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,875
I'M NOT QUITTING! I'M GETTING
YOU OUT, YOU HEAR ME?

134
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,166
I'M NOT GONNA BE
WORTHLESS EVER AGAIN!

135
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,958
- THIS CERTAINLY EXPLAINS YOUR
INCOMPETENCE WITH THE GIRL.

136
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,041
- BEHIND YOU IS A
FISSURE IN SPACE TIME,

137
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,833
CUT BY THE GOD OF SORCERY.

138
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,500
- YOU DARE TAKE ALLEGIANCE WITH
HUMANS, AND DEFY YOUR MASTER?

139
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,875
( Kinkel laughing )

140
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,666
WHAT AN INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT.

141
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,833
ETERNAL LIFE CAN BE
SO BORING, AT TIMES.

142
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,666
AFTER A WHILE
YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL.

143
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,208
BUT THIS!
THIS IS ENTIRELY NEW.

144
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,916
HOW DID THE SLAVE
BREAK HER CHAINS?

145
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,500
NOW THAT IS A REAL ENIGMA
WORTH PONDERING.

146
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,083
THIS IS YOUR FINAL CHANCE
TO CO-OPERATE, COUNT.

147
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,625
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY DAUGHTER

148
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,958
OR YOU'LL MEET YOUR FATE
WITH NO SYMPATHY FROM ME.

149
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,291
- ( laughing )

150
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,500
YOU HONESTLY THINK YOU'RE IN A
POSITION TO MAKE DEMANDS?

151
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,875
THAT I'M AFRAID OF A LITTLE
PINPRICK IN SPACE?

152
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,666
- HE WON'T HELP YOU.

153
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,791
- DO AS YOU'VE PLANNED.

154
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,666
- ( screaming )

155
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,541
- I'M SEALING IT.

156
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,708
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE'VE DEFEATED HIM?

157
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,583
- NO ONE COULD EVER ESCAPE THAT
VACUUM, NOT EVEN THE COUNT.

158
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,833
- THEN YOU'VE
REALIZED YOUR DREAM.

159
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,750
YOU ARE PERMANENTLY FREE.

160
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,083
- SO IT WOULD SEEM,
AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO HIM.

161
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,583
- ALL THANKS TO WHOM?

162
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,125
- THAT'S AN ODD THING
FOR YOU TO ASK.

163
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,250
- ELFRIEDE, GET AWAY!

164
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,375
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- QUIET.

165
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,041
- I'M DISAPPOINTED IN YOU,
MY LITTLE SLAVE.

166
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,375
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF?

167
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,583
NOW TELL ME WHO
YOU MEANT BY "HIM"?

168
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,833
- ( grunting )

169
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,875
I'M NOT QUITTING! NEVER!

170
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,583
- Woman: SEE THE MOON? ONCE
IT'S FREE FROM THE CLOUDS,

171
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,375
YOU'LL EMERGE TOO.
YOU'LL BE LUNA AGAIN.

172
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,458
- Hazuki: ME? LUNA?

173
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,833
- YES, THAT'S WHO YOU ACTUALLY
ARE, MY SWEET DAUGHTER.

174
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,250
HAZUKI'S JUST A MADE UP PERSON.

175
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,541
YOU'VE BEEN VERY GOOD AT
PRETENDING, BUT PLAYTIME'S OVER.

176
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,000
YOUR REAL NAME IS LUNA,

177
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,083
AND I'M HAPPY YOU'LL
BE HER AGAIN SOON.

178
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,916
- Kouhei: HAZUKI!

179
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,416
JUST. HOLD ON. PLEASE!

180
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,958
- I KNOW THAT VOICE.
I'VE HEARD IT BEFORE.

181
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,875
HE CALLS ME HAZUKI.
IS THAT WHO I AM?

182
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,041
- Seiji: HIROMI AND
THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

183
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,625
STILL HAVEN'T SHOWN UP YET?

184
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,166
- Editor: NAH. HAVEN'T HEARD
A PEEP FROM THEM

185
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,333
SINCE THEY WENT OUT ON
SOME STORY ASSIGNMENT.

186
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,333
AH, YEAH, YOU HAD AN APPOINTMENT
WITH HER, DIDN'T YOU?

187
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,500
SORRY, MAN, WE SHOULD
HAVE CALLED.

188
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,000
- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
REACHED ME, ANYWAY.

189
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,708
I WAS WORKING ON MY MANUSCRIPT
IN THE LIBRARY BASEMENT.

190
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,000
MY CELL DOESN'T WORK
DOWN THERE.

191
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,916
- Haiji: THERE YOU ARE!

192
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,875
- HAIJI, WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU'RE SOAKED.

193
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,750
- BIG TROUBLE!

194
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,958
- PSYCHIC HOLOGRAMS!
- THAT'S RIGHT, OLD MAN.

195
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,666
- DROP HER!

196
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,500
WHERE ARE YOU, COUNT?

197
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,208
- RIGHT HERE!

198
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,958
- ( groans )

199
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,583
- YOUR RECOGNITION OF
TECHNIQUES IS IMPRESSIVE.

200
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,583
BY USING MY POWERS
I CAN BEND LIGHT,

201
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,583
CHANGING THE WAY IT REFRACTS TO
CREATE ANY APPEARANCE I CHOOSE.

202
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,791
AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.

203
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,583
AND ONCE I MASTERED THE BASICS,
I LEARNED TO TAKE IT FURTHER.

204
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,416
TWO IMAGES, BUT WHICH IS REAL?
MAYBE NEITHER IS.

205
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,458
YOU WON'T KNOW UNTIL THERE'S
A BOOT AT YOUR THROAT.

206
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,083
SUFFICE TO SAY HER LAST ATTACK
WAS WAY OFF THE MARK.

207
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,750
- DON'T HURT HER.

208
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,125
- BUT I HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW
THIS SLAVE BETRAYED ME.

209
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,458
TELL ME ELDER,
YOU'RE WISE ENOUGH.

210
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,500
WHO'D SHE MEAN BY "HIM"?

211
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,333
- ( grunting )

212
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,750
I'M GONNA GET YOU OUT OF THERE,
HAZUKI! I'M ALMOST THERE!

213
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,125
HAZUKI!

214
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,041
- THAT VOICE.
IT'S COMING FROM THE SKY.

215
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,833
- THE TIME HAS COME.

216
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,208
- WHO COULD IT BE?
IS IT THE MOON?

217
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,750
- ( grunting )

218
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,833
( screams )

219
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,250
HAZUKI? HAZUKI!

220
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,375
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

221
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,666
YOU REALLY HAD ME WORRIED,
KID, YOU KNOW THAT?

222
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,833
- MY NAME IS LUNA.
- WHAT?

223
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,541
- THERE IS NO HAZUKI.

224
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,000
- MISTRESS LUNA HAS
AWAKENED NOW.

225
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,000
YOU'VE WASTED MY
TIME LONG ENOUGH.

226
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,666
- ( groaning )

227
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "LUNA?"

228
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,333
STAND UP! WE'VE GOTTA GET
OUT OF THIS PLACE!

229
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:04,083
- I CAN'T GO. I'M STAYING HERE
WITH MY MOTHER FOREVER.

230
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,208
- LISTEN TO ME, HAZUKI.

231
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,458
YOU DON'T REALIZE
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

232
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,333
YOU'VE BEEN PUT INTO SOME
KIND OF A TRANCE.

233
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,083
COME ON! I'LL GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

234
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,541
- Kinkel: A WEAKLING LIKE YOU
DOESN'T DESERVE HER.

235
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,250
- ELFRIEDE? IS THAT YOU?
WHAT WAS THAT VOICE?

236
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,375
ELFRIEDE, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

237
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,083
- SO THE OLD CONJUROR
WAS JUST A DECOY.

238
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,583
SO MUCH FOR THAT PLAN.

239
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,666
- BASTARD!

240
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,416
- WHAT A USELESS CREATURE.

241
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,750
- THIS IS YOUR CHANCE, HAZUKI,
JUST GET OUT OF HERE!

242
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,291
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, JUST GO!

243
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,750
- HERE'S A BETTER IDEA.

244
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,208
LET'S USE HIM TO TEST YOUR
AWAKENING, MISTRESS LUNA.

245
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,500
DESPAIR, THE AWARENESS OF
IMPENDING SUFFERING

246
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,666
WHEN YOU KNOW
YOU CANNOT PREVENT.

247
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,000
IT IS MY FAVORITE OF
HUMAN EMOTIONS.

248
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,875
- HAZUKI...

249
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,333
- WHY?
- AND TO CAUSE DESPAIR

250
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,875
IN THE ONE WHO TRIED
TO SAVE YOU,

251
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,416
NOTHING CAN BE MORE
BEAUTIFUL THAN THAT.

252
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,333
( maniacal laughter )

253
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:04,125
- THAT SMELL. BLOOD. HIS BLOOD.

254
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,125
I CAN REMEMBER THAT SMELL.

255
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,625
AND I WANT IT. I NEED IT.

256
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,958
- WHAT IS THIS POWER?

257
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,625
- HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE AM I?

258
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:55,083
KOUHEI! WHAT'S GOING ON?
HOW'D WE GET HERE?

259
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,541
- HEY, BRAT.

260
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,250
- WHY ARE YOU LYING ON THE
FLOOR LIKE THAT, YOU DUMMY?

261
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,333
GET UP!

262
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,000
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HAND?

263
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,375
- ABOUT TIME YOU
ACTED NORMAL AGAIN.

264
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,041
YOU CAN BE A REAL PAIN IN THE
ASS SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW THAT?

265
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,041
- BUT, WHAT IS THIS BLOOD FROM?

266
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,958
- AS POWERLESS AS I AM.

267
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,791
I THINK I WAS ACTUALLY
ABLE TO SAVE YOU,

268
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,208
IN A WEIRD SORT OF WAY.

269
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,041
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, KOUHEI?

270
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,458
- YOU WERE WORTH IT.

271
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:28,083
- KOUHEI? KOUHEI! WHAT'S WRONG?
- HE'S NOT A SLAVE AT ALL.

272
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:33,708
HE WAS SOMETHING ELSE. SO THIS
IS THE "HIM" ELFRIEDE SPOKE OF.

273
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,583
THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

274
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:40,208
- NO! BIG BROTHER, PLEASE!

275
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:44,833
- THEN IT ISN'T JUST A LEGEND.
A LUDO FAIRYTALE.

276
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,833
HE IS THE ONE MAN CAPABLE OF

277
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,083
WIPING OUT EVERYTHING
OUR KIND HAS BUILT.

278
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,500
OUR ENTIRE WAY OF LIFE.

279
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:56,000
HE'S OUR WORST NIGHTMARE.
AND HE MUST BE DESTROYED!

280
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,458
FORCES OF LIGHT THAT BIND
ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD!

281
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,583
FUSE TOGETHER AND CAST
THE ENEMY TO THE HEART OF HELL.

282
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,875
PENETRATE THE ILLUSION.
BE CRUSHED BY THE LIGHT.

283
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,791
PURITY THAT BINDS ALL THE
CORNERS OF THE WORLD,

284
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,625
PIERCE THE HEART.

285
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,541
YOUR FATE BE SEALED!

286
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,000
WHAT'S THIS?

287
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,708
- ( coughing )

288
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,583
- MASTER!

289
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,041
- NO, KOUHEI...
PLEASE...

290
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,166
- STEP AWAY.

291
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,916
- NO! I'M NOT
LEAVING HIM! STOP!

292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,416
- SEIJI, LET HER TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED.

293
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,250
- I'M NOT SURE. I WAS
DREAMING ABOUT MY MOTHER.

294
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,625
WE WERE SITTING BY A TREE,
WE WERE HAPPY. AND THEN...

295
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,541
AND THEN I HEARD KOUHEI'S
VOICE UP IN THE SKY.

296
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,833
I TRIED TO SEE HIM
BUT I COULDN'T.

297
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,666
AND WHEN I WOKE UP,
HE WAS ON THE FLOOR!

298
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,958
- HIS LEFT LUNG HAS BEEN
PUNCTURED. WE HAVE TO GO.

299
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,000
- ( gasps )

300
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:30,333
- AN UTTER FAILURE, SPURRED
BY TOO MANY UNKNOWNS.

301
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,125
BUT NOW THE TRUTH IS EXPOSED.

302
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,458
ORDER IN THE VAMPIRE
CLAN IS MAINTAINED BY

303
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,875
THE SACRED HIERARCHY, BUILT
ON THE POWER OF BLOOD TIES.

304
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,583
AND ORDER MUST BE RESTORED.

305
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,375
THIS SLAVE I CAN HANDLE.

306
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,666
SHE'LL LEARN THE PENALTY OF

307
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,625
TRYING TO ESCAPE
HER MASTER'S GRIP.

308
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,000
BUT AS FOR YOU, BOY...

309
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,041
- ( siren wailing )

310
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:12,583
- Kinkel: THE BREAKER OF BLOOD
TIES. THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

311
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,666
YOU'RE FAR TOO DANGEROUS
TO BE LEFT ALIVE.

312
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:31,041
- ( theme song playing )

313
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,708
- ( singing in French )

314
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,708
- BIG BROTHER,
I'M TIRED OF RIDDLES.

315
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,291
LET'S TRY SOMETHING ELSE THAT
CAN BE EVEN MORE FUN!

316
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,625
YA HAVE TO THINK AS HARD AS YOU
CAN, AND SEE IF YOU CAN

317
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,916
COME UP WITH SOMETHING
NO ONE'S EVER THOUGHT BEFORE!

318
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,416
YOU READY? FULL, FULL, FULL...
MOON! WELL?

319
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,250
DID YOU THINK OF SOMETHING
REALLY SMART AND ORIGINAL?

320
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,833
TELL YOU WHAT. WE BETTER MAKE
THAT YOUR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

321
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,458
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A LOT OF TIME

322
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,583
TO THINK RIGHT NOW, ANYWAY.

323
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,083
NEXT, IT'S EPISODE 10,

324
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,791
"YOU'RE MY SLAVE AND
I WON'T FORGIVE YOU!"
