1
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:13,750
MY BIG BROTHER.

2
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:29,083
NOW, BIG BROTHER,
YOU BELONG TO ME.

3
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,833
- ( theme song playing )

4
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

5
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,041
- ( gasps )

6
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,750
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME?

7
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,750
- YOU MAY CALL ME LUNA.

8
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:41,333
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
THAT I'VE TASTED HUMAN BLOOD.

9
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,166
NOW, PLACE YOUR LIPS ON MY HAND.

10
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,916
PROVE YOUR LOYALTY TO ME.

11
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,333
- YEAH, THAT'S IT. RIGHT THERE.

12
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,708
THAT'S THE LOOK I
WANTED TO CAPTURE.

13
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,083
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T MOVE.

14
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,833
- ( gasps )

15
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:06,875
- WHERE DID I PUT MY CAMERA?

16
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,666
MAN, I HOPE I DIDN'T
LOSE IT AGAIN.

17
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,208
- ( chuckles ) RIGHT.
LET'S SEE THAT LOOK.

18
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,875
- ( grunts )

19
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,875
- UH, THAT'S NOT QUITE
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

20
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,208
IT WAS SOMETHING WITH A LITTLE
MORE PRIDE BEHIND THE EYES.

21
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,958
YOU THINK YOU COULD TRY
TO GET THAT BACK FOR ME?

22
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,500
HAZUKI?

23
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,166
- ( gasps )

24
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,166
- ( screaming )

25
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,916
- WHAT THE HELL?
OKAY, HAZUKI, LET ME GO!

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,875
- NEVER CALL ME
BY MY NAME AGAIN.

27
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,708
YOU WILL ADDRESS ME AS
"MISTRESS" OR "GODDESS"

28
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,166
AND NOTHING ELSE. GOT IT?

29
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,041
- HAZUKI, LET ME GO.
- HMM.

30
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,375
- THAT HURT, MAN.

31
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,458
OW, MY FACE.

32
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,333
- COME HERE
AND SMASH THIS THING.

33
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,750
THEN I'LL FINALLY BE FREE
FROM THIS PLACE!

34
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,875
- OKAY.

35
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,166
- OW.
- I GAVE YOU AN ORDER.

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,958
- ( growls )

37
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,458
- HEY, WHAT'S THE
MATTER WITH YOU?

38
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,041
WHAT IS WITH THIS HIGH
AND MIGHTY ROUTINE?

39
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,708
- OH, I'M SORRY.
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

40
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,916
- ( screams )

41
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,458
- YOU'RE STILL THE SAME.
- HUH?

42
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,625
- YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL.
WHY? WHY HAVEN'T YOU CHANGED?

43
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,375
STUPID! STUPID! STUPID!
STUPID! STUPID!

44
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,875
- WHAT DID YOU EXPECT ME
TO CHANGE INTO? A FLYING COW?

45
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,166
I'M NOT A MAGICIAN.
I'M JUST A REGULAR GUY.

46
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,083
- YOU SHOULD BE MY SLAVE.

47
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,625
- YOUR SLAVE?
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

48
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:56,833
- NO, I'M NOT CRAZY.

49
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,541
IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN
WHEN I KISS SOMEONE.

50
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,666
YOU BECOME MY SLAVE
FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY.

51
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,833
- WELL, I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS,

52
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,125
BUT I'M NOT ANYONE'S SLAVE,

53
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,541
NO MATTER WHO I'M KISSING.

54
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,000
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S
A KISS FROM YOU.

55
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,458
- OH, YEAH? YOU THINK YOU CAN

56
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,833
LOOK ME IN THE EYES
AND SAY THAT?

57
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:12,958
- UH-HUH.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,041
- HOW ABOUT NOW?
- NOW? WHAT ABOUT NOW?

59
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,083
- I MEAN, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
DOING EVERYTHING I SAY NOW?

60
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,208
- NO FREAKING WAY.

61
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,458
- ( screams )

62
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,333
- YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
A BIG, MEAN, STUPID-HEAD!

63
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,250
YOU MAKE ME CRAZY!

64
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,416
- ( sighs )

65
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
- I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU,
I HATE YOU!

66
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,208
AFTER ALL MY PRACTICE...

67
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:51,291
I WAITED SO LONG AND I TRIED
SO HARD AND FOR ALL MY TROUBLE,

68
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,958
ALL I GOT WAS EMBARRASSED.

69
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,458
AND YOU'RE EXACTLY THE SAME.
WHY WON'T YOU CHANGE?

70
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,041
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW AWFUL THIS IS!

71
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,916
I'M STUCK IN THIS
HORRIBLE CASTLE

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,083
UNTIL YOU START
OBEYING MY ORDERS.

73
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,291
- ( thunder rumbling )

74
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,833
- HERE AT THE SCHWARTZ QUELLE
CASTLE IN SOUTHERN GERMANY,

75
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,583
STRANGE HAPPENINGS ARE
CHURNING INSIDE IT'S WALLS.

76
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,166
WHAT ENERGIES WIND
THEIR WAY THROUGH

77
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,125
THESE OLD STONE HALLWAYS
MARRED BY TRAGEDY?

78
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,916
THE RENOWNED PSYCHIC SEIJI MIDO
AND HIS CAMERAMAN KOUHEI MORIOKA

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,416
HAVE BOTH ENTERED THE CASTLE,

80
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,000
COURAGEOUS TO FACE
WHAT EVILS MAY LURK.

81
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,250
THE QUESTION THAT REMAINS IS,
WILL THEY RETURN UNHARMED?

82
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,375
( sighs )

83
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,500
I HOPE YOU TWO ARE ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T WANNA LEAVE HERE ALONE.

84
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,083
- ( thunderbolt )

85
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,333
- Vigo: HOW PATHETIC.

86
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,500
TOSSING AROUND SUCH
UNINSPIRED PSYCHIC ATTACKS

87
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,166
WITH NO SPIRITUAL ABILITY.

88
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,666
NOW ALL THAT REMAINS IS TO RID
THIS PLACE OF THAT OTHER ONE.

89
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,791
THE ONE WHO CROSSES
MY MASTER'S BARRIER

90
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,958
WITH NO REGARD
FOR HIS SPIRITUAL DEFENSES.

91
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,708
- Seiji: YES. MY COUSIN'S
ALWAYS BEEN A BIT THICK-HEADED.

92
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,125
- HUH?

93
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,208
- SORRY, I'D RATHER NOT HAVE
HAD TO PLAY DEAD FOR YOU.

94
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,041
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY

95
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:28,000
I COULD THINK OF TO GET YOU
OUTSIDE OF THAT BARRIER.

96
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:33,791
- I, SEE. SO, YOU, UNLIKE YOUR
FRIEND, CAN SEE ALL THIS!

97
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,083
- ( thunder rumbling )

98
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,416
- THEN YOU'RE NO ORDINARY HUMAN.

99
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,625
- THAT MAKES US EVEN, MY FRIEND.

100
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,875
I CALL ON AMEI,
GOD OF THE EAST SEA.

101
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,916
SHUKURYOU, GOD OF THE WEST SEA.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,583
KYOJOU, GOD OF THE SOUTH SEA.

103
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,166
KUGYOU, GOD OF THE NORTH SEA.

104
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,583
GODS OF THE FOUR SEAS,
GUARDIANS OF US ALL.

105
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,083
DISPERSE THIS EVIL.
KYUU KYUUNYO RITSURYO!

106
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,750
- ( screams )

107
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,500
- SO THERE'S A BARRIER
OF PSYCHIC ENERGY

108
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,041
SURROUNDING THIS CASTLE.

109
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,125
- YES. AND ONLY
WHEN IT'S BROKEN CAN I LEAVE.

110
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,250
SO YOU BELIEVE ME?

111
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,083
- OF COURSE. MY GRANDPA NEVER
STOPS TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF.

112
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,708
I'VE BEEN AROUND IT
MY WHOLE LIFE.

113
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,708
- I CAN'T EVEN TOUCH IT,
THE BARRIER. I'M TRAPPED.

114
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,250
I CAN'T TOUCH IT
OR THE PERSON WHO CREATED IT.

115
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,208
THAT'S WHY, I NEEDED YOU.

116
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,083
- ( sighs )

117
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,541
WELL...

118
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:01,166
- IF I COULD SHATTER THAT THING
MYSELF, I WOULD'VE DONE IT.

119
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,083
- SURE, WHY NOT?
IT'S JUST A CRYSTAL.

120
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,875
SHOULDN'T BE HARD TO BREAK
IF I PUT MY BACK INTO IT.

121
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,416
- ( gasps )

122
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,083
- THERE'S JUST ONE LITTLE THING
YOU NEED TO DO FOR ME FIRST,

123
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,083
THEN I'LL SMASH THAT
SUCKER, NO SWEAT.  

124
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,625
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN, SHORTY?

125
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,000
- HMM. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

126
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,875
- I JUST WANT YOU TO SAY
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, LIKE,

127
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,791
"BIG BROTHER, BREAK THAT
CRYSTAL, PRETTY PLEASE!"

128
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,916
- HUH? PRETTY PLEASE?

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,250
YOU WANT ME TO SAY
"PRETTY PLEASE" TO MY SLAVE?

130
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,541
- ( sigh ) YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY BEGGING

131
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,125
FOR A GOOD PUNCH IN THE MOUTH.

132
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,583
- A GOOD SLAVE WOULDN'T TALK
TO HIS MASTER THAT WAY!

133
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,208
- YEAH? WELL YOU'RE NOT
MY MASTER, YOU SCHIZO!

134
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,208
FIRST YOU'RE ALL LOVEY,
THEN YOU TURN PSYCHO.

135
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,125
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

136
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,750
- ( inaudible )

137
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,041
- I SAY CHOOSE A PERSONALITY
AND STICK WITH IT.

138
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,666
- I'M A GIRL! MOOD SWINGS
COME WITH THE TERRITORY,

139
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,791
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?

140
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,041
- I GUESS I'M LEARNING.

141
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,291
- ( rumbling )

142
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,625
- WHOA. WHAT'S WITH
THAT RUMBLING?

143
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,708
- OH, NO. THIS ISN'T GOOD.
HE'S COMING BACK!

144
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,625
- ( both screaming )

145
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,708
- ( groaning )

146
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,666
- Vigo: UNFORGIVABLE!

147
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,166
YOU DARE ENTER THE CASTLE
I AM CHARGED WITH PROTECTING

148
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,625
AND TRY TO LURE AWAY
MY MISTRESS?

149
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,541
- UH, IF THE GIANT TALKING HEAD
IS REAL,

150
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,166
THEN IT'S TIME FOR
ME TO GO HOME.

151
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,208
- I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN
VIGO THIS UPSET BEFORE.

152
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,583
HE'S ACTUALLY BECOME
THE CASTLE WALLS.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,125
- AH!

154
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,458
- YOU THINK YOU CAN RUN
FROM ME?

155
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,041
- ( screams )

156
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,666
- ( Vigo growling )

157
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,750
- ( screams )

158
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,875
- ( both panting )

159
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,791
- WE HAVE TO THINK
OF ANOTHER PLAN.

160
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,416
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
SMASHING THAT CRYSTAL

161
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,000
IS GONNA BE SUCH AN EASY TASK.

162
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,583
- YEAH, YA THINK?
WELL, FORGET IT!

163
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,583
I'VE HAD JUST ABOUT
ENOUGH OF THIS CRAZY FARM.

164
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,708
I'M OUT OF HERE!

165
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,958
- IT'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD.
- OH, NO?

166
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,500
- JUST CALM DOWN. THERE'S
NO WAY VIGO CAN HURT ME.

167
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,750
YOU'LL BE SAFE AND SOUND
AS LONG AS YOU STICK BY MY SIDE.

168
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,125
LET ME FILL YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

169
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,125
DESTROY THE CRYSTAL I SHOWED YOU

170
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,750
AND YOU DESTROY THE
SOURCE OF VIGO'S POWER.

171
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,916
SO, WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, HUH?

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,833
- I GUESS I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
I'LL FIND THE STUPID CRYSTAL.

173
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,000
- THANK YOU.
COME ON NOW, LET'S HUG!

174
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,833
- ( sighs )

175
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,541
- ( chuckles )

176
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,750
- HEY, GET OFF!

177
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,625
- I MAY NOT KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THE SPIRIT WORLD,

178
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:11,166
BUT EVEN I CAN FEEL THAT ENERGY.

179
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,083
- WE'RE SO FAR APART AND

180
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,458
HE CAN STILL COUNTER EVERY
SPELL I THROW HIS WAY.

181
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,041
AMAZING!

182
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,041
- I HAVE BEEN
ENTRUSTED BY MY MASTER

183
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,833
TO MAKE SURE NO ONE PENETRATES
THIS CASTLE.

184
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,000
NO MATTER HOW GREAT
THEIR ENERGY.

185
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,416
- ( Kouhei panting )

186
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,416
( gasps )

187
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:38,791
A DEAD END.

188
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,666
- AWAY WITH YOU.

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,208
YOU CAN PUT ME DOWN NOW
IF YOU WANT TO.

190
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,333
- OH. SURE.

191
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,375
- FOLLOW ME.

192
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,208
- ( screaming )

193
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,333
- HAZUKI, NO!

194
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,208
- Vigo: I CANNOT ALLOW YOU
TO LEAVE, MISTRESS LUNA.

195
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,041
- PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW, VIGO!

196
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,541
- THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION
OF MY SWORN OATH

197
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,958
AND I CANNOT DO THAT.

198
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,458
- KOUHEI, GET TO THE CRYSTAL!

199
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,208
- BUT, BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT.

200
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,958
- KNOCK IT TO THE FLOOR
AND SHATTER IT.

201
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,708
FREE ME.

202
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,083
- I'LL GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

203
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,250
I GOTTA BE A MORON PUTTING
MYSELF THROUGH ALL THIS TROUBLE!

204
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,000
- NO, THIS CANNOT BE!
HE'S IMMUNE TO MY ATTACKS!

205
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,375
EVERY OUNCE OF ENERGY THAT
I USE AGAINST HIM IS WASTED!

206
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,958
- AH, GEEZ. WHAT IS THAT?

207
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:01,875
( gasps )

208
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,000
( screams )

209
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,208
( grunts )

210
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,375
OH, NO.

211
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,541
- ( Vigo screaming )

212
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,875
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

213
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,125
- IT'S THE AMULET
THAT GRAMPS GAVE ME.

214
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,041
I GET IT.

215
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,916
THIS PROTECTED ME.

216
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,875
- I'LL SEE YOU DEAD FOR THIS!

217
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,541
- ( screams )

218
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,416
- I SEE YOUR INJURY
IS NO RUSE THIS TIME.

219
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,250
WHICH MEANS MY NEXT MOVE
WILL SEAL YOUR FATE.

220
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,291
- PUT ME DOWN. IT'S OKAY.

221
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,125
GO AHEAD.
YOU CAN GET RID OF HIM.

222
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,750
HE DISHONORED THE BLOOD PACT

223
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:44,000
WHEN HE REFUSED TO BECOME
MY SLAVE. UNFORGIVABLE.

224
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,791
- ( panting )

225
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,666
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.
HERE GOES.

226
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,958
- ( rumbling )

227
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,000
- HUH?

228
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,166
( screams )

229
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,750
- YOUR DAY OF RECKONING
HAS COME. PREPARE TO DIE!

230
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,125
- ( screams )

231
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,083
I BET I CAN HIT THAT
THING FROM HERE.

232
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,000
( grunts )

233
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,000
- IS THAT...
AN INCARNATION?

234
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,958
- ( screaming ) NO!

235
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,250
- NO!

236
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,750
- HAZUKI, GET OUTTA HERE!

237
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,291
- WE DON'T WANT YOU HURT,
MISTRESS LUNA. YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

238
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,375
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

239
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,500
BUT MY NAME IS NOT LUNA!

240
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,541
I'M NO ONE'S CAGED BIRD.

241
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,166
AND I REFUSE TO STAY IN THIS
HORRIBLE CASTLE ANY LONGER!

242
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,500
- THAT'S IT.
THERE IS IT'S WEAKNESS!

243
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,458
- ( screams )

244
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,833
- ( roars )

245
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,125
- ( screams )

246
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,583
- HUH?

247
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,375
- YOU AND ME, YOU PIECE OF JUNK.

248
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,083
YOU'VE STOLEN ENOUGH
OF HAZUKI'S LIFE!

249
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,625
- ( screams )

250
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,666
- ( screaming )

251
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,916
- NOW, THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE EVERY DAY.

252
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,166
- IT'S TIME TO SAY
GOODBYE, LUNA.

253
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,291
YOU COULD ONLY EXIST
INSIDE THE BARRIER

254
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,916
AND NOW IT'S GONE FOREVER.
YOU'RE NO LONGER PART OF ME.

255
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,666
- HAZUKI, WHERE ARE WE?

256
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,666
( screams ) HAZUKI!

257
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,166
- ( theme song playing )

258
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,708
- ( singing in French )

259
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,833
- Hiromi: IT'S TIME TO
GO HOME, KOUHEI.

260
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,500
WE SEARCHED THIS
WHOLE PLACE FOR HER.

261
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,333
SHE'S NOT HERE ANYMORE.

262
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,750
- Seiji: I DON'T SENSE
ANY HUMANS OR SPIRITS

263
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,291
ANYWHERE IN THE AREA.

264
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,208
I THINK THIS PLACE IS EMPTY.

265
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,500
- Hiromi: WELL, AN EMPTY CASTLE

266
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,833
REALLY PUTS OUR STORY
IN THE TOILET.

267
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,291
"THE CASE FILE
OF PSYCHIC SEIJI MIDO."

268
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:29,458
"A SPECIAL EDITION, SPIRITS IN A
GERMAN CASTLE" BY HIROMI ANZAI.

269
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,791
UGH, IT SOUNDED SO GOOD.

270
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,041
I GUESS IN THE END,
SHE WAS PROBABLY

271
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,208
JUST YOUR AVERAGE
GHOST ANYWAY.

272
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,833
BUT, HEY, YOU SHOULD BE GLAD
YOU FINALLY GOT TO SEE ONE.

273
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,208
YOU'VE GRADUATED FROM
BEING IMPERVIOUS TO SPIRITS

274
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,083
TO SENSING THEM...

275
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,625
A BIT. PRETTY COOL.

276
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,416
- Kouhei: BUT WOULD A GHOST
HAVE PHYSICAL SHAPE?

277
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,708
WOULD IT ACTUALLY FEEL WARM?

278
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,166
DO GHOSTS KISS?

279
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,583
- ( airplane engine whirring )

280
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,708
- IT FIGURES THE STUPID AIRLINE
WOULD LOSE MY LUGGAGE.

281
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,541
I HAD ALL MY GOOD LENSES
PACKED IN THERE.

282
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,416
IF THEY DON'T FIND MY STUFF,
I'M OUT HUNDREDS.

283
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,083
MAN, THIS TOTALLY SUCKS.

284
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,083
( sighs )

285
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,541
HI, GUYS. I'M HOME.

286
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,458
- GOOD. KOUHEI, IT'S ABOUT TIME.
COME ON IN.

287
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,833
- THEY NEVER FOUND YOUR LUGGAGE,
HUH? THAT'S TOO BAD.

288
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,625
- AT LEAST YOU MADE
IT HOME SAFE.

289
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,083
- GEEZ, WE'VE BEEN
WAITING FOREVER.

290
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,000
WHAT TOOK YOU SO
LONG, BIG BROTHER?

291
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,375
- I GOT STUCK IN CUSTOMS.
IT SUCKED!

292
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,458
( gasps )

293
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,500
( exclaiming in fright )

294
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,958
- OH, RIGHT, I THINK
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY

295
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,416
FOR SAYING HAZUKI WAS A GHOST,

296
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,041
'CAUSE UH, SHE'S, SHE'S NOT.

297
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,583
- SHE EXPLAINED
THE SITUATION TO US.

298
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,250
IT SEEMS YOU TWO HAD YOURSELVES

299
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,333
QUITE AN ADVENTURE IN
THAT DARK CASTLE.

300
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,541
- YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS DOESN'T

301
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,250
SEEM A LITTLE UNUSUAL
TO YOU GUYS?

302
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,208
I MEAN WHAT THE HECK
IS SHE DOING IN MY HOUSE?

303
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,875
- ACTUALLY, THIS IS MY HOUSE.

304
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,000
I JUST LET YOU LIVE
HERE RENT FREE.

305
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,625
- OH, CUT IT OUT GRANDPA.

306
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,208
MAYBE YOU WANNA
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME.

307
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,500
- I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU
AGAIN. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

308
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,416
DO YOU MISS ME, BIG BROTHER?

309
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,750
- ( sighs ) JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

310
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,083
- WELL, YOU SAID YOU
WANTED ME TO POSE FOR YOU

311
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,541
SO I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
HAPPY THAT I CAME HERE.

312
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,166
- AND WHAT EXACTLY
GAVE YOU THE IDEA

313
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,833
THAT I WANT YOU TO POSE FOR ME
WHILE LIVING IN MY HOUSE?

314
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,125
- ( crying ) IT'S BECAUSE
OF THE KISS, ISN'T IT?

315
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,333
YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

316
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,833
- HUH?
- YOU CAN'T EVEN STAND

317
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,083
TO LOOK AT ME ANYMORE.

318
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,750
- WHAT DID YOU DO
TO THIS POOR LITTLE THING?

319
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,250
- I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
TO HER, GEEZ!

320
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,166
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S ALL CALM DOWN.

321
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,458
WE JUST NEED TO ACCEPT
THAT THIS IS KOUHEI'S FAULT.

322
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,708
AND NO ONE ELSE'S.

323
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,250
- WHAT? I NEVER SAID
OR DID ANYTHING

324
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,541
TO THIS LITTLE NUT JOB!

325
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,333
- SINCE MY GRANDSON SAYS
HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU,

326
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,000
I WILL BE.

327
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,333
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A DEAL
TO YOU, YOUNG LADY?

328
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,375
- ( gasps )

329
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:24,041
- I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.
I PUT MYSELF IN YOUR CARE.

330
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:30,125
- GRAMPS, YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME! YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

331
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,166
NOW WHAT?

332
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,375
- SEE, BIG BROTHER?

333
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,208
I TOLD YOU I'D MAKE
YOU MY SLAVE.

334
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,125
- ( growls )
I AM NOT YOUR SLAVE!

335
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,208
- Ryuuhei: SO, SHE'S NOT HUMAN.

336
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,750
- Seiji: THAT'S RIGHT.

337
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,791
IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS ARE GONNA
GET INTERESTING AROUND HERE.

338
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,458
- Ryuuhei: ( chuckles )
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

339
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,958
THAT YOUNG LADY COULD
COMPLICATE THINGS QUITE A BIT.

340
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,958
- Hazuki: RIDDLE TIME AGAIN,
BIG BROTHER!

341
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,500
THIS IS AN EASY ONE.

342
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,500
WHERE DO ANIMALS GO
WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR TAILS?

343
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:07,625
YOU'D HAVE TO BE REALLY DUMB
NOT TO GET THIS ONE.

344
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:14,333
READY? GO! FULL, FULL,
FULL MOON! TIME'S UP!

345
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,833
NEXT TIME ON MOON PHASE,
EPISODE THREE.

346
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,208
"BIG BROTHER,
LET'S LIVE TOGETHER."

347
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,208
WANNA KNOW THE ANSWER, DUMMY?

348
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,625
WHEN ANIMALS LOSE THEIR TAILS,
THEY GO TO THE RETAIL STORE!

349
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,666
- ( giggles )
