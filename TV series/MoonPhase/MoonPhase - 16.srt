1
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,750
- Frieze: IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME, MARIO.

2
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:26,416
- Mario: IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

3
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,833
- WELL, HERE I AM. SO, SPEAK.

4
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:41,208
- THE ALL-POWERFUL FORTUNETELLER

5
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:43,458
NEEDS ME TO TELL
HER WHY I'VE COME.

6
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,208
FASCINATING.

7
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,333
- YOU SEEK MISTRESS LUNA.

8
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:54,541
- VERY GOOD.

9
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:56,166
WHERE IS SHE?

10
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:09,916
- IF YOU'VE COME
LOOKING FOR HER,

11
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,500
THAT MEANS YOU KNOW WHAT BECAME
OF COUNT HEINRICH VON KINKEL.

12
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:14,666
I'D BE CAREFUL.

13
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,083
WOULDN'T WANT TO SHARE HIS FATE.

14
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:20,041
- DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME, FORTUNETELLER.

15
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:21,166
- NO?

16
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:24,000
- NO. I'M NOT AS WEAK
AS THE COUNT.

17
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,458
- ( chuckles )

18
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:41,125
- BOOKS.

19
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:51,541
GOODBYE, FRIEZE. THANK YOU.

20
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:53,416
- ( theme song playing )

21
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

22
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
- ( sneezes )

23
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:30,333
- MAN, IT'S COLD TODAY.

24
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:36,500
- ( sneezes )

25
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,583
- WELL, THIS COULD TAKE A WHILE.

26
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:47,208
( yawns )

27
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:56,791
( gasps )

28
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:59,208
OH, RIGHT. SHE'S A DAY WALKER.

29
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,375
I GUESS I HAVE TO
GET USED TO THAT.

30
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:03,291
- Hazuki: ALMOST TIME.
YOU READY?

31
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:04,875
- Haiji: READY!

32
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:06,458
- HEY, WHAT'RE YOU GUYS DOING?

33
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:07,958
- SHH! BE QUIET.

34
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:10,458
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A
BATTLE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL.

35
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:12,416
- Kouhei: GOOD AND EVIL?

36
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:16,208
WHICH ONE ARE YOU?

37
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:23,166
SO YOU'RE FIGHTING A BUN?

38
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,291
- HERE IT COMES!

39
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:29,125
- IT'S A CROW.

40
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:31,333
- ( cawing )

41
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:33,958
- NOW!
- I'M ON IT!

42
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:36,750
- ( screams )

43
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:40,125
- KICK HIS LITTLE CROW BUTT!
LET HIM HAVE IT!

44
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,625
- ( screams )

45
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,833
- ALRIGHT!

46
01:04:44,916 --> 01:04:46,291
- GEEZ. POOR CROW.

47
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:48,458
- DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE
FORCES OF EVIL. THEY'RE SNEAKY.

48
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:49,583
- LIKE THAT?

49
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,125
- ( crow caws )

50
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,208
- WHAT?

51
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:56,000
HE BROUGHT REINFORCEMENTS!

52
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,083
- HE WHAT?

53
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,958
- ( pounding )

54
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:04,500
- HAIJI!

55
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,291
- NO! MY POOR, SWEET HAIJI.

56
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,500
- ( crow cawing )

57
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:28,000
- STUPID!

58
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:31,500
I HATE THOSE EVIL, THIEVING,
UGLY, HORRIBLE, MEAN CROWS!

59
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:32,750
- WOMEN.

60
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,666
- YOU SHOULDN'T SCOFF
AT MY MASTER'S PAIN.

61
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,708
THIS IS AN EPIC
TALE OF STOLEN LOVE.

62
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,333
AND THE THWARTED
RETRIBUTION THAT FOLLOWS!

63
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:42,750
IT BEGINS WITH TWO BEAUTIFUL
NEKOMIMI BUNS FROM FURUFURU-DO,

64
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:45,041
BOUGHT WITH INNOCENT
HOPE FOR A TASTY SNACK

65
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:46,916
BY THE SWEET YOUNG
GIRL BEFORE YOU.

66
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,791
SHE AND HER SHIKIGAMI JOURNEYED
TO THE KITCHEN TO MAKE TEA

67
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:52,000
ONLY TO DISCOVER,
UPON THEIR RETURN,

68
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,166
THAT THE BEAUTIFUL BUNS
WERE BEING PILFERED AWAY!

69
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,666
- ( both yell )

70
01:05:57,666 --> 01:05:58,708
- HEY!

71
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:03,250
COME BACK HERE, YOU FOUL BEAST!

72
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:07,166
- Haiji: BUT, ALAS,
HE DID NOT RETURN

73
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:08,583
AND THE FURUFURU-DO BUN

74
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:11,250
THAT MASTER SO LOVED WAS
NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN.

75
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:13,208
AND SO WE HATCHED
A FEARSOME PLOT.

76
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:14,958
WE'LL NEVER GIVE UP!

77
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,791
- OH, HAIJI, MY TRUE FRIEND!

78
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:19,458
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
IN THE WORLD WHO UNDERSTANDS ME.

79
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:23,041
- OKAY. SO YOU'RE AT WAR
WITH SOME EVIL CROWS, HUH?

80
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:24,166
WELL, THAT'S ABOUT AVERAGE

81
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,125
ON THE WEIRD SCALE
FOR A VAMPIRE GIRL.

82
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:27,583
- THEY SHALL KNOW PAIN!

83
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:29,875
OH, YES THEY SHALL, MY FRIEND.

84
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:31,791
- WHY DON'T WE JUST GO
BACK TO THE STORE?

85
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:34,375
I'LL BUY YOU SOME MORE BUNS
AND NOBODY HAS TO KNOW PAIN.

86
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,416
- THIS IS BIGGER THAN BUNS!
- OKAY.

87
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,708
- THIS IS ABOUT HONOR!
INTEGRITY! VALOR!

88
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:40,041
AND TEACHING THOSE STUPID LITTLE

89
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,166
BLACK PIGEONS NOT
TO MESS WITH ME!

90
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,916
- SOUNDS LIKE A NOBLE GOAL, HAZ.

91
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,041
- YOU SHUT UP!

92
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:48,458
I AM A GREAT PREDATOR
AMONG PREDATORS!

93
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:50,791
I CAN OUTSMART
A COUPLE OF CROWS.

94
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:53,375
THIS BOWL OF GOODIES WILL
LURE THEM OUT INTO THE OPEN.

95
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,500
QUICK, HAIJI, YOU GO
HIDE UNDER THE HOUSE!

96
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:56,666
- RIGHT!

97
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,458
- YOU REALLY THINK
THIS IS GONNA WORK?

98
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:01,041
THEY'RE NOT JUST GONNA FLY DOWN
AND EAT RIGHT OUTTA YOUR HAND.

99
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:02,208
- OF COURSE IT'LL WORK.

100
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:04,083
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
SUPPRESS MY PRESENCE

101
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:05,500
AND THEY WON'T EVEN NOTICE ME.

102
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:07,041
- "SUPPRESS YOUR PRESENCE?"

103
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:36,583
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
SHE'S NOT MOVING AT ALL.

104
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:38,416
DOESN'T EVEN LOOK
LIKE SHE'S ALIVE.

105
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:33,291
- KOUHEI! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

106
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,875
- OH, UH, HA. NOTHING.

107
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:38,291
- WHAT'S THE POINT OF
SUPPRESSING MY PRESENCE

108
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:40,208
IF YOU'RE JUST GONNA
STAND AROUND ANNOUNCING IT?

109
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,541
- OH! RIGHT, YEAH, SORRY.

110
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:45,250
I WAS JUST... NEVER MIND.

111
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,041
- THAT'S HOW SHE LOOKED WHEN
I SAW HER FOR THE FIRST TIME

112
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:58,208
SITTING UP THERE ON
TOP OF THE CASTLE.

113
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:20,291
I WISH I COULD CAPTURE
THAT SOMEHOW.

114
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,416
YOU KNOW, THAT JUST MIGHT WORK.

115
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:33,791
- I'M HOME, GRANDPA.

116
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,541
HUH?

117
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:37,291
- Elfriede: OH, HELLO,
KOUHEI. WELCOME HOME.

118
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,583
- SO, UH, WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

119
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:44,291
- WHAT, ARE YOU BLIND,
BOY? I'M DOING SIT-UPS.

120
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:46,166
- Kouhei: IN THE ENTRYWAY?

121
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,750
- YES, WELL, HE LIKES
THE LEVEL OF THE STAIRS.

122
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:51,500
- Kouhei: WHATEVER. DO EITHER
OF YOU KNOW WHERE HAZUKI IS?

123
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:52,833
- Ryuuhei: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

124
01:09:52,916 --> 01:09:54,791
I THOUGHT THE GIRL WAS WITH YOU.

125
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:56,333
- Kouhei: SHE ISN'T HERE?

126
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:57,833
- Ryuuhei: I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.
- Elfriede: AND I CAN'T FEEL

127
01:09:57,916 --> 01:09:59,250
HER PRESENCE.

128
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:00,916
MAYBE SHE WENT OUT
FOR A WHILE.

129
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:04,166
- NO WAY!
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

130
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:07,500
- ( bone cracks )

131
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:09,958
- Elfriede: OH, DEAR.

132
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,166
- THERE'S NO WAY!

133
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,333
THERE'S NO WAY SHE
COULD HAVE BEEN

134
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:19,625
SITTING THERE THE
WHOLE TIME I WAS GONE!

135
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:20,750
THAT WAS LIKE, AN HOUR!

136
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,875
- ( crows cawing )

137
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:36,458
- I GOTCHA!

138
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:39,708
- Hazuki: HAIJI! THE ROPE!
- GOT IT!

139
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:44,083
- Both: YEAH!

140
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:48,166
BONSAI! BONSAI!

141
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,541
BONSAI! BONSAI!

142
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,375
BONSAI! BONSAI! BONSAI!

143
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:54,958
- Kouhei: Hmm.

144
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:56,500
- BLESS YOU.
- ( laughs )

145
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,083
- THAT WASN'T A SNEEZE!

146
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,541
- WELL, EXCUSE ME!
IT SOUNDED LIKE A SNEEZE!

147
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:01,875
- I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU TWO.

148
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,416
YOU CERTAINLY VANQUISHED
THE BEASTS!

149
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,583
( laughs hysterically )

150
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:06,708
REALLY. WAY TO GO!

151
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:10,333
- QUIT LAUGHING AT ME!

152
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:12,958
- Kouhei: I CAN'T WAIT TO
SEE YOUR NEXT BIG BATTLE!

153
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:15,541
- WELL, YOU JUST WON YOURSELF
A FRONT ROW SEAT, MISTER!

154
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:17,791
HAIJI! TIE THAT JERK UP!

155
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,708
- Kouhei: HEY! NO, WAIT!
I WAS JUST KIDDING!

156
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:21,333
- HAIJI! CUT IT OUT!
- Hazuki: WHO'S LAUGHING NOW,

157
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:22,708
- I WASN'T LAUGHING
- SIR LAUGHS-A-LOT?

158
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:25,208
- Kouhei: AT YOU, I SWEAR!
- OUCH! LET ME GO!

159
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:26,958
- Hazuki: I'M SO FUNNY.
TIGHTER, HAIJI!

160
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:35,583
- Ryuuhei: WELL, THAT SETTLES
IT. I'M THROUGH WITH SIT-UPS.

161
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,958
- Elfriede: HOW'S YOUR BACK?
IS IT FEELING ANY BETTER YET?

162
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:40,583
- IT'S BEEN BETTER
BUT I THINK I'LL SURVIVE.

163
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:42,833
JUST NEED TO LEARN NOT TO
PUSH MYSELF SO HARD.

164
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:46,750
- YOU KNOW, RYUUHEI,

165
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:50,125
TRUE ART ONLY BECOMES
MORE VALUABLE AS IT AGES.

166
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:52,166
THIS VASE WAS PROBABLY
WORTH VERY LITTLE

167
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,041
WHEN IT WAS MADE
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

168
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:55,916
AND NOW IT'S WORTH THOUSANDS,

169
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,458
VALUED MORE FOR THE
HISTORY IT HOLDS

170
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:59,708
THAN THE CLAY IT WAS MADE WITH.

171
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:01,875
SOMETIMES THE ONES
THAT SHOW THEIR AGE ARE

172
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:04,125
MORE VALUABLE
THAN THE ONES THAT DON'T.

173
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,833
SORRY. SILLY TO
GET ALL SENTIMENTAL

174
01:12:08,916 --> 01:12:10,541
OVER A VASE LIKE THAT.

175
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:12,416
- WELL, YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD.

176
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,916
I IMAGINE YOU'VE LIVED ENOUGH
OF YOUR LIFE WITHOUT SENTIMENT,

177
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,416
SO DON'T BOTHER HOLDING BACK
ON MY ACCOUNT.

178
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,833
AND IF BY CHANCE
YOU GET THE URGE

179
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:20,666
TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
OTHER THAN ART,

180
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,125
I KNOW ONE OLD VASE WHO'S
ALWAYS WILLING TO LISTEN.

181
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:24,250
- YOU DO, HUH?

182
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:30,000
WELL, I JUST MIGHT TAKE
YOU UP ON THAT SOMEDAY.

183
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:33,208
- LET'S JUST TELL THEM
WE'RE CLOSED.

184
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:34,625
- HELLO! CAN WE HELP YOU?

185
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:36,250
- I HOPE SO.

186
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:37,666
- Ryuuhei: HIROMI! HELLO.

187
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:42,041
- Hazuki: REMEMBER,
YOU PROMISED.

188
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,666
NO GOING BACK ON YOUR WORD.

189
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:47,041
- I KNOW. A WEEK'S WORTH OF
NEKO-MIMI BUNS FROM FURUFURU-DO.

190
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:49,041
I GOT IT. DON'T YOU WORRY
YOUR PRETTY LITTLE HEAD.

191
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:50,416
- A WEEK'S WORTH?

192
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,000
THAT'S INTERESTING.
I THOUGHT WE SAID TEN DAYS.

193
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:54,666
- ( chuckles )

194
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,000
- FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER MODEL. I QUIT.

195
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:59,708
- ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT!
TEN DAYS' WORTH. I PROMISE.

196
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:02,708
GEEZ. WHAT WERE YOU GONNA
DO, JUMP OUT THE WINDOW?

197
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:06,291
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
YOURSELF A MODEL AGAIN, CUTIE.

198
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:08,333
- ( sighs )

199
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:10,000
- Kouhei: THE THINGS
I DO FOR MY ART.

200
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,208
- WAIT! KOUHEI LEFT?
WHERE DID HE GO?

201
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:15,708
- WELL. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY.

202
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,333
HE JUST SAID HE WAS TAKING
HAZUKI FOR A LITTLE DRIVE.

203
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:19,958
- HE WENT FOR A DRIVE?

204
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:22,875
( grunts ) HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
DO THE OCCULT SHOOT!

205
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:25,333
- AND I TAKE IT THE DEADLINE
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TODAY.

206
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:28,208
- YES! CAN'T THAT DUNCE
REMEMBER ANYTHING?

207
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,875
- YEAH. THIS'LL WORK.

208
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:36,750
- SO, HOW DO YOU WANT
ME TO POSE, ANYWAY?

209
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,416
LIKE THIS? HUH? WANT
ME TO BLOW YOU A KISS?

210
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,875
- NO.

211
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,041
- WANT ME TO WEAR THESE?

212
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:45,125
- DEFINITELY NOT.

213
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:47,416
- YOU'RE STIFLING MY
CREATIVE GENIUS, HERE.

214
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,666
- JUST BE YOURSELF.

215
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:51,166
I WANNA CAPTURE YOU THE
WAY YOU REALLY ARE, HAZ.

216
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:55,291
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
ALL EMBARRASSED ABOUT?

217
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:57,083
- OH, IT'S JUST...

218
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,791
AH! IT'S JUST SO
HOT HERE. THAT'S ALL.

219
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:03,333
- HOT, HUH?
IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER.

220
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:06,750
- ( sneezes )

221
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,875
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE TAKING
PICTURES OR SOMETHING?

222
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:11,625
WHAT KIND OF PROFESSIONAL
PHOTOGRAPHER ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

223
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:13,291
- WELL, WE'VE STILL
GOT A FEW HOURS.

224
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,750
- HUH? TILL WHEN?

225
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:16,666
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

226
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:18,250
BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL SUNSET.

227
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,500
- Hazuki: SUNSET?

228
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:20,625
- NICE AND SHINY.

229
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,166
- YEAH.

230
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:26,708
BUT SINCE WE HAVE
A LITTLE WHILE,

231
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:28,791
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANNA DO SOME FISHING.

232
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:30,166
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

233
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:34,916
HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS BEFORE?

234
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
- OF COURSE I HAVE.
I'M LIKE, THE BEST FISHER EVER.

235
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:40,791
- IS THAT SO? WELL, DIVE IN.

236
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:44,000
- THANK YOU. JUST WATCH.
I'LL CATCH WAY MORE THAN YOU.

237
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,833
- Haiji: WORMS. BLECH!

238
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:48,625
- YOU OKAY?

239
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:52,666
- NO, THANKS!
I DON'T NEED THESE.

240
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,041
- DON'T NEED 'EM?

241
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:55,791
YOU CAN'T FISH WITHOUT BAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

242
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:58,500
- IT'S ALL ABOUT SPIRIT
AND DETERMINATION.

243
01:14:58,583 --> 01:14:59,750
- SO THAT'S A YES, THEN?

244
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:01,083
- WATCH OUT FISHIES!

245
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:03,791
- THAT'S RIGHT!
'CAUSE HERE COMES THE MASTER.

246
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:06,250
- HOW ABOUT I BAIT YOUR
LINE FOR YOU, HAZUKI?

247
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:07,541
WOULD THAT CHANGE YOUR MIND

248
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:10,208
ABOUT THESE FAITH-BASED
FISHING METHODS? HUH?

249
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:12,333
- WELL, IF YOU REALLY
WANNA PUT BAIT ON MY LINE,

250
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:15,416
I GUESS I CAN'T
STOP YOU. HERE.

251
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:19,208
- GEE, THAT'S REAL
SWELL OF YOU, HAZ.

252
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:20,458
I'M GUESSING A
LITTLE THANK YOU

253
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:22,250
WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR
ME TO ASK FOR, RIGHT?

254
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:24,291
- COME ON, HURRY
IT UP, BAIT BOY.

255
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:25,416
- YEAH, YEAH.

256
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,041
- UH-OH, KOUHEI,
MY WORM ESCAPED.

257
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:54,666
GUESS I NEED ANOTHER ONE.

258
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:56,958
- GUESS SO.

259
01:15:58,291 --> 01:16:01,250
- KOUHEI! IT GOT AWAY AGAIN!

260
01:16:04,208 --> 01:16:06,833
- WELL, GUESS IT'S ABOUT
TIME TO TAKE THOSE PICTURES.

261
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:09,708
- WE CAN'T GO. NOT UNTIL
I CATCH AT LEAST ONE FISH.

262
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:15,750
( gasps )

263
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,000
KOUHEI! A BITE!

264
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:20,666
- WHAT? WELL, REEL IN! PULL!

265
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,333
- ( screams )

266
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,750
I CAUGHT A FISH!

267
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,500
- ( chuckles ) THAT'S GREAT!
NOW, GRAB IT!

268
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:45,416
- EW. NO WAY! I CAN'T!

269
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,875
- SURE YOU CAN!
IT'S GONNA GET AWAY.

270
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:48,375
- NO, NO, NO.

271
01:16:48,458 --> 01:16:49,875
- Kouhei: COME ON, FISH MASTER!
- Hazuki: I DON'T WANT TO.

272
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:53,416
PLEASE,KOUHEI, YOU TAKE IT.
TAKE IT! TAKE IT! TAKE IT!

273
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,083
- Haiji: HE TOOK IT!

274
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:57,666
- Hazuki: THAT'S NOT WHAT
I MEANT! TAKE THE STUPID FISH!

275
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:04,583
- ( camera clicks )

276
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:19,000
- WELL, I'D SAY OUR
PHOTO SHOOT WAS A SUCCESS.

277
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:20,625
WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD STU...

278
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:33,791
SO DEFENSELESS.

279
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:01,291
- ( Kouhei yells )

280
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:06,125
HEY, WHAT THE HECK
WAS THAT FOR, ROMI?

281
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:07,541
- WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

282
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,916
THAT WAS FOR MISSING THE
OCCULT PHOTO SHOOT, YOU ASS!

283
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:13,166
- AH.

284
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:14,250
- "AH"?

285
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:17,583
THAT'S ALL YOU
HAVE TO SAY IS "AH"?

286
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:19,583
I HAD TO DO THE
STUPID THING BY MYSELF!

287
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:20,708
I'M EXHAUSTED.

288
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,375
WOW.

289
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,708
- YEAH, THAT ONE'S NOT
TOO TERRIBLE, IS IT?

290
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:37,833
- THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

291
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:39,208
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

292
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:42,250
IT'S LIKE HAZUKI'S
GLOWING OR SOMETHING.

293
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:45,458
- I KNOW. I KEEP TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

294
01:18:45,541 --> 01:18:46,833
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE SHE JUST...

295
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:48,791
JUST DRAWS YOU IN.

296
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,625
HEY, WAIT, WHERE'RE YOU
GOING WITH THAT PICTURE?

297
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:51,750
I NEED THAT BACK!

298
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:54,541
- I'M JUST BORROWING IT.

299
01:18:54,625 --> 01:18:56,833
- WELL, DON'T LOSE IT.
- DON'T BE STUPID.

300
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:03,166
- IT'S TIME FOR YOUR INJECTION.
- ( camera clicks )

301
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:05,125
- OH, LOOK AT HER!
SHE'S JUST SO CUTE!

302
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,458
- OKAY, NEXT COSTUME!

303
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:07,583
HI!

304
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:09,166
HEY!

305
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:10,916
KONICHIWA!

306
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:13,208
ALLO!

307
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:15,291
BONJOUR!

308
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:16,416
ROWR.

309
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,875
- OH, I CAN HARDLY STAND IT!

310
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:19,875
YOU MUST BE THE CUTEST
LITTLE THING THAT EVER LIVED!

311
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,791
- ( giggles )

312
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:24,958
MORE! TAKE MORE PICTURES OF
HER, WE'LL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH.

313
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:29,583
- ALRIGHT. BUT WHERE DID
THIS SUDDEN INTEREST

314
01:19:29,666 --> 01:19:31,291
IN HAVING YOUR PICTURE
TAKEN COME FROM?

315
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:34,000
- I GUESS I JUST REALIZED
HOW SPECIAL IT MADE ME FEEL.

316
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:37,375
( metallic thudding )

317
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:40,166
- SO I'M NOT
IMAGINING IT, CHIEF?

318
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:44,250
WHAT IS IT ABOUT IT?

319
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:46,166
- Chief Editor: I DON'T KNOW
IT'S CERTAINLY COMPELLING.

320
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:48,083
FOR ONE THING, IT'S TOO
GOOD TO BE A COMPOSITE,

321
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:49,916
NOT THAT MORIOKA WOULD DO THAT.

322
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,333
BUT IT MEANS IT
HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED UP,

323
01:19:51,416 --> 01:19:53,333
WHICH WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE.

324
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:55,208
- IT WAS CLEARLY TAKEN AT NIGHT,

325
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,541
BUT IT'S A GREATER
DEPTH OF FIELD

326
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,125
WHICH MEANS A HIGHER F-STOP.

327
01:19:58,208 --> 01:19:59,750
SO THE SHUTTER WAS
OPEN LONG ENOUGH TO LET

328
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:02,083
QUITE A BIT OF LIGHT
THROUGH THE SMALL APERTURE.

329
01:20:02,166 --> 01:20:04,791
I MEAN, THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
HE COULD'VE GOTTEN THIS EFFECT.

330
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:07,708
- OKAY. TOO MUCH SHOP TALK.

331
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:10,291
- IN OTHER WORDS, THAT GIRL
HAD TO STAND IN THAT POSITION,

332
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:11,666
COMPLETELY STILL, LONG ENOUGH

333
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,708
FOR THE STARS TO
SHIFT BEHIND HER.

334
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:17,250
- Hiromi: BUT...
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

335
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,291
- Hazuki: ELFRIEDE,
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

336
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:24,416
- OF COURSE.

337
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,791
- HOW COME YOU...

338
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:28,125
GIVE IN TO MY WHIMS ALL
THE TIME THE WAY YOU DO?

339
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:32,666
- WELL, I GUESS IT'S
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND IT.

340
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,250
THE NEED TO
TEST YOUR FREEDOM.

341
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:36,333
- TEST MY FREEDOM?

342
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:37,708
- TO EXPERIENCE ALL YOU CAN,

343
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,375
NOW THAT YOU'RE FINALLY
RELEASED FROM YOUR PRISON,

344
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:41,541
IT'S THE SAME FOR ME.

345
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:50,041
- THE SAME FOR YOU.
BUT NOT FOR THEM.

346
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:52,083
WHEN KOUHEI WAS
TAKING MY PICTURE TODAY,

347
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:54,666
MY REASONS FOR LETTING
HIM WERE SIMPLE.

348
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,916
I WANTED HIM TO. IT WAS FUN.
I LIKE SPENDING TIME WITH HIM.

349
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,583
IT ISN'T THE SAME FOR HIM.

350
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:04,000
IT ISN'T THE SAME
FOR ANY OF THEM, ACTUALLY.

351
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:06,500
THEY'RE KIND ENOUGH TO LET
ME STAY HERE WITH THEM.

352
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:08,750
BUT WHEN THEY LOOK AT
ME THEY SEE AN ORPHAN,

353
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:11,541
SOMEBODY TO BE PITIED, AND
TREATED LIKE SHE BELONGS.

354
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:13,875
I HATE SEEING THEM
LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

355
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:16,125
- ( laughing )

356
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:18,916
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK
YOU SEE WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOU?

357
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:23,333
- YOU'RE LAUGHING AT ME?
THAT'S JUST CRUEL.

358
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:29,041
- I'M SORRY. I DO LOVE
YOU, HAZUKI, VERY MUCH.

359
01:21:31,916 --> 01:21:32,958
OKAY?

360
01:21:34,791 --> 01:21:37,666
- HEY! WHOA! I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WERE INTO GIRLS!

361
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:39,541
LISTEN, MAYBE WE
SHOULDN'T BATHE TOGETHER.

362
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:40,833
- ( laughs )

363
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:43,333
- Hazuki: GET OUT OF
MY BATH, YOU PERVERT!

364
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:45,208
- Elfriede: HAZUKI, PLEASE!
- Hazuki: NO WAY.

365
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:46,958
I DON'T CARE HOW
MUCH YOU BEG ME!

366
01:21:57,666 --> 01:21:59,041
- Kouhei: WHAT CAN
I DO TO HELP HER?

367
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:32,750
- ( theme song playing )

368
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:34,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

369
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:02,708
- Hazuki: OH, BIG BROTHER!

370
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:05,291
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEG ME
TO DO RIDDLES WITH YOU!

371
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:08,541
I'VE BEEN SAVING ONE
UP JUST FOR YOU! READY?

372
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:11,250
IF YESTERDAY HAD BEEN
WEDNESDAY'S TOMORROW,

373
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:13,500
AND TOMORROW IS
SUNDAY'S YESTERDAY,

374
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:15,541
WHAT DAY WOULD TODAY BE?

375
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:18,666
FULL, FULL, FULL... MOON!

376
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:21,833
NEXT TIME ON MOON
PHASE, EPISODE 17,

377
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:24,166
"BIG BROTHER, WHY IS
THIS HAPPENING?"

378
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,708
READY FOR THE ANSWER?

379
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:29,875
IT'S FRIDAY! I THINK.
WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?
