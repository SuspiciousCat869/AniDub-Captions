1
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:11,625
- SO, IT WAS DECIDED WE WOULD
ALL TAKE A TRIP TO KYOTO.

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,416
HIROMI AND I NEEDED
TO COVER A STORY.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,083
GRANDPA AND SEIJI HAD BUSINESS
WITH THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY.

4
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,666
AND HAZUKI, WELL,
SHE WAS ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:25,041
- OH! IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!
ISN'T IT?

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,666
- THAT'S PERFECT.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,916
THE BRAT ALREADY THINKS I'M HER
SLAVE, NOW I'M THEIRS TOO.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,458
HERE'S YOUR BENTO, GUYS.
AND THESE ARE FOR THE GIRLS.

9
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,375
AW, COME ON! WOULD YOU TAKE
OFF THOSE STUPID NEKO MIMI?

10
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,791
WE'RE IN PUBLIC NOW!

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,041
YOU HAVING FUN, HAZUKI?

12
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,333
- ( laughs )

13
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,208
- YOUR FIRST TRIP
ON A TRAIN, HUH?

14
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,416
I'M GLAD I DIDN'T INSIST THAT
SHE STAY HOME, AFTER ALL.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,833
- Hazumi: OOH!
THAT LOOKS YUMMY!

16
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,250
- AND THIS ONE'S THE SOY SAUCE,

17
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,958
SO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
MIX 'EM UP, OKAY?

18
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,125
- BENTO IS THE COOLEST EVER!

19
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,166
( speaking Japanese )

20
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,625
- HOW MUCH LONGER CAN YOU LAST?

21
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,708
- KOUHEI MORIOKA,
THE TIME HAS COME.

22
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,458
- ( theme song playing )

23
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

24
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,708
- SO, THIS IS THE MIDO
FAMILY HOME, HUH?

25
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,125
SOMEHOW I EXPECTED MORE.

26
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,250
- YOU CAN'T TELL FROM OUT HERE,
BUT IT'S REALLY QUITE LARGE.

27
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,375
- WE'RE GOING IN THERE?
FOR REAL?

28
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,458
- UH, GRAMPS?
I THINK I'M GONNA STAY OUT HERE.

29
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,208
- OH, REALLY?
BUT THEY SERVE SUCH GOOD TEA.

30
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,166
- YOU SURE YOU WANNA
MISS ALL THE FUN, KOUHEI?

31
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,250
- YEAH. HAZUKI SEEMS
PRETTY NERVOUS.

32
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,125
- VERY WELL. DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

33
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,791
HAIJI WILL NEED TO COME WITH ME
FOR A LITTLE WHILE, ALL RIGHT?

34
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,666
- SURE, I GUESS SO.
BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY.

35
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,791
- BROTHER SEIJI!
IT'S YOU, ISN'T IT?

36
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,458
- WELL, WELL, WELL.
HIKARU AND KAORU!

37
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,083
- I KNEW IT!
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN, SEIJI?

38
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,625
YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOREVER.
HAVE YOU MISSED ME?

39
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,458
- HELLO, HIKARU.
OF COURSE I HAVE.

40
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,541
- IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
BIG BROTHER.

41
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,500
- YEAH, YOU TOO. YOU'RE
LOOKING REALLY GOOD, KAORU.

42
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,625
- OH, THANK YOU.

43
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,375
- WHO IS THIS MOUSE?

44
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,708
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

45
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,541
YOU HAVEN'T MET THESE
TWO YET, HAVE YOU, HAZUKI?

46
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,375
- MY NAME IS HIKARU MIDO.

47
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,083
I'M SEIJI'S SECOND COUSIN AND
THE WOMAN HE'S GONNA MARRY.

48
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,458
AND THIS IS MY LOVELY
TWIN SISTER, KAORU.

49
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,208
SHE'S ENGAGED TO KOUHEI.

50
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,083
- ( exclaims )

51
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,333
- WHAT DOES SHE MEAN "ENGAGED"?
YOU'RE ENGAGED?

52
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,541
- IS THAT TRUE, SENSEI?

53
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,208
- WELL, IT'S SORT OF
A CHILDHOOD THING...

54
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,666
- OUR FAMILIES PROMISED
US TO EACH OTHER

55
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,000
WHEN WE WERE
STILL LITTLE KIDS.

56
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,541
- IT'S A PROMISE THAT BINDS US
TOGETHER FOREVER.

57
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,125
- THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION!

58
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,875
KOUHEI IS MY SLAVE AND HE'S NOT
MARRYING ANYBODY, UNDERSTOOD?

59
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,958
- ( grunts )

60
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,916
I MEAN, HE'S VERY
IMPORTANT TO ME!

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,375
- BUT...

62
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,791
- WELL, HE'S IMPORTANT
TO US, TOO. AND WE HAVE DIBS.

63
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,125
- GUESS WE SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT
THE HOUSE TODAY, HUH, HAZUKI?

64
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,083
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

65
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,625
- NOW YOU'VE DONE IT, MORON.

66
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,791
- ( crying )

67
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,833
- AW, COME ON NOW,
KAORU. DON'T CRY.

68
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,041
WHAT'D I SAY? I JUST TOLD HER WE
SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT THE HOUSE.

69
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,000
- THAT'S RIGHT! HE JUST
SAID WE SHOULDN'T HAVE

70
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,250
LEFT THE HOUSE WHERE
WE LIVE TOGETHER.

71
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,750
- ( both gasp )

72
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,791
- YOU WANNA FIGHT?
BRING IT.

73
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,208
- THIS PLACE IS TOO PUBLIC FOR
A SORCERER'S BATTLE.

74
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,041
TAKE THE GIRL
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

75
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,375
- COME ON BRAT,

76
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,250
MAYBE WE CAN FIND SOME
ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES!

77
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,541
- HEY, KOUHEI, WAIT FOR ME!

78
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,875
- LET THEM GO.

79
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,958
- BUT KOUHEI'S IN DANGER! THAT
GIRL HE'S WITH IS A MONSTER.

80
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,791
- HE'S OKAY.

81
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,666
- ACTUALLY, WE NEED
YOU HERE, GIRLS.

82
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,166
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME TO TAKE
KOJIRO A MESSAGE FOR US.

83
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,708
- Hiromi: THE MIDO FAMILY HAS
ALWAYS BEEN FAMOUS

84
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,750
FOR THEIR PSYCHIC POWERS.

85
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,625
BEFORE RYUUHEI OPENED HIS
ANTIQUE SHOP,

86
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,458
HE WORKED AS A SPIRITUALIST.

87
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,041
AND SEIJI SENSEI STILL DOES.

88
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,333
KOUHEI GREW UP SURROUNDED
BY SPELLS AND CHARMS

89
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,083
HIS WHOLE LIFE SO HE
HARDLY NOTICES THEM.

90
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,416
AND I'VE HEARD SO MANY STORIES
EDITING THE MAGAZINE THAT

91
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,041
I SUPPOSE I TAKE THE PARANORMAL
FOR GRANTED SOMETIMES.

92
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,458
BUT SEEING THEIR
FAMILY IN ACTION

93
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,500
IS A WHOLE OTHER
STORY, ISN'T IT?

94
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,208
- SO THOSE TWO GIRLS ARE...

95
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,750
- AS PSYCHIC AS
THE REST OF THEM.

96
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:32,041
- NO WONDER I DIDN'T LIKE THEM.
ENGAGED? HMM.

97
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,875
- IT'S RIDICULOUS.

98
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,958
MY STUPID FAMILY AND ITS
STANDARDS. IT'S NOT RIGHT.

99
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,041
I MEAN IT'S NORMAL NOT
TO HAVE PSYCHIC POWERS

100
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,625
BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A FAMILY FULL
OF PEOPLE WHO DO, IT'S LIKE...

101
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,958
- LIKE BEING THE DUMB ONE
IN A FAMILY OF GENIUSES.

102
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,625
- IT'S NOTHING AT ALL LIKE THAT!

103
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,416
- YOU POOR LITTLE
MISUNDERSTOOD IDIOT.

104
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,791
- YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHAT I MEANT!

105
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,250
- THIS GIRL'S GOT
A POINT, KOUHEI.

106
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,583
YOU'RE A LUCKY JERK, AND IF
YOU DON'T STOP COMPLAINING

107
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,250
I'M GONNA START
THROWING THINGS AT YOU.

108
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,625
- I'M A LUCKY JERK?
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

109
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,666
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
PSYCHIC TO KNOW THAT ONE.

110
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,791
- SO KOUHEI TOOK HER
UNDER HIS WING.

111
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,291
AND THE CHILD'S BEEN LIVING
WITH US IN TOKYO EVER SINCE.

112
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,833
- A VAMPIRE.
THAT'S AN INTERESTING TALE.

113
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,833
- YOU MEAN AN
INTERESTING COINCIDENCE.

114
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,500
CONSIDERING WHAT MY
DAUGHTER SAID 14 YEARS AGO

115
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,291
ON THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED.

116
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,166
- Chizuru: DAD, I KNOW IT
SOUNDS CRAZY,

117
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,000
BUT VAMPIRES EXIST,
I KNOW THEY DO.

118
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,875
- AND NOW THE PROOF OF HER
REMARKABLE CLAIM IS REVEALED.

119
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,041
- THE VAMPIRE CHILD IS NOT OUR
ONLY NEW HOUSE GUEST, KOJIRO.

120
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,708
THIS CAT'S NAME IS ACUDA.

121
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,375
IT WAS CHIZURU'S
SHIKIGAMI MESSENGER.

122
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,833
- IT WAS? HOW DO YOU KNOW?

123
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,416
- I DON'T KNOW YET HOW
THE CHILD'S MOTHER

124
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,041
COULD'VE GAINED POSSESSION
OF MY DAUGHTER'S SHIKIGAMI.

125
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,916
BUT I'M POSITIVE THIS IS ACUDA.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,083
- IT SEEMS WEAK.

127
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,083
- YES. IT NEEDS ENERGY
FROM ITS MASTER

128
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,708
OR IT'LL DIE IN
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

129
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,666
- I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
THIS CREATURE, KOJIRO.

130
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,375
IT'S MY ONLY LINK
TO MY DAUGHTER.

131
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,166
I CAME HERE FOR
THE FAMILY'S HELP.

132
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,541
PLEASE. WE CANNOT DO THIS ALONE.

133
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,291
- THE OCTAGONAL HALL
IS YOURS TO USE

134
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,000
FOR AS LONG AS YOU REQUIRE IT.

135
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,500
- THANK YOU.

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,416
- ( camera clicking )

137
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,583
- THERE HE IS.

138
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,208
"THE MYSTERIOUS
NOBLEMAN WHO HAUNTS

139
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,916
ONE OF KYOTO'S MOST
POPULAR RAMEN SHOPS."

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,916
NEXT MONTH'S FEATURE
HEADLINE JUST WROTE ITSELF.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,250
- YOU DID IT, KOUHEI.
YOU SAVED THE HEADLINE.

142
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,583
YOU KNOW, TALENT IS VERY SEXY.

143
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,291
- I'M SO GLAD YOU THINK SO.

144
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,541
- ( crying ) I'M USING A
YOKOHAMA RAMEN RECIPE IN KYOTO.

145
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,416
THAT'S WHY THE NOBLEMAN
IS HAUNTING MY RESTAURANT!

146
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,791
- I STILL HAVE TO
INTERVIEW THIS GUY,

147
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,166
SO YOU TWO CAN HEAD
OUT NOW IF YOU WANT.

148
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,083
HERE YOU GO, HAZUKI,
YOUR FIRST COMMISSION.

149
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,250
THAT'S FOR ALL THE HELP
YOU GAVE US.

150
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,208
NOW WHY DON'T YOU LET KOUHEI
TAKE YOU SOUVENIR SHOPPING?

151
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,250
- WHAT? AND WHY SHOULD I?

152
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,166
- HEY, I WANTED TO TAKE A
WALKING TOUR OF KYOTO,

153
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,000
AND YOU'RE THE REASON WE GOT
HERE TOO LATE, COOKIE,

154
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,750
SO JUST SUCK IT UP AND
TAKE HER SHOPPING, OKAY?

155
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,833
- IT'S HAZUKI'S FAULT. SHE'S
THE ONE WHO HAS TO TRAVEL AT...

156
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,000
- TAKE ME SHOPPING!

157
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,333
- I'M SUCH A SUCKER.

158
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,416
- ( gasps )

159
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,541
- MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET
TOO FAR FROM ME, OKAY?

160
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,875
- OKAY, DAD!

161
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,708
- HELLO, LITTLE LADY. WOULD YOU
LIKE TO TRY SOME YATSUHASHI?

162
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,250
CAN'T LEAVE KYOTO WITHOUT
TRYING OUR MOST FAMOUS DESSERT.

163
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,916
- IT'S ALL DRY AND FLAKYISH.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,250
- THAT JUST MEANS IT'S
REALLY GOOD YATSUHASHI.

165
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,833
- OH! THEN I'LL TAKE
A WHOLE BOX.

166
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,083
- YOU HAVE EXCELLENT TASTE.

167
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,000
- BE CAREFUL. YOU DON'T
WANNA SPEND IT ALL HERE.

168
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,375
- DON'T WORRY.

169
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,958
GRANDFATHER GAVE ME A BUNCH
OF SPENDING MONEY, TOO.

170
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,833
- GREAT, THEY'RE TRYING
TO SPOIL YOU ROTTEN.

171
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,875
- I JUST LOVE THE SMELL
OF CINNAMON. DON'T YOU?

172
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,041
- ELFRIEDE!

173
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,291
- HEY! YOU FOLLOWED ME
ALL THE WAY TO KYOTO!

174
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,833
- IT'S NOT YOU I WAS FOLLOWING.

175
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,041
- THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

176
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,458
- FOR KOUHEI. I DID SAY
I'D MODEL FOR HIM, AFTER ALL.

177
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,250
AND WHAT BETTER PLACE THAN HERE?

178
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,291
WITH SUCH A
BREATHTAKING BACKDROP,

179
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,708
I JUST MIGHT REVEAL
MORE THAN I INTEND.

180
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,458
- BACK OFF, HAG!
GET YOUR OWN SLAVE!

181
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,000
- I SUPPOSE SINCE I AM HERE,

182
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,000
I SHOULD ASK YOU TO
RETURN TO THE CASTLE.

183
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,625
- JUST LEAVE US ALONE!
YOU SLAVE STEALER!

184
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,250
( grunting )

185
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,583
- OH DEAR, I SEEM TO HAVE
UPSET THE LITTLE DARLING.

186
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,000
I GUESS I BETTER GO BEFORE SHE
PUTS SOMEONE OUT OF BUSINESS.

187
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,958
CLEANUP ON AISLE 5!

188
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,833
- ( panting )

189
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,125
HE'S MINE!

190
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,791
- ALL RIGHT.
WHO'S PAYING FOR ALL THIS?

191
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,875
- UH, I AM SO SORRY, SIR!

192
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,250
I, UM... I'LL COVER IT.
DON'T WORRY.

193
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,500
- YOU BET YOU WILL, PAL.
I HOPE YOU HAVE CREDIT.

194
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,416
- Ryuuhei: WE'LL BORROW POWER
FROM THE MIDO FAMILY SHRINE

195
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,416
AND TRANSFER ACUDA'S
SPIRIT BOND TO A NEW MASTER.

196
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,125
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH
TO SAVE HIM.

197
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,208
- Seiji: THE ONLY PROBLEM IS
WHO SHOULD INHERIT IT?

198
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,875
YOU, AS CHIZURU'S FATHER,
OR KOUHEI, AS HER SON?

199
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,041
I SEE.
AND WHOSE HAIRS ARE THOSE?

200
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,666
- THEY BELONG TO THE GIRL.

201
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,416
- YOU'RE CERTAIN ABOUT THIS?

202
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,166
- KOUHEI AND I HAVE
A STRONG FAMILY,

203
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,833
PEOPLE WE CAN CONFIDE IN,

204
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,083
BUT THAT GIRL'S ALL ALONE.

205
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,708
SHE NEEDS A GOOD FRIEND.

206
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,250
- THEN LET'S BEGIN.
WE'VE A LONG NIGHT AHEAD.

207
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,750
- WHAT'S WRONG, HAZUKI?

208
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,291
- "3 A.M. AT AWAGI TEMPLE."

209
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,291
(gasps ) HAZUKI!
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

210
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,791
- I SHOULD BE ASKING YOU
THE SAME THING.

211
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,166
HOW COULD YOU MEET THAT NO-GOOD

212
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,208
SLAVE STEALING HUSSY
BEHIND MY BACK?

213
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,500
- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
- I SAW THE NOTE!

214
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,333
- LOOK, THERE'S A GOOD REASON
FOR THIS, I PROMISE,

215
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,208
IT'S JUST THAT...

216
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,833
HEY! A GIANT BOX OF YATSUHASHI!

217
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,208
- REALLY? WHERE?

218
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:53,250
HEY! KOUHEI! THAT'S CHEATING!
GET BACK HERE! KOUHEI!

219
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,041
- I KNOW SEIJI SAID
TO LEAVE HER ALONE,

220
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,625
BUT WE CAN'T STAND
BY AND DO NOTHING

221
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,250
WHILE YOUR FIANCEE IS IN DANGER
AND DOESN'T EVEN REALIZE IT.

222
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,166
I WON'T LET THAT
DEMONIC GIRL HURT HIM.

223
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,083
LET'S GO, KAORU!

224
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,541
- ( whimpers )

225
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,291
- ( sighs ) OH, KAORU.
YOU'RE HOPELESS.

226
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,000
- MAY I ASK YOU
SOMETHING, UNCLE?

227
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,583
- OF COURSE.

228
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,666
- WHEN YOU TOLD KOUHEI ABOUT HIS
MOTHER, YOU SAID SHE WAS DEAD.

229
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,708
- YES.

230
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,291
HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR GRANDSON
THAT HIS MOTHER ABANDONED HIM

231
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,708
14 YEARS AGO, AND
DISAPPEARED FOREVER?

232
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,375
- Kouhei: I GUESS
SHE ALREADY LEFT.

233
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,416
( gasps )

234
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,208
YOU'RE HERE.

235
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,750
- I COULDN'T MAKE
YOU COME OUT HERE

236
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,041
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT FOR
PICTURES, AND THEN NOT SHOW.

237
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,833
- HAVING YOU AS A MODEL
IS A NICE DREAM,

238
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,041
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY I CAME HERE.

239
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,625
AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHY
YOU'RE HERE EITHER.

240
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,750
I CAME BECAUSE I WANNA
KNOW SOMETHING.

241
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,708
YOU KEEP ASKING HAZUKI TO GO
BACK TO THE CASTLE,

242
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,291
BUT YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING TO FORCE HER HAND.

243
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,791
YOU CALL HER "MISTRESS" LIKE
YOU'RE HER SERVANT OR SOMETHING,

244
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,166
BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
NOT DOING WHAT SHE WANTS.

245
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,083
I DON'T THINK YOU
MEAN HER ANY HARM,

246
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,125
BUT WHAT IS IT
YOU'RE AFTER, EXACTLY?

247
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,208
- ( sighs ) I SUPPOSE I'M
A LITTLE ENVIOUS.

248
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,625
- KOUHEI, COME ON.

249
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,666
I WANNA GO HOME.
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

250
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,250
- Elfriede: THE WAY SHE LIVES,
SO CAREFREE.

251
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,541
YES, THAT'S IT. SO FREE.

252
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,416
- FREE?

253
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,333
- AND YOU'RE THE REASON
FOR THAT FEELING IN HER.

254
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,958
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

255
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,875
YOU'RE THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

256
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,916
IF ONLY I HAD SOMEONE
LIKE YOU IN MY LIFE, AS WELL.

257
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,458
- UM, ELFRIEDE, I CAN'T...

258
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,375
- SET ME FREE, KOUHEI.

259
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,375
- NO!

260
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,833
( screams )

261
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,333
- SET ME FREE FROM THAT MAN.

262
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,041
- THIS FEELING.
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO KOUHEI?

263
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,000
KOUHEI! KOUHEI, WHERE ARE YOU?

264
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,041
KOUHEI!

265
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,458
NO!

266
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,750
SO THAT'S WHY SHE WANTED YOU
TO MEET HER HERE WITHOUT ME.

267
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,083
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GO HOME
WHEN I TOLD YOU TO,

268
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,708
LIKE ANY OTHER SLAVE?

269
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,833
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GET IT
THROUGH YOUR HEAD, BRAT?

270
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,250
I'M NOT YOUR...

271
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,333
- KOUHEI? KOUHEI?

272
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,000
- GET AWAY FROM HIM! NOW!

273
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,375
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

274
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,166
- LET HIM GO. I WON'T LET
YOU GET AWAY WITH THIS!

275
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,875
FOUL TEMPTRESS.
YOU WON'T SEDUCE KOUHEI.

276
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,166
( grunting )

277
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,750
- NO, WAIT. IT WASN'T ME.

278
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,875
- RIGHT. LIAR!

279
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,291
- WAIT!

280
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,291
- I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TALK
YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS ONE,

281
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,958
MY DARLING MISTRESS.

282
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,416
- EVIL DEMON! LET'S SEE HOW
YOU BITE WITHOUT THOSE TEETH!

283
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,833
- I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T ME,
IT WAS ANOTHER VAMPIRE,

284
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,625
I SWEAR, I WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

285
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,708
- OH, YEAH,
LIKE I'D BELIEVE YOU!

286
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,500
- GOODNESS, THAT GIRL
IS AWFULLY TALENTED.

287
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,666
THE MISTRESS IS
IN OVER HER HEAD.

288
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,083
- GET BACK HERE AND REPENT,
DEMON GIRL!

289
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,125
- YOU'RE CRAZY!

290
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,375
- OW, STOP!

291
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,208
MY HAND...
BUT HOW DID SHE DO THAT?

292
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,666
- MY BARRIER!

293
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,875
MY POWER WON'T LAST
UNLESS I HAVE MORE BLOOD.

294
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,625
THAT'S IT!

295
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,750
I HOPE YOU SAVED
SOME FOR ME, KOUHEI!

296
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,916
( gasps )

297
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,583
- AND LOOK, THE OTHER
ONE'S A CONJURER.

298
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,875
MY, WHAT AN INTERESTING FAMILY.

299
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,916
- WHAT IS THAT?

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,541
- NOTHING FOR IT, I GUESS. I'LL
HAVE TO PROTECT HER THIS TIME.

301
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,208
- WHAT'S THAT?

302
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,833
KAORU! NO! WHO'S DOING THIS?

303
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,791
- ELFRIEDE.

304
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,375
- IT'S BEGINNING.

305
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,833
WHAT HAPPENED?

306
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,958
- IT MUST'VE SENSED SOMETHING
OUT THERE. WE HAVE TO FOLLOW IT!

307
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,208
- IT'S DAYBREAK!

308
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,666
- IF IT'S LOOKING FOR
ITS NEW MASTER,

309
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,791
THE GIRL MIGHT BE
IN TROUBLE. FASTER!

310
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,625
- ( groaning )

311
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,625
HAZUKI, THE SUN, IT'S...

312
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,583
( gasps ) WHAT IS THAT?

313
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,708
- NO, IT'S...

314
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,583
IF THE SUN'S RAYS TOUCH US
WE'LL BOTH BE KILLED.

315
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,333
WE HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE, NOW!

316
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,375
RUN!

317
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,083
- REACH OUT YOUR HAND, MASTER.

318
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,291
NOW!

319
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:00,791
- OKAY.

320
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,166
- HEY, YOU GUYS, COME ON.

321
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,708
I FOUND HER. SHE'S OVER
HERE. HURRY IT UP!

322
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,458
- ( grunting )

323
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,375
- ( all screaming )

324
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,166
- SHE'S SAFE.

325
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,625
- WE MADE IT JUST IN TIME.

326
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,791
- TOO CLOSE FOR MY TASTE.

327
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:32,041
- WHY? THEY'RE NOT YOUR SLAVES,
WHY DO THEY PROTECT YOU?

328
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,083
- I DON'T LIKE IT IN HERE!
THESE COATS ARE STINKY!

329
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,333
- WELL DONE, BOYS!

330
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,666
- AND STOP SITTING ON ME!
- HIP-HIP HOORAY!

331
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,750
- SO I WANT YOU TO LEAVE HER
ALONE FROM NOW ON.

332
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,833
NO MORE FIGHTING. UNDERSTOOD?

333
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,958
- NO MORE FIGHTING,
GRANDPA. I PROMISE.

334
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,458
- THAT'S VERY ADULT
OF YOU. THANKS.

335
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,750
- OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.
IT'S NOTHING.

336
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,458
- AND NO MORE CRYING
EITHER, OKAY?

337
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:04,500
LIKE I TOLD YOU, THERE'S
NOTHING BETWEEN ME AND HAZUKI.

338
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,791
NOW YOU PROMISE YOU'LL COME
SEE US WHEN YOU'RE IN TOKYO.

339
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,000
THERE. THAT'S BETTER.

340
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,166
- Elfriede: YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

341
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,458
LIVING AS YOU CHOOSE.

342
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,958
FREELY.

343
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,250
SELFISHLY.

344
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,541
YET LOVED BY THOSE AROUND YOU.

345
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,166
I ENVY YOU FOR THAT, MISTRESS.

346
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,791
WITH ALL THAT I AM.

347
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:35,916
- ( sighs ) I'M SO EXHAUSTED.

348
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,708
- YOU WANT SOME MORE NOW, HAIJI?

349
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,791
SHE'S SO CUTE.
I'M GONNA KEEP HER FOREVER.

350
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,458
- YOU SEEM HAPPY TOGETHER.
I'M GLAD.

351
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,916
- YES. JUST A PITY THE
TRANSFER OF MASTERS

352
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,666
ERASED THE SPIRIT'S
MEMORY OF THE PAST.

353
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,708
- COULDN'T BE HELPED.

354
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,833
- Haiji: EXCEPT HIM!

355
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,250
I REMEMBER YOU FROM BEFORE.
YOU'RE NICE.

356
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,750
SO I'LL PROTECT YOU
AND MY MASTER NOW.

357
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,833
AND KEEP YOU COMPANY
SINCE YOUR MOM IS GONE.

358
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,625
OKEY-DOKEY?

359
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,375
- I'LL COUNT ON IT.

360
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:15,666
- HEY, YOU STAY AWAY. SHE'S MY
SHIKIGAMI AND WE'RE INSEPARABLE.

361
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,166
TRY A BEAN, HAIJI. DON'T
FORGET, LITTLE BITES, OKAY?

362
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,416
- Haiji: LITTLE BITES.

363
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,791
- (theme song playing )

364
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

365
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,833
- Hazuki: OKAY, BIG BROTHER.
IT'S RIDDLE TIME AGAIN.

366
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,125
( sternly ) IT'S RIDDLE TIME!
SIT DOWN!

367
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:07,791
NOW, WHAT GETS WETTER
AND WETTER THE MORE IT DRIES?

368
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,333
DON'T ROLL YOUR EYES.
IT'S A GOOD ONE.

369
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:15,166
READY? FULL, FULL, FULL MOON!

370
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,250
THIS IS AN EASY ONE, KOUHEI!

371
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,541
A TOWEL!

372
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:19,916
NEXT TIME ON MOON PHASE,

373
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,125
EPISODE 7,
"WELL, I WANTED IT..."

374
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,166
GOODNIGHT, BIG BROTHER!
