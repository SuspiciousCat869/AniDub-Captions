00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,166
- SO YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
ATTACKED KOUHEI, AREN'T YOU?

8
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,500
ANSWER ME!

9
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,041
WHERE'S KOUHEI NOW?

- ( muffled groaning )

11
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,625
- PUT HER DOWN!

12
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,750
I'M WARNING YOU, YOU BULLY!

13
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,333
- Vargas: THOSE EYES.
THAT MOUTH.

14
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,416
YOU RESEMBLE THE PRINCESS,
JUST AS I EXPECTED.

- Vargas: THOSE EYES.
THAT MOUTH.

19
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,333
YOU RESEMBLE THE PRINCESS,
JUST AS I EXPECTED.

20
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,666
- YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOON ENOUGH.

22
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,041

27
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,666
- Hikaru: GRODY! BLECH!

28
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,916

THIS NURSERY RHYME FROM?"

- ( screaming )

31
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,958
THAT'S NO FAIR, MY FIRST KISS
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH SEIJI!

32
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,208
NOT SOME DEMON GIRL LAME-O!

33
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,666
- THEN YOU SHOULDN'T'VE PLANTED
YOUR LIPS ON ME, KLUTZ!

34
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,250
- HE THREW ME! YOU SHOULD'VE
MOVED YOUR BIG BUTT!

35
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,541
- DON'T BLAME ME,
STUCK-UP SHRINE GIRL!

MONSTER-FACE FREAK!

- ( Vargas laughing )

38
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,250
LIKE THE SWEET CHIRPING
OF TWO LITTLE BIRDS.

39
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,291
YOU REALLY ARE ADORABLE.

40
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,041
- OOPS. I FORGOT ABOUT HIM.

41
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:24,041
- BUT A BIRD ONLY SINGS ITS BEST
WHEN IT FEELS SAFE BEHIND BARS,

42
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,125
PROTECTED FROM THE
DANGERS OF THE WORLD.

43
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,291
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME,
MISTRESS LUNA.

44
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,291
BACK TO THE COMFORT
OF YOUR TRUE MASTER'S CAGE.

- ( Hazuki and Hikaru panting )

50
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,875
- Hikaru: DID YOU SEE
WHAT YOU DID TO HIM?

51
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,333
DON'T YOU THINK THAT
WAS A LITTLE MUCH?

52
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,833
- Hazuki: I DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE!

53
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,125
( thinking ) I CAN'T LET ANYONE
ELSE GET HURT BECAUSE OF ME.

54
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,083
- ( squealing )

55
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,875

- IMPRISON!

63
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,333
- ( Vargas screaming )

64
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,500
SO, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
BEEN HIDING HER.

65
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,375
( groaning )

66
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,250
- ONE ADVANTAGE TO
BEING A HOMEBODY,

67
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,625
YOU HAVE TIME TO
PERFECT YOUR SPELLS.

68
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,083
- Hazuki: MASTER YAYOI!

69
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,000
- DON'T WORRY. HE WON'T BE
ABLE TO BREAK FREE.

70
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,750
- THAT'S NOT IT!
HIS EYES AREN'T RED!

71
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,916
HE HASN'T BEEN FEEDING!

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,500
HE'S NOT THE ONE WHO
DRANK KOUHEI'S BLOOD!

73
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,458
- Yayoi: YOU'RE RIGHT. THEN
KOUHEI'S STILL IN DANGER.

- ( groaning )

75

- ( groaning )

77
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,625
( thinking ) THAT'S WEIRD.

78
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:40,083
ALL THE PAIN JUST STOPPED.
IS SHE DOING THAT?

79
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,458
- FEEL BETTER?

80
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,625
- ( yells )

81
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,000
- ( stammering )
UH, YEAH, IT'S LIKE

82
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,291
I DIDN'T EVEN
FALL OFF A CLIFF!

83
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,583
- I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

84
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,750
- I'M NOT SURE WHY,
BUT, UH...

85
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,875
NEKO MIMI?

86
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,833
- ( clattering )

87
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,250
- I NEED TO BE FED NOW.

88
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,875
CAN I EAT THOSE?

89
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,583
- NO. NOT UNLESS YOU WANT
THE TREES TO START TALKIN'.

90
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,750
( Kouhei laughing nervously )

91
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,458
- ( stomach growling )

92
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,708
- ( thinking ) SHE'S HUNGRY,
BUT WHAT CAN I DO?

93
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,291
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO OFFER.

94
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,958
( aloud ) HERE.

95
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,458
SORRY. THIS IS ALL I'VE GOT.

- ( munching )

97
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,375
IT'S YUCKY.

98
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,000
- YEAH, WELL...

99
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,583
IT'S GUY FOOD.

100
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,375
MADE IT MYSELF, IT'S DESIGNED
FOR NINJA SURVIVAL, MOSTLY,

101
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,750
SO I COULD TELL THAT A GIRL
WOULDN'T REALLY BE INTO IT.

102
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,416
GUESS SHE REALLY IS HUNGRY.

103
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,208
- ( water flowing )

104
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,125

113
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,666
I'M SURPRISED YOU KNOW
THAT OLD NURSERY RHYME.

114
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,833
- I LEARNED IT WHEN
I WAS TAUGHT JAPANESE.

115
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,458
- IS THAT RIGHT?

116
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,583
SO, WHERE'D YOU
COME FROM, EXACTLY?

117
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,750

- ( Haiji groaning )

120
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,791
PASSING OUT WAS THE
BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.

121
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,041
NOW I'VE LOST MY MASTER!

122
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,583
OOH! ISN'T THAT HER SLAVE?

123
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,958
HEY! SLAVE BOY!

124
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,666
- Ryuuhei: LEAVE HIM BE.

125
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,333
- OH! IT'S YOU!

126
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,666
- FACING A VAMPIRE WITH
NO ONE TO HELP HIM.

127
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,916
IT'S A VITAL STEP ON THE
PATH TO HIS AWAKENING.

128
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,791
- CAN WE PLAY?

129
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,666
- HOW CAN YOU STAND HERE
WHEN HE'S IN TROUBLE?

130
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:51,416
- IF HE CAN'T SURVIVE THIS,
HE'LL BE DEAD SOON ANYWAY.

131
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,208
- SO, ANY PARTICULAR
GAMES YOU LIKE?

00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,916
( grunting )

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,250
YOUR MAGIC IS A BOOSTER
TO YOUR PHYSICAL TRAP.

139
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,000
WITHOUT THE TRAP,
THERE'LL BE NOTHING

140
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,125
FOR THE SPELL TO ENHANCE!

141
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,458
- HE JUST GREW MORE ARMS!

142
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,083
- SO IF YOU'VE STRUNG
ME TO A TREE...

143
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,708
- ( crashing )

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,125
- OH, NO! HE'S FREE!

145
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,583
- ( Vargas laughing )

146
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,250
WHO'S IN TROUBLE NOW?

147
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,291
- Seiji: LIGHTNING STRIKE!

148
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,083
- ( screaming )

149
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,500
- SEIJI'S HERE!

150
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,625
- RIGHT WHEN WE NEED HIM!

151
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,125
- FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH YOU.

152
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,416
- YOU'LL REGRET THAT.

153
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,416
( screaming )

154
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,666
- SORRY, THERE'S NO
TIME TO PLAY NICE.

155
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,791
- IS THAT SO? I'LL KEEP THAT
IN MIND FOR MYSELF.

156
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,333
- WHO IS THIS MONSTER?

157
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,250
- I'D SAY YOU'VE
BEEN OUTCLASSED.

158
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,208
( laughing )

159
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,375
- ( distant screaming )

160
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,583
- WHAT THE?

161
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,541
( screaming intensifies )

162
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,625
( thudding )

163
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,458
- OH, HEY.

164
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,041
- THAT SOUNDED LIKE KOUHEI.

165
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,583
- HEY.

166
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,958
- ( Vargas grunting angrily )

167
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,000
( yelling )

168
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,375
- NO! KOUHEI!

169
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,708
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING
AS THE PRINCESS' TOY, HUMAN.

170
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,541
- THAT'S SORT OF HOW
I WOUND UP HERE.

171
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,333
( laughing sheepishly )

172
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,125
- Vargas: GO BACK
AND ENTERTAIN HER!

173
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,666
- MAN, NOT AGAIN!

174
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,750
- HUH?

175
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,125
- LOOK, CAN WE
TRY SOMETHING ELSE?

176
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,708
I PLAY A MEAN GAME
OF TIC-TAC-TOE!

177
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,458
( screaming )

178
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,750

181
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,708

- ( Hikaru and Hazuki gasping)

188
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,000
- Vargas: PRINCESS,
THIS ISN'T SAFE.

189
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,375
I THOUGHT WE AGREED YOU WOULD
LEAVE THE SEARCH TO ME.

190
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,875
- BUT IT'S BORING
JUST WAITING THERE.

191
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,000
DIDN'T YOU LIKE OUR
LITTLE BOUNCY BALL GAME?

192
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,166
- ( laughing nervously )

193
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,250
ASK ME AFTER MY HEART
STOPS EXPLODING.

194
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,041
- DID YOU NOT HAVE
ENOUGH FUN YET?

195
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,166
DO YOU WANNA PLAY SOME MORE?

196
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,208
- ( whimpering )

197
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,791
- I THINK WE SHOULD.

198
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,916
- ALL RIGHT, LITTLE MISS CREEPY,
THAT'S ENOUGH!

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,833
- THAT'S ENOUGH OF WHAT?

200
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,875
- DON'T YOU GET IT?
HE'S MY SLAVE!

201
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,333
YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH HIM
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!

202
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,750
- I SEE. SO WE HAVE FOUND YOU.

203
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,458
- Kouhei: IS IT ME, OR DID
IT JUST GET DARKER?

204
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,083
- Hazuki: NO MORE GAMES.
JUST WHO ARE YOU?

205
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,083
- MY NAME IS ARTEMIS.

206
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,791
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME ARTE.

207
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,666
- ARTE?

208
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,916
- ARTEMIS WAS AN ANCIENT
MOON GODDESS. LIKE LUNA.

209
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
THAT'S WHERE DADDY
GOT OUR NAMES.

210
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,125
- Vargas: YES, YOU'RE
HALF SISTERS.

211
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,500
SIRED BY OUR MASTER.
BORN TO DIFFERENT MOTHERS.

212
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,625
- SHE'S MY... LITTLE SISTER?

213
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,791
- THERE'S TWO OF US,
SO WE DON'T NEED YOU.

214
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,083
YOU CAN DIE.

215
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,875
- ( Hazuki screaming )

216
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,416
WHAT WAS THAT THING?

217
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,916
- IT'S A SHADOW DEMON.
THAT'S HER SPECIALTY.

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,583
SHE'S A SHADOW MASTER.

219
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,583
- ( gasping )

220
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,875
- KAORU SENSED THE
DANGEROUS VIBRATIONS

221
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,416
ON THAT MOUNTAIN LONG AGO.

222
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,083
YET YOU CONTINUE TO TELL ME
NOT TO LET HER HELP?

223
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,125
- IT'S WHAT MASTER YAYOI
AND YOU-KNOW-WHO DECIDED.

224
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,125
FOR KOUHEI'S AWAKENING TO
TAKE PLACE, HE CANNOT BE HELPED.

225
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,000
THIS IS NO TIME FOR EMPATHY.

226
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,541
- YOU WANT US TO IGNORE
OUR FEELINGS?

227
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.

228
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,083
- ( sighs )

229
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,125
- Vargas: PRINCESS, YOU MUST
NOT TAKE HER LIFE.

230
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,000
MY ORDERS WERE TO
FIND MISTRESS LUNA

231
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,833
AND RETURN HER
SAFELY TO OUR MASTER.

232
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,625
- BUT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

233
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,916
WHY'S THE SLAVE STILL
PROTECTING HER?

234
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,166
I ALREADY KISSED HIS NECK.

235
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,291
- Vargas: WHAT?

236
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,875
BUT THAT CAN ONLY
MEAN ONE THING.

237
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,125
HE IS THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER!

238
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,458
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.
HE'S MY SLAVE!

239
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,500
- ( Hazuki and
Kouhei screaming )

240
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,625
- Kouhei: COME ON!

241
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,541
- ( explosion )

242
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,625
- ( Kaoru gasping )

243
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,541
- Koharu: OH, KAORU.

244
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,125
DON'T YOU GO WANDERING
OFF NOW, I NEED YOUR HELP.

245
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,416
- YOU DO?

246
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,333
- WE'RE GOING TO COOK
SOME RICE BALLS.

247
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,291
I'M SURE THEY'LL ALL BE VERY
HUNGRY WHEN THEY GET BACK.

248
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:38,916
- BUT I...

249
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,625
- DON'T WORRY, DEAR.

250
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,583
THEY'RE ALL GOING
TO RETURN HOME SAFELY.

251
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,375
GRANDMA CAN FEEL
IT IN HER BONES.

252
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,458
COME NOW,
THE RICE IS WAITING.

253
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,125
- ( whimpering )

254
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,750
- ( both panting )

255
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,041
- DAMN IT.

256
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,541
- Seiji: (thinking )
THESE VAMPIRES' POWERS

257
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,875
SEEM TO HAVE NO END.

258
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,750
- ( thinking ) ARE WE REALLY
SUPPOSED TO JUST STAND HERE?

259
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,833
AND WATCH KOUHEI SUFFER
LIKE HEARTLESS DEMONS?

260
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,500
- NO! NO!

261
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,208
- HIKARU, WHAT'S WRONG?

262
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,666
- THEY CAN'T.
DON'T LET THEM!

263
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,958
- I OWE YOU FOR TAKING MY EYE.
SO I'LL TAKE YOUR LIFE!

264
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,958
- Seiji: MASTER!

265
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,291
- YOU WORRY ABOUT
PROTECTING HIKARU.

266
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,125
- ( thinking ) IS SHE JUST
SCARED? OR IS IT SOMETHING MORE?

267
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:46,833
- Arte: I WANT TO PLAY.

268
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:52,250
PLEASE, FORGET ABOUT LUNA.
PLAY WITH ME INSTEAD.

269
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,333
- OH, JUST GIVE UP!

270
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,958
KOUHEI BELONGS
TO ME, NOT YOU,

271
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,208
AND HE DOES WHATEVER
I WANT HIM TO!

272
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,541
AND I DON'T FEEL
LIKE SHARING HIM

273
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,291
WITH A MEAN LITTLE
GIRL LIKE YOU!

274
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,041
- LUNA'S TOY...

275
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,375
I WAS AFRAID
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

276
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,291
THE SLAVE'S ACTING LIKE DADDY.
ALL THAT HE CARES ABOUT IS YOU.

277
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,375
WITH LUNA AROUND,
WHY WOULD ANYONE

278
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,375
WANNA PAY ATTENTION TO ME?

279
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,375
I HATE HER.

280
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,416
( shouts ) I HATE LUNA!

281
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,791
- Kouhei: ( thinking ) WE WON'T
BE ABLE TO ESCAPE THIS TIME.

282
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,416
DAMN IT, SHE'S GONNA KILL US
WITH A STUPID SHADOW!

283
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,250
NO! THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!

284
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,625
( grunting )

285
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,791
- ( crackling )

286
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,000
- ( Arte screaming )

287
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,583
- KOUHEI...

288
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,416
- HE REPELLED HER SHADOW.

289
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,666
OR WAIT. HE DESTROYED IT!

290
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,791
- Vargas: PRINCESS!

291
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,375
DON'T MOVE!
I'M COMING TO HELP YOU!

292
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,750
PRINCESS!

293
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,416
- MAN, I WASN'T TRYIN' TO
KNOCK HER UNCONSCIOUS.

294
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,291
- WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

295
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,458
THAT SHADOW WAS PART OF HER.

296
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,666
DESTROYING IT WAS BOUND
TO HURT HER TOO.

297
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,791
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

298
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,958
- ( cheerfully ) UM, KOUHEI?

299
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,416
YOUR NECK IS ABOUT
TO BE SORE, ALL RIGHT?

300
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,625
- A MERE HUMAN HURTING
THE PRINCESS. UNFORGIVABLE!

301
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,000
YOU'LL SUFFER FOR THIS!

302
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,500
NO. SHE'S FEEDING!

303
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,625
- AS YOU CAN SEE MY POWERS
JUST GOT A MAJOR BOOST.

304
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,083
SO UNLESS YOU WANNA GET
HURT EVEN WORSE TONIGHT,

305
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,708
TAKE THAT GIRL AND
GET OFF THIS MOUNTAIN!

306
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,750
- ( swishing )

307
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,291
- ( crashing )

308
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,000
- I'LL FIGHT YOU MYSELF.

309
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,166
I'M NOT GONNA WATCH SOMEONE
ELSE GET HURT BECAUSE OF ME.

310
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,666
NEVER, EVER AGAIN!

311
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,125
- HAZUKI...

312
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,791
- DID YOU SEE THAT?
SHE HARNESSED HER TRUE POWER.

313
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,083
MAYBE WE REALLY CAN WIN THIS.

314
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,875
- Jeda: ( whispering ) THEN I'D
BETTER STEP IN.

315
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,833
- BROTHER SEIJI!

316
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,666
( Hikaru moaning )

317
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,750
- WHAT THE?

318
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,875
- HIKARU!

319
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,833
- JEDA, WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?

320
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,416
- COMPLICATIONS, MR. VARGAS.

321
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,958
I MUST SAY I'M DISAPPOINTED

322
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,250
IN YOUR PERFORMANCE
WHILE I'VE BEEN GONE.

323
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,875
- WHO'S THIS GUY? HOW MANY
VAMPIRES ARE OUT HERE?

324
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:34,291
- LISTEN, BUG-HEAD, YOU GIVE
HIKARU BACK TO ME, RIGHT NOW!

325
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,333
- WILL YOU COME WITH US,
LIKE A GOOD LITTLE GIRL?

326
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,958
- Hazuki: I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE WITH YOU!

327
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,666
- WELL, THEN. I'LL HAVE TO
MAKE HER MY HOSTAGE.

328
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,083
- NO YOU WON'T!

329
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,916
- JUST HOW SKILLFUL DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE, MISTRESS?

330
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,791
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN STOP
US WITHOUT HURTING HER AS WELL?

331
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,125
- Hazuki: HIKARU, NO...

332
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,041
- Kouhei: YOU COWARDS!
SHE'S JUST A KID!

333
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,500
- Jeda: WE'LL GIVE YOU TIME
TO MULL IT OVER.

334
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,833
WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO HURT
YOUR SOFT LITTLE BRAINS.

335
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,083
MEET US BACK HERE, ON THE
NIGHT OF THE NEXT FULL MOON.

336
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,291
- ( Seiji grunting )

337
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,291
- IF YOU EVER WANT TO SEE
THIS GIRL ALIVE AGAIN.

338
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,625
- WHERE IS SHE?

339
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,166
- Jeda: WELL, I'LL BE WAITING,
MISTRESS LUNA.

340
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,333
SWEET DREAMS, PUPPETS

341
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,333
( laughing )

342
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,583
- DAMN IT!

343
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,375
I STILL WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

344
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,166
- Ryuuhei: NO, KOUHEI.

345
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,083
- THEY TOOK HER.

346
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,541
I TRIED...

347
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,875
I TRIED TO FIGHT BACK THIS TIME.

348
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,000
- I KNOW.

349
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,541
- BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.

350
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,208
IT HAPPENED AGAIN.

351
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,458
SOMEONE'S BEEN HURT.

352
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,416
TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE OF ME.

353
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,000
( thinking ) WHY AM I
SUCH A CURSE?

354
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,000
- ( theme song playing )

355
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,416
( singing in Japanese )

356
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,458
- Hazuki: OKAY, BIG BROTHER,
RIDDLE TIME AGAIN!

357
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,750
USUALLY WHEN YOU BREAK
SOMETHING YOU GET IN TROUBLE.

358
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,750
BUT WHAT CAN YOU BREAK
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

359
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,708
AND GET PRAISED FOR EVERY TIME?

360
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,125
FULL, FULL, FULL, MOON!

361
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,833
YOU GIVE UP? A RECORD! DUH!

362
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,041
YOU KNOW YOU'RE REALLY NOT
GETTING ANY BETTER AT THESE.

363
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,750
WE'VE BEEN DOING 'EM
FOR A WHILE NOW

364
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,291
AND YOU'D THINK EVENTUALLY
SOMETHING WOULD SINK IN.

365
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,833
I-I MEAN, UM, GOOD TRY!

366
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,500
NEXT TIME ON MOON PHASE,

367
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,333
"I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE LIKE THAT!"

368
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,916
GOODNIGHT, BIG BROTHER!
