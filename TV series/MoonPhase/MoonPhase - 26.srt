1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,333
- ( people chattering )

2
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,250
- All: ITADAKIMASU!

3
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,791
- ELFRIEDE, MY DEAR, WILL YOU
PASS ME SOME OF THAT SOY SAUCE?

4
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,500
- WHY, OF COURSE,
RYUUHEI DARLING.

5
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,583
- IS THIS A JOKE?
- WHAT?

6
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,750
- WELL, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT

7
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,333
FIXED BREAKFAST THIS
MORNING, AREN'T YOU?

8
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,541
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU MAD
AT ME FOR FEEDING YOU NOW?

9
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:01,833
- I GUESS IT'S AN ACCIDENT THAT

10
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,500
MY FISH IS THE SIZE
OF MY PINKY THEN, HUH?

11
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,791
AND YOURS IS AS BIG
AS YOUR DEMON FACE?

12
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,500
- THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE.

13
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,833
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT. I'VE SEEN
EYELASHES BIGGER THAN THIS.

14
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:11,958
- IT JUST LOOKS SMALL

15
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,458
IN YOUR MAN HANDS.
- ( Hikaru gasping )

16
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,958
- WOULD YOU TWO KNOCK IT OFF
ALREADY? IT'S WAY TOO EARLY.

17
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,291
- ( softly ) I THINK MINE'S ONLY
BEEN COOKED HALFWAY THROUGH.

18
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,250
- SWAP YOUR FISH
WITH KAORU'S, FREAK-O.

19
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,791
- NO WAY.
- IT'S NOT A REQUEST.

20
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,375
- N-O.

21
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,875
- SWAP IT NOW!
- NO!

22
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,416
- COME ON,
I'M TRYING TO EAT.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,208
- ( both grunting )

24
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,916
- DO YOU THINK I COULD
HAVE A SECOND HELPING,

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,291
ELFRIEDE DEAREST?

26
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,083
- SURE, RYUUHEI HONEY.

27
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,083
- ( Haiji exclaiming )

28
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,875
- YEAH, IT DEFINITELY TASTES
LIKE IT'S RAW IN THE MIDDLE.

29
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,333
- ELFRIEDE, MY SWEET,
I'D LOVE SOME MORE SOUP, TOO,

30
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,708
IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

31
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,500
- NO. NOT AT ALL.

32
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,625
- ( gasping )
- WHAT THE...

33
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,083
- HIS SWEET?

34
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,875
- ( chuckles )
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

35
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,000
- HAVEN'T YOU HEARD THE THINGS
THEY'VE BEEN SAYING?

36
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,333
"HONEY" THIS, "DEAREST" THAT.

37
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,666
- YEAH. NEXT THING YOU KNOW

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,666
SHE'LL START CALLING HIM
"PEAS AND CARROTS."

39
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,291
- YEAH, IT SOUNDS NICE.
THEY'RE JUST TERMS OF ENDEARMENT

40
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,250
AND MAYBE IF YOU GUYS USED THEM,
YOU WOULDN'T ARGUE SO MUCH.

41
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,708
- YOU'RE TOTALLY
MISSING THE POINT.

42
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,583
- YEAH, NUMB SKULL.

43
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:13,208
- WELL, MAYBE IF I JUST CLOSE MY
EYES AND EAT IT REALLY QUICKLY.

44
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,666
- ( laughing )

45
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,250
- Arte: SHE STOPPED MOVING.
- Hazuki: NOT NOW, ARTE, OKAY?

46
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,125
YOU THINK SO?

47
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,166
- THE SIGNS DO
POINT THAT WAY.

48
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,500
- SCANDALOUS.

49
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,916
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,958
- YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT,
NUMB SKULL.

51
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,208
- WOULD YOU STOP
CALLING ME THAT?

52
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,125
I'M ASKING YOU
A PERFECTLY REASONABLE QUESTION.

53
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,625
- Hikaru: REASONABLE IF
YOU'RE A NUMB SKULL.

54
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,208
- Kouhei: THEN HERE'S A
QUESTION. HOW MUCH OF A BRAT

55
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,541
DO YOU HAVE TO BE BEFORE

56
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,083
I LOCK YOU IN THE BASEMENT?
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

57
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,458
- HEY. ARTE?

58
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,083
- WHERE'S SHE GOING?

59
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,000
- ( gurgling )
- LOOK. SHE'S DROWNING.

60
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,833
- ( exclaims ) GUYS, LOOK!

61
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,708
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- ( coughing )

62
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,166
DEATH BY FISH BROTH
IS THE WORST WAY TO GO.

63
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,583
- YOU GOOF. WHAT'RE YOU DOING
SWIMMING IN SOUP?

64
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,791
- DON'T SCOLD ME, SLAVE BOY.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

65
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,916
I WAS DROWNING
BECAUSE ARTE PUT ME THERE.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,166
- ARTE DID?

67
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,458
- THEY'RE NO FUN.

68
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,000
- KINDA TAKES PLAYTIME A LITTLE
TOO FAR, DON'T YOU THINK?

69
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,583
- YOU COULD SAY THAT.

70
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,750
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A
TALK WITH THAT GIRL TODAY.

71
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,583
- OH, DEAR, MISSED A PIECE.

72
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,708
- YES, SLOPPY OLD ME.
THANKS, SUGAR PLUM.

73
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,166
- YOU'RE WELCOME, HANDSOME.

74
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,625
- DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THAT?

75
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,083
- HOLD ON.

76
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,666
ARE YOU SAYING THEY'RE,
LIKE, MORE THAN FRIENDS?

77
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,208
- Both: NUMB SKULL!
- SCANDALOUS.

78
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,208
- BY THE WAY, WHERE'S SEIJI?
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM THIS MORNING.

79
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,291
- I TOLD HIM BREAKFAST WAS
READY, BUT HE NEVER CAME DOWN.

80
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,166
- STILL IN THAT ROOM, HUH?

81
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,625
I TELL YOU, THAT BOY'S
JUST INCAPABLE OF ADAPTING.

82
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,916
- ( typing )

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,583
- IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS NOW,
AND STILL NO SIGN OF RELIEF,

84
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,041
OR EXPLANATION

85
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,333
FOR THE STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT HAVE BEFALLEN US.

86
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,625
HOW CAN THEY STAY SO CALM?

87
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,291
HOW CAN THEY SIT IN THIS HOUSE,
EATING THEIR MEALS,

88
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,458
LAUGHING AS ALWAYS?

89
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,666
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM ANYMORE.

90
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,791
AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S KEPT HIS SANITY?

91
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,125
WHEN?

92
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,000
WHEN WILL
THIS BIZARRE ISOLATION END?

93
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,000
WHEN WILL OUR RESCUERS FIND US?

94
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,833
- ( intense music playing )

95
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,541
- ( waves crashing )

96
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:55,083
- TALK ABOUT RELAXING.
WHAT A DAY.

97
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:59,416
THE SKY IS BLUE.
THE SUN IS SHINING.

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,583
- ( gasping for breath )

99
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,625
- MY HELPLESS TWIN SISTER
IS DROWNING.

100
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,041
( exclaims ) KAORU!

101
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,875
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, KAORU?

102
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,583
- YEAH. THANKS TO YOU.

103
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,041
- GOOD, THEN WE CAN MOVE ON.

104
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,833
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
SWIMMING IN THESE?

105
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,541
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THEY'D SOAK UP
WATER AND SINK YOU?

106
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,875
- THEY'RE MY HOTTIE PAIR.

107
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,333
I HAVE DIFFERENT PAWS
BUT THOSE ARE MY HOTTIE ONES.

108
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,166
- THEY ARE?
- MEOW.

109
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,083
- YES, OF COURSE!
YOU LOOK TOTALLY HOT.

110
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,583
- MEOW?

111
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,791
- ( both laughing )
- Hikaru: YEAH.

112
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,041
- MEOW.
- AWW.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,666
- WELL, I'M HEADING OUT,
HONEY BABY.

114
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,750
- GREAT. I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN YOU GET BACK, SWEETUMS.

115
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,333
- TRY TO CATCH AN OCTOPUS
THIS TIME, OKAY?

116
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,375
- ( shouting )
LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN

117
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,416
WITHOUT YOU RUINING IT, BOY!

118
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,958
OKAY. I'M HEADING OUT,
CUTIE DEAREST.

119
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,791
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU WHEN YOU
GET BACK, YOU BEAUTIFUL MAN.

120
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,666
- BUT, REALLY, FIND AN OCTOPUS.
I'M GETTING TIRED OF FISH.

121
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,333
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH, BOY!

122
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,791
TAKE CARE.
- YOU, TOO.

123
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,708
- ( whistling )

124
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,833
- GOODBYE, DEAR.
HAVE A NICE HUNT.

125
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,250
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

126
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,916
- YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT THAT UP, KOUHEI.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,583
MENTIONING OCTOPUS.

128
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,708
DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DEAR
GRANDFATHER HAS BEEN THROUGH?

129
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,041
HE'S TRIED VERY HARD
TO PUT THAT ALL BEHIND HIM.

130
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,333
- GRAMPS AND OCTOPUS?
NEVER HEARD OF THAT ONE.

131
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,916
- IT WAS HORRIFYING.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,333
A TALE SO HAUNTING, FEW MEN
CAN EVEN BEAR TO HEAR IT.

133
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,333
IT HAPPENED 44 YEARS AGO,
IN A SEA MUCH LIKE THIS ONE.

134
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,291
HE SWAM THROUGH THE CAVE,
TENTACLES LASHING.

135
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,083
DEEPER INTO HIS BRAIN,
ATTACKING HIM WITH THE MEMORIES

136
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,208
OF THE GHOSTLY WOMAN
DRENCHED IN BLOOD.

137
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:36,083
- ( Kouhei screaming )

138
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,208
- AND THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
HAPPENED 44 YEARS AGO.

139
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,375
- POOR GRANDPA. THAT'S TERRIBLE.

140
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,416
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEIR TENTACLES COULD DO THAT.

141
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,875
I'LL NEVER EAT
AN OCTOPUS AGAIN!

142
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,166
- Hazuki: OPEN THIS DOOR
RIGHT NOW, ARTE!

143
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,875
YOU'RE GONNA APOLOGIZE TO HAIJI
FOR WHAT YOU DID TO HER.

144
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,250
- Haiji: I'VE ALREADY
TRIED KNOCKING.

145
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,708
SHE REFUSES TO COME OUT.

146
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,625
- ( grumbling ) LET'S GO!

147
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,708
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MASTER?
DON'T GIVE UP NOW!

148
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,083
- I'M NOT GIVING UP.

149
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,125
I'M JUST NOT LETTING HER
WASTE ANY MORE OF MY TIME.

150
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,833
SHE DIDN'T EAT MUCH AT BREAKFAST
SO SHE'S BOUND TO COME OUT SOON.

151
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,250
- BUT, MASTER...
- I SAID, LET'S GO!

152
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,333
WE'LL YELL AT HER LATER.
- FINE.

153
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,833
- Seiji: SUDDENLY,
A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME.

154
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,125
DISTURBING IN ITS IMPLICATIONS.

155
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,583
HOW LONG CAN THIS HOUSE STAY
AFLOAT IN THESE UNKNOWN WATERS?

156
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,500
WHEN THE STORMS AND
THE HIGH WAVES COME,

157
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,458
WILL THIS HOUSE WITHSTAND THEM?

158
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,791
AFTER ALL,
IT'S JUST AN ORDINARY BUILDING.

159
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,791
WAIT A MINUTE.

160
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,666
HOW IN THE WORLD IS THIS HOUSE
STAYING AFLOAT RIGHT NOW?

161
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,750
- ( sighs )

162
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,625
IT SURE IS HOT, THOUGH.

163
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,791
HAIJI! CAN YOU BRING SOME JUICE?

164
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:05,916
HAIJI?

165
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:12,458
THAT'S WEIRD. SHE'S GONE.
- HAZUKI, THERE YOU ARE.

166
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,500
- OH, HEY, HIKARU.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HAIJI WENT?

167
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,791
- YOU'D BETTER COME DOWNSTAIRS.

168
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,333
- WHY, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

169
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,958
- JUST COME SEE
FOR YOURSELF, OKAY?

170
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,083
- WELL, WELL.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

171
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,666
SO, PRINCESS SOUP TORTURER
FINALLY COMES OUT OF HER ROOM.

172
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,000
WELL, IF YOU THINK WE FORGOT
WHAT YOU DID, YOU'RE WRONG!

173
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,708
ARTE! SORRY TO ASK, BUT WILL
YOU GO FIND HAIJI FOR ME?

174
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,458
YOU'RE GONNA APOLOGIZE,
UNDERSTOOD?

175
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,375
- ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT YOU DOWN HERE.

176
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,208
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
- THERE'S A BITE.

177
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,291
- HAZUKI! REEL IT IN,
REEL IT IN NOW!

178
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,833
- WHY? WHO CARES?
- JUST DO IT, OKAY?

179
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,333
- OKAY. CALM DOWN.

180
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:16,250
HAIJI!
- OUCHIE, OUCHIE, OUCHIE.

181
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,750
- THAT'S A BIG ONE.

182
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,208
- SAY SOMETHING, HAIJI.
ARE YOU OKAY?

183
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,666
- SHE LOOKS TERRIBLE!

184
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,916
- WE CAUGHT A YELLOW TAIL
- HAIJI? HAIJI, ARE YOU OKAY?

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,041
- TOGETHER. AND, IT'S BIG.
- SHOULD WE DO CPR OR SOMETHING?

186
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,958
- WE HAD FUN, DIDN'T WE?
- I NEVER LEARNED FIRST AID.

187
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,541
- AREN'T YOU PROUD OF ME, LUNA?
- SHAKE HER AT LEAST!

188
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,541
- THAT FISH WAS PRETTY BIG.

189
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,083
DO YOU THINK SHE
HAS A BROKEN BONE?

190
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,875
- Hikaru: WAIT, I THINK I SAW
HER BLINK. DID YOU SEE THAT?

191
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,166
- HOLD ON.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

192
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,291
ARTE! GET BACK HERE.

193
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,250
WHAT'S THAT GIRL'S PROBLEM?
SHE'S SUCH A BIG BRAT!

194
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,500
HONESTLY, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND HER AT ALL.

195
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,166
SEAWEED, HUH?

196
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,541
WHAT IN THE...

197
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,583
- I'M ONLY GUESSING, HAZ,

198
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,208
BUT MAYBE ARTE'S DOING ALL THIS
JUST TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.

199
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,625
- SERIOUSLY?

200
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,500
- IT'S A GUARANTEED WAY
TO GET NOTICED, ISN'T IT?

201
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,458
MAKING YOU MAD?
- I GUESS SO.

202
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,583
BUT WHO WANTS ATTENTION FROM

203
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,291
SOMEONE WHO'S MAD AT
YOU ALL THE TIME?

204
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,875
IF SHE WANTS TO HANG OUT,
WHY CAN'T SHE JUST ASK?

205
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,166
- MAYBE BECAUSE SHE'S A LOT
LIKE HER OLDER SISTER.

206
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,916
ARTE DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE YET.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,708
AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS ALONE,
IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN.

208
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,333
YOU WERE LIKE THAT
YOURSELF IN THE BEGINNING,

209
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,166
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

210
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,416
NOW, I'M NOT SAYING THAT
TO EXCUSE WHAT SHE'S DONE.

211
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,250
I KNOW THAT SHE'S GONE
A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

212
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,750
- IT'S MORE THAN
A LITTLE, KOUHEI.

213
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,500
THE GIRL'S A FREAKING TERROR.
- ( chuckles )

214
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,833
JUST TRY TO PUT YOURSELF
IN HER SHOES, OKAY?

215
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,583
- YEAH, OKAY.

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,583
YOU'VE GOT A POINT.
I'LL TRY MY BEST.

217
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,166
SHE IS MY LITTLE SISTER,
AFTER ALL.

218
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,291
- OH, YEAH,
AND SPEAKING OF A TERROR.

219
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,416
- YEAH?

220
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,125
- ELFRIEDE TOLD ME
THE CRAZIEST STORY

221
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,625
ABOUT GRANDPA
WHEN HE WAS YOUNG.

222
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,083
- WHAT?
- IT HAPPENED 44 YEARS AGO...

223
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,458
- ( waves crashing )

224
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,541
- Hazuki: ( screaming )
AN OCTOPUS DID WHAT?

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,208
- Seiji: BLOOD OF ANCESTRY,
DESTINY OF BLOOD.

226
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,166
BLOOD OF ANCESTRY,
DESTINY OF BLOOD.

227
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,333
- I'VE BROUGHT YOU TEA,
BROTHER SEIJI.

228
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,625
I'LL JUST SET IT DOWN HERE.

229
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,291
AND YOU CAN GET IT
WHEN YOU WANT.

230
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,791
- BLOOD OF ANCESTRY,
DESTINY OF BLOOD.

231
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,083
BLOOD OF ANCESTRY,
DESTINY OF BLOOD.

232
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,041
BLOOD OF ANCESTRY,
DESTINY OF BLOOD.

233
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,375
- WHAT KIND OF SPELL
IS THAT?

234
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,375
- Kaoru: FATE THROUGH
SEVEN GENERATIONS.

235
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,666
- OH, YEAH, I'VE HEARD OF THAT.

236
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,583
IT'S SUPPOSED TO
TELL OUR FUTURE.

237
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,125
HE DOESN'T LOOK TOO GOOD.

238
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,083
- Ryuuhei: HEY, I'M HOME.
AND WE'VE GOT A VISITOR.

239
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,375
- ...DESTINY OF BLOOD.

240
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,875
- Woman: HOW'S MY FAVORITE
ODDBALL FAMILY?

241
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,375
- WHO IS THAT?
- BLOOD OF ANCESTRY...

242
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,125
THAT VOICE...
BUT HOW COULD THAT BE?

243
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,625
- Elfriede: THAT'S
QUITE A CATCH, DARLING.

244
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,583
- Ryuuhei: NEVER
COULD'VE DONE IT

245
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,208
WITHOUT THIS YOUNG LADY'S MOVES.

246
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,208
- Hiromi: OH, PLEASE. I JUST
HELPED HERD THEM IN A LITTLE.

247
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,125
- WOW, IT REALLY IS HER.
- SEE? WHAT DID I SAY, KOUHEI?

248
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,250
I KNEW I RECOGNIZED HER VOICE!

249
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,041
- HEY, GUYS, HOW'S IT GOING?
LONG TIME, NO SEE.

250
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,041
- HOW IN THE WORLD
DID YOU GET HERE, HIROMI?

251
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,333
- ( giggling )
SURE YOU WANNA KNOW?

252
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,000
- Ryuuhei: IT'LL BLOW YOUR MIND.
- I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

253
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,833
- YEAH! SHOW US, HIROMI, PLEASE?

254
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,791
- OKAY. FOLLOW ME.

255
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,458
- ( footsteps )

256
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,166
- HEY, SEIJI. YOU FINALLY
CAME OUT OF YOUR HOLE.

257
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,125
- I HEARD HIROMI'S VOICE.
WHERE IS SHE?

258
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,375
- UH...

259
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,500
- SHE LEFT. SHE HAD
A VERY BUSY SCHEDULE.

260
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,083
- YEAH, I'VE GOT TO ADMIT.
MY MIND IS BLOWN.

261
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,208
- I KNEW HIROMI WAS TALENTED,
BUT THAT TAKES THE CAKE.

262
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,875
- Seiji: WAIT!
- HEY, SEIJI.

263
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,000
- HIROMI. WHERE IS SHE?
- YOU JUST BARELY MISSED HER.

264
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,666
- YEAH. SHE JUST
WENT BACK HOME.

265
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,166
- HOME? HIROMI WENT HOME?

266
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,250
- YEAH, IS THERE A PROBLEM?
- PROBLEM?

267
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,375
- SEIJI, STOP IT!

268
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,708
- HIROMI SHOWS UP OUT OF NOWHERE
AND YOU LET HER LEAVE,

269
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,708
AND YOU ASK ME
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM?

270
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:03,916
- IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO RESPOND TO YOU

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,791
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO CHOKE ME TO DEATH.

272
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,583
- WHAT HAS GOTTEN
INTO YOU, SEIJI?

273
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,041
CALM DOWN!
- HAZUKI'S RIGHT.

274
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,041
YOU'VE REALLY BEEN MAKING
A FOOL OF YOURSELF LATELY.

275
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,125
YOU NEED TO RELAX.

276
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:17,291
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU FREAKS?

277
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,625
I'M NOT SURE WHERE HIROMI CAME
FROM OR HOW SHE GOT HERE.

278
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,916
BUT CLEARLY SHE CAME
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,875
WHICH MEANS YOU LET OUR BEST
CHANCE OF BEING SAVED GET AWAY.

280
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,500
WHY AM I THE ONLY
ONE IN THIS HOUSE

281
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,041
WHO SEEMS TO CARE
ABOUT GETTING RESCUED?

282
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,583
DON'T YOU WANT TO GET
BACK TO THE MAINLAND,

283
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,083
OR CARE HOW WE GOT HERE?

284
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,375
HAVE YOU GONE MAD?

285
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,583
- YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
SCREAM LIKE THAT.

286
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,541
YOU'LL LOSE YOUR VOICE.

287
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,791
- THERE'S NO REASON TO WORRY.

288
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,666
I'M SURE HIROMI
WILL COME BACK SOON

289
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,916
AND YOU CAN TALK TO HER THEN.

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,625
- OR MAYBE KISS?

291
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,541
- I JUST CAN'T GET
THROUGH TO THEM.

292
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,458
WE'RE VICTIMS OF SOME
STRANGE PARANORMAL EVENT

293
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,750
AND THEY DON'T CARE.

294
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,500
( screams )

295
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,916
- SEIJI, WHERE'RE YOU GOING?
WHAT'S WRONG?

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,125
- "WHAT'S WRONG" IS RIGHT.

297
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,000
I THINK SOMEONE'S
BEEN DRINKING SALTWATER.

298
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,166
-HE'S NOT IN HERE, EITHER.
I WONDER WHERE SEIJI WENT.

299
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,333
- ( waves crashing )

300
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,458
- ( screaming )

301
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,416
THE HOUSE IS FLOODING!
- MASTER, THERE YOU ARE!

302
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,666
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- WE'VE BEEN UNCORKED.

303
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,833
- ARTE!
- SHE PULLED THE CORK

304
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,041
OUT OF THE FLOOR, AND NOW THE
HOUSE IS FILLING UP WITH WATER.

305
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,583
- WE'LL SINK!
- IT POPPED.

306
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,666
IT POPPED.
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, HUH?

307
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,875
- IT POPPED.

308
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,666
- STOP SAYING THAT,
I KNOW THE CORK POPPED.

309
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,041
AND FUNNY SOUNDS ARE NO EXCUSE
FOR SINKING A HOUSE.

310
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,541
- HAZUKI, WHAT ON EARTH
DID YOU DO?

311
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,416
- HOW COULD YOU?
- WE'VE BEEN UNCORKED.

312
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
YOU'RE GONNA GET US ALL KILLED!

313
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,916
- NO, YOU GUYS, IT WASN'T ME!

314
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,750
- UH-OH.
- "UH-OH" IS RIGHT, MISSY!

315
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,208
YOU REALLY THINK I'D BE SO...

316
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,291
- Hikaru: BE SO WHAT? STUPID?

317
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,875
- WELL, OF COURSE WE DO. YOU'RE
STANDING THERE HOLDING THE CORK.

318
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,833
- OKAY, FINE, I DID IT.
SO, WHAT?

319
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:19,416
- MASTER, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, HAZUKI?

320
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,791
I DON'T KNOW,
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IT.

321
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,041
IT MADE A FUNNY POPPING SOUND

322
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,791
AND IT WAS THE MOST FUN
I'VE HAD ALL WEEK.

323
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,541
- Hikaru: THAT'S THE DUMBEST
REASON I EVER HEARD.

324
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,500
- IT'S JUST A CORK. WHO CARES?

325
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,916
- I CARE, FREAK-O.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE US ALL DROWN.

326
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,416
- THEN PLUG THE HOLE
WITH YOUR FACE.

327
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,000
- MASTER, WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

328
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,208
- I KNOW YOU DIDN'T UNCORK IT.
I SAW IT MYSELF.

329
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,708
- STOP TRYING
TO COVER FOR ME, HAIJI!

330
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,500
- IT WAS ME, OKAY?
I LOVE THE SOUND.

331
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,458
POP. POP. POP.

332
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,875
- STOP SAYING "POP."

333
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,333
- ( creaking )

334
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,958
- ( all screaming )
- WATCH OUT!

335
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,208
- HONEY SNOOKUMS.
- ELFRIEDE, ARE YOU HURT?

336
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,416
- I'M FINE, HAZUKI,
IT'S JUST A LITTLE SCRATCH.

337
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,625
THE IMPORTANT THING IS

338
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,416
WE PUT THE CORK BACK
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

339
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,500
- GIVE IT TO ME. QUICK.
- I'LL HELP, TOO.

340
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,625
- PLEASE BE CAREFUL.
THIS REALLY IS BAD.

341
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,333
- OF COURSE, IT'S BAD. WE'RE
ALL IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF YOU.

342
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,958
- I'M SORRY.

343
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,500
- Ryuuhei: PUSH, KOUHEI!
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT SEAL.

344
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,833
- ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO.

345
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,541
- ( popping )

346
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,875
- THEY STOPPED THE FLOODING.
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.

347
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,625
- SO, LET'S MAKE A NOTE
NOT TO DO THAT AGAIN, OKAY?

348
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,208
- Seiji: A MIRACLE.

349
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,375
IT'S REALLY THERE. MY EYES
WEREN'T PLAYING TRICKS ON ME.

350
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,083
WE'LL BE SAVED! HEY!

351
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,833
HEY! HEY!

352
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,333
IT'S NO GOOD.
THEY'RE TOO FAR AWAY.

353
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,291
IF ONLY I COULD
SEND THEM A SIGNAL.

354
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,791
OF COURSE!

355
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,500
- HOT DAY OUT IN THE OPEN SEA,
ISN'T IT?

356
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,666
- CERTAINLY IS, SIR.

357
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,041
- HARD TO WIPE SWEAT IN THESE
THINGS, DON'T YOU THINK?

358
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,375
- CERTAINLY DO, SIR.
- HUH? WHAT'S THAT?

359
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:34,000
- A DISTRESS SIGNAL. ADMIRAL,
SIR, YOU SHOULD HEAR THIS.

360
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,000
- WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW?
- AN S.O.S.

361
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,666
- HEY, LOOK OVER THERE.

362
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,916
- ( exclaims )

363
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,125
- ( giggles )

364
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,291
- OH, WOW. SHE'S SO LOVELY.

365
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,708
LOVELY. SHE MUST BE
ONE OF THE GREAT SIRENS OF MYTH.

366
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,375
NO MAN CAN RESIST HER.

367
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,416
- Officer 2: QUICK, COVER YOUR
EYES. PUT WAX IN YOUR EARS.

368
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,166
- WHY WOULD I? I LOVE HER!
- ME, TOO!

369
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,125
- DON'T LET HER GET AWAY, MEN.
AFTER HER, FULL THROTTLE.

370
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,375
- All: AYE AYE, SIR!

371
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,291
- Seiji: NO.
THEY'RE SAILING AWAY.

372
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,166
AND AT FULL SPEED.
BUT WHY? ( exclaims )

373
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,541
- HAZUKI.

374
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,041
- SCRUBBY DUBBY DINEY,
MAKE IT NICE AND SHINY,

375
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,291
SCRUBBY DUBBY CUPCAKES,
SCRUB IT TILL YOUR BACK ACHES,

376
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,666
SCRUBBY DUBBY DOLPHIN,
MASTER GOT THE RAW END.

377
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,916
( humming )

378
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,625
- YOU'RE HELPING?
- SORRY. I DIDN'T REALIZE.

379
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,416
I HAVE A SISTER
TO LOOK AFTER, TOO.

380
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,041
YOU'RE A GOOD SISTER, HAZUKI.

381
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,625
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN AT IT FOR LONG,

382
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,958
BUT I'D SAY
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

383
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,250
- YOU MEAN IT?

384
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,583
- HOW'S THAT CUT, ELFRIEDE?
FEEL BETTER?

385
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,500
- LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

386
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:35,125
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
- DON'T BE. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

387
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,625
- Hazuki: ARTE.

388
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,791
- IT WASN'T HAZUKI.

389
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,750
I'M THE ONE
WHO TOOK OUT THE CORK.

390
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,458
- IT'S OKAY.

391
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,458
- WE'RE SAFE NOW. RIGHT?

392
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,916
- HAZUKI.

393
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,833
I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

394
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,166
I'LL NEVER PULL
THIS CORK OUT AGAIN.

395

- Seiji: I TOLD YOU, YOU FREAKS.

398
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,750
- SORRY, HAZUKI.

399
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,250
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
WE'RE FINE.

400
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,083
