1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,083
- ( she gasps )

2
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:17,750
- Hazuki: I'LL GO WITH YOU NOW.
BACK TO "MY KIND."

3
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,291
- WHAT IS THAT?

4
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,750
- IT'S A CASTLE.

5
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,750
- THAT'S SCHWARTZ QUELLE,
THE PLACE WHERE HAZUKI WAS

6
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,625
IMPRISONED WHEN
KOUHEI RESCUED HER.

7
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,458
- HOW'D IT GET HERE?

8
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,708
- THE CASTLE SEEKS MISTRESS LUNA
JUST AS SHE SEEKS THE CASTLE.

9
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:15,375
HER DECISION TO RETURN BROUGHT
IT FROM GERMANY TO HERE.

10
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,333
IT WILL APPEAR FOR HER ALWAYS.

11
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,916
WHENEVER SHE CHOOSES
FOR IT TO COME.

12
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,750
- WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?

13
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:29,500
- IT SEEMS JEDA HAS
ACCOMPLISHED HIS MISSION.

14
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,666
YOU SHOULD BE PLEASED, HUMAN.
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

15
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,291
- SERIOUSLY?

16
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,791
- AS PROMISED. WE HAVE WHAT WE
WANT. FOLLOW ME, PRINCESS.

17
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,625
- ( theme song playing )

18
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

19
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,041
- GOOD-BYE BIG BROTHER.

20
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,500
I'M GOING BACK? I'M
REALLY GOING BACK?

21
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,250
- I'M SORRY, MOTHER,
BUT I HAD TO COME BACK.

22
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,208
I KNOW YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

23
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,500
I JUST REALLY WISH I COULD'VE
WAITED UNTIL I SAW YOU AGAIN.

24
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,416
AT LEAST ONCE.

25
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,416
- KOUHEI.

26
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,125
- YOU... I SAW YOU.

27
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,750
DO... DO YOU HAVE A NAME?

28
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,666
- WELL, OF COURSE I DO, SILLY.
MY NAME IS HAZUKI.

29
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,125
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

30
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,791
AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
IF I MAY ASK?

31
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:00,041
- OH. YEAH, I'M KOUHEI MORIOKA.

32
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,916
- KOUHEI.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,416
YOU'RE MY BIG BROTHER, KOUHEI.

34
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,833
I REMEMBER ALL OF IT.
LIKE IT JUST HAPPENED.

35
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,625
MY BIG BROTHER.

36
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,458
THAT WAS OUR FIRST KISS.

37
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,875
AND NOW IT'S ALL
GONNA BE OVER, BIG BROTHER.

38
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,875
I WANTED TO STAY
WITH YOU FOREVER,

39
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,375
EVEN IF YOU WERE A BAD SLAVE.

40
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,125
AND NOW I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER GET TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

41
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,500
- ( sobbing )

42
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,875
- YOU'RE AFRAID OF ME.
I UNDERSTAND.

43
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,416
BUT DON'T WORRY,
IT'LL BE OVER SOON.

44
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,916
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,083
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID
OF ME... ANYMORE.

46
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,291
- ( puffing and panting )

47
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,000
- HAZUKI LEFT BECAUSE OF ME.
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

48
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:34,291
- DON'T SHOULDER THIS ALONE,
HIKARU. WE'RE ALL TO BLAME.

49
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,458
HAZUKI LEFT TO SAVE
THE ENTIRE MIDO CLAN.

50
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,791
- ( sobbing )

51
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:44,500
- PLEASE COME BACK, MASTER!
MASTER, COME BACK!

52
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,791
- I'M GOING.
WE HAVE TO RESCUE HER.

53
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,791
- HIKARU.

54
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,041
I TOLD YOU, WE PROMISED

55
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,375
WE WOULDN'T TRY TO FOLLOW
HER WHEN SHE LEFT.

56
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,625
I GAVE MY WORD.

57
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,125
- BUT STILL!

58
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,500
- I WOULD FOLLOW HER IF I
THOUGHT IT WOULD DO ANY GOOD.

59
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,666
IT WON'T.

60
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,375
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO BEAT THEM WITH.

61
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,500
NOTHING BUT KOUHEI'S JAGAN, AND
HE HASN'T MASTERED IT.

62
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,208
- KOHARU'S WORKING ON THAT.

63
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,375
SHE'S DOING ALL SHE
CAN TO HELP HIM.

64
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,791
BUT SO FAR IT
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING.

65
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,958
- TELL ME.

66
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,875
WHY DID YOU COME BACK
TO THE CASTLE?

67
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,583
- WELL, IT DEFINITELY WASN'T
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE HERE.

68
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,666
I HAD TO COME.

69
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,750
I CAME. TO SAVE THE
PEOPLE THAT I LOVE.

70
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,375
BUT I GUESS YOU
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

71
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,916
- NO, I WOULDN'T.
I HATE YOU, LUNA.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,791
- AND THAT'S WHY.
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO LOVED.

73
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:58,083
YOU'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE WAY TOO SPOILED.

74
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,916
DADDY LOVES YOU BEST.
HE ALWAYS HAS.

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,958
- REALLY. IF HE
LOVES ME SO MUCH,

76
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,750
WHY'S HE WANT ME LOCKED
UP IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

77
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:11,041
I LOVE PEOPLE, SURE.
BUT THEY DON'T LOVE ME BACK.

78
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,791
- KOUHEI LOVES YOU VERY MUCH
AND YOU KNOW IT.

79
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,166
I WANTED HIM TO BE MINE.

80
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,541
BUT OF COURSE YOU HAD TO
MAKE HIM YOUR SLAVE FIRST.

81
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,250
THAT'S HOW IT IS.
YOU GET EVERYTHING I WANT.

82
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,916
AND THAT'S WHY I DECIDED
TO KILL ALL OF THEM.

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,083
SINCE I CAN'T KILL YOU, I
THOUGHT THAT COULD ENTERTAIN ME.

84
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,958
I KNEW IF I KILLED KOUHEI
AND YOUR FRIENDS,

85
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,500
IT WOULD MAKE YOU SAD.

86
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,666
I THOUGHT I'D ENJOY THAT.
SOUNDED FUN.

87
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,625
- SHE REMINDS ME...

88
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:48,000
REMINDS ME OF HOW I USED TO BE.
TRAPPED IN THE CASTLE, ALONE.

89
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,500
I WAS SO MUCH LIKE HER
UNTIL KOUHEI CAME ALONG

90
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,666
AND CHANGED ALL THAT.

91
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,875
I THINK I UNDERSTAND NOW.

92
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,291
YOU'RE ALONE.
I REMEMBER HOW THAT FEELS.

93
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,541
IT'S HARD BEING LONELY.

94
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:07,958
- I'M NOT LONELY.
I'M NOT ALONE! I HAVE VARGAS.

95
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,541
I'LL ALWAYS HAVE MY FRIEND
RIGHT HERE BESIDE ME.

96
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,583
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
ABOUT TO BE ALONE FOREVER, LUNA.

97
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,250
- IT LOOKS LIKE
THE CASTLE'S DISAPPEARING.

98
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,250
- WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO IT, MASTER?

99
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,333
- THE MAGIC BARRIER IS
PERMANENTLY SEALING,

100
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,166
SO NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER.

101
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,250
- PERMANENTLY?

102
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,041
WHY ARE WE JUST STANDING
HERE? DON'T YOU GET IT?

103
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,041
IF WE JUST LET HAZUKI
DISAPPEAR WITH THE CASTLE,

104
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,541
EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE,

105
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,541
EVERYTHING KOUHEI'S DONE,
WAS JUST A BIG WASTE OF TIME!

106
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,666
I'M GOING!

107
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,416
YOU CAN ALL STAY HERE.

108
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,625
- I WANNA HELP TOO.
I'LL COME.

109
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:01,541
- STAY HERE. KOUHEI NEEDS
YOUR HELP, REMEMBER?

110
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,833
STAY WITH HIM.
HE IS YOUR FIANCEE, RIGHT?

111
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,583
- RIGHT.

112
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,833
- MASTER, I'M COMING! I DON'T
CARE IF I'M BREAKING MY PROMISE!

113
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,916
- PLEASE FORGIVE US ALL, HAZUKI.

114
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,125
- WAIT!

115
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,583
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THE TWO OF US HAVE TO DO.

116
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:42,208
I SUMMON THE ELEMENTS! FIRE!
WATER! WOOD! METAL! EARTH!

117
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,333
WE HAVE TO KEEP
THE BARRIER OPEN.

118
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,750
AT LEAST UNTIL
KOUHEI'S READY.

119
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,458
- LET'S HOPE HE'S READY SOON.
THIS WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER!

120
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:14,083
- SO, THE SISTER AND HER
CLOWN ARE STILL HERE.

121
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,750
- ( crashes )

122
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,375
PRINCESS ARTE.

123
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,833
IT'S TIME FOR BIG SIS
TO FINALLY RETURN TO HERSELF.

124
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,666
HOPE YOU ENJOYED
THE SABBATICAL, MISTRESS LUNA.

125
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,375
THIS IS A GROWN-UP TASK,
ASSIGNED ONLY TO ME.

126
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,875
I WANT THE TWO OF YOU TO LEAVE.

127
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,125
- NO.

128
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,916
I'M STAYING.
I WANT TO SEE LUNA CHANGE.

129
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,625
- IF YOU INSIST.
WHO AM I TO ARGUE WITH ROYALTY?

130
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,000
- YOU HAD BETTER
KEEP YOUR PROMISE!

131
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,500
YOU SWORE YOU'D NEVER GO AFTER
THEM AGAIN IF I DID THIS.

132
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,041
KOUHEI OR ANY OF THE REST!

133
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,583
- OF COURSE, MISTRESS.

134
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,958
IF YOU'D COME BACK
WILLINGLY WHEN I ASKED,

135
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,250
WE COULD'VE AVOIDED
THAT LAST LITTLE ROW.

136
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,541
- OH, REALLY? WELL IF
YOU'D JUST LEFT ME ALONE

137
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,166
AND NOT COME AFTER ME, THEN
NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

138
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,625
AND I'D BE WITH THEM NOW

139
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,000
INSTEAD OF BACK IN THIS
STUPID CASTLE WITH YOU!

140
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,791
- AND IF YOU HAD STAYED WHERE
YOU BELONGED IN THE FIRST PLACE,

141
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,083
INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY WITH
THAT BOY AND MURDERING KINKEL,

142
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,000
I WOULDN'T HAVE
HAD TO CHASE YOU.

143
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,666
BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL WATER
UNDER THE BRIDGE NOW.

144
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,791
- ( he sniggers )

145
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,958
- I CALL YOU, MASTER!
SHOW US YOUR POWER!

146
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,000
- GOOD-BYE, KOUHEI.

147
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,791
TIME TO GO.

148
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,250
- GOOD-BYE, KOUHEI.

149
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,291
- ISN'T THIS GREAT?

150
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,583
HAZUKI'S GOING AWAY.

151
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,000
YOU'LL FINALLY BE FREE.

152
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,833
YOU WON'T HAVE TO BE
AFRAID ANYMORE.

153
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,791
ISN'T THAT GOOD?

154
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,958
- I... I DON'T KNOW.

155
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,250
- ( she screams )

156
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,208
- ARE WE FIGHTING FOR NOTHING?

157
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,916
WITHOUT KOUHEI'S POWER,
IT'S POINTLESS!

158
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,000
- EVEN WITHOUT A FULL MOON,

159
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,416
THIS PENDANT HAS THE POWER TO

160
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,458
TRANSFORM YOU BACK
INTO MISTRESS LUNA.

161
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,791
ANY PHASE OF THE MOON
WILL SUFFICE.

162
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,208
ONCE AROUND YOUR NECK,

163
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,250
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO
REMOVE IT WITH YOUR OWN HANDS.

164
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,125
YOU'LL BE LUNA FOREVER.

165
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,833
- I KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

166
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,958
EVENTUALLY, I'LL LEARN
NOT TO MIND BEING LUNA AGAIN.

167
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,833
AND MAYBE THEN, WE CAN ACTUALLY
GET ALONG TOGETHER AS FRIENDS.

168
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,875
OR EVEN AS SISTERS, Y'KNOW?

169
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,958
- AS SISTERS?

170
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,000
- YEAH.

171
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,791
BECAUSE THEN,
I'LL BE JUST LIKE YOU.

172
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,125
- THANK YOU, ALL OF YOU,
FOR EVERYTHING.

173
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,708
I'M SO SORRY, KOUHEI.

174
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:06,458
- Hiraku: HAZUKI!
- Haiji: MASTER! WE'RE HERE!

175
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,291
- HIKARU! HAIJI!
MASTER YAYOI!

176
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,458
- WHAT... WHAT'S GOING ON?

177
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,166
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WE CAME TO RESCUE YOU!

178
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,666
- YOU CAME FOR ME?

179
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,083
- SURE, OF COURSE WE DID!

180
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,875
AND YOU'D BETTER
APPRECIATE IT!

181
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,833
WE'VE PUT UP WITH A LOT JUST
TO GET IN HERE, SUCKER-HEAD!

182
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,750
- I'M SURE YOU DID. BUT THEN
WHAT THE HECK'S THE POINT OF ME

183
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,541
COMING ALL THE WAY BACK HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE, DORK MAIDEN?

184
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,333
- OH, STOP WHINING,
MONSTER GIRL.

185
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,125
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT ANYWAY
FOR JUST RUNNING OFF LIKE THAT.

186
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,375
YOU LEFT KOUHEI ALL ALONE.

187
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,125
- I HAD TO.

188
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,708
THE OTHERS MAY HAVE PROMISED NOT
TO FOLLOW YOU, BUT I NEVER DID!

189
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,750
AND BESIDES, YOU
KNOW KOUHEI WOULD

190
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,875
DO THE SAME THING
PROMISE OR NOT!

191
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,750
- LET'S GET GOING.

192
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,708
- OKAY!

193
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,791
- HOW 'BOUT YOU COME WITH US.

194
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,958
- I DON'T THINK SO!

195
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,083
- ( she screams )

196
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,458
- I'M THE KEEPER OF THIS CASTLE
NOW.

197
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:38,166
AND I WON'T LET ANYONE
TAKE YOU AGAIN.

198
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,125
- LET ME GO, YOU JERK!
THIS WASN'T PART OF THE DEAL!

199
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,250
YOU PROMISED YOU'D LEAVE THEM
ALONE IF I CAME BACK!

200
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,208
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I DID!

201
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,208
- THEY BROKE THE DEAL FIRST
BY COMING AFTER YOU.

202
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,125
NOW IT'S OPEN SEASON,

203
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,583
AND A PERFECT CHANCE
TO GET RID OF THEM FOR GOOD.

204
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,500
- YOU CAN'T TURN ME INTO
LUNA NOW, THERE'S NO POINT!

205
00:15:56,583 --> 00:16:01,833
KOUHEI. HELP ME. KOUHEI!

206
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,583
- WHY AM I JUST SITTING HERE
DOING NOTHING BUT BEING SCARED?

207
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,916
HELPING HAZUKI WAS THE REASON

208
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,791
I GOT THIS POWER IN
THE FIRST PLACE!

209
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,791
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
AT LEAST TRY TO SAVE HER.

210
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,666
- NOW, KOUHEI.

211
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,333
- NOW. PLEASE, KOUHEI.

212
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,541
- GRANDMOTHER? GRANDMOTHER!

213
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,000
- ( he screams)

214
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,125
- I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
THIS PLACE.

215
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,500
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE IT.

216
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:53,958
- HAZUKI.

217
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,791
HAZUKI!

218
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,083
- DAMN YOU, JEDA!

219
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,125
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE
PRINCESS IS STILL HERE!

220
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,708
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, VARGAS?

221
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,916
- PRINCESS, I'M SORRY.

222
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,500
- NO. VARGAS.

223
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,791
- COME WITH US!

224
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,416
RUN. NOW!

225
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,333
- CHILD'S PLAY.

226
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,875
- YEAH, YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT!

227
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,083
- YOU LUNA, THE DAY WALKER,
ARE ALL THAT MATTERS.

228
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,458
ARTE AND VARGAS WERE
SIDESHOWS JUST LIKE THE REST.

229
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:40,291
NOW IT'S TIME TO CLEAN HOUSE.

230
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,875
I FIGURED THIS ONE
MIGHT STILL BE USEFUL.

231
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,750
SO I BROUGHT HIM ALONG.

232
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,541
- IT'S SEIJI.
STILL IN A TRANCE.

233
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,625
- HIKARU, LOOK OUT!

234
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,958
- SEIJI! YOU'VE COME BACK!

235
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,250
- LIGHTING STRIKE!

236
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:20,916
- BROKE FREE OF MY SPELL.
MUST BE STRONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

237
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,833
OH, WELL, THE PUPPETRY
WAS JUST FOR FUN.

238
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,125
I'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM
KILLING THEM ALL MYSELF.

239
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,833
- EVERYONE'S RISKING
THEIR LIVES FOR ME.

240
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,000
BUT I DIDN'T WANT THIS.
NOT AGAIN.

241
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,666
KOUHEI!

242
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,083
- Kouhei: YOU CALLED?

243
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,458
- KOHEI. YOU'RE HERE.

244
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:21,291
- WHAT? BUT NO, IT'S TOO LATE.
SHE HAS THE NECKLACE NOW.

245
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,250
ANY MOMENT SHE'LL BECOME
MISTRESS LUNA AGAIN.

246
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:28,458
YOU CAN'T STOP IT, YOU HUMAN
WASTE. IT'S HER DESTINY!

247
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,500
- WELL, THAT'S A DESTINY
I'LL JUST HAVE TO CHANGE.

248
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,750
- ( he yells )

249
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,916
- SO THIS IS JAGAN?

250
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,750
- ( she screams )

251
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,208
- SORRY FOR THE WAIT, HAZ.

252
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:59,583
- YOU REALLY DID COME.
OH, KOUHEI!

253
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,583
KOUHEI, I THOUGHT
I'D LOST YOU FOR GOOD.

254
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,291
YOU MEAN YOU AREN'T
SCARED ANYMORE?

255
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,416
- WHO, ME?

256
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,333
NAH.

257
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,916
- I'M SO GLAD.

258
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,625
I'M NOT CRYING, OKAY? I'M NOT
CRYING EVEN A LITTLE BIT!

259
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,791
OF COURSE YOU SHOULD'VE COME
SOONER, YOU'RE MY SLAVE.

260
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,416
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG ANYHOW,
YOU BIG DOPE?

261
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,125
- I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT, HAZ.
I SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE FOR YA.

262
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,083
TAKE SOME BLOOD.
WE'LL CALL IT EVEN, OKAY?

263
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,041
- NO! YOU CAN'T!

264
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,541
- IT'S OVER NOW.

265
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,958
- ( he yells )

266
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,416
- HUMAN WASTE!

267
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,958
- ( theme song playing )

268
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

269
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,375
- NOW HERE'S A REALLY HARD
RIDDLE FOR YOU, BIG BROTHER!

270
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,166
WHO IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON
IN THE WHOLE WORLD TO ME?

271
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,875
IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME
TO FIGURE THIS OUT,

272
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,916
BUT I THINK I'VE
FINALLY GOT IT.

273
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,125
FULL, FULL, FULL MOON! OH, COME
ON, DON'T MAKE ME SAY IT,

274
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,458
THAT'S JUST MEAN.

275
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,666
A LADY SHOULD NEVER HAVE
TO EXPLAIN HERSELF, OKAY?

276
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,791
SERIOUSLY, DON'T BE SO DENSE!

277
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,875
NEXT TIME ON MOONPHASE:
"THEY SAY IT'S THE END!"

278
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,541
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY, RIGHT?

279
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,250
I MEAN, WON'T YOU
ALWAYS BE MY SLAVE?
