1
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,166
- ( car honking )

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,500
- Woman: ALL RIGHT.
THAT SOUNDS FINE.

3
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,750
YOU'LL GET IN TOUCH
WITH THEM TOMORROW, THEN?

4
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,500
GOOD. JUST LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU DECIDE.

5
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,333
TALK TO YOU THEN. BYE.

6
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,291
( gasps )

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,958
EXCUSE ME.

8
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,291
- OF COURSE.

9
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,333
- THIS WAY, MASTER. FOLLOW ME.

10
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,958
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

11
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,541
- ( theme song playing )

12
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,166
- Ryuuhei: SO THIS CAT LED YOU
TO YOUR MOTHER, EH?

14
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,958
AND YOU SAY SHE SPOKE TO YOU.

15
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,333
- UH-HUH.

16
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,791
- YEAH, BUT ACTUALLY, I THINK
IT WAS MORE LIKE HER MOTHER'S

17
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,875
SPIRIT OR HER MEMORIES.

18
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,458
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,
I JUST KNOW I SAW HER,

19
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,125
AND SHE PROMISED
SHE'D COME FIND ME.

20
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,375
- THAT COULD TAKE A WHILE.

21
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,000
IN THE MEANTIME I ASSUME
YOU'LL BE STAYING HERE.

22
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,625
- I GUESS WE REALLY DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE THERE, HUH?

23
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,875
HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT DO YA, GRANDPA?

24
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,208
- IT CAN'T BE!

25
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,291
- GRAMPA, WHAT IS IT?

26
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,666
- IT CAN'T BE!

27
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,083
- GRAMPA, WHAT IS IT?

28
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,458
- IT CAN'T BE!

29
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,166
- GRAMPA, WHAT IS IT?

30
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,833
- THIS CAT HAS NO RECTUM!

31
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,125
- DO YOU THINK A SPIRITUAL
MESSENGER NEEDS ONE?

32
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,625
- WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU LOOKING
AT THE CAT'S BUTT FOR ANYWAY,

33
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,250
YOU PERVERTED OLD GEEZER!

34
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,250
- I AM A MAN OF SCIENCE,
AS WELL AS SORCERY.

35
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,041
- DO YOU MIND IF I STAY?

36
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,375
- YOU MAY STAY HERE
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE, HAZUKI.

37
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,041
- THANK YOU.

38
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,250
- HOWEVER, EVERYONE PULLS
THEIR OWN WEIGHT AROUND HERE,

39
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,125
SO YOU'LL DO YOUR
SHARE OF THE WORK.

40
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,583
THAT INCLUDES COOKING, CLEANING,
AND TENDING TO THE STORE.

41
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,000
THAT SOUND FAIR?

42
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,250
- YES! I'LL WORK REALLY HARD,
GRANDFATHER, I PROMISE.

43
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,291
- JUST ONE MORE CONDITION,

44
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,666
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE
OURSELVES A DEAL.

45
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,708
- YES?

46
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,833
- I'D LIKE YOU TO WEAR
THE NEKO MIMI.

47
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,666
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

48
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,458
- AW. THEY'RE JUST SO CUTE.

49
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,583
- ( Hazuki giggling )

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,708
- THIS IS SUCH A NOISY CITY.

51
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,083
MISTRESS LUNA WILL WAKE
WHEN THE FULL MOON COMES.

52
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,000
I CAN WAIT UNTIL THEN.

53
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,333
YOU MAY GO NOW.

54
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,708
- THANK YOU, MASTER.

55
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,541
- COME NOW, LITTLE ONE.

56
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,166
AWAKEN, AND JOIN ME.

57
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,916
- GRANDFATHER!

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,375
I'M FINISHED CLEANING THE STORE
NOW, SO AM I DONE FOR THE NIGHT?

59
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,708
( gasps )

60
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,208
- AH. GOOD WORK. THANK YOU.

61
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,666
- NO PROBLEM.

62
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,083
- HOW 'BOUT IT, GIRL?
WANNA JOIN ME? IT FEELS GOOD.

63
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,208
- UH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

64
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,166
- POOR GIRL'S RUNNING
HERSELF RAGGED.

65
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,666
I BET SHE'D APPRECIATE
IT IF SOMEONE ELSE

66
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,083
MADE THE DINNER TONIGHT.

67
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,208
- ( Hazuki exhales )

68
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,875
- WHAT IS IT, HAZUKI?

69
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,750
- UH, NOTHING.

70
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,875
- WELL, IT CAN'T BE NOTHING.

71
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,000
LOOK AT YOU, YOUR
FACE IS BRIGHT RED.

72
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,125
- I SAID IT WAS NOTHING!
LEAVE ME ALONE!

73
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,708
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
YELLING AT ME FOR?

74
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,083
- I'M NOT YELLING, YOU JERK!

75
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,750
- THEN WHAT DO YOU
CALL THAT, BRAT?

76
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,958
- DON'T CALL ME A...

77
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,708
- ( bubbling )

78
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,916
- THAT'S GONNA OVERFLOW!
- WHAT? AH, CRAP!

79
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,750
OW! AH! THAT'S HOT!

80
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,750
- OF COURSE IT'S HOT.
IT'S BOILING!

81
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,541
- GIMME A BREAK,
I'M INJURED HERE.

82
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,708
- OH, HELLO THERE, HAIJI.

83
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,708
- IT BETTER NOT STEAL ANY FOOD.

84
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,500
- DON'T WORRY.
HAIJI'S NOT LIKE YOU.

85
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,166
- WELL, AT LEAST
I HAVE A BUTT HOLE.

86
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,875
- ( Haiji snarls )

87
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,208
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, HAIJI?

88
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,541
( gasps )

89
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,416
HEY, HAVEN'T YOU PUT
THE SEAWEED IN YET?

90
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,333
- UH-UH. FIGURED
I'D ADD IT IN LATER.

91
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,125
- IT'S MISO SOUP. YOU HAVE
TO COOK THE INGREDIENTS!

92
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,750
JUST LET ME DO IT!

93
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,833
- HEY!

94
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,333
- WHY DON'T YOU GO
PRACTICE SPITTING OR

95
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,666
SOMETHING MANLY LIKE THAT?

96
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,500
- DON'T ADD THAT YET!
- WHY NOT?

97
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,791
- BECAUSE THE POT'S NOT
BOILING ANYMORE, DUMMY!

98
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,000
- TOO BAD. I'M ADDING IT.

99
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,041
- NO, COME ON, WAIT!

100
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,583
- SORRY. MY HAND SLIPPED.

101
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,166
- ONE OF THESE DAYS MY HAND'S
- AH, THEY'RE GETTING ALONG.

102
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,916
- GONNA SLIP AND YOU'RE GONNA
GET THE SPANKING OF YOUR LIFE.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,666
- YOU WOULDN'T DARE,
YOU BIG BULLY!

104
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,750
- WELL, HELLO THERE, HAIJI.
FEELING NEGLECTED?

105
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,208
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
WITH YOU, MY CURIOUS FRIEND? HM?

106
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,500
- Hazuki: DINNER'S READY,
GRANDFATHER!

107
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,166
- Ryuuhei: AH! WONDERFUL!

108
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,916
- Kouhei: I WOULDN'T SAY THAT
UNTIL YOU TRY IT.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,583
- ( clanging )
- ( Kouhei exclaims )

110
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,875
- Hazuki: IGNORE HIM. LET'S EAT!
HERE YOU GO, GRANDFATHER.

111
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,333
- ( all speaking in Japanese )

112
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,916
- Ryuuhei: YUCK.

113
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,875
- ( yawning )

114
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,083
- ( mewing )

115
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,666
- SORRY, FUR BALL.

116
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,958
SHE WON'T BE COMING OUT OF
THERE UNTIL THE SUN GOES DOWN.

117
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,041
MORE LIKE SHE CAN'T
COME OUT, ACTUALLY.

118
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,666
- OKAY, I'M BACK. SORRY.

119
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,416
- AW, MAN, THEY CAN'T
USE ANY OF 'EM?

120
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,625
- I AM AFRAID NOT.

121
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,250
THEY WERE PRETTY VOCAL
ABOUT IT, ACTUALLY.

122
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,583
- SORRY I MESSED THINGS UP.

123
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,666
I KNOW YOU WENT OUT
ON A LIMB FOR ME, HIROMI.

124
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,625
- I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT
I JUST WANNA FIND YOU SOME WORK.

125
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,875
OKAY, HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

126
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,916
YOU HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE
GIFT FOR PHOTOGRAPHY,

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,416
BUT YOU CAN'T SEEM
TO TAKE PICTURES

128
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,541
WITHOUT SOMETHING
PARANORMAL POPPING UP.

129
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,916
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WORK
WITH OUR MAGAZINE

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,583
TO KEEP YOU IN BLUE JEANS
AND CANDY BARS,

131
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,666
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE
PET-NET MAGAZINE

132
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,125
WOULD BE SAFE ENOUGH, BUT

133
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,791
IF ALL YOUR DOGS HAVE SPIRITS
HANGING OVER THEM, WELL,

134
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,041
IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT THEIR
SUBSCRIBERS WANNA SEE.

135
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,583
- SO BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING
THAT I'M UNEMPLOYABLE

136
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,125
AS A PHOTOGRAPHER, RIGHT?

137
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,666
- YUP. SORRY, COOKIE, BUT THAT'S
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

138
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,708
- ( sighs )

139
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,666
- HOWEVER, I DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD LET THAT STOP YOU.

140
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,875
YOU'VE BEEN A PHOTOGRAPHER
SINCE WE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

141
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,458
IT'S WHO YOU ARE.

142
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,166
AND I'VE ALWAYS ENVIED YOU FOR
THAT SINGLE MINDED PASSION.

143
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,291
DON'T LET A LITTLE THING LIKE
EATING GET IN THE WAY NOW.

144
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,541
- THANKS, 'ROMI.

145
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,708
- OH, IT'S PURELY SELFISH,
WITHOUT YOUR CAMERA IN THE WAY

146
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,791
I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR FACE.

147
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,666
- YOU MEAN MY BEAUTIFULLY
SCULPTED FACE?

148
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,291
- SPEAKING OF FACES, YOU HAVE
SOME NEW FODDER FOR YOUR CAMERA.

149
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,750
-HUH?

150
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,750
- YOU KNOW. YOUR LITTLE
GIRLFRIEND FROM GERMANY.

151
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,625
- WHO, HAZUKI?

152
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,875
YEAH RIGHT, WHY WOULD I WANNA

153
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,583
TAKE PICTURES OF
THAT LITTLE BRAT?

154
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,375
WHOA.

155
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,291
- WHAT? DID YOU SEE SOMETHING?

156
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,541
- I... NEVER MIND.

157
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,250
GUESS THE REJECTION JUST
HIT ME HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

158
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,791
MY MIND'S PLAYING
TRICKS ON ME.

159
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,291
- Elfriede: KOUHEI MORIOKA.

160
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,750
- ( yawning )

161
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,916
I FEEL ALL WEIRD.

162
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,041
MAYBE I'M SICK.

163
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,625
I DON'T FEEL SICK.

164
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
HEY! GET UP, MR. LAZY!

165
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,666
- AW, COME ON!

166
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,791
- THE SUN WENT DOWN FOREVER AGO.

167
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,958
YOU HAVE TO GET UP AND EAT NOW
SO I CAN START CLEANING.

168
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,208
- I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
SORTING THROUGH NEGATIVES.

169
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,791
I JUST GOT TO BED, HAZUKI.

170
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,166
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING THAT FOR?

171
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,583
- ISN'T IT CUTE?
GRANDFATHER GAVE IT TO ME.

172
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,500
HE MADE IT HIMSELF.

173
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,791
- COMPLETE WITH CAT EARS I SEE.

174
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,666
- SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I THINK THE NEKO MIMI ARE CUTE.

175
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,750
- YEAH, CUTE IN A
HUMILIATING WAY.

176
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,875
- I HAVE TO GET BACK

177
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,416
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
WATCHING THE STORE.

178
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,791
WHEN YOU'RE DONE EATING,
CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF.

179
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,875
- RIGHT. SURE THING.

180
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,583
AH, YEAH. THAT'S NICE.

181
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,166
- WHAT PART OF THAT
DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

182
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,250
- SO, IT'S ANOTHER BIG
CROWD TONIGHT, HUH?

183
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,083
- WE'RE DOING OKAY.

184
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,125
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

185
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,833
JUST LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

186
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,375
- EXCUSE ME...

187
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,791
- CAN I HELP YOU?

188
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,833
- COULD YOU UH, TELL ME HOW MUCH
YOU'RE ASKING FOR THIS?

189
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,125
- AH. A GOOD CHOICE!

190
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,958
- YOU CERTAINLY HAVE EXCELLENT
TASTE IN POTTERY.

191
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,250
- I DO? I MEAN, THANK YOU.
SO DO YOU.

192
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,291
- ( giggles )

193
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,250
- I'LL TAKE IT!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

194
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,083
- OH, NO, NO, THANK YOU, SIR!

195
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,458
BUT OF COURSE THIS CUP IS
GONNA BE SO LONELY ON ITS OWN.

196
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,500
YOU SEE,

197
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,833
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY CLOSE
TO THIS LITTLE ONE RIGHT HERE.

198
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,500
I'LL BE SO SAD
WHEN THEY'RE SEPARATED.

199
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,125
- LET ME TAKE BOTH OF THEM THEN.

200
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,583
- DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT?
OH, I'M SO HAPPY.

201
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,125
- I'LL TAKE THIS ONE!
- I WANT ONE, TOO!

202
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,333
- ( all chattering )

203
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,416
- THANK YOU!

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,250
- MAN, HOW DOES SHE DO IT?

205
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,291
- USING CHARM.
IT'S ANOTHER FORM OF THE JAGAN.

206
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,750
- SHE'S USING JAGAN?

207
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,541
- YES. ALTHOUGH,
I DOUBT IF SHE REALIZES IT YET.

208
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,041
- CHARM, HUH?

209
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,166
WHATEVER IT'S CALLED,

210
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,875
IT'S DEPRESSING
WATCHING A LITTLE GIRL

211
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,958
WRAP GROWN MEN AROUND
HER FINGERS LIKE THAT.

212
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,333
- OH, IS THAT SO?

213
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,500
SHE'S GOT YOU WRAPPED
PRETTY TIGHTLY, DOESN'T SHE?

214
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,208
- NO SHE DOESN'T!
I'M IMMUNE!

215
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,333
I THINK.

216
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,666
- Hazuki: THANK YOU.
COME AGAIN SOON.

217
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,083
( yawns )

218
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:12,291
A GOOD NIGHT'S WORK, I'D SAY.
NOW IT'S TIME TO CLEAN UP.

219
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,708
- ( wind howling )

220
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,291
- A FULL MOON.

221
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,666
- ( chuckles )

222
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,708
- Kouhei: IT'S ALREADY BEEN
A MONTH, THEN.

223
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,375
- KOUHEI.

224
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,041
- HI. UH, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING IN HERE?

225
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,958
- IT'S A FULL MOON.

226
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,791
MY MIND GOT ALL FUZZY
AND MY TEETH ARE ACHING.

227
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,125
I FEEL SO THIRSTY, KOUHEI.

228
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,625
IT'S TIME TO FULFILL
YOUR ROLE AS MY SLAVE.

229
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,875
- HEY!

230
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,541
- ( screaming )

231
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,541
OW, OW, OW! THAT REALLY
HURT MY HEAD, YOU MEANIE!

232
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,833
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

233
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,500
- I'M THE ONE WHO
SHOULD BE ASKING THAT!

234
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,708
YOU THINK I'M JUST GONNA SIT
THERE WHILE YOU SUCK MY BLOOD?

235
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,875
- YOU'RE MY SLAVE, DUMMY!
THAT'S YOUR JOB!

236
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,791
- QUIT CALLING ME YOUR SLAVE!
I AM NOT YOUR SLAVE!

237
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,416
YOU JUST KEEP THINKING
THAT I AM!

238
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,833
- YEAH! THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE!
- NO I'M NOT, GET AWAY FROM ME!

239
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,833
- COME HERE! COME HERE, SLAVE!
- NO! STOP CALLING ME THAT,

240
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,208
YOU LUNATIC!

241
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,958
- SLAVE! GET OVER HERE!
SLAVE, SLAVE, SLAVE, SLAVE!

242
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,666
- STOP! STOP IT! STOP IT!
NO SCRATCHING! STOP IT!

243
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,166
YOU'RE FREAKING NUTS!

244
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,083
- ( panting )

245
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,541
IF THAT'S HOW YOU'RE
GONNA BE, THEN FINE!

246
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,833
I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T RELY
ON YOU ANYWAY!

247
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,500
I'LL JUST FIND MYSELF A NEW
SLAVE WHO ISN'T STUPID!

248
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,250
- FINE! GO FIND YOURSELF
A NEW SLAVE.

249
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,916
IT'S NOT LIKE I FREAKING CARE.

250
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,708
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
A "NEW SLAVE"?

251
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,708
- EXCUSE ME, SIR?

252
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,625
COULD YOU HELP ME, PLEASE?

253
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,333
- UH, YEAH. SURE, I CAN HELP.

254
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,250
- I DROPPED
SOMETHING OVER THERE,

255
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,208
BUT IT'S SO DARK I CAN'T
SEE ANYTHING.

256
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,208
AND I NEED SOMEBODY
TO HELP ME LOOK FOR IT.

257
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,375
- OH YEAH, I'LL HELP YOU OUT,
KID. I GOT REAL GOOD EYES.

258
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,541
- THANK YOU, SIR.

259
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,041
- Kouhei: HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

260
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,333
- WHO THE HELL ARE...

261
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,500
- KOUHEI!

262
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,208
- HEY, MAN, I'M SORRY. IS MY
LITTLE SISTER BOTHERING YOU?

263
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,958
SHE ACTS A LITTLE
STRANGE SOMETIMES.

264
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,166
- HEY, WHAT'S YOUR
PROBLEM, PUNK?

265
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,666
- OH, YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I JUST COULDN'T STOP, YOU KNOW?

266
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,041
- UH-HUH. WELL, ME EITHER!

267
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,958
- ( both grunting )

268
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,791
- HEY, PUT ME DOWN, KOUHEI!

269
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,083
- SORRY AGAIN, PAL, I FEEL
TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS.

270
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,916
HOPE YOU DON'T CATCH
PNEUMONIA OR ANYTHING!

271
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,125
- LET ME GO. LET ME GO,
YOU STUPID PARTY-POOPER!

272
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,375
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

273
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,833
- YOU KNOW WHAT MY PROBLEM IS!

274
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,208
- YOU WON'T LET ME KISS YOU
SO I GO FIND SOMEONE ELSE,

275
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,458
AND NOW YOU WON'T
LET ME KISS HIM?

276
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,583
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

277
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,791
LET YOU STROLL AROUND

278
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,958
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
NIGHT LOOKING LIKE THAT?

279
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,583
I MEAN, YOU'RE DRESSED
LIKE A FREAKING...

280
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,416
- I'M DRESSED LIKE A
PERSON WHO CAN DRESS

281
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,333
HOWEVER SHE WANTS
WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION!

282
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,416
- MAN, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TONIGHT?

283
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,916
YOU HAVEN'T HAD A
SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD

284
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
SINCE YOU GOT HERE AND YOU'VE
BEEN DOING JUST FINE.

285
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,291
WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT NOW?

286
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,083
- THE MOON IS FULL, STUPID!

287
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,750
VAMPIRES CRAVE BLOOD WHENEVER
THERE'S A FULL MOON.

288
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,291
THAT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE!
DON'T YOU READ?

289
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,041
- PLENTY, BUT I NEVER READ THAT.

290
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,583
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE THICK-HEADED.

291
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,958
- BEING THICK-HEADED
HAS NOTHING TO DO IT!

292
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,125
- DRINKING WHEN YOU'RE THIRSTY

293
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,333
IS ONE OF THE MOST BASIC
ANIMAL INSTINCTS.

294
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,666
WHEN YOU'RE THIRSTY YOU DRINK.
AND I'M THIRSTY FOR BLOOD.

295
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,791
- WELL, CONTROL IT.
- I CAN'T.

296
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,125
- THEN DRINK THIS INSTEAD.

297
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,625
- WHAT IS THIS?

298
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,083
- IT'S A CAN OF TOMATO JUICE.

299
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,583
HEY WAIT. I WENT OUT OF MY
WAY TO GET YOU THAT JUICE!

300
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,083
- DON'T BE STUPID.

301
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,000
- YOU BETTER QUIT CALLING
ME STUPID, YOU LITTLE...

302
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,375
- THERE HE IS. THAT'S HIM.

303
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,916
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

304
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,041
- WHAT'S UP IS I'M GONNA TEAR
YOU INTO LITTLE PIECES, MAN.

305
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,000
- SHOULD WE RUN?

306
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,125
- GET OUT OF HERE.

307
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,250
NOW, HAZUKI!

308
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,625
- BUT, I...

309
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,750
- NO, BABY.
YOU STAY RIGHT THERE.

310
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,708
