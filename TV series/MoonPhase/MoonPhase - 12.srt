1
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,291
- YOU FEELING OKAY, GRAMPS?

2
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,833
- WE THOUGHT THE DOCTOR CLEARED
YOU TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL

3
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,833
- I'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF
TELLING YOU TWO,

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,708
BUT MY CONDITION IS MUCH MORE
SERIOUS THAN WE THOUGHT.

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,291
THE DOCTOR HAS TOLD ME

6
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,791
I'M GOING TO NEED TO
STAY HERE MUCH LONGER.

7
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:23,833
- I HOPE THIS "CONDITION"

8
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,458
DOESN'T INVOLVE
GIRLS IN WHITE HATS.

9
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,958
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU MEAN.

10
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,083
- COME ON, GRAMPS, DID
YOU REALLY HAVE TO MOVE

11
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,500
INTO A PRIVATE VIP SUITE?
THESE ROOMS ARE EXPENSIVE.

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,000
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO PAY FOR IT?

13
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,291
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
AUCTIONING THE HOUSE.

14
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,541
- DON'T WORRY, KOUHEI,

15
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,458
I HAD A LOVELY CHAT WITH
THE BILLING DEPARTMENT

16
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,500
AND I CONVINCED THEM TO
GIVE ME A SPECIAL RATE

17
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,708
WITH SOME HELP FROM MY
SECRET HYPNOSIS POTION.

18
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,416
( laughing )

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,666
- IT'S A GOOD THING YOU WEREN'T
MORE AMBITIOUS IN LIFE.

20
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,750
- ( theme song playing )

21
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

22
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,875
- Kouhei: ANY NEWS ON KINKEL?
- Seiji: NOTHING YET.

23
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,750
- ( sighs )

24
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,208
IF WE COULD JUST FIND ELFRIEDE,

25
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,375
WE'D BE AT LEAST ONE STEP
CLOSER TO FINDING THE COUNT.

26
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,250
- SHE'S THE HELPFUL
VAMPIRE, RIGHT?

27
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,375
- ( chuckling )

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,666
- ( knock on door )

29
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,125
- COME IN. THE DOOR'S OPEN.

30
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,041
OH. DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU.

31
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,041
TOO BAD YOU DIDN'T STOP
BY A LITTLE EARLIER.

32
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,583
YOU JUST MISSED
KOUHEI AND SEIJI.

33
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,958
I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
SEE THEM ON YOUR WAY UP.

34
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,291
YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE THEM A CALL
AND TELL THEM YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

35
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,791
THEY'RE PRETTY WORRIED.

36
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,916
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
REACH YOU THESE PAST FEW DAYS.

37
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,416
- THAT'S WEIRD. DOOR'S OPEN.
I COULD HAVE SWORN I LOCKED IT.

38
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,958
- YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE
SUCH CARELESS MISTAKES, KOUHEI.

39
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,916
WE'RE IN ENOUGH DANGER AS IT IS.

40
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,250
- HMPH!

41
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,666
DIDN'T ANYONE EVER TEACH YOU

42
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,583
IT'S RUDE TO BE LATE WHEN
YOU HAVE A GUEST?

43
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,791
- GUEST?
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID!

44
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,833
AND SINCE YOU'VE NO CONCEPT
OF TIME AND MASTER IS SLEEPING,

45
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,166
I'VE BEEN KEEPING HIM COMPANY.

46
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,541
- OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,000
HEY, HAVE YOU GONE INSANE?

48
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,000
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO

49
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,708
REVEAL YOURSELF
TO ANYONE BUT US!

50
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,750
( gasps )

51
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,791
- WELCOME BACK.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
- HEY! IT'S THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF!

53
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,125
WE'VE BEEN WORRYING
SICK ABOUT YOU, YOU KNOW THAT?

54
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,333
YOU COULD'VE AT LEAST
RETURNED OUR PHONE CALLS!

55
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,083
FOR ALL WE KNEW YOU
COULD HAVE BEEN INJURED

56
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,250
ON ONE OF YOUR
STORY ASSIGNMENTS.

57
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,000
EITHER THAT OR YOU
FINALLY CONVINCED HIROMI

58
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,083
TO RUN OFF WITH YOU
AND TIE THE KNOT.

59
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,708
- ARE YOU FINISHED?

60
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,083
- HEY, DON'T PRETEND LIKE
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ME!

61
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,041
- KOUHEI, NOT ONLY DO YOU
HAVE THE SOCIAL GRACES

62
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,625
OF A BARNYARD ANIMAL,

63
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,125
YOU'VE SHOWN YOURSELF TO BE MORE
DENSE THAN I THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

64
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,458
- WHAT?

65
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,208
- HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED
ANYTHING PECULIAR?

66
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,875
- HEY! HE'S WEARING
GRANDPA'S WORK ROBE!

67
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,333
I DON'T GET IT, WHY IS THE
EDITOR IN GRANDPA'S CLOTHES?

68
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,000
- DO I REALLY HAVE TO
SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU?

69
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,125
- NOW I SEE!
YOU HAVE GOT GRANDPA!

70
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,500
- WHY YES, I'M HAPPY TO
REPORT THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER

71
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,333
HAS BEEN IN MY MASTER'S
CUSTODY FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

72
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,916
( laughing )

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,708
- WHO'S HE TALKING ABOUT?
- MY GUESS IS COUNT KINKEL.

74
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,458
- UH-OH.

75
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:02,250
- IT SEEMS HE'S TURNED THIS
POOR MAN INTO ONE OF HIS SLAVES.

76
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,166
- SO DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIROMI?

77
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,291
- MOST LIKELY.

78
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,375
- MY MASTER SENT ME TO DELIVER

79
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,875
AN INVITATION FOR YOU
TO JOIN HIM AT HIS ESTATE.

80
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,500
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?

81
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,000
( laughing )

82
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,583
- ( lightning crashing )

83
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:24,000
- Kouhei: THAT'S THE HOUSE THAT
HAZUKI GREW UP IN, ISN'T IT?

84
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,458
- Editor: KOUHEI MORIOKA,
SEIJI MIDO,

85
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,500
AND THE CHILD ARE
INVITED TO ATTEND.

86
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,333
IN ADDITION, MY MASTER WISHES
TO EXTEND A WARNING.

87
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,541
SHOULD ANY OF YOU
CHOOSE TO DECLINE,

88
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,416
YOU WILL DO SO AT THE COST
OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S LIFE!

89
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,791
- HUH?

90
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,750
- ( laughing )

91
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,583
- FOR ALL WE KNOW GRANDPA'S
AT THE HOSPITAL

92
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,625
RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT HIM AND
THIS IS JUST SOME LOUSY TRAP!

93
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,375
- DOUBTFUL. KINKEL'S TOO STRONG
TO RELY ON EMPTY THREATS,

94
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,000
AND THAT MEANS
WE'RE IN REAL TROUBLE.

95
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,833
THE OTHER NIGHT, WHEN WE HAD TO
FACE THE COUNT AT THE HOTEL,

96
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,333
THE ONLY REASON
WE SUCCEEDED WAS

97
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,625
BECAUSE WE HAD GRANDFATHER
AND ELFRIEDE'S HELP.

98
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,875
BUT NOT THIS TIME.

99
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,875
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? WE HAVE YOU!

100
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,416
THAT'S GOT TO COUNT
FOR SOMETHING, RIGHT?

101
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,875
- AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME
TO ADMIT MY OWN SHORTCOMINGS,

102
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,750
THERE'S NO FEASIBLE WAY I COULD
DEFEAT A VAMPIRE LIKE KINKEL.

103
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,416
I KNOW IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU WANT TO HEAR

104
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,958
BUT GOING THERE
MEANS CERTAIN DEATH.

105
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,833
I'M SORRY. BUT THIS
JUST LOOKS HOPELESS.

106
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,291
- Hazuki: WELL
I'M GOING, ANYWAY.

107
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,791
I'LL GO ALONE IF I HAVE TO.

108
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:23,375
- YOU'RE AWAKE, MASTER.
- BUT YOU CAN'T GO!

109
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,666
- GRANDFATHER HAS ALWAYS
BEEN SO NICE TO ME,

110
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,333
EVEN WHEN I DIDN'T DESERVE IT.

111
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:31,458
HE'S SURE TREATED ME A HECK OF A
LOT BETTER THAN YOU TWO HAVE!

112
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,125
HE GAVE ME HAIJI, AND HE GAVE
ME THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT

113
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,291
WHEN NOBODY ELSE WOULD.

114
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,333
- MMM-HMM.

115
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,416
SO I'M GOING. AND I PROMISE,
KINKEL WILL PAY!

116
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,333
- THAT'S NOT VERY POLITE,
LITTLE GIRL.

117
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,333
MY MASTER WILL
HAVE TO PUNISH YOU.

118
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,458
( laughing )

119
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,708
- WHAT'S HE LAUGHING AT?

120
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,958
- JUDGING FROM HIS BEHAVIOR, THE
COUNT HAS PROBABLY ORDERED HIM

121
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,458
TO LAUGH HIMSELF TO DEATH AFTER
HE CARRIED OUT HIS MISSION,

122
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,041
BUT LUCKILY I KNOW A SPELL THAT

123
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,750
SHOULD STOP HIM
BEFORE HE SUCCEEDS.

124
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,083
AT LEAST I HOPE IT WILL.

125
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,416
I SUPPOSE KINKEL WOULD
ENJOY MAKING MINDLESS SLAVES

126
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,208
DESTROY THEMSELVES FOR HIS
OWN SADISTIC AMUSEMENT.

127
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,708
- I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT THE COUNT I DIDN'T LIKE.

128
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,500
- RIGHT. SO LET'S GO
MAKE HIM PAY.

129
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,875
- Seiji: IS IT TOO LATE
TO CHANGE MY MIND?

130
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,500
- I GUESS NOT. BUT IF YOU DID

131
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,208
YOU'D HAVE TO LOAN
ME YOUR CAR, YOU KNOW.

132
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,875
- WELL, IF THAT'S THE
CASE, KOUHEI, NEVER MIND.

133
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,458
I'VE SEEN WHAT YOU CALL DRIVING.

134
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,416
- HEY, KNOCK IT OFF, YOU'RE
GONNA GET IN TROUBLE

135
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,666
IF YOU SCUFF UP THOSE SEATS.

136
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,000
BESIDES, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE FUN

137
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,208
WHILE YOUR MASTER'S
IN THE TRUNK.

138
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,000
YOU'LL JUST MAKE HER
FEEL WORSE.

139
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,291
- SHOWS HOW MUCH
YOU KNOW, SLAVE BOY.

140
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,125
MASTER TOLD ME SHE DOESN'T MIND
RIDING IN THE TRUNK

141
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,625
AS LONG AS IT'S NICE
AND CLEAN LIKE SEIJI'S

142
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,833
AND NOT OLD AND STINKY
LIKE YOURS IS.

143
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,500
- ( scoffs )

144
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,791
- I HATE THAT HIROMI
AND THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

145
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,291
HAD TO GET MIXED
UP IN ALL OF THIS.

146
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,333
I CAN'T HELP
BUT FEEL RESPONSIBLE.

147
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,500
- THAT'S ONE MORE REASON
WHY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING!

148
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,083
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.

149
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,583
- ( lightning crashing )

150
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,916
- THAT'S WEIRD. THE
LAST TIME WE WERE HERE,

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,833
THE PLACE LOOKED CONDEMNED.

152
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,458
- I SUPPOSE HE WANTED TO MAKE IT
MORE SUITABLE FOR HIS GUESTS.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,500
- YOU MEAN MORE SUITABLE
FOR HIS VICTIMS.

154
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,166
HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE BACKPACK?

155
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,000
- I FOUND IT IN THE STOREROOM.
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S CUTE?

156
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,416
- KILL ME, PLEASE.

157
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,166
- I'M WILLING TO BET IT'S
MORE THAN DECORATIVE. SEE?

158
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,916
STAKES, CROSSES,
GARLIC, HOLY WATER.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,333
THESE THINGS COULD
COME IN HANDY,

160
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,166
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
OUR ADVERSARY.

161
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,333
SHE'S ACTUALLY PLANNING AHEAD.

162
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,708
- WELL, IF THEY'RE SO
FRICKING HANDY,

163
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,208
HOW COME LITTLE MISS
BLOODSUCKER HERE ISN'T AFFECTED?

164
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,625
- WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

165
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,208
- IT'S PROBABLY 'CAUSE
YOUR SKIN'S THICK AS A RHINO'S.

166
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,333
- MY SKIN'S SOFT AS SILK,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,416
- ( gate creaking )

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,958
- ( all gasping )

169
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,041
- HIROMI, IS THAT YOU?

170
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,500
- MY MASTER HAS BEEN
EXPECTING YOU.

171
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:29,958
- ( thunder rumbling )

172
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,208
- PLEASE FEEL FREE TO
ENJOY SOME REFRESHMENTS.

173
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,541
- YUM! DON'T HAVE TO
ASK ME TWICE!

174
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,833
- HEY, WHAT IF THE FOOD'S
POISONOUS OR SOMETHING?

175
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,375
MAYBE SUPERNATURAL THINGS
LIKE SHIKIGAMI ARE IMMUNE TO IT.

176
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,791
- I BELIEVE POISON IS A LITTLE

177
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,750
TOO OBVIOUS FOR
THE COUNT'S TASTE.

178
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,416
I GET THE FEELING
THIS IS HIS VERSION

179
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,833
OF THE LAST SUPPER
BEFORE OUR CRUCIFIXION.

180
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,333
- YOUR SOUP HAS GOTTEN COLD.
SHALL I REHEAT IT?

181
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,500
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME BREAD
TO GO WITH YOUR MEAL?

182
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,625
I COULD BUTTER IT.

183
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,416
PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE
SOME ROASTED MEAT?

184
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,125
I COULD CUT IT FOR YOU.

185
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,208
AND THIS ONE'S THE SOY SAUCE,

186
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,625
SO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
MIX THEM UP, OKAY?

187
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,375
HERE YOU GO, HAZUKI,
YOUR FIRST COMMISSION.

188
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,625
HEY? WHAT'S WITH THE SAD FACE?

189
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,666
I GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE
FOR MY CUTE LITTLE FRIEND,

190
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,083
DESPITE MY INSANE WORK SCHEDULE,

191
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,208
AND SHE JUST LOOKS AT ME
LIKE I'VE RIPPED HER HEART OUT.

192
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,708
- HIROMI, ARE YOU
STILL IN THERE?

193
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,333
- WOULD MISTRESS LUNA
PREFER DESSERT INSTEAD?

194
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,708
- ( crackling )

195
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,041
- ( gasps )

196
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,333
- YOUR GRANDFATHER
TASTED THIS DESSERT AS WELL.

197
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,541
I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT,
IT'S MY SPECIALTY.

198
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,583
- HIROMI!
- BIG SISTER!

199
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,833
I'LL GET YOU BACK TO NORMAL.

200
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,125
I PROMISE I WILL, HIROMI.
JUST HOLD ON!

201
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,875
- WHAT THE HELL?
WHY DID SHE HURT HERSELF?

202
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,958
- I TOLD YOU. THAT'S THE WAY
THE COUNT OPERATES.

203
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,791
- MONSTER.

204
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,583
( gasps )

205
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,208
- PLEASE FOLLOW ME THIS WAY.
MY MASTER IS WAITING.

206
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,541
- MAN. DIDN'T LOOK THIS BIG
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

207
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,458
SO, YOU REALLY
USED TO LIVE HERE, BRAT?

208
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,583
- MMM-HMM.

209
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,833
- SEIJI, HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO SENSE WHERE GRANDPA IS YET?

210
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,666
- SORT OF. I CAN TELL HE'S NEAR.

211
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,791
BUT FOR SOME REASON I'M NOT ABLE
TO PINPOINT HIS EXACT LOCATION.

212
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,083
- WHAT IS IT, HAZUKI?
- OH, IT'S NOTHING.

213
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,791
- PLEASE MAKE
YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.

214
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,375
- NO! DON'T GO, HIROMI!

215
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,541
- YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED,
NOW SHOW YOURSELF KINKEL!

216
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,708
WHERE'S MY GRANDFATHER, DAMN IT?

217
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,250
GRAMPS, CAN YOU
HEAR ME? GRAMPS?

218
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:52,958
- THIS BED...

219
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,333
( laughing )

220
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,500
HUNGRY! HUNGRY, MAMA!

221
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,083
IT WAS HERE.

222
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,041
I LIVED IN THIS ROOM WITH
MY MOTHER WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

223
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,500
- YEAH. THIS MUST BE HARD.

224
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,250
- IT IS.
I REMEMBER SO MUCH.

225
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,083
- SO, WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THESE PAINTINGS OVER HERE?

226
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,375
- I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
SEEN THEM BEFORE.

227
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,416
- ( all gasp )

228
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,958
- WHAT IS THIS?

229
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,958
- Woman: THEY'RE GLIMPSES
INTO THE REALITY

230
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,166
THAT WILL FALL
UPON YOU VERY SOON.

231
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,958
- ( gasps )

232
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,875
MAMA?

233
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,208
STOP IT! IT'S NOT FAIR!

234
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,458
IT'S NOT REAL! YOU'RE USING
HER IMAGE TO TRICK ME!

235
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,375
- COME ON KINKEL! STOP BEING
A COWARD AND SHOW YOURSELF!

236
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,125
- ( chuckles )

237
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,458
- COME ON!
I'M NOT PLAYING AROUND!

238
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:14,666
- AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
THREATENING ME, KOUHEI MORIOKA?

239
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,541
- MAYBE!

240
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,791
- REALLY, MISTRESS LUNA,

241
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,333
WHY DO YOU WASTE YOUR
TIME ON THIS HALF-WIT?

242
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:28,125
CAN'T YOU SEE? A MAN LIKE HIM
CAN ONLY BRING RUIN TO OUR KIND.

243
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:32,375
HIS POISONED BLOOD ROBS YOU OF
THE VERY ESSENCE OF WHO YOU ARE.

244
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,208
IT NUMBS YOU.

245
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,750
BY ATTACHING YOURSELF TO HIM
YOU DENY YOUR TRUE EXISTENCE

246
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,500
FOR AN INFERIOR LIFE
PLAGUED BY MEDIOCRITY.

247
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,000
THIRST MAKES YOU EXTRAORDINARY.

248
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,375
OUR THIRST SEPARATES US FROM
THE RANKS OF POWERLESS MORTALS.

249
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,500
THAT MAN IS AN EVIL DREAM

250
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,500
WHICH BREAKS THE PEACE
OF OUR DIVINE SLUMBER.

251
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,625
PLEASE, AWAKEN FROM THIS
NIGHTMARE AND COME HOME TO ME.

252
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,916
- YOU'RE THE NIGHTMARE,
NOT KOUHEI.

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,833
PREPARE YOURSELF,

254
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,916
BECAUSE I'LL NEVER FORGIVE
YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE!

255
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,666
- IS THAT SO?

256
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,291
THEN TELL ME, WHAT
SORT OF PREPARATIONS

257
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,916
DO YOU SUGGEST I MAKE?

258
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:22,916
- ( exclaims )

259
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,291
THAT ISN'T SEIJI!
THAT'S KINKEL!

260
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,958
- BUT HOW? HE CAN'T BE!

261
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,958
- ( laughs ) YOU REALLY ARE
AS STUPID AS YOU LOOK!

262
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,625
- HAIJI, ATTACK!

263
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,041
- HAIJI!

264
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,041
- ( laughs ) WELL,
THAT'S TOO BAD.

265
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,250
IT APPEARS I JUST KNOCKED
YOUR SHIKIGAMI SENSELESS.

266
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,000
I MEANT TO DO
A LOT WORSE THAN THAT.

267
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,666
- OH, YEAH? WELL YOU'RE
WEAKER THAN YOU THINK!

268
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,708
- ( screams )

269
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,083
- KOUHEI!

270
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,250
- I'M FINE. COME ON!

271
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,416
- WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.
THE COUNT'S PRETTY SNEAKY.

272
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,541
- OH, REALLY, YOU DON'T SAY.

273
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,500
- ( both exclaim )

274
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,375
- ( yelling )

275
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,000
- ( yelling )

276
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,416
- HAZUKI!

277
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,750
( groans )

278
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,541
I...

279
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,166
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SEIJI!

280
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,083
WHOA! OKAY!

281
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,208
STOP! TIME OUT!

282
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,250
- KOUHEI!

283
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,000
- ( yelling )

284
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,583
- ( yelling )

285
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,375
NOW, WHERE IS HE?
WHERE'S MY GRANDPA?

286
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,833
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

287
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,541
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO LOCKED
HIM UP IN HERE, AREN'T YOU?

288
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,208
- WHAT? I DON'T
EVEN UNDERSTAND

289
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,916
WHAT GAMES YOU'RE
PLAYING ANYMORE.

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,791
BUT HEY, IF YOU REALLY
WANT A CHALLENGE,

291
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,541
THEN HOW'S THIS FOR A GAME?

292
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,166
- GOYO HAKKE!

293
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,291
- KOUHEI!

294
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,458
- ( screaming ) NO!

295
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:58,500
HAZUKI! NO, PLEASE! JUST LET
GO OF ME AND GET OUT OF HERE!

296
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,708
- WOULD YOU STOP TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO? AND GO ON A DIET!

297
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,958
- WAIT, IS IT REALLY YOU?
YOU SEEM GENUINE.

298
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,416
TELL ME, ARE YOU THE REAL
KOUHEI AND THE REAL HAZUKI?

299
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,375
- WELL, OF COURSE IT'S US!
- WHO ELSE WOULD WE BE?

300
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,208
- I SEE. NO WONDER MY SPELLS
WOULDN'T WORK ON YOU.

301
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:19,333
- OH, NO WAY. YOU GET AWAY
FROM US, VAMPIRE SCUM!

302
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,916
- FROM WHAT I CAN TELL
COUNT KINKEL TRICKED US

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,833
INTO TURNING ON EACH OTHER.

304
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,958
- HE'S GONNA ATTACK AGAIN!

305
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,833
- HIDE SOMEWHERE!
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP

306
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,833
- OR BITE HIM! OR SOMETHING!
- FOR A MINUTE?

307
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,875
- A SMART BOY.

308
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,500
- ( groans )

309
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,875
- I'M SURE YOU'VE
REALIZED IT BY NOW.

310
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,125
I HAVE A UNIQUE TALENT
THAT ALLOWS ME TO BEND

311
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,458
AND MANIPULATE LIGHT.

312
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,083
BEFORE YOU WERE EVEN AWARE
SOMETHING WAS AMISS,

313
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,791
YOU HAD ENTERED INTO AN
ILLUSION OF MY OWN CREATION.

314
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,125
- THE MANIPULATION
OF LIGHT. OF COURSE!

315
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,541
THAT'S WHAT I FELT
IN THE HALL!

316
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,708
YOU SEPARATED US IN THAT MOMENT.

317
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,583
TAKING US DOWN
TWO SEPARATE PATHS,

318
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,750
REPLACING MY COMPANIONS
WITH MIRAGES.

319
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,500
- I CONFESS, IT WAS
DIFFICULT TO PULL OFF.

320
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,375
IT'S NOT EASY BEING
IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE.

321
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,875
- WHEN YOU BROUGHT
US BACK TOGETHER

322
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,583
WE THOUGHT WE WERE
STILL FIGHTING YOU.

323
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,791
AND WE ALMOST KILLED
EACH OTHER AS A RESULT.

324
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,708
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU
WOULD STOOP SO LOW.

325
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,166
- UNFORTUNATELY IT
WASN'T LOW ENOUGH.

326
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,625
- ( groans )

327
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,000
- HEY! GET YOUR NASTY
FEET OFF MY SLAVE!

328
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,416
- THAT'S NOT A VERY NICE
THING TO SAY, MISTRESS.

329
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,416
ACTUALLY, I RECENTLY HAD
THESE SHOES POLISHED.

330
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,041
HIROMI DOES EXCELLENT WORK.

331
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,250
AH, YES. WHEN YOU GLARE
AT ME WITH THOSE EYES

332
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,750
I FEEL EXCITEMENT PULSE
THROUGH MY ENTIRE BODY!

333
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,416
- KOUHEI, HERE!

334
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,541
- WELL, THAT COULD
HAVE BEEN WORSE. I'M NOT DEAD.

335
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,416
- GOOD THING.

336
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,708
- GET AWAY FROM HIM,
MISTRESS LUNA!

337
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,583
- I WARNED YOU!

338
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,583
NOW, PREPARE YOURSELF!

339
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,208
KINKEL!

340
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,125
- THIS CAN'T BE HER POWER!

341
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:25,000
DAMN YOU. VAMPIRE'S LOVER!

342
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,833
- ( sighs )

343
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:30,958
- YOU OKAY?

344
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,750
- DO YOU THINK THAT'S
THE LAST OF HIM?

345
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,000
THAT'S PROBABLY TOO MUCH
TO HOPE FOR, HUH?

346
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,541
- THE COUNT MAY BE
GONE FOR THE MOMENT

347
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,166
BUT I WOULDN'T LET YOUR
GUARD DOWN IF I WERE YOU.

348
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,208
HE TRICKS YOU INTO A
FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY

349
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,791
SO HE CAN CATCH YOU
AT YOUR WEAKEST.

350
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,458
- MAYBE SO, BUT I
DON'T THINK HE'LL BE

351
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,750
BOTHERING US FOR A WHILE.

352
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,000
- WHY IS THAT?
- TAKE A LOOK AT THE SKY.

353
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,958
- OH, GOOD POINT.
IT IS ALMOST DAYBREAK.

354
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,000
- ( bell ringing )

355
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,500
- ( gasps )

356
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,791
- GRANDPA!
- Seiji: WHAT'S HE DONE TO HIM?

357
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,583
- Kouhei: OKAY LISTEN, YOU TAKE
THE BRAT AND GO FIND HIROMI.

358
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,208
I'M GONNA GO CUT GRANDPA DOWN SO

359
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,791
WE CAN GET THE HELL
OUT OF THIS PLACE!

360
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,583
GRANDPA!

361
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,208
- HIROMI?
- HIROMI!

362
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,208
- ( muffled cries )

363
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,041
- ELFRIEDE!

364
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,041
- SHE'S RIGHT BY THE WINDOW.
SHE WON'T LAST LONG.

365
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,083
- ( muffled cries )

366
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,750
- THIS MIGHT NOT BE SMART.
BUT WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HER.

367
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,208
- GRANDPA!

368
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,333
- ( coughing )

369
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,833
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP KOUHEI!

370
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,458
IT'S KINKEL!

371
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,000
HE'S... HE'S...

372
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,333
A DAYWALKER!

373
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,166
- ( theme music playing )

374
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

375
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,166
- BIG BROTHER! I'M HUNGRY.
WHAT DO YOU WANNA EAT?

376
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,375
OH, WAIT. WE HAVE TO DO
THE RIDDLE FIRST.

377
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,958
UM, LET'S SEE.
OOH! I GOT IT!

378
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,208
WHAT'S A VAMPIRE'S
FAVORITE FOOD?

379
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,333
( laughs ) I LIKE THIS ONE.

380
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,625
FULL, FULL, FULL MOON!

381
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,875
WHAT'S A VAMPIRE'S
FAVORITE FOOD?

382
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,333
GRAVE-Y.

383
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:19,166
( laughs ) OH, SHUT UP.
IT'S FUNNY.

384
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,500
NEXT TIME ON MOON PHASE.
EPISODE 13.

385
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,250
"LET'S DEFEAT THE COUNT!"

386
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:26,041
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT ONE'S FUNNY?
