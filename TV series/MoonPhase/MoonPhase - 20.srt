1
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:29,958
- ( grunting )

2
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,750
- Ryuuhei: GETTING HER
OUT OF HERE IS HER ONLY CHANCE!

3
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:45,541
IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT HAZUKI,
THEN YOU HAVE TO GO!

4
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:01,750
- ( screams )

5
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,625
( breathing deeply )

6
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,541
THE MEMORIES ARE
COMING BACK AGAIN.

7
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,458
AND THEY WILL UNTIL I COMPLETE
MY TRAINING AND END THIS.

8
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,166
BUT I WON'T LET THEM DISTRACT ME
FROM WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

9
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,166
THEY'RE NOT GONNA HOLD ME BACK!

10
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:37,083
- GOOD. THAT'S THE WAY.

11
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,125
YOU'RE WALKING
THE RIGHT PATH, KOUHEI.

12
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,583
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO LEARN TO RUN.

13
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,208
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME.

14
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,041
THAT'S...

15
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,875
- ( Kouhei cries out )

16
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,666
- ( theme song playing )

17
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

18
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,250
- ( Kouhei cries out )

19
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,833
FALLING FROM THIS HEIGHT
THERE'S NO WAY I'LL LIVE.

20
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,625
( yelling )

21
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,416
IF I CAN JUST SLOW DOWN
AND CHANGE MY DIRECTION.

22
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,833
I'LL LAND ON A TREE.

23
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,958
HOPEFULLY THAT'LL
BREAK MY FALL.

24
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,500
I CAN'T DIE! GRANDPA'S
SACRIFICE CAN'T BE IN VAIN!

25
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,375
( yells )

26
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,958
- Hazuki: Episode 20.

27
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,458
( reading )

28
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,416
( screams )

29
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,916
- GEEZ, TALK ABOUT CLUMSY.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,583
WHAT KINDA SHRINE
MAIDEN ARE YOU?

31
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,541
- WHOA, WHAT WAS THAT?
- HUH?

32
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,833
- IT FELT LIKE
SOMETHING HAPPENED

33
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,916
TO KOUHEI JUST THEN, THAT'S ALL.

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,625
- OH. SO NOW
YOU'RE PSYCHIC, HUH?

35
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,875
WHAT, YOU THINK
JUST 'CAUSE YOU

36
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,166
STICK YOUR TEETH INTO
HIS NECK ONCE A MONTH

37
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,583
YOU'RE LIKE,
SOUL MATES OR SOMETHING?

38
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,291
FAT CHANCE, BUT YOU
MIGHT GET POINTS

39
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,875
FOR THE CREATIVE EXCUSE
FOR FALLING ON YOUR BUTT.

40
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,125
- I ADDED WHISKERS.

41
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,916
BUT NOW I CAN'T GET THEM OFF.

42
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,250
( Kaoru cries )

43
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,000
- JUST LOOK WHAT YOU'VE
DONE TO MY SISTER!

44
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,541
YOU'VE TURNED HER INTO A
PATHETIC WHINY LITTLE CAT GIRL!

45
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,541
ARE YOU SATISFIED?

46
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,125
- THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT
THE WOMEN IN YOUR FAMILY.

47
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,500
- THEY CAN'T HANG
ON TO THEIR MEN.

48
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,416
- HUH?

49
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,083
- OH, SPEAKING OF WHICH, HIKARU,

50
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,791
HOW IS YOUR FIANCEE
DOING THESE DAYS?

51
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,000
- UM, I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW
WHERE HE IS RIGHT THIS SECOND.

52
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,541
- ( yawns )

53
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,541
HEY! WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

54
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,541
- YOU LOOKED LIKE
YOU WERE FALLING ASLEEP.

55
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,458
- MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE SOMEBODY
IN THIS HOUSE SNORES TOO LOUD!

56
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,125
- OR MAYBE DEMONS WERE NEVER
MEANT TO BE UP DURING THE DAY.

57
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,125
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT!
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE A NAP

58
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:29,500
WHILE YOU TWO GO CLEAN
THE TEMPLE BY YOURSELVES!

59
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,583
DON'T FORGET TO
MOP THE FLOOR, SLAVE.

60
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,875
- WHEN DOES THIS END?

61
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,041
JUST HOW FAR WILL YOU PUSH HIM?

62
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,541
YOU SHOULDN'T TRY
TO GET UP YET, KOUHEI.

63
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,333
- WHERE AM I?

64
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,041
- A SALVE MADE FROM
MULBERRY LEAVES.

65
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,708
IT'LL HELP WITH
THE PAIN FOR NOW.

66
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,166
- SORRY, SENSEI.

67
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,666
I SCREWED UP AGAIN, DIDN'T I?

68
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,916
( screams in pain )

69
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,208
- IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A
LITTLE BIT OF PAIN,

70
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,083
YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED
MUCH FROM ME AT ALL.

71
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,250
LOOKS LIKE OUR TRAINING WILL
TAKE LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

72
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,750
- WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU
MEAN BY "LITTLE BIT"?

73
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,750
CAUSE I THINK MY ARMS
ARE GONNA FALL OFF.

74
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,333
- DON'T BE SO MELODRAMATIC.

75
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,375
YOU HAVE A COUPLE DOZEN BROKEN
BONES, NOTHING TOO SERIOUS.

76
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,708
I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT THAT
PRETTY MUG OF YOURS.

77
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,291
GOOD THINKING,
FALLING FACE FIRST.

78
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,791
- ( laughing )

79
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:45,375
COUPLE DOZEN. IS THAT ALL?
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN

80
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,500
TRYING TO KILL
ME WITH THIS LESSON.

81
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,583
- OH? AND WHICH LESSON IS THAT?

82
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,541
- THE SHIKIGAMI EARLIER.

83
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,875
YOU SENT IT TO SEE HOW WELL
I'D REACT, DIDN'T YOU?

84
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,125
EVEN I COULD TELL
THAT ONE WAS A TEST.

85
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,791
I STILL FAILED IT,
THOUGH, DIDN'T I?

86
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,500
- I DON'T KNOW.

87
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,875
- ( groaning )

88
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,833
- ENOUGH WHINING.
I HAVE TO CONTINUE TRAINING.

89
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,416
( yells in pain )

90
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,125
- THE TRAINING WILL
HAVE TO WAIT.

91
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,708
UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T
DO TOO MUCH FOR THE PAIN.

92
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,958
I'VE MASTERED SEVERAL FORMS
OF SPIRIT FIGHTING,

93
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,500
AS WELL AS THE MARTIAL ARTS,

94
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,500
BUT I NEVER WAS
MUCH GOOD AT HEALING.

95
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,041
I'M AFRAID THAT ALWAYS TOOK
A BACKSEAT IN MY STUDIES.

96
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,583
WE'LL HAVE TO POSTPONE
OUR WORK FOR A WHILE

97
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,125
UNTIL YOUR INJURIES
ARE COMPLETELY HEALED.

98
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,708
OR, WE COULD AVAIL
OURSELVES OF OUR OTHER OPTION.

99
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,833
HAZUKI'S POWER.

100
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,291
BUT MAYBE YOU'D RATHER
TAKE THE TIME OFF.

101
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,958
- NO. THAT'S OKAY.

102
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,458
- IT'S DANGEROUS TO MOVE YOU NOW

103
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,333
AND I'D HATE FOR YOUR ORGANS
TO GET PUNCTURED.

104
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,458
SO I'LL BRING HER BACK HERE.

105
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,041
TO WARD OFF EVIL
OR ANIMALS, MORE LIKELY.

106
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,708
THERE ARE BEARS
IN THESE MOUNTAINS.

107
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:54,958
DON'T WANT YOU TO GET EATEN

108
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,500
AFTER ALL THE TIME I'VE
INVESTED IN YOU. DO I?

109
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,000
- ( Kouhei laughing )

110
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,750
- Aruto: I SAW SOMETHING I WANT.

111
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,750
IT LOOKED...

112
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,791
DELICIOUS.

113
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,958
- ( bell ringing )

114
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,291
- WOULD YOU MIND KEEPING IT
DOWN? I'M TRYING TO TAKE A NAP.

115
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,750
I DON'T WANT ANY COOKIES
OR WHATEVER YOU'RE SELLING.

116
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,458
ALL RIGHT, WEIRD BASKET-HEAD
GUY, IS THIS SOME KIND OF PRANK?

117
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,125
HELLO! ARE YOU LISTENING?

118
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,583
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
IS IT REALLY...

119
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,208
- WHAT, ARE YOU
COMPLETELY STUPID?

120
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,500
I MEAN HOW FREAKING CARELESS
CAN YOU BE, DEMON GIRL?

121
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,208
HE GOT THROUGH THE BARRIER...

122
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,500
YAYOI HAS A PROTECTIVE WALL SET
UP AROUND THE ENTIRE MOUNTAIN.

123
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,791
AND IF THIS GUY COULD GET
THROUGH IT WITHOUT YAYOI

124
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,333
KNOWING HE'S HERE, THAT
MEANS HE'S NO ORDINARY HUMAN.

125
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,041
- DUH. OF COURSE
HE ISN'T, DUMMY.

126
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,791
OF COURSE HE ISN'T ORDINARY.

127
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,458
HE'S ALMOST AS WEIRD AS YOU ARE.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,416
- IS IT REALLY YOU IN THERE?

129
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,916
- HELLO, THERE.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, YOU TWO.

130
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,083
- ( Hikaru screams and cries )

131
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,500
- MAN, WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?

132
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,916
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE KOUHEI.

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,541
NOW THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
REALLY EMBARRASSING.

134
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,166
TOO LATE, LITTLE MISS PROPER.

135
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,000
SEIJI SAW THE REAL YOU
THIS MORNING.

136
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,041
- YOU SHUT UP, SUCK FACE!

137
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,958
TELL US, BROTHER SEIJI,
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

138
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,916
I NOTICED YOUR KI SEEMS
STRONGER THAN EVER.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,541
HAVE YOU BEEN OFF
TRAINING SOMEWHERE?

140
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,083
- NOT EXACTLY.

141
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,625
- DO YOU MIND IF I ASK WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN ALL THIS TIME?

142
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,833
- NOT AT ALL.

143
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,291
I'VE BEEN KEEPING MYSELF HIDDEN.

144
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,750
TRAILING THE ENEMY AND
WATCHING ALL OF THEIR MOVEMENTS.

145
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,208
MAKING SURE THAT THEY DON'T EVER
CATCH US BY SURPRISE AGAIN.

146
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,458
- OH, WOW!

147
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,541
YOU'RE SO BRAVE, BROTHER SEIJI!

148
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,958
I KNEW WE COULD
COUNT ON YOU TO PROTECT US!

149
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,166
- FOR THE MOMENT.

150
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,041
UNFORTUNATELY, I'M NOT
SURE HOW MUCH LONGER

151
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,625
WE CAN AVOID
THEIR DETECTION.

152
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,125
THEY'RE CLOSE.

153
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,666
THEY DISCOVERED THE LOCATION OF

154
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,416
THE MAIN BRANCH OF THE FAMILY
FROM THE RUINS OF THE OLD HOUSE.

155
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,583
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY STRIKE.

156
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,000
WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

157
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,416
- I SEE.
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE?

158
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,041
- I WANTED TO REPORT THIS TO
YAYOI AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

159
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,541
SO HE AND KOUHEI
WILL HAVE SOME TIME TO PREPARE.

160
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,625
SO. WHERE ARE THEY, ANYWAY?

161
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,458
- OH. THEY'RE IN SECLUSION,
SOMEWHERE ON THE MOUNTAIN.

162
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,500
YAYOI THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE EASIER FOR KOUHEI

163
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,791
TO CONCENTRATE
ON HIS TRAINING

164
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,958
IF HE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY DISTRACTIONS.

165
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,416
- WELL, THIS IS TOO
IMPORTANT TO WAIT.

166
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,833
WE'LL HAVE TO GO TO THEM.

167
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,083
CAN ANY OF YOU LEAD ME
TO WHERE THEY ARE THERE?

168
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,958
- I KNOW HOW TO GET THERE!
I'LL TAKE YOU!

169
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,333
- NO WAY! IT'S
AGAINST THE RULES FOR

170
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,291
YOU TO SEE HIM MORE
THAN ONCE A MONTH!

171
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,083
- NEVER FEAR! HAIJI IS HERE!

172
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,041
LET ME DELIVER SEIJI'S MESSAGE
TO MASTER'S SLAVE.

173
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,250
I'LL BE QUICK AS A CAT.

174
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,375
( Haiji screams )

175
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,000
- NO! HEY!

176
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,041
WHAT'D YOU DO TO MY HAIJI,
YOU EVIL SHIKIGAMI STEALER?

177
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,250
GIVE HER BACK OR I'LL SMACK
THOSE STUPID GLASSES

178
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,750
RIGHT OFF YOUR FACE!

179
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,291
GIMME THAT EGG!

180
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,666
- IT LOOKS LIKE OUR MESSENGER'S
A LITTLE TIED UP RIGHT NOW.

181
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,833
HOW 'BOUT IT, HIKARU,

182
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,083
DO YA THINK YOU COULD
TAKE ME UP THERE?

183
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,958
- Hazuki: COME HERE,
YOU LITTLE RODENT!

184
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,375
- IF YOU DON'T MIND, THAT IS.
- NO, I DON'T MIND AT ALL!

185
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,208
IT'S REALLY NO PROBLEM,
I'LL TOTALLY TAKE YOU.

186
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,166
I MEAN, TAKE YOU UP THERE.
I MEAN, LEAD YOU THERE.

187
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,375
- THANKS, I APPRECIATE IT.

188
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,333
- OH, IT'S NOTHING.

189
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:02,791
THANK YOU, KAORU.

190
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,625
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

191
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,291
- Announcer on TV: "SUPER
SCIENCE" FILE NUMBER 13.

192
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,958
THE CHARRED REMAINS OF AN
ANTIQUE SHOP HAVE BECOME OVERRUN

193
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,125
BY A SPECIES OF VINE PREVIOUSLY
UNDOCUMENTED BY SCIENTISTS.

194
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,500
- WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S... OUR HOUSE.

195
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,625
- HELLO. I'M TAKAYO TOMI AND
I'M HERE WITH A WITNESS

196
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,666
WHO WAS CLOSE TO THE FAMILY
WHO OWNED THE SHOP.

197
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,083
- OH MY GOSH, IT'S HIROMI!

198
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,958
TELL US HOW YOU KNEW
THE DECEASED, MA'AM.

199
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,250
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
ACQUAINTED WITH THEM?

200
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,958
- I DON'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE DECEASED.

201
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,416
I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THEY'RE
ALL GONE JUST LIKE THAT.

202
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,833
THAT ONE FIRE COULD TAKE
ALL OF THEM AWAY FROM ME.

203
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,791
IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS,

204
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,916
RYUUHEI, ELFRIEDE,
SEIJI, ANYBODY...

205
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,500
KOUHEI. HAZUKI,
ARE YOU LISTENING?

206
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:04,500
PLEASE. IF YOU ARE, JUST LET
ME KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

207
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,041
- LET ME GO!
WE HAVE TO GO BACK!

208
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,125
STOP! WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE
GRANDPA AND ELFRIEDE BEHIND!

209
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,708
- THEY CAN TAKE CARE
OF THEMSELVES.

210
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,041
THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

211
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,750
- STUPID.

212
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,458
STUPID!

213
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,166
GRANDFATHER. ELFRIEDE.

214
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,250
YOU WOULD BOTH
BE PROUD OF KOUHEI.

215
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,250
AND HIKARU AND KAORU ARE
LOOKING OUT FOR ME, TOO.

216
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,208
I PROMISE...

217
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,291
I WON'T LET ANY OF YOU DOWN.

218
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,708
- Ryuuhei: WHAT A SORRY SIGHT.

219
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,041
- SENSEI? IS THAT YOU?

220
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,791
- ONE LITTLE FALL AND YOU'RE
HELPLESS AS A BABY.

221
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,166
FINE FIGHTER YOU'LL MAKE.

222
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,958
AT THIS RATE YOU SHOULD
FINISH YOUR TRAINING

223
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,625
SOMETIME IN THE MIDDLE
OF YOUR NEXT LIFE.

224
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,750
ASSUMING YOU DON'T
GIVE UP BEFORE THEN.

225
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,541
- WHO ARE YOU?

226
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,791
I KNOW YOU. DON'T I?

227
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,875
COME CLOSER, SO I CAN SEE.

228
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,583
I'VE MET YOU BEFORE, I KNOW IT.

229
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,250
I RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE.

230
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,500
YOU SOUND LIKE...

231
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,250
NO! STOP!

232
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,208
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT
YOU'RE TORTURING ME?

233
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,166
PLEASE... JUST
TELL ME WHO YOU ARE.

234
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,291
IT CAN'T BE.

235
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,500
IS THIS EVEN REAL?

236
00:14:58,916 --> 00:14:59,958
WHO ARE YOU?

237
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,750
( grunts )

238
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,250
( yells in pain )

239
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,791
COME ON, KOUHEI.

240
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,916
WHAT KIND OF FIGHTER
ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

241
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,875
- DOES THIS ONE BELONG TO YOU?

242
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,125
- AND IF I SAY YES?

243
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,583
- THEN I SHALL GET
RID OF HIM FIRST.

244
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,125
- DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH HIM.

245
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,041
- VERY WELL.

246
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,291
- SENSEI.

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,958
HURRY.

248
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,083
- WHAT? KOUHEI'S BEEN HURT?

249
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,833
YOU CAN GLOAT ABOUT
YOUR PREMONITION

250
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,583
BEING RIGHT LATER, OKAY?

251
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,791
- DOES THIS MEAN
THEY'RE SOUL MATES?

252
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,583
- WE NEED YOU TO
GIVE HIM THE KISS, HAZUKI.

253
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,000
- YEAH, OKAY.

254
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,041
- TWO TIMES IN ONE MONTH,
WHAT A STROKE OF LUCK!

255
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,708
I BET YOU'RE DOING A JIG INSIDE,
AREN'T YA, DEMON GIRL?

256
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,958
- IT'S NOT LUCKY AT ALL,
FOR YOUR INFORMATION.

257
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,416
WHEN I USE MY POWERS TO HEAL IT
EATS UP SOME OF MY LIFE FORCE.

258
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,958
- I'LL COME WITH YOU,

259
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,916
JUST IN CASE MY POWERS CAN BE
OF SOME ASSISTANCE AS WELL.

260
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,666
- FINE! THEN I'M
COMING ALONG, TOO!

261
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,541
I MEAN, IF THAT'S OKAY
WITH YOU, MASTER.

262
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,000
OF COURSE I'LL STAY HERE
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

263
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,333
- YOU REALLY WANT TO COME?

264
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,708
- ESPECIALLY AFTER THE NEWS
BROTHER SEIJI JUST BROUGHT US.

265
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,750
HE'S BEEN FOLLOWING THE ENEMY
AND THEY'RE GETTING CLOSE.

266
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,541
- IS THAT SO?

267
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,916
I APPRECIATE YOUR DILIGENCE,
SEIJI, THANK YOU.

268
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,958
- NO NEED FOR THANKS.

269
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,458
- AH. I TAKE IT YOU'D LIKE
TO COME TOO, KAORU.

270
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,750
I KNOW IT'S HARD
BEING LEFT BEHIND.

271
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,166
BUT CAN I ASK YOU TO PROTECT
THE HOUSE WHILE WE'RE AWAY?

272
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,791
- ( whimpers )

273
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,041
DON'T WORRY, CHILD.

274
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,416
WE'LL BRING HIM
HOME SAFELY, I PROMISE.

275
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,875
- YOU'RE GIVING HER BACK?

276
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,000
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE MAD.

277
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,708
- Vargas: AN EASTERN AMULET
TO WARD OFF EVIL...

278
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,083
CHARMING, BUT USELESS.

279
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,291
- ( yells in fear )

280
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,125
- YOU'RE VERY FUNNY.
I THINK I LIKE YOU.

281
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,708
- WHAT'S A LITTLE GIRL LIKE THIS
DOING SO DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS?

282
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,958
- VARGAS SAYS YOU
FELL OFF A CLIFF

283
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,583
AND NOW YOUR BODY'S ALL BROKEN
AND YOU CAN'T MOVE IT ANYMORE.

284
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,125
I THINK HE'S RIGHT, ISN'T HE?

285
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,666
- SHE'S WITH HIM?

286
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,916
WHO ARE THESE GUYS?

287
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,750
- CAN I KEEP HIM, VARGAS?

288
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,833
HE LOOKS LIKE SUCH A FUN TOY.

289
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,458
- OF COURSE.

290
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,541
YOU SHOULD BE FLATTERED, HUMAN.

291
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,333
THE PRINCESS HAS CHOSEN YOU.

292
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,250
- SHE'S A VAMPIRE?

293
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,958
THAT MEANS THEY FOUND US.

294
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,083
AND HAZUKI'S IN DANGER!

295
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,875
- HE SMELLS OF HER.

296
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,500
SHE'S BEEN HERE BEFORE ME.

297
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,791
- IT SEEMS YOU'RE RIGHT.

298
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,833
- YOU'RE NOT HER SLAVE ANYMORE,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

299
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,208
YOU'RE MY SLAVE NOW AND
I'LL NEVER LET YOU GO!

300
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,666
- NO! SENSEI. HAZUKI.

301
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,208
STAY AWAY! DON'T COME HERE!

302
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,750
- Kikaru: THAT VIBRATION!

303
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,375
- Seiji: VAMPIRES.

304
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,000
- YOU MEAN... KOUHEI?

305
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,208
- DAMN. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT HIM.

306
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,500
IF I'D KNOWN THEY WERE CLOSE

307
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,625
I WOULD'VE MADE SURE HE WAS
BETTER PROTECTED.

308
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,833
- THE VAMPIRES ARE HERE.

309
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,083
AND YAYOI DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH WARNING.

310
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,125
I'M THE ONE WHO WAS
WATCHING THEM.

311
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,416
THIS IS MY FAULT.

312
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,541
- GO BACK TO THE TEMPLE, HAZUKI.

313
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,916
IT'S YOU THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.

314
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,541
WE CAN'T RISK THEM FINDING YOU.

315
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,791
HAZUKI!

316
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,500
- NO! STOP!
- DAMN!

317
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,291
- SHE'S JUST AS
IMPULSIVE AS EVER.

318
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,333
DOESN'T SHE REALIZE WE'RE
TRYING TO SAVE HER LIFE?

319
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,708
- THAT'S WHY SHE'S DOING IT.

320
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,916
SHE KNOWS SHE'S THE ONE
THE VAMPIRES WANT

321
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,500
AND THAT ONCE THEY HAVE HER,
KOUHEI WILL BE SAFE.

322
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,750
- KOUHEI. I'M COMING.

323
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,416
HANG ON!

324
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,291
- Yayoi: WE NEED TO MOVE FASTER.

325
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,416
- OKAY.

326
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,166
- HAZUKI HAS THE SPEED
OF A VAMPIRE.

327
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,750
AND HIKARU HAS BEEN TRAINED
FOR QUICKNESS AND AGILITY.

328
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,125
YOU'LL HAVE TO
CATCH UP WITH US LATER!

329
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,208
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

330
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:48,250
I CAME HERE TO PROTECT THEM
AND I CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP.

331
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,541
WHAT GOOD ARE MY POWERS IF I
CAN'T EVEN HELP MY OWN FAMILY?

332
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,708
- I BELIEVE YOU MIGHT
COME IN HANDY, HUMAN.

333
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,333
- QUIT FOLLOWING ME!

334
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,625
- I'D LOVE TO. BUT AS MUCH OF
A PAIN IN THE BUTT AS YOU ARE,

335
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,416
I PROMISED MASTER YAYOI
THAT I'D PROTECT YOU.

336
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,958
SO I GO WHERE YOU GO,
DEMON SPAWN.

337
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,416
YOU HEAR THAT?

338
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,666
- YEAH.

339
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,875
- SOMETHING iS WRONG.
IT'S TOO QUIET HERE.

340
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,416
- YES?

341
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,916
- GO CHECK THINGS OUT, OKAY?

342
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,041
- UH-HUH!

343
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,083
( Haiji screams )

344
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,125
- HAIJI!

345
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,125
LET HER GO!

346
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,750
- I THINK NOT.

347
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,083
SO NICE TO SEE YOU,
MISTRESS LUNA.

348
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,583
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

349
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,541
- ( theme song playing )

350
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

351
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,666
- Haiji: HELLO, SLAVE BOY.

352
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,791
MASTER'S BEEN LOOKING A LITTLE
SAD LATELY, SO I'VE GOT A PLAN.

353
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,458
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN
A LITTLE DANCE NUMBER

354
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:05,875
TO MAKE HER SMILE, OKAY?

355
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,208
THIS IS HOW IT GOES.

356
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:11,083
FULL, FULL, FULL, MOON!
FULL, FULL, FULL, MOON!

357
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,625
NOW YOU TRY IT.

358
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:15,416
NEXT TIME, ON MOON PHASE,
EPISODE 21.

359
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,375
"BROTHER, WHERE IS THIS
NURSERY RHYME FROM?"

360
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,333
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT A
LOTTA PRACTICING TO DO.

361
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:25,000
YOU'RE TERRIBLE. LET'S GO!
