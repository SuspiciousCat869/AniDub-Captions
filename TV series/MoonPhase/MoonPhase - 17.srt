1
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:10,958
- ( gasps )

2
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,250
- OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

3
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:16,958
- THIS ISSUE'S FLYING
RIGHT OFF THE SHELVES

4
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,625
THANKS TO OUR LITTLE
COVER GIRL HERE! WE'RE A HIT!

5
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,291
IT REALLY IS A
REMARKABLE PHOTOGRAPH.

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,375
WHO TOOK IT, HIROMI?
WAS IT YOU?

7
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,375
- ( chuckles ) NUH-UH.

8
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,625
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT!

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,500
RIGHT?

10
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:34,125
- UH-HUH. ACTUALLY,
KOUHEI'S THE PHOTOGRAPHER.

11
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,208
- NO! KOUHEI? REALLY?

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,291
- MM-HMM.

13
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,708
- THEN I TAKE IT
THE GENIUS OF IT

14
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,958
MUST'VE BEEN A
FORTUNATE MISTAKE!

15
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,833
- ( laughs )

16
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,708
WELL, IT COULDN'T BE TALENT.

17
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,083
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

18
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,625
KOUHEI'S GREAT AND HE WORKED
HARD ON THIS PICTURE!

19
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,500
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS, ELFRIEDE!

20
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,041
I MEAN HE'S STILL
TOTALLY A USELESS GEEK.

21
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,125
I'M NOT SAYING HE'S
COOL OR ANYTHING.

22
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,791
- OH, WE KNOW.

23
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,458
- NO, OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.
( laughs )

24
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,666
- JERKS.

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,333
- ( continues laughing )

26
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,458
( stops laughing )

27
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,083
- ( theme song playing )

28
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

29
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,458
- WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, KOUHEI?

30
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,916
- Kouhei: I'M PRETTY
WORTHLESS, AREN'T I?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,333
- HMM?

32
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,166
- I MEAN, I'VE NEVER BEEN
ABLE TO FINISH ANYTHING

33
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,625
I'VE SET OUT TO DO EVER
SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID.

34
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,375
EVEN THE SIMPLE STUFF.

35
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,666
GOALS ANYONE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO REACH

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,333
ARE ALWAYS TOO MUCH FOR ME.

37
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,916
BUT WE CAN'T JUST
KEEP PRETENDING

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,875
THAT SHE'S SAFE HERE, GRANPA.

39
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,750
- All: ( laughing )
I'M SERIOUS, KID!

40
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,750
- Kouhei: SHE'S VULNERABLE HERE.

41
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,208
THESE OTHER VAMPIRES HAVE

42
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,333
THEIR SIGHTS FIXED ON HER
AND I WANNA PROTECT HER.

43
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,416
BUT I CAN'T.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,791
I WANNA BE STRONG ENOUGH.
I UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T HAVE

45
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,291
THE SAME NATURAL ABILITIES
THAT YOU AND SEIJI DO.

46
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,208
BUT IF I WORK HARD AND PUT
EVERYTHING INTO TRAINING,

47
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,500
I KNOW I CAN AT LEAST
BE BETTER THAN THIS!

48
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,250
PLEASE... TEACH ME.

49
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,291
EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

50
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,125
YOUR TECHNIQUES,
YOUR SPELLS...

51
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,375
I'LL WORK HARD, I SWEAR!
I WON'T GIVE UP!

52
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,208
- THAT'S WHAT YOU
WANTED TO ASK ME?

53
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,875
YOU SNIVELING IDIOT!

54
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:50,958
- ( gasps )

55
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,583
- GRANDPA, WAIT!

56
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,916
- YOU'RE PITIFUL. LEARN FROM ME

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,666
AND YOU'RE STILL
DEPENDING ON OTHERS.

58
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,916
DON'T ASK ME AGAIN.

59
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,250
- Haiji: DID I MISS SOMETHING?

60
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,875
HEY, SLAVE, WAIT!
WHAT'S WRONG?

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,041
MOODY BOY.

62
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,166
( yawns )

63
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,416
- ( Kouhei grunts )

64
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,583
- WHAT THE HELL?

65
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,708
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TRAIN HIM?
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

66
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,500
HE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T
DO ANYTHING BY HIMSELF.

67
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,916
- BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN OPTION.

68
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,333
I CAN'T TRAIN KOUHEI YET.

69
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,208
- WHY NOT?

70
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,041
- TELL ME, HAIJI...

71
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,083
YOU'RE A SHIKIGAMI,
ORIGINALLY MADE BY SHIZURU.

72
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,333
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
SO WHAT?

73
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,375
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

74
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,666
MY DAUGHTER.
CAN YOU SENSE HER?

75
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,166
I GUESS THAT'S A NO.

76
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,708
- I'M SORRY.

77
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,333
BUT I DON'T THINK MY SOUL
IS CONNECTED TO HERS ANYMORE.

78
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,041
- I KNOW.

79
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,791
I JUST REALLY
WISH SHE WERE HERE

80
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,958
SO I COULD ASK HER WHAT
SHE WOULD SAY TO HER SON.

81
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,291
BECAUSE THIS HELPLESS OLD MAN
DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE.

82
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,791
- Hazuki: WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN BED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY?

83
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,208
THINK YOU'RE A VAMPIRE?

84
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,541
GET UP, SLACKER!

85
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,541
- Kouhei: ( groans ) GOD,
YOU ARE SUCH A PAIN!

86
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,708
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KICK ME!

87
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,000
- Hazuki: OH, PARDON ME.

88
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,833
I MISTOOK YOU FOR A USELESS
PIECE OF TRASH!

89
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,083
- Kouhei: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

90
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,208
- UH-OH. SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER
WAR'S STARTED!

91
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,041
TIME TO RESCUE THE SLAVE!

92
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,083
- MAYBE YOU'RE NOT LINKED
TO MY DAUGHTER ANYMORE,

93
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,583
BUT AT LEAST YOU'VE INHERITED
HER CONCERN FOR KOUHEI.

94
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,208
- Kouhei: HEY! DON'T STEP
ON MY LENSES!

95
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,791
- Hazuki: IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR
TOSSING THEM ALL OVER YOUR ROOM!

96
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,458
- Kouhei: THEY'RE NOT TOSSED!
THEY'RE VERY CAREFULLY PLACED!

97
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,250
DAMN IT! CAN'T A GUY BROOD
FOR TEN MINUTES IN THIS HOUSE?

98
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,708
- THANK YOU, GIRLS.
YOU'RE JUST WHAT HE NEEDS.

99
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,791
YOU HELP ME TOO MUCH.

100
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,708
- DON'T BE SILLY.

101
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,416
- WILD BERRIES! HOW NICE.

102
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,250
- HIROMI BROUGHT THEM OVER
THIS MORNING.

103
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,333
THEY'RE NOT IN SEASON,
BUT THEY TASTE GOOD NONETHELESS.

104
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,333
- I'M SURE.

105
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,416
- LISTEN, ELFRIEDE...
- YES?

106
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,000
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D
LIKE TO FINISH THE STORY

107
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,166
YOU STARTED TELLING ME
THE OTHER DAY.

108
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,916
NOT THAT I CAN DO ANYTHING TO
HELP, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR.

109
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,541
- MY ORIGINAL HOME
IS THE SCHWARTZ WALD,

110
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,666
THE "BLACK FOREST,"

111
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,583
IN SOUTHERN GERMANY.

112
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:03,375
I LIVED THERE, RAISED BY MY
AUNT AND UNCLE IN THE VILLAGE.

113
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,291
THAT WAS ROUGHLY
ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

114
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,583
MY AUNT AND UNCLE WERE ALWAYS

115
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,416
SO KIND TO ME AND
LOVED ME AS THEIR OWN,

116
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,958
AND THEIR DAUGHTER NINA
WAS MY MOST CHERISHED FRIEND.

117
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,166
- ( girls giggling
in the distance )

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,125
- WHERE WERE YOUR PARENTS?

119
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,041
- Elfiede: NOT LONG AFTER MY
MOTHER AND FATHER MARRIED,

120
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,208
THEY WENT ON
A LONG WALK TOGETHER,

121
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,625
DEEP INTO THE BLACK FOREST,

122
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,083
WHERE IT WAS SAID
A POWERFUL DEMON LIVED.

123
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,375
PERHAPS IT WAS
THE CURIOSITY OF YOUTH.

124
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,000
BUT THEY GOT LOST,

125
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,083
AND A FEW DAYS LATER, MY MOTHER
RETURNED TO THE VILLAGE ALONE.

126
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,208
SHE WAS PREGNANT...

127
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:43,750
...WITH ME.

128
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,958
WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THOSE WOODS
CHANGED MY MOTHER COMPLETELY.

129
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,000
SHE STAYED INDOORS
DURING THE DAY.

130
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,416
AND THEN SHE JOURNEYED
INTO THE FOREST AT NIGHT.

131
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,625
- ( woman screaming )

132
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,458
- ( roars )

133
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,500
- Elfriede: IT WAS
TOO MUCH TO IGNORE.

134
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,958
THE GOSSIP IN THE
VILLAGE WAS THAT

135
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,916
MY MOTHER HAD BEEN
POSSESSED BY THE DEMON.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,500
AND THAT I WAS
THE DEMON'S CHILD.

137
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,666
- ( kids laughing )

138
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,083
- I BLAMED HER.
I HATED MY MOTHER.

139
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,125
I HATE YOU. I HATE YOU, I HATE
YOU! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!

140
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,750
I WANT A REAL MOM!

141
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,791
( crying )

142
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,375
- Elfriede: NINA WAS
MY ONLY FRIEND.

143
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,916
BUT THAT WAS FINE WITH ME.

144
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,625
AS LONG AS SHE
WAS THERE BY MY SIDE,

145
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,666
I DECIDED I WOULD
NEVER BE LONELY.

146
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,708
SEASONS PASSED, LIFE WENT ON.

147
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,666
AND EVENTUALLY MY MOTHER
STOPPED CRYING OUT AT NIGHT.

148
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,583
THE GOSSIP QUITED DOWN TOO,
AND MY LIFE WAS GETTING BETTER.

149
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,625
OR AT LEAST THAT'S
HOW IT SEEMED TO ME.

150
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,458
AND THEN ONE NIGHT
MY AUNT AND UNCLE

151
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,333
CAME TO ME WITH A
VERY SPECIAL GIFT.

152
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,166
THESE GLASSES.

153
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,041
THEY WERE TOO BIG FOR ME AND THE
PRESCRIPTION WASN'T QUITE RIGHT,

154
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,333
AND AT FIRST IT WAS
STILL HARD TO SEE.

155
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,875
BUT THEY WERE MINE,

156
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,166
AND THEY GAVE THE WORLD
A SHARPNESS I HAD NEVER KNOWN.

157
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,291
I WAS SO EXCITED!

158
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,583
I RAN TO MY MOTHER'S ROOM,

159
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,833
FORGETTING MY OATH
TO NEVER VISIT HER AT NIGHT.

160
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,875
SHE WAS THERE, WITH A STRANGE
MAN I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

161
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,833
HE WAS STRIKING.

162
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,541
MAGNETIC.

163
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,041
HE SAID HIS NAME
WAS HEINRICH VON KINKEL.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
- KINKEL?

165
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,375
- HE TURNED TO ME,
SO TERRIBLY CALM.

166
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,958
"MY PRECIOUS DAUGHTER," HE SAID.

167
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,916
"YOU HAVE THE
BLOOD OF A VAMPIRE.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,666
"MY BLOOD, COURSING
THROUGH YOUR VEINS."

169
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,708
THEN HE GAVE ME TWO CHOICES.

170
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,291
I COULD STAY WITH
MY AUNT AND UNCLE,

171
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,125
NEVER TRULY PART
OF THE VILLAGERS' FOLD,

172
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,333
OR I COULD BECOME A VAMPIRE.

173
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,708
"YOU HAVE NEW GLASSES," HE SAID.

174
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,000
"LET ME SHOW YOU
A WORLD YOU'VE NEVER SEEN."

175
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,958
I PONDERED IT CAREFULLY
AND CAME TO A DECISION.

176
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,291
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A BURDEN

177
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,750
ON MY AUNT AND UNCLE'S
HOUSEHOLD ANYMORE.

178
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,500
I WAS A VAMPIRE'S CHILD.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,583
I LET KINKEL KISS ME SO THAT
I COULD BECOME THE MONSTER

180
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,791
I'D BEEN DESTINED FOR
SINCE MY CONCEPTION.

181
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,833
AND THEN I MADE A PROMISE.

182
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,541
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE COUNT
TAKING ME IN,

183
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,416
I TOLD HIM HE COULD
HAVE MY FAMILY AS WELL.

184
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,875
IN MY MIND, I WAS SACRIFICING
MY MOTHER TO HIM.

185
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,875
CONSIDERING THE FATE
SHE HAD BORNE ME INTO,

186
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,625
I FELT IT WAS ONLY FAIR.

187
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,875
BUT...

188
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,000
MY MOTHER WAS NEVER TOUCHED.

189
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,458
THE FAMILY KINKEL HAD IN MIND
WHEN I AGREED TO THE DEAL

190
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,458
WERE THOSE IN MY UNCLE'S HOUSE.

191
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,416
WHEN I REALIZED IT,
I RAN HOME TO STOP HIM.

192
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,625
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

193
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,625
MY AUNT AND UNCLE
WERE ALREADY DEAD.

194
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,125
ONLY NINA WAS BREATHING.

195
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:37,166
SHE WAS SO PALE,
BARELY CLINGING TO LIFE.

196
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,333
KINKEL TOLD ME TO GIVE
HER THE VAMPIRE'S KISS,

197
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,708
AND FINISH THE DEED.

198
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,875
I TRIED TO REFUSE,
BUT I WASN'T HUMAN ANYMORE.

199
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,541
I WAS HIS SLAVE,

200
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,208
AND THOUGH MY INSIDES WERE
SCREAMING OUT AGAINST HIM,

201
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,625
I WAS POWERLESS.

202
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,500
MY BODY COULDN'T
DISOBEY HIS COMMAND.

203
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,666
AND SO...

204
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,708
I DID IT.

205
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,083
I LOVED HER SO MUCH,
AND I PUT MY TEETH IN HER NECK.

206
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,916
AND AS I FELT HER LIFE
DRAINING AWAY,

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,375
PASSING FROM HER BODY TO MINE,
I MADE A NEW PROMISE.

208
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,833
I WOULD SURVIVE.

209
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,250
THROUGH MISERY,
TORTURE, ANYTHING,

210
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,000
UNTIL I COULD AVENGE
NINA AND HER PARENTS

211
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,625
AND WITNESS THE DEATH
OF MY FATHER, COUNT KINKEL.

212
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,416
( sobbing )

213
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,250
- THANK YOU
FOR TELLING ME, ELFRIEDE.

214
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,666
FOR YOUR TRUST.

215
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,000
YOU HAVE SUFFERED MORE
THAN ANY OF US.

216
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,333
- ( crying )

217
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,083
- ( engine starts )

218
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,208
- THANKS AGAIN FOR LENDING ME
YOUR CAR, KOUHEI.

219
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,125
- JUST BRING IT BACK
IN ONE PIECE, ALRIGHT?

220
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,458
- OH, COME ON, IT'S ME!

221
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,500
- YEAH, THAT'S MY POINT!

222
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,583
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE ALMOST FREAKIN' DIED

223
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,916
WITH YOU BEHIND THE WHEEL?

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,333
- ARE YOU REALLY THAT
TERRIBLE A DRIVER, HIROMI?

225
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,083
- NO. KOUHEI'S JUST
ANXIETY-PRONE, THAT'S ALL.

226
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,500
OH, BY THE WAY...

227
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,458
- Huh?

228
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,708
- WHAT'S THE STORY WITH
THE TWO LOVE BIRDS IN THERE?

229
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,208
- ( chuckles ) FEEL GOOD?
- ( laughing ) OH. YES, VERY!

230
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,500
- Hazuki: OH, RIGHT.
SO YOU NOTICED TOO, HUH?

231
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,083
- WELL, IT IS PRETTY
HARD TO MISS.

232
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,791
- YEAH, GUESS SO.

233
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,916
- I THINK THE OLD MAN NEEDS TO
STOP WITH THE CRADLE ROBBING.

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,291
- WELL, I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

235
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,791
ELFRIEDE COULD BE A LOT
OLDER THAN HIM, ACTUALLY.

236
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,000
- UH, WHAT?

237
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,416
- ( laughing ) I'M JUST KIDDING!

238
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,791
- LOVE BIRDS? WHAT'RE YOU
GUYS EVEN TALKING ABOUT?

239
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,000
- Both: ( gasp ) MORON!

240
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,750
- BE BACK LATER TONIGHT, 'KAY?

241
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,958
- SEE YOU THEN, HIROMI!
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR ARTICLE!

242
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,916
- THANKS, I'LL BRING
YOU A PRESENT, SWEETIE!

243
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,166
- ( crashes )

244
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,125
- Argh! STOP, STOP,
STOP, STOP, STOP!

245
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,875
- IT'S FINE, KOUHEI,
I'VE GOT IT!

246
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,458
- NO, IT ISN'T FINE! GET OUT!

247
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,458
SERIOUSLY! I CHANGED MY MIND!

248
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,000
YOU CAN'T BORROW MY CAR!

249
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,583
HIROMI, COME BACK!

250
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,958
- BETTER START SHOPPING
FOR A NEW ONE.

251
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,375
- AW, MAN. AND I
HAVEN'T EVEN FINISHED

252
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,333
PAYING FOR THAT STUPID CAR.

253
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,833
- Hazuki: SEIJI, WHEN DID YOU
GET HERE?

254
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,958
- OKAY, WHAT'S WITH
THE FACES, YOU GUYS?

255
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,291
- KOUHEI, I FOUND THIS
IN YOUR ROOM.

256
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,833
- WHAT'S THAT, KOUHEI?
HAVE YOU TAKEN UP WOODCARVING?

257
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,291
OH, IT'S NOT VERY PRETTY.

258
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,666
- THIS ISN'T A JOKE.
IT'S A JUGUNDO DOLL.

259
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,708
- WHAT'S "JUGUNDO"?

260
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,875
- AS I UNDERSTAND
IT, THAT DOLL IS

261
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,875
A PART OF A SPELL TO
SUMMON EVIL SPIRITS.

262
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,750
- THERE WAS SOME KIND
OF SUPERNATURAL MIASMA

263
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,416
HOVERING OVER
THIS PART OF TOWN.

264
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,666
IT WAS SUSPICIOUS,

265
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,875
AND I CAME HERE TO SEE
WHAT COULD'VE CAUSED IT.

266
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,291
WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS DOLL?
WERE YOU LOOKING FOR TROUBLE?

267
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,625
- NO, OF COURSE I WASN'T.

268
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,125
- REMEMBER THE PROVERB, COUSIN.

269
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,416
"A HALF-BAKED CURE
CAN CAUSE MORE HARM."

270
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,333
AND WITH SPELLS, EVEN DEATH.

271
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,375
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT JUGONDO IS,

272
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,708
YET YOU'RE PLAYING WITH IT

273
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,625
LIKE SOME CHILD TOSSING
ROCKS AT A HORNET'S NEST!

274
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,125
WHAT IN THE WORLD
WERE YOU THINKING?

275
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,750
- NOW, NOW, SEIJI.

276
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,333
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SO HARSH.

277
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,375
- NO, IT'S FINE! YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MAGIC WORKS...

278
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,958
THAT'S THE WHOLE
REASON I WAS STUDYING IT

279
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,583
SO I COULD LEARN ABOUT IT, OKAY?

280
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,083
- KOUHEI?

281
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:19,916
KOUHEI, WAIT!

282
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,541
- YOU THINK I WENT TOO FAR?

283
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,750
- I GUESS NOT.
HE WAS IN THE WRONG HERE.

284
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:27,875
- I'M CONFUSED.

285
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,583
WHY WOULD KOUHEI
START STUDYING MAGIC

286
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,333
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
AND WITHOUT HELP?

287
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,500
- GRANDPA?

288
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,625
- Hazuki: KOUHEI, I'M COMING IN.

289
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,958
- GEEZ, YA EVER
HEAR OF KNOCKING?

290
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,125
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE CHANGING?

291
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,583
- IT'S TOO LATE NOW.
- THESE DOORS NEED LOCKS!

292
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,750
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

293
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,875
- GOING FOR A RUN.

294
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,708
- ( Japanese song playing )

295
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,083
- HURRY UP.
YOU'RE SUCH A WIMP.

296
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,583
- I'M NOT A WIMP, OKAY?

297
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,166
I JUST GET THESE STUPID
CRAMPS IN MY SIDES IS ALL.

298
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,833
I DON'T THINK I CAN
RUN ANYMORE, HAZ.

299
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,958
LET'S TAKE A CAB HOME, OKAY?

300
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,125
- I HOPE YOU'RE KIDDING.

301
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,208
- ( panting )

302
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,208
- WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

303
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,083
- NOTHING. JUST LOOK.

304
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,166
I LOVE BEING A DAY WALKER!

305
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,833
- I KNOW, KID.

306
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,458
COME ON! LET'S KEEP
ENJOYING THE SUNSET!

307
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,875
- ARE YOU SURE? YOU JUST
SAID YOU COULDN'T GO ON!

308
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,583
- I JUST GOT MY SECOND WIND!

309
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:08,875
( laughing )

310
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,208
( groaning )

311
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,541
- ( sighs )

312
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,291
- HEY GRAMPS,
HAVE YOU SEEN HAZUKI?

313
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,750
- SHE WENT TO HER ROOM,
I BELIEVE.

314
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,791
- THANKS.

315
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,500
- KOUHEI, SIT DOWN.

316
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,541
- OKAY.

317
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,291
- IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TRAIN,
THEN GO TO HIM.

318
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,083
- GRANDPA?

319
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,541
- ANOTHER MIASMA.

320
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,375
MUST BE KOUHEI AGAIN.

321
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,583
WILL HE EVER LEARN?

322
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,166
- ( coughs )

323
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,125
- KAORU!

324
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,291
- I'M OKAY. BUT, KOUHEI...

325
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,041
- MARIO... IT'S YOU.

326
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,833
- WHERE IS MISTRESS LUNA?

327
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,250
- GET OUT OF HERE!

328
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,541
- I DID NOT COME HERE
TO BE DENIED.

329
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,541
- Kouhei: TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON FIRST!

330
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,666
- THERE'S NO TIME. TAKE HAZUKI
AND GET OUT OF HERE NOW!

331
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,500
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

332
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,333
- SO THE OTHER VAMPIRES
HAVE COME FOR HER, RIGHT?

333
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,291
I KNOW I MAY NOT BE
THE SMARTEST GUY AROUND,

334
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,375
BUT I CAN GUESS THAT MUCH!

335
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,791
I WANNA FIGHT 'EM, TOO!

336
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,333
- USE YOUR HEAD!

337
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,208
- I DON'T HAVE POWERS LIKE YOU,
I KNOW THAT, BUT EVEN SO...

338
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:42,166
I CARE ABOUT HAZUKI AND
I WANNA PROTECT HER MYSELF!

339
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,541
- THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO TAKE
HER, KOUHEI! DON'T YOU SEE?

340
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,250
- GETTING HER OUT OF HERE
IS HER ONLY CHANCE!

341
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,166
IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT HAZUKI,
THEN YOU HAVE TO GO!

342
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:01,916
( grunting )

343
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,791
- ( shatters )

344
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:27,958
- NO!

345
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,250
- LET ME GO! WE HAVE TO GO BACK!

346
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,750
STOP! WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE
GRANDPA AND ELFRIEDE BEHIND!

347
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,833
- THEY CAN TAKE CARE
OF THEMSELVES.

348
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,291
THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

349
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,333
- STUPID. STUPID!

350
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,916
- ( both groaning )

351
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:09,833
- WHERE IS SHE?

352
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:14,958
A BARRIER!

353
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,708
WHAT IS THIS?

354
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,500
- GODS OF THE NORTH,
THE SOUTH, THE EAST, THE WEST.

355
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,958
LEND YOUR STRENGTH TO ME.

356
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,291
SEAL THIS HOME,
CLEANSE IT OF EVIL.

357
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,666
I OFFER YOU THIS SACRIFICE.

358
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,250
- ( explosions booming )

359
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,625
- OH, GOD. NO.

360
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,875
PLEASE.

361
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,791
NO!

362
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,125
( sobs )

363
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,125
- Ryuuhei: ELFRIEDE.

364
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,250
- Elfriede: YES?

365
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,041
- I'M SO SORRY.

366
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:30,000
- NO. IT WAS
MY CHOICE TO STAY.

367
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,208
- THIS WASN'T MY INTENTION.

368
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,916
I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

369
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,291
- THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE.

370
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,333
- ( both panting )

371
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,000
- OH, NO.

372
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,916
- THAT FIRE. IT'S NOT...

373
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,208
IT'S NOT THE HOUSE.

374
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:33,708
KOUHEI. IT'S NOT THE HOUSE,
IT'S A COINCIDENCE RIGHT? RIGHT?

375
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,041
- GRANDPA.

376
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,208
- KOUHEI, WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

377
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,541
- Kouhei: GRANDPA!

378
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,416
- Yayoi: TODAY A SPECIAL GUEST
GETS TO ASK THE RIDDLE!

379
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,375
ME, YAYOI, THE GREAT TRAINER
OF SUPERNATURAL COMBAT!

380
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:09,000
OKAY, WHAT ALWAYS ENDS
ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING?

381
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,458
LITTLE HAZUKI GOT THIS
RIGHT OFF THE BAT!

382
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:14,416
FULL, FULL, FULL, MOON!
GIVE UP?

383
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,750
THE LETTER "G"!
( chuckles )

384
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,500
NEXT TIME ON MOON PHASE,

385
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:22,583
EPISODE 18, "YAHOO!
I'LL SEE YOU SOON!"

386
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,458
AND I GUESS I WILL, WON'T I?

387
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,666
GOODNIGHT, KOUHEI.
