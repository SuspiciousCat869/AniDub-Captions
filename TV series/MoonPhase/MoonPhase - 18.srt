1
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,750
- ( grunts )

2
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,041
- NOT TOO BAD!

3
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,750
- OH, WELL THAT'S JUST BECAUSE
YOUR ATTACKS ARE SO OBVIOUS.

4
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,666
- MY ATTACKS ARE OBVIOUS, HUH?

5
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,541
FINE. LET'S SEE YOU BLOCK THIS.

6
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,125
( exclaiming )

7
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,458
HOW OBVIOUS IS THIS?

8
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,833
- THAT WAS TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR.

9
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,333
- WELL, I GUESS THAT'S JUST
THE FRUIT OF MY DAILY DILIGENCE.

10
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,333
- MEET THE FRUIT JUICER!

11
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,333
( grunts )

12
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,666
- SWINGING A STICK AROUND

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,291
WITH NO TECHNIQUE IS NO
WAY TO WIN A SWORD FIGHT.

14
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,500
UNCALLED FOR...

15
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,041
- YOU SEE? TALENT WILL
ALWAYS BEAT DILIGENCE.

16
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,083
- YOU JUST GOT LUCKY,
DEMON FREAK!

17
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,791
- ( unintelligible chatter )

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,625
- ( theme song playing )

19
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

20
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,958
- Haiji: STOP FIGHTING,
YOU BIG BABIES!

21
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,708
GOOD. KAORU WAS STARTING
TO GET A HEADACHE.

22
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:04,000
- OH, WE WEREN'T FIGHTING.
UH, WE WERE JUST PRETENDING.

23
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,583
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

24
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,666
WE WERE PLAYING SHRINE MAIDEN
BEATS UP THE DEMON INTERLOPER.

25
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,708
- THAT IS SO NOT WHAT
WE WERE PLAYING!

26
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,708
IT WAS VAMPIRE THROWS
DOWN ON SHORT UGLY GIRL.

27
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,083
- DID YOU SAY "UGLY"?

28
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,875
- NO. ACTUALLY I SAID
SHORT AND UGLY.

29
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,083
- UM, GIRLS?

30
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,375
( clears throat )

31
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,208
KAORU SAYS YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK

32
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,916
BEHIND YOU RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

33
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,791
- Both: OH, MASTER YAYOI.

34
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,000
- YAHOO! HI-HO!
I'LL SEE YOU SOON!

35
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,666
- Yayoi: IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS

36
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,250
SINCE YOU CAME HERE
SEEKING SHELTER.

37
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,000
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

38
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,666
TELL ME, IN THOSE EIGHT MONTHS,

39
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,750
DO YOU FEEL YOU'VE BEEN
FULFILLING YOUR DUTIES?

40
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,833
THE CONDITION OF YOUR
SANCTUARY WAS THAT YOU

41
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,083
LOOK AFTER AND MAINTAIN THE
MIDO FAMILY'S FUTTSU SHRINE.

42
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,916
I DON'T REMEMBER ANY STIPULATION
ABOUT FIGHTING IN FRONT OF IT.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,750
- THIS IS YOUR FAULT, YOU KNOW.

44
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,250
- HEY, YOU STARTED IT.

45
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,958
- NUH-UH. STUPID DEMON GIRL.

46
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,458
- WHATEVER. YOU UGLY...

47
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,458
- ARE YOU QUITE FINISHED?

48
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,750
- Girls: SORRY, MASTER.

49
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,416
- I DON'T SEE WHY
I GOT YELLED AT.

50
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,458
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED
TO HAVE A SWORD MATCH.

51
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,625
TROUBLEMAKER.

52
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,000
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- WHAT?

53
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,708
- WE NEVER FIGURED OUT WHO WAS
THE WINNER OF THE MATCH, DID WE?

54
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,708
WE GOT INTERRUPTED BEFORE WE
COULD SEE WHO WAS STRONGEST.

55
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,208
- YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT AGAIN?

56
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,833
- AND GET YELLED AT BY THE
MASTER AGAIN? NO THANKS!

57
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,250
- THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
TO MAKE IT SOMETHING

58
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,041
WE WON'T GET IN TROUBLE FOR.

59
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,958
- SOMETHING MASTER YAYOI
WOULD WANT US TO DO ANYWAY.

60
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,666
FINE, THEN.
YOUR CHALLENGE IS ACCEPTED.

61
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,666
- UM. SISTER...

62
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,833
- GOOD. THEN WE'LL MAKE IT
BEST 2 OUT OF 3.

63
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,291
ROUND ONE! MOPPING THE FLOORS!

64
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,500
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT,
DEMON GIRL!

65
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,666
- BRING IT, ZIT-FACE!
I'M A MOPPING GOD!

66
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,708
- YOU WISH!

67
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,416
- LET'S GO, MOPPERS.
LET'S GO.

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,208
- Hazuki: ROUND TWO!
REPAPERING THE SCREEN DOORS!

69
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,541
- Hikaru: ROUND THREE!
POLISHING THE PILLARS!

70
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,291
- I GUESS MY SCOLDING
REALLY SANK IN.

71
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,500
- Hikaru: HAZUKI, MASTER.

72
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,458
- Hazuki: THAT WAS LAME.
SAY IT AGAIN,

73
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,083
BUT THIS TIME SAY
IT WITH GUSTO!

74
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,583
- HAZUKI, MASTER!

75
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,250
- GOOD! MUCH BETTER.

76
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,083
- ( groans )
THIS IS SO HUMILIATING!

77
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:38,375
- THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
CLEANED FASTER. LOSER.

78
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:42,291
- SO, KAORU. DO I WANT
TO KNOW? OR DON'T I?

79
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,833
- HIKARU LOST THE
CLEANING CONTEST

80
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,250
SO SHE HAS TO CALL MY
MASTER "MASTER," MASTER!

81
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,375
- UH-HUH.

82
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,416
- WATCH THE ROCK!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

83
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,333
- JUST OLD, DEAR.

84
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,916
- HERE. LET ME TAKE CARE
OF THIS FOR YOU, GRANDMOTHER.

85
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,125
- SUCH A SWEET CHILD.

86
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,458
- OH! IT'S NOTHING.

87
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,833
I MEAN, IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO

88
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,791
WHEN YOU AND MASTER YAYOI
ARE PUTTING UP WITH ME.

89
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,625
I OWE YOU SO MUCH.

90
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,250
- OH, YOU OWE US NOTHING,
MY DEAR. YOU'RE A PLEASURE.

91
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:24,458
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT,
GRANDMOTHER. I'M A BRAT.

92
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:28,291
- REALLY? AND I WAS GOING TO
TELL YOU OUR MIDO FAMILY SECRET.

93
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,000
- YEAH?

94
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,250
- Hikaru: WHAT IS THIS,
A NATURE HIKE?

95
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,625
- JUST SHUT UP.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE, I THINK.

96
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,166
- ( gasping )

97
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,458
- IT LOOKS LIKE A FAIRYTALE.

98
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,125
- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THIS
PLACE IS EVEN REAL, ISN'T IT?

99
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:03,208
- YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IT'S LIKE A PAINTING.

100
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,875
- YEAH, OR LIKE A DREAM OR
SOMETHING. IT'S GREAT, HUH?

101
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,208
HEY, HOLD ON!

102
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,875
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ELSE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY?

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,333
- OH, RIGHT.
HAZUKI MASTER, MASTER, MASTER.

104
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,333
- HEY, LOOK.

105
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,958
- ( giggling )

106
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,541
- HEY. WE SHOULD COME BACK
HERE AGAIN TOMORROW.

107
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,375
- OKAY!
- YEAH!

108
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:45,666
- I JUST WISH THAT...
I WISH KOUHEI WAS HERE.

109
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,458
- I'M SORRY. WHAT?

110
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,875
- OH, NOTHING!
IT WAS SILLY.

111
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,916
- ( chattering )

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,125
- IT'S THE PRETTIEST
PLACE I'VE EVER SEEN!

113
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,875
- THERE WERE FLOWERS EVERYWHERE!

114
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,041
- SO I GOT YOU THESE.

115
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,708
THEY'RE FROM THIS AMAZING PLACE
THAT GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME ABOUT.

116
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,500
I GOTTA KEEP YOUR ALTAR LOOKING
SPIFFY, YOU KNOW?

117
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,250
I MISS YOU, GRANDPA.

118
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,708
ELFRIEDE.

119
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,166
- NOW BE CAREFUL. THE PACK'S
A LITTLE HEAVY THIS MONTH.

120
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,083
- I'LL BE OKAY.
THANKS, GRANDMOTHER.

121
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,708
- YOU LOOK GOOD ENOUGH TO SPREAD
ON CRACKERS, MASTER.

122
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,375
- THANKS, HAIJI.

123
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,416
- AND LIT UP
LIKE A LANTERN, TOO.

124
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,208
EXCITED ABOUT SEEING YOUR
GOOD FRIEND, I SUPPOSE.

125
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,583
- OH. YEAH, I GUESS SO.

126
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,416
I MEAN, I KNOW I CAN'T BE
WITH HIM WHILE HE'S IN TRAINING.

127
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,250
AND I WOULDN'T BOTHER HIM IF IT
WASN'T FOR THE FULL MOON THING,

128
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,875
BUT SINCE IT'S ONLY ONCE A MONTH
I GUESS IT'S OKAY.

129
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,458
- COME ON, HAZUKI, YOU KNOW
YOU'RE DYING TO SEE HIM.

130
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,166
JUST SAY IT.

131
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,208
- HAZUKI WHAT?

132
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,583
- WAIT, YOU MEAN...

133
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,666
- DID I HEAR A "MASTER"
AFTER THAT?

134
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,583
- HEY, THAT WAS DAYS AGO.
GET OVER YOURSELF!

135
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,375
- A DEAL IS A DEAL,
DEAL-BREAKER!

136
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,333
BYE!

137
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,375
- HAVE A GOOD TIME NOW, DEAR.

138
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,250
- SHE'S REALLY
DIFFERENT, ISN'T SHE,

139
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,000
THAN SHE WAS WHEN
SHE GOT HERE.

140
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,458
- IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS SINCE
THEY SHOWED UP LOOKING FOR

141
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,083
A SAFE PLACE TO HIDE.

142
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:06,875
SHE'S HAD SOME TIME TO ABSORB
HER LOSSES AND MOVE ON.

143
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,333
- IT WAS HARD
SEEING HER SO DEPRESSED.

144
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,291
- IT WAS. I'M JUST GLAD SHE
HAD YOU TWO GIRLS AROUND.

145
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,458
WHO KNOWS WHERE SHE WOULD BE
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU?

146
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,958
I DO BELIEVE IT WAS YOU WHO
BROUGHT HER BACK TO LIFE.

147
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,666
- BUT, NOW THAT SHE'S HAPPY,

148
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,333
DO YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA
BE ENEMIES AGAIN?

149
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,375
- NO.

150
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,958
- WHAT AM I GETTING SAD ABOUT?

151
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,041
JUST 'CAUSE I'M
LEAVING THE SHRINE?

152
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,875
DON'T I REMEMBER WHO
I'M GOING TO SEE? KOUHEI!

153
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,458
( panting )

154
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,000
( sighs )

155
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,583
FULL, FULL, FULL MOON!

156
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,833
( gasps )

157
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,875
KOUHEI?

158
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,958
THIS IS THE SECOND MONTH
IN A ROW HE HASN'T BEEN HERE.

159
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,291
I KNOW HE CAN'T STAY
IN HERE ALL THE TIME,

160
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,250
BUT DIDN'T HE KNOW
I WAS COMING?

161
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,666
WAIT A MINUTE.

162
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,291
I'M NOT JUST GONNA SIT HERE.
I'M GONNA GO FIND HIM.

163
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,541
THERE YOU ARE.

164
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,833
I'VE BEEN WALKING FOREVER.

165
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,958
I'M PRETTY SURE THIS
IS WHERE I SAW HIM.

166
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,541
GEEZ! WHAT'S HE DOING OUT
SO FAR, ANYWAY?

167
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,458
PROBABLY LOST. STUPID KOUHEI!

168
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,000
WHERE ARE YOU?

169
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,166
- ( rustling )

170
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,291
- IS THAT HIM?

171
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,416
WAIT. THIS ENERGY...

172
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,916
WHOEVER IT IS,
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT KOUHEI.

173
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,000
( gasps )

174
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,000
- ( growling )

175
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,916
( roaring )

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,375
- NO! STAY AWAY FROM ME!

177
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,583
( screams )

178
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:15,708
OH, MAN! WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE
A BLOB MONSTER?

179
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,958
I HATE BLOB MONSTERS!

180
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,000
OH, GREAT! IT'S A SPIRIT
SUCKER. THIS IS SO NOT GOOD.

181
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,750
KOUHEI, WHERE ARE YOU?
I HARDLY HAVE ANY POWER LEFT.

182
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,916
I NEED BLOOD! HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO FIGHT THIS THING?

183
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,791
- ( roaring )

184
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,875
- I HATE THIS. IT'S LIKE...

185
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,000
IT'S LIKE THAT NIGHT

186
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:04,458
WHEN ALL WE COULD DO WAS RUN.
WE WERE POWERLESS TO FIGHT BACK.

187
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,958
BUT AT LEAST KOUHEI
WAS WITH ME.

188
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,958
NOW... NOW I'M ALL ALONE.

189
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,833
WHERE ARE YOU? I NEED YOU.

190
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,625
( screaming )

191
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,416
NO, ALL OF KOUHEI'S THINGS!

192
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,875
( screaming )

193
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,958
- Kouhei: HAZUKI? HAZUKI.

194
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,083
- KOUHEI! IT'S YOU.

195
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,375
- YEAH, OF COURSE IT'S ME.
WHO DO YOU THINK IT WAS, GOOF?

196
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,916
THAT'S A TIGHT GRIP
YOU MUST'VE REALLY MISSED ME.

197
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,375
I'M HERE NOW.

198
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,416
- LIKE I EVEN CARE. I'M
ONLY HERE FOR YOUR BLOOD.

199
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,875
HAS IT BEEN A WHILE?

200
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,291
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE!

201
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,583
SO DON'T GO THINKING
I'M LONELY WITHOUT YOU.

202
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,500
- WELL, I WAS LONELY.

203
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,333
- KOUHEI?

204
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,541
UM, NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,

205
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,958
I WAS WONDERING,
CAN I KISS YOU?

206
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,083
- YOU COULD. EXCEPT...

207
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,666
- WHAT, DO YOU NOT WANT ME TO?

208
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,208
- NO. IT'S JUST THAT THIS TIME
I THINK I'D LIKE TO KISS YOU,

209
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,458
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

210
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,166
( evil laughter )

211
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,666
- ( screaming )

212
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,541
- KOUHEI!

213
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,833
- COME ON.
DON'T YOU WANNA KISS ME, HAZUKI?

214
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,416
YEAH.

215
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,958
HAZUKI!

216
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,750
- ( exclaims in fear )

217
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,166
IT'S GONNA SUCK OUT MY SPIRIT!

218
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,958
- ( laughing )

219
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,916
- KOUHEI, WHERE ARE YOU?
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE!

220
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,958
I NEED YOU.

221
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,583
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE
LEFT ME ALONE.

222
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,500
KOUHEI, NO!

223
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,791
- Kouhei: DID YOU CALL ME?

224
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,041
- ( monster snarling )

225
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,416
- SO, WHAT'S UP?

226
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
- IS... IS IT REALLY YOU NOW?

227
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,083
- WELL, OF COURSE IT'S ME, BRAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

228
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT AM I DOING?

229
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,833
ISN'T IT A LITTLE OBVIOUS?

230
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,541
WAIT! KOUHEI CAN'T SEE SPIRITS.
HE DOESN'T KNOW!

231
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,416
- OH, YEAH. YOU MEAN
YOUR LITTLE BUDDY THERE.

232
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,583
- ( screams )

233
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,250
- THESE THINGS AREN'T VERY
STRONG. I CAN HANDLE THIS.

234
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,750
THAT WHICH IS NOT
OF THIS WORLD,

235
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,750
BRINGER OF DARKNESS AND
CREATURE OF THE SHADOWS.

236
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,875
- IS KOUHEI DOING
AN INCANTATION?

237
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,916
- IN THE REALM OF THE LIVING
HERE YOU WILL DO NO MORE HARM.

238
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:43,041
RETURN NOW FROM WHENCE YOU CAME!
I COMMAND YOU, FOUL DEMON!

239
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,791
- ( monster screaming )

240
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,083
- ( explosion )

241
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,875
- VERY WELL DONE, KOUHEI.

242
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,791
- YES. I'D SAY HE PASSED THE
TEST WITH FLYING COLORS.

243
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,833
THE YOUNG MAN'S MADE REMARKABLE
STRIDES THESE LAST FEW MONTHS.

244
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,250
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER
HOW LITTLE HE KNEW BEFORE.

245
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,916
IMPRESSIVE.

246
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,375
- SO, DO YOU THINK
HE WAS PROTECTING HER?

247
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:21,041
- UH-HUH. HAZUKI SHOULD
BE WITH HIM BY NOW.

248
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,291
IS THAT WHY YOU CAME, HIKARU,
TO SEE SHE GOT THERE SAFELY?

249
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,916
- KOUHEI IS KAORU'S FIANCEE,
NOT HAZUKI'S STUPID SLAVE.

250
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
IT'S MY SISTER HE SHOULD
BE WORRYING ABOUT.

251
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,583
- YOU OKAY?

252
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,291
- KOUHEI, WHERE DID YOU
LEARN TO DO THAT?

253
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,916
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN
ABLE TO SEE SPIRITS.

254
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,333
IS THIS ALL BECAUSE
OF YOUR TRAINING?

255
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,916
YOU MUST BE WORKING HARD.

256
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,041
- I GUESS. I'M DOING EVERYTHING
SENSEI YAYOI TOLD ME TO.

257
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,208
BUT IF YOU WANNA
KNOW THE TRUTH,

258
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,625
THAT'S THE FIRST
TIME I'VE BEEN ABLE TO

259
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,125
PULL OFF SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

260
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,750
- THE FIRST TIME?

261
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,166
- ( laughs )

262
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,000
- THANK YOU, KOUHEI.

263
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,250
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT DOPEY
LOOK ABOUT, SHORT STUFF?

264
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,250
ARE YOU OVERWHELMED
BY MY RUGGED GOOD LOOKS?

265
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,166
- MAYBE IT WAS THE STENCH.
YOU SMELL LIKE A PIG.

266
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,541
- I'M LIVING IN A FREAKING TREE!

267
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,958
- EXCUSES, EXCUSES,
YOU BIG OINKER!

268
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,541
- OH, YEAH? YOU VAMPIRE!

269
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,833
- WHAT, ARE YOU RETARDED?

270
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,750
"YOU VAMPIRE"? LIKE
THAT'S EVEN AN INSULT!

271
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,958
- IF ALL VAMPIRES ARE LIKE YOU,
THEN IT IS AN INSULT!

272
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,833
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW,
YOU BIG JERK?

273
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,166
- I KNOW THAT YOU
ARE REALLY STUPID.

274
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,375
- Aruto: JEDA?

275
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,000
- MISTRESS ARTE. GOOD EVENING.

276
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,750
- THIS PLACE, IT'S FILTHY.

277
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,666
- Vargas: YOU COULD
HAVE AT LEAST CLEANED

278
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,166
BEFORE WE ARRIVED, JEDA.

279
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,875
- Jeda: I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN
BOTHERED BY FILTH.

280
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,125
- SO? ANY MORE CLUES?

281
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,750
- NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL.

282
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,333
- NOTHING? WHAT HAVE
YOU BEEN DOING?

283
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,041
- I DID FIND THIS PLACE,
OF COURSE.

284
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,083
YOUR GRATITUDE IS
OVERWHELMING, VARGAS.

285
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,375
- THERE'S NOTHING HERE.
IT'S USELESS.

286
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:41,541
- MISTRESS ARTE.
I'M NOT POSITIVE IT'S HER,

287
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,583
BUT THERE'S A PLACE THAT'S
EMITTING STRANGE WAVES.

288
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,833
I THINK IT MIGHT BE
WORTH INVESTIGATING.

289
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,583
MISTRESS?

290
00:21:55,666 --> 00:22:00,750
- I DON'T REALLY CARE. I CAME
HERE BECAUSE I WAS TOLD TO.

291
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,875
I LOOK FOR HER
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD TO.

292
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,416
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO MEET HER.

293
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,708
WHY SHOULD I? I HATE HER.

294
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,375
I HATE HER.

295
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,625
- ( theme song playing )

296
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

297
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:03,666
- Kouhei: HAZUKI,
IT'S RIDDLE TIME! READY?

298
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,625
FULL, FULL, FULL, MOON!

299
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,458
RIDDLE, RIDDLE, RIDDLE, RIDDLE,
RIDDLE, RIDDLE, RIDDLE, RIDDLE,

300
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,625
RIDDLE, RIDDLE, RIDDLE, RIDDLE,
RIDDLE, RIDDLE, RIDDLE, RIDDLE!

301
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:15,541
OKAY. NEXT TIME ON
MOON PHASE, EPISODE 19,

302
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,333
"DAY ON THE MOUNTAIN, MONKEY IN
THE SPA, THE CAT'S WHISKERS...

303
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,125
AND WHO ARE YOU?"
OH, I'M SORRY.

304
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,666
IS THAT NOT WHAT
"RIDDLE TIME" MEANS?

305
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,541
I HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION.
