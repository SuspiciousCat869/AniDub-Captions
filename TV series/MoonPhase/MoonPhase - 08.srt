1
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,000
- Hiromi: COUNT HEINRICH
VON KINKEL.

2
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,125
MEMBER OF ONE OF THE MOST

3
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,458
ILLUSTRIOUS NOBLE
FAMILIES IN EUROPE.

4
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,750
KNOWN AS "THE SORCERER
OF LIGHT AND SPACE."

5
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,750
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

6
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:31,791
MASTER OF THE OCCULT AND SCHOLAR
OF ARCHAIC RELIGIOUS PRACTICES.

7
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,083
SO, BASICALLY THIS KINKEL GUY

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,208
IS THE HIGH MUCKETY-MUCK
OF ALL THINGS WEIRD,

9
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,833
BUT BEING INVITED
TO THIS EXHIBIT

10
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,833
MEANS GOOD THINGS FOR
THE MAGAZINE, RIGHT?

11
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,250
- WE'RE NOT HERE TO LOOK
AT HIS ARTWORK.

12
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,416
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE THE
COUNT WANTS A FAVOR.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,250
HIS OFFICIAL REASON
FOR COMING TO JAPAN

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,375
IS TO CHECK ON THE EXHIBIT,

15
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,250
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING
GOES SMOOTHLY.

16
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,000
BUT HIS REAL REASON
IS TO TOUR SPIRITUAL HOT SPOTS

17
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,833
AND FURTHER HIS RESEARCH
ON THE OCCULT.

18
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,291
- WHAT'S A HOT SPOT?

19
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,875
- JUST SOMEPLACE
FREQUENTLY ACKNOWLEDGED

20
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,708
AS HAVING PARANORMAL ACTIVITY.

21
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,791
- I DON'T GET IT.

22
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,083
IF HE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THE EXHIBIT,

23
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,958
THEN WHY DID HE
AGREE TO OUR INTERVIEW?

24
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,625
- WELL, I BELIEVE THAT TIES INTO
THE FAVOR HE WANTED TO ASK US.

25
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,000
I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S GONNA
WANT YOU TO BE HIS GUIDE,

26
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,166
IN WHICH CASE YOU BETTER COME
BACK WITH SOME JUICY GOSSIP!

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,541
- ( she exclaims )
- ( he laughs )

28
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,291
- ( theme song playing )

29
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

30
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,458
- I HAVE FAILED YOU, MASTER.
FORGIVE ME.

31
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,791
I NEVER INTENDED FOR YOU
TO HAVE TO COME HERE YOURSELF.

32
00:02:55,875 --> 00:03:00,333
- AND YET I FIND I MUST.
HOW UNFORTUNATE FOR US BOTH.

33
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,333
- I'M AFRAID MY MISTAKE
WAS IN WAITING.

34
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,208
I THOUGHT THAT WHEN
THE FULL MOON CAME

35
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,375
AND THE MISTRESS
SOUGHT HER KISS,

36
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:09,125
I WOULD BE ABLE
TO FOLLOW HER KI.

37
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,833
I WAS WRONG.

38
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,833
I KNOW SHE DRANK THAT NIGHT,
BUT SOMEHOW I WAS BLOCKED.

39
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,375
I COULDN'T SENSE HER WELL
ENOUGH TO FOLLOW.

40
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,833
AND I LOST THE CHANCE
TO BRING HER BACK. I'M SORRY.

41
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,791
- YOUR MISTAKE WAS
IN UNDERESTIMATING HER.

42
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,208
A MISTAKE I SEEM TO HAVE
MADE AS WELL.

43
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,125
I HAD HOPED SHE WOULD BE
CARELESS AND GIVE HERSELF AWAY.

44
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,416
BUT IT SEEMS
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

45
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,875
EVEN I'VE BEEN UNABLE
TO SENSE HER LOCATION.

46
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,291
SO I CAN HARDLY FAULT YOU.

47
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,416
CAN I?

48
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,166
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

49
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,750
- TO THE GALLERY. I BELIEVE IT'S
TIME I MADE SOME NEW FRIENDS.

50
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:13,250
COULD HE TELL? COULD HE TELL
THAT I LIED TO HIM?

51
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,416
I LIED.

52
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,958
THAT MEANS I TRULY AM FREE.

53
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:25,958
BUT HE CAN'T FIND OUT. NOT YET.
IT'S STILL TOO DANGEROUS.

54
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:30,333
HE CAN'T FIND OUT THAT KOUHEI
MORIOKA IS THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

55
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,500
- WHERE DID IT GO?

56
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:44,375
AW, THIS IS GREAT! HEY, GRAMPS!
DO YOU KNOW WHERE MY GEAR IS?

57
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,250
I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE!

58
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,416
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

59
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
- I SAID DO YOU KNOW
WHERE MY GEAR IS?

60
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,416
- YOU DIDN'T ACCIDENTALLY
SELL IT, DID YOU?

61
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,625
- OF COURSE NOT! IDIOT BOY.
ACTS LIKE I'M THE SENILE ONE.

62
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,166
I DIDN'T LOSE MY CAMERA.

63
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,083
- ( he sighs )
- I'M SORRY, GRAMPA.

64
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,916
IT'S JUST, I REALLY NEED
THIS GIG TO GO WELL,

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,333
AND WITHOUT
MY CAMERA THERE'S NO GIG.

66
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,791
- CALM DOWN.
YOU TAKE THINGS SO SERIOUSLY!

67
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,291
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

68
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,333
- ( crickets chirping )
- ( dog barking )

69
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,750
- I'M DOING WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO,
MAMA. I'M WAITING.

70
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,791
- HAZUKI?

71
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?
IT'S DANGEROUS.

72
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,875
- GO AWAY, PLEASE.

73
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,208
- GO AWAY.

74
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,583
- A SLAVE SHOULD NEVER INTERRUPT

75
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,583
HIS MASTER WHEN
SHE'S CONCENTRATING.

76
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,791
- DEFINITELY NOT.

77
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,583
- FINE THEN, STAY UP HERE.
SEE IF I CARE.

78
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,291
FALL ASLEEP UP HERE AND GET
CAUGHT IN THE SUN, BY ALL MEANS.

79
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,083
DON'T EXPECT ME TO SCRAPE
YOU OFF THE ROOF WHEN YA DO.

80
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,583
- WHY NOT? YOU
SHOULD BE USED TO IT

81
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,125
WITH THE GRODY TOAST YOU MAKE.

82
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,750
- YEAH! GRODY.

83
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,583
- AH!

84
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,583
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
STOLE MY WORK GEAR!

85
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,250
- SO, I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE
A GOOD REASON

86
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,000
FOR STEALING MY VERY EXPENSIVE
CAMERA EQUIPMENT.

87
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,000
- DON'T BE STUPID.
OF COURSE I DO.

88
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,125
MY MOTHER COULD BE COMING TO

89
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,041
FIND ME ANYTIME
NOW, YOU KNOW.

90
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,708
BUT, IF SHE'S LOST OR SHE'S IN
TROUBLE OR SOMETHING,

91
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,083
SHE MIGHT NEED ME TO HELP
HER WHEN SHE GETS CLOSER.

92
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,833
I HAVE TO BE READY.

93
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,833
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

94
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,625
JUST MAKE SURE YOU
ASK NEXT TIME, OKAY?

95
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,416
I NEED THAT STUFF FOR WORK.

96
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,416
- OOH!

97
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,541
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

98
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,958
WHOA! COME, ON.

99
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,625
COULDN'T THEY EVEN TAKE THE TIME
TO CLOSE THE FREAKIN' CURTAINS?

100
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:49,541
HEY! YOU'RE KIDDING ME!
THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S LEGAL.

101
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,416
IN FACT, I'M NOT EVEN
SURE THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH

102
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,083
TO KNOW IF
IT'S ILLEGAL.

103
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,291
WELL, THEY'RE ALL LUCKY.

104
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,083
I MEAN IT COULD'VE BEEN
SOME PERVERT UP HERE.

105
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:05,125
NO WAY! IS THAT... IT CAN'T BE.
IS THAT YOUR...

106
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,333
- ( he screams )

107
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,791
- MAMA!

108
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,875
- REALLY?

109
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,541
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! IT'S MAMA.

110
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,291
SHE CAME FOR ME JUST
LIKE SHE SAID SHE WOULD!

111
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,000
MAMA!

112
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,041
- HAZUKI! HAZUKI, WAIT!

113
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,416
- WAIT FOR ME!

114
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,541
- HEY! STOP!

115
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,166
- KOUHEI!

116
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,375
- TOO LATE. SHE'S GONE.

117
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,958
- ( Haiji whimpers )

118
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,500
- HAIJI? HAIJI!

119
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,625
HAIJI, WHO DID THIS TO YOU?
ARE YOU OKAY?

120
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,708
HAZUKI AND HER MOTHER,
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY WENT?

121
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,833
- KOUHEI!

122
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,250
YOU'RE WRONG.
I WASN'T THE ONE YOU SAW.

123
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,333
- THEN WHO WAS IT?

124
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,333
- NOT ME, BUT AN
ILLUSION OF MYSELF

125
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,333
USED TO LURE MY
DAUGHTER AWAY.

126
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,916
IT COULD NOT BE ME, KOUHEI,

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,833
NOT IN THAT FORM,
BECAUSE I NO LONGER EXIST.

128
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,041
- NO LONGER EXIST?
BUT WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

129
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,916
IF YOU NO LONGER EXIST,
THEN WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,166
- A PHANTOM. AN ILLUSION.

131
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,416
MERELY A MESSENGER
LEFT FOR HAZUKI.

132
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,583
THE ONLY WAY MY TRUE SELF KNEW
TO LEAVE HER THOUGHTS BEHIND

133
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,375
WHEN SHE WAS
FORCED TO LEAVE THIS WORLD.

134
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,583
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
"SHE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE."

135
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,666
COME ON, YOU DON'T MEAN
THAT SHE'S... THAT SHE'S DEAD.

136
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,541
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
RIGHT? HER MOM'S NOT DEAD!

137
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,250
- AND YET YOU TOLD HER THAT HER
MOTHER WAS COMING FOR HER.

138
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,541
YOU KEPT HER HOPE ALIVE.

139
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,166
DIDN'T YOU REALIZE HOW
CRUEL THAT WOULD BE?

140
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,125
HOW COULD YOU
MAKE THAT PROMISE?

141
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:12,333
- I COULDN'T TELL HER THE TRUTH.
I COULDN'T.

142
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,083
I'M AN ILLUSION, YES,
BUT ENDOWED WITH A MEMORY.

143
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,833
I COULDN'T BEAR TO
HURT THE LITTLE GIRL

144
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:20,958
THAT I REMEMBER
LOVING SO VERY MUCH.

145
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,083
PLEASE. TAKE GOOD CARE
OF MY DAUGHTER.

146
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,083
YOU'RE ALL THAT SHE HAS.

147
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,666
- WAIT, BEFORE YOU GO,

148
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,083
TELL ME HOW MY DAUGHTER'S
SHIKIGAMI MESSENGER

149
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,500
CAME TO BE IN YOUR POSSESSION
WHILE YOU WERE ALIVE.

150
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,666
- I'M SORRY. MY MEMORY
IS NOT THAT COMPLETE.

151
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,375
BUT I CAN SAY THIS.

152
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,250
THE ONE WHO HAS TAKEN MY
DAUGHTER MAY KNOW SOMETHING.

153
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,291
FIND HER.

154
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,750
AND PLEASE, HURRY.

155
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:58,500
- OKAY. WE'VE GOTTA SAVE HAZUKI.
THAT'S STRAIGHTFORWARD ENOUGH.

156
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,250
AW, MAN, I TOTALLY FORGOT.

157
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,958
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO LOOK FOR HER!

158
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,583
DAMN! WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO?

159
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,666
THE TRAIL'S
PROBABLY COLD BY NOW!

160
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,666
- CALM DOWN. I MIGHT HAVE
AN IDEA WHERE SHE WAS TAKEN.

161
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,291
- ( he chuckles )

162
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,166
- ( wind howling )
- ( newspaper rustling )

163
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,291
- MASTER, I'M HUMBLED BY YOUR
POWER AS ALWAYS.

164
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,791
THAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED
IN ONE NIGHT

165
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,375
WHAT I HAVE FAILED
TO ACHIEVE FOR SO LONG.

166
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,458
I WILL PREPARE
FOR OUR RETURN TO THE CASTLE

167
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,375
NOW THAT YOU HAVE
WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR.

168
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,125
- NOT QUITE YET, MY DEAR.

169
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,458
THERE IS SOME BUSINESS
YET TO TAKE CARE OF

170
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,750
BEFORE WE CAN RETURN
TO SCHWARTZ QUELLE.

171
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:19,041
SHORTLY, MISTRESS LUNA'S SLAVES
WILL BE COMING TO RESCUE HER.

172
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,125
IT IS MY INTENTION
TO ENSURE THEY NEVER LEAVE.

173
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,541
UNDERSTOOD?

174
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,583
THE GREAT MASTER MUST NEVER
BE TOLD OF THIS LITTLE MISHAP.

175
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,250
I WON'T RUN THE RISK OF HIM
EVER LEARNING MISTRESS LUNA

176
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,666
LEFT THE CONFINES
OF SCHWARTZ QUELLE.

177
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,375
SO, WE WILL ERASE ALL EVIDENCE
OF HER LIFE OUTSIDE ITS WALLS.

178
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,958
AND ELFRIEDE,
NO MISTAKES THIS TIME.

179
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,083
- NO.

180
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,916
- ( sinister laugh )

181
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:06,875
- THERE, I CAN FEEL IT.
THAT POWER. THERE! AGAIN!

182
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,625
I HAD MY SUSPICIONS FROM THE
PAPER, AND NOW THERE'S NO DOUBT.

183
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,875
THE CHILD IS BEING
HELD IN THAT BUILDING!

184
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,250
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO GET HER!

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,208
( he screams )

186
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,708
- HOLD IT!

187
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,041
- THE POWER I'M SENSING
IS NOT HAZUKI'S.

188
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,875
SOMEONE IN THAT BUILDING IS
RELEASING A DANGEROUS KI.

189
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,083
MUCH TOO DANGEROUS
FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

190
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,208
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO WAIT FOR SEIJI.

191
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,833
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOU CALLED HIM?

192
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,125
- A COUPLE OF MINUTES.
HE STILL WON'T ANSWER HIS PHONE.

193
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,708
AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE HAIJI
WILL FIND HIM IN TIME, EITHER.

194
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,875
SO HOW LONG DO WE STAND HERE

195
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,250
WHILE HAZUKI'S LIFE
IS AT RISK, GRAMPS?

196
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,666
BEFORE YOU DECIDE
THAT I'M ENOUGH?

197
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,166
- KOUHEI. IT'S JUST
THAT YOU'RE...

198
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,875
- I KNOW! I KNOW WHAT I AM.

199
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,708
BELIEVE ME, I'VE
ALWAYS KNOWN, GRAMPA.

200
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,833
I MEAN, HOW COULD I FORGET?

201
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:59,250
REMEMBER THE BABY BIRD I FOUND
THAT DAY WHEN I WAS JUST A KID?

202
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,083
IT'D FALLEN OUT OF ITS
NEST OR SOMETHING,

203
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,666
AND IT WAS JUST
LAYING THERE, HELPLESS.

204
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,916
I WANTED TO SAVE IT,
MAKE IT BETTER.

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,291
DO SOMETHING.
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW.

206
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,625
BROUGHT IT HOME AND FED IT,
WATCHED OVER IT DAY AND NIGHT.

207
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,625
I DID EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO MAKE THAT BIRD LIVE.

208
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,750
IT DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD.

209
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,625
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED
WHAT "POWERLESS" MEANT

210
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,083
AND WHY MY FAMILY LOOKED AT ME

211
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,458
WITH SUCH PITY WHEN
THEY SAID IT.

212
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,958
BUT I'M TIRED, GRAMPA.

213
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:32,125
I'M TIRED OF BEING POWERLESS.
OF BEING USELESS.

214
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,458
AND I'M TIRED OF
WAITING AROUND

215
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,166
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO
GET ME OUT OF A JAM

216
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,916
WHILE I STAND THERE
AND DO NOTHING!

217
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,708
I'M GOING TO SAVE HAZUKI!
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU!

218
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,208
- IT SEEMS THE ENEMY HAS TAKEN
CONTROL OF THIS ENTIRE BUILDING.

219
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,333
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS
PLANS FOR US ARE,

220
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,458
BUT I THINK WE CAN ASSUME HE
WON'T LET US THROUGH TOO EASILY.

221
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,375
BEST TO SPLIT UP.
LET'S HEAD FOR THE TOP FLOOR.

222
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,833
THAT'S WHERE
THEY'RE KEEPING THE GIRL.

223
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,750
I'LL TAKE THE ELEVATOR
AND MEET YOU THERE.

224
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,583
BE CAREFUL
GOING UP THE STAIRS, OKAY?

225
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,666
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

226
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,083
WELL, I GUESS IT'S FOR THE BEST.

227
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,333
A MAN HIS AGE SHOULDN'T
CLIMB THAT MANY STAIRS, ANYWAY.

228
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,625
- YOU IDIOT!

229
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,708
- ( Kouhei gasps )

230
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,291
- I WILL RELEASE A POWERFUL KI,

231
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,083
WHICH THE ENEMY
WILL SENSE IMMEDIATELY!

232
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,166
YOU, HOWEVER,
RELEASE ONLY HOT AIR,

233
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,083
AND WILL BE ABLE TO SLIP
PAST HIM UNNOTICED. UNDERSTAND?

234
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:52,958
I'M PLAYING THE DECOY SO THAT
YOU CAN TAKE HIM BY SURPRISE!

235
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAD
TO EXPLAIN ALL THAT.

236
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,541
DIDN'T YOU PLAY
VIDEO GAMES AS A KID?

237
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,125
TALISMANS TO WARD OFF SPELLS.
USE THEM.

238
00:15:55,458 --> 00:16:00,416
WELL, SOMEONE HAS AN INTERESTING
TASTE IN ARTWORK. A BIT MORBID.

239
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,541
GO GYOU SHOUKOKU. GON!

240
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:36,500
- I SEE. SO IT WAS YOU
I SENSED AFTER ALL.

241
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:47,458
WELL, IF IT'S OUR FATE
THEN SO BE IT.

242
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,500
I CALL UPON THE GODS
OF THE FOUR SEAS,

243
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,541
AND INVOKE THE ANCIENT LAW!

244
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,750
REPEL THIS DEMON SPIRIT!

245
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,958
- THIS IS FREAKIN' RIDICULOUS.

246
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:07,500
UH, HELLO UP THERE? HI?

247
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,833
HEH-HEH. HEY, GUYS. SEEN ANY
GOOD ZOMBIE FLICKS LATELY?

248
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,666
- ( he screams )

249
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:39,291
SORRY, FELLAS,
I HATE TO HEX AND RUN.

250
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,791
I'M COMIN' FOR YOU, HAZUKI,
JUST HANG ON, OKAY?

251
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,541
I'M COMIN' FOR YOU!

252
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,583
- MAMA! I'M COMING!

253
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,333
I'M COMING FOR YOU!

254
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,583
- ( Kouhei screams )

255
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:26,250
- I WAS HOPING WE WOULD
MEET AGAIN, BOY.

256
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,166
- YOU'RE THAT GUY FROM
THE GERMAN CASTLE!

257
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,291
- VERY GOOD!
SO GLAD I MADE AN IMPRESSION.

258
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:35,708
BUT YOU KNOW, I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN
I CAN MAKE A BETTER ONE!

259
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,583
- MY LAST ONE.

260
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,791
- THAT'S ALL?

261
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,333
- ( Kouhei screams )

262
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,666
BECAUSE OF YOU, I FAILED TO

263
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,791
FULFILL MY DUTY
TO MISTRESS LUNA.

264
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,875
BECAUSE OF YOU
I NO LONGER HAVE A HUMAN FORM!

265
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,000
- COME ON.
C'MON, C'MON, C'MON!

266
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,750
- ( laughs )

267
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

268
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,708
- ( coughs )

269
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,958
- ELFRIEDE? WAIT A MINUTE,
WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING HERE?

270
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,375
- I SUMMON YOU!

271
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,083
GO GYOU HAKKI BI!

272
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,416
- GRANDPA!

273
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,000
THEY'RE FIGHTING! THAT MEANS
ELFRIEDE'S ONE OF THEM!

274
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,625
- GRANDPA!

275
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,291
- FLY! NOW!

276
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,458
- ( gasps )

277
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,458
GET AWAY, GET AWAY,
GET AWAY, GET AWAY!

278
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,875
- ( he laughs )

279
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,333
- ( he screams )

280
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,583
- NO! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

281
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:43,000
ELFRIEDE! WHAT IS THIS?
WHY AREN'T YOU DOING ANYTHING?

282
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,916
ELFRIEDE!

283
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:03,500
NO! YOU TRAITOR!

284
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,583
I SUPPOSE WE'RE LUCKY
YOUR IMMUNITY TO SPIRITS

285
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,041
ENABLES YOU TO DEFLECT
SHADOW MESSENGERS, KOUHEI.

286
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:19,666
AND LUCKY YOU DEFLECTED THEM IN
PRECISELY THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

287
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,458
THEN AGAIN, PERHAPS IT WASN'T
LUCK AT ALL. RIGHT, ELFRIEDE?

288
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,291
- YOU MEAN SHE DID THAT
ON PURPOSE?

289
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,500
YOU MEAN SHE'S ACTUALLY
ON OUR SIDE AFTER ALL?

290
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,875
- LET'S ASK HER, SHALL WE?

291
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,541
WAS IT MY IMAGINATION,
OR WERE YOU HOLDING BACK

292
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,333
WHEN YOU AND I WERE FIGHTING?

293
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,250
- WELL, ONLY A LITTLE.

294
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,833
- AW, MAN!

295
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,458
- ( he laughs )

296
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:56,875
- ELFRIEDE, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

297
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:01,708
- I'M SORRY. BUT I'M AFRAID
I NEED THIS, KOUHEI.

298
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,208
AND ONLY YOUR BLOOD WILL DO.

299
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,333
LAST TIME IT WAS TO FREE
MYSELF FROM MY MASTER.

300
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,500
AND THIS TIME,
IT'S TO DEFEAT HIM.

301
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,125
- ( theme song plays )
- ( singing in Japanese )

302
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,958
- IT'S RIDDLE TIME,
MISTRESS LUNA.

303
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,375
HE WHO MAKES ME
DOESN'T WANT ME.

304
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:07,625
HE WHO BUYS ME DOESN'T USE ME.
HE WHO USES ME DOESN'T SEE ME.

305
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,583
WHAT AM I?

306
