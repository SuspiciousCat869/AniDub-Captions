1
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:12,666
- ( he gasps )

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,041
- WE MUSTN'T.

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,958
- WHAT?

4
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,166
- SHE'LL BE MAD SO WE MUSTN'T.

5
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,166
- DID YOU SAY?

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,333
- ( laughs )

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,458
- ( cat meows )

8
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,750
- ( he screams )

9
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,416
- WHAT THE HECK?

10
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,125
WHERE'S MY HEAD BEEN?

11
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,458
I COMPLETELY FORGOT
TO GIVE THIS TO HER.

12
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,166
- ( theme song playing )

13
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,958
- THEN IT'S DECIDED. FOR THE
NEXT FEATURE INVESTIGATION

15
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,708
WE'LL GO WITH THE CURSED WATCH.

16
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,416
- I THINK THAT'S
A REALLY CHOICE.

17
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,125
I'LL GET CRACKING ON THE
RESEARCH RIGHT AWAY

18
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,166
AND MAKE SURE WE'RE PREPPED
FOR EVERYTHING AT THE SITE.

19
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,625
I'LL CONTACT YOU AS SOON
AS I FEEL LIKE WE'RE READY!

20
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,166
- ( groans in pain )

21
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,166
- WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT
SLEEPING THROUGH THE MEETINGS?

22
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,958
- ( yawns loudly )

23
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,375
- I'M SERIOUS, KOUHEI,
YOU BETTER KNOCK IT OFF.

24
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,791
- I CAN'T HELP IT.
THOSE MEETINGS ARE TOO LONG.

25
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,875
- WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO WAKE YOU UP?

26
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,375
- UH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I THINK
I'LL GO WITH CAFFEINE, INSTEAD.

27
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,250
SO WHAT'S UP WITH THAT
FAVOR I ASKED YOU? ANY NEWS?

28
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,958
- FAVOR? WHAT FAVOR?

29
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,791
OH, YOU MEAN THE
WHEREABOUTS OF HAZUKI'S MOTHER?

30
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,625
- I ASKED A FRIEND OF
MINE WHO'S A DETECTIVE

31
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,666
TO LOOK INTO IT FOR ME.

32
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,125
NOTHING BUT DEAD ENDS SO FAR.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,916
- I SEE.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,458
- SO REFRESH MY MEMORY.

35
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,708
WHY CAN'T HAZUKI KNOW THAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HER MOM?

36
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,750
- IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S KEPT
HER OPINIONS A SECRET.

37
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,458
- I TOLD YOU MY MOTHER IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS, KOUHEI!

38
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,250
YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK FOR
HER BECAUSE SHE PROMISED

39
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,958
SHE'D COME BACK FOR
ME ANY DAY NOW!

40
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,541
THIS ISN'T YOUR
PROBLEM, YOU JERK,

41
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,833
SO WHY DON'T YOU KEEP
YOUR BIG NOSE OUT OF IT!

42
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,208
- THERE'S NO POINT TELLING HER.

43
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,458
I'D JUST BE SUBJECTING
MYSELF TO MORE VERBAL ABUSE.

44
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,375
- ( dog barks )

45
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,250
- ( groans in pain )

46
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,500
- CLEAN UNTIL IT GLEAMS!

47
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:07,291
- HAIJI? WHAT ARE YOU
DUSTING IN HERE FOR?

48
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,333
- I'M DUSTING 'CAUSE
IT'S DUSTY, MASTER.

49
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,041
YOU CAN'T DUST WITHOUT
DUST, YOU KNOW.

50
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,583
- YOU MAKE AN INTERESTING POINT.
BUT DON'T BOTHER.

51
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,833
- BUT IT JUST WOULDN'T DO

52
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,333
NOT TO CLEAN THE ROOM
OF MY MASTER'S SLAVE.

53
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,250
HE IS YOUR PROPERTY, AFTER ALL.

54
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,666
- SERIOUSLY IT'S NO BIGGIE.

55
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,750
I'D RATHER HE GET
DUSTY THAN SPOILED.

56
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,041
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME

57
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,458
AND WE'LL FINISH CLEANING
THE HALLWAY INSTEAD?

58
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,458
- WELL IF YOU SAY SO.
IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY MASTER,

59
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,625
THEN IT PLEASES ME
JUST FINE TOO!

60
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,958
- ( bell rings )

61
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,041
- UH-OH!
I DROPPED SOMETHING!

62
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,708
- WONDER WHAT THIS IS?

63
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,083
- DO YOU THINK MAYBE
IT'S A PRESENT

64
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,541
'CAUSE IT'S
WRAPPED UP SO PRETTY?

65
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,541
- THAT'S WEIRD.

66
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,708
THE TAG SAYS HE BOUGHT
IT IN KYOTO.

67
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,625
- LET'S SEE. HOW ABOUT THIS?

68
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,333
KOUHEI HAD A SECRET GIRLFRIEND
AND WHILE WE WERE IN KYOTO,

69
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,791
HE PICKED OUT A
PRESENT FOR HER,

70
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,041
BUT THEY GOT
IN A REALLY BIG FIGHT

71
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,708
AND BROKE UP BEFORE
HE COULD GIVE IT TO HER,

72
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,958
SO HE'S KEPT IT EVER SINCE

73
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,208
HOPING THEY MIGHT GET
BACK TOGETHER SOME DAY!

74
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,000
- DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE READING
A LITTLE TOO MUCH INTO ALL THIS?

75
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,000
- COME ON, IT COULD BE TRUE!

76
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,625
- MAYBE IN SOME OTHER UNIVERSE.

77
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,083
NOT THIS ONE. HE PROBABLY
BOUGHT IT FOR HIMSELF.

78
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,000
EVEN A REJECT LIKE HIM KNOWS
THAT ANYTHING WITH A BELL ON IT

79
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,208
IS WAY TOO LAME
TO GIVE ANYONE THESE DAYS.

80
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,125
COME ON, LET'S GO.

81
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,500
- ( groans )

82
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,708
- OH DEAR, OH DEAR,
OH DEAR, OH DEAR.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,291
- SO CHILD, YOUR NECK IS STIFF
FROM SLEEPING?

84
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,458
- UH-HUH.

85
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,958
- MY NECK'S STIFF TOO.

86
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,375
- HE WASN'T TALKING
TO YOU, SQUIRT.

87
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,333
- I ASSUME IT'S
QUITE PAINFUL FOR YOU?

88
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,958
- YEAH, IT HURTS REALLY BAD.

89
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,208
- IT HURTS SO BAD.

90
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,875
- DID YOU PRACTICE
THIS ROUTINE?

91
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,083
- NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT.

92
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,291
I ALWAYS SLEPT IN A BED
BEFORE I CAME HERE.

93
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,375
- AND YOU SUPPOSE THAT SLEEPING
ON THE FUTON CAUSED YOUR INJURY?

94
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,875
- ALL I KNOW IS I HAVEN'T HAD

95
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,166
A DECENT DAY'S REST
SINCE I GOT HERE.

96
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,833
- WELL NOW, I'M SURE
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT SOON.

97
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,125
- OR MAYBE
YOU COULD GET ME A BED.

98
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,416
WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?

99
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,916
- I ALMOST FORGOT!

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,666
DID ANYBODY SEE WHO WON
THE BASEBALL GAME TODAY?

101
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,541
I'M HOPING MY BOYS
MADE A COMEBACK.

102
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,625
AW, WHO AM I KIDDING, THE
PENNANT RACE IS GOOD AS OVER.

103
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,208
- ( laughs )

104
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,166
- GRANDPA'S TOO STRONG FOR
YOUR JAGAN, REMEMBER?

105
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,375
AND KOUHEI'S TOO BLIND!

106
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,375
- WELL, I HAD TO
TRY IT OUT AT LEAST.

107
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,208
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT
OF HAVING THESE POWERS,

108
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,833
IF I DON'T TAKE 'EM FOR A SPIN?

109
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,708
- LOOK, HAZUKI! JUST 'CAUSE
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING DOESN'T...

110
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,333
- ANYBODY HOME?

111
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,458
- IS THAT HIROMI?

112
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,083
- I'M COMIN' IN!

113
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,875
- OH, NO!
- HAIJI!

114
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,125
- OH CRAP, YOU'RE RIGHT!

115
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,833
- WHAT'S ALL THE CARRYING
ON ABOUT YOU TWO?

116
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,250
IT'S ONLY HIROMI.

117
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,208
- HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
EXPLAIN A TALKING CAT CREATURE?

118
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,333
- CALM DOWN. JUST SAY SHE'S ONE
OF YOUR COUSINS OR SOMETHING.

119
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,833
- SHE'S LIKE
THE SIZE OF MY FOOT!

120
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,250
- HAIJI! TRANSFORM!

121
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,375
- OKAY!

122
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,750
- HEY, YOU GUYS!

123
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,041
- ( cat meows )

124
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,083
- OH, HEY ROMI.
COME ON IN.

125
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,083
- HEY, FELLAS. HAZUKI, HAIJI,
HOW YA DOIN'?

126
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,750
- EVER HEAR OF CALLING FIRST?

127
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,791
- WELL NORMALLY I WOULD HAVE,

128
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,125
BUT IT WOULD'VE
RUINED THE SURPRISE.

129
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,333
HERE, THESE ARE FOR YOU.
I HOPE EVERYTHING FITS.

130
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,333
- ( she laughs )

131
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,416
- TA-DA!

132
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,666
- ( she meows )

133
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,166
- ( she exclaims )

134
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,166
- OH! YOU LOOK SO PRETTY!

135
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,291
- VERY NICE, CHILD.
VERY NICE.

136
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,458
- NOW LET'S SEE, I THINK I TRIED
IT ALL ON BUT I WANNA BE SURE.

137
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,916
- WHOA, WHAT'S WITH THE MESS?

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,791
- IT'S FROM THE
FASHION SHOW, YOU DUMMY!

139
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,750
DON'T WORRY, I'LL CLEAN IT UP.

140
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,000
- HAZUKI, LISTEN.

141
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,125
MAKE SURE YOU THANK HIROMI
FOR THE CLOTHES, OKAY?

142
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,291
I ALREADY DID.

143
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,833
- COME ON, DON'T LIE TO ME.

144
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,750
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN THANKED
HER FOR THE FIRST GIFT YET!

145
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,250
- FINE, I'LL DO IT LATER.

146
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,958
- JUST DO IT SOON, ALL RIGHT?

147
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,375
- WOULD YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

148
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,750
- OH, AND ONE MORE THING...

149
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,666
- YOU'RE MY SLAVE SO STOP
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO!

150
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,166
- GEEZ!

151
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,750
- TAKE HAIJI AND CLEAN
THIS MESS UP YOURSELF!

152
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,916
- ( both shriek )

153
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,458
- HUH? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING!

154
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,041
- HEY, ARE YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

155
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,416
- YEAH, I'M AFRAID SO,

156
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,833
I'VE GOT A PRETTY LOADED
SCHEDULE THIS WEEK.

157
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,458
- I COULD USE SOME
NEW CLOTHES MYSELF.

158
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,208
MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE ME
SHOPPING SOME TIME.

159
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,500
- IN YOUR DREAMS.

160
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,708
- HIROMI, WAIT A SECOND.

161
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,708
CAN I WALK OVER TO THE
METRO STATION WITH YOU

162
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,875
SO WE CAN HANG OUT
A LITTLE LONGER?

163
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,041
- THIS CAN'T BE MY LIFE.

164
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,958
- GET USED TO IT, SLAVE BOY.

165
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,500
- DON'T CALL ME THAT!

166
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,958
- HERE WE ARE.
BE CAREFUL GOING HOME, 'KAY?

167
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,750
- I WILL.
- SEE YA LATER.

168
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,000
- HIROMI?

169
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,083
- YEAH? WHAT IS IT?

170
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,666
- DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
DO ME A TEENSY LITTLE FAVOR?

171
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,166
- A LITTLE FAVOR?

172
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:37,916
- UH-HUH!

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,666
THAT WAS EASY!

174
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,208
- ( she laughs )

175
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,000
- ELFRIEDE?

176
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,375
- GOOD EVENING, MISTRESS.

177
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,750
ARE YOU PREPARED TO RETURN
TO THE CASTLE YET?

178
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,375
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

179
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,958
- I SUPPOSE YOU WOULDN'T.

180
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,416
HONESTLY, IF I WERE
IN YOUR POSITION

181
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,458
I WOULDN'T GO BACK EITHER.

182
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,333
- AND WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

183
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,666
- HOW COULD ANYONE DESERT
A LIFE LIKE YOURS?

184
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,750
FRIENDS, FREEDOM, HAPPINESS.

185
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,750
- I'M NOT SURE
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.

186
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,666
- AT LEAST YOU HAVE
THEIR COMPANIONSHIP

187
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,291
WHICH IS MUCH MORE
THAN I CAN SAY.

188
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,291
I THINK MY FRIENDS ARE
WHAT I MISS THE MOST

189
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,875
FROM MY PREVIOUS LIFE.

190
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,208
SEE, EVER SINCE I BECAME A LUDO
I'VE BEEN FORCED TO LIVE ALONE.

191
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,833
- LUDO? WHAT'S THAT?

192
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,541
- WE VAMPIRES ARE DIVIDED
INTO TWO CLASSES:

193
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,333
THE PURE VAMPIRES LIKE YOURSELF
ARE THE BLUEBLOODS,

194
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,625
AND THERE ARE THOSE LIKE ME.

195
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,291
NOT BORN, BUT CHOSEN TO BECOME
VAMPIRES BY OUR MASTERS.

196
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,583
WE ARE THE LUDO.

197
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:43,125
- I HAD NO IDEA. I THOUGHT
WE WERE ALL THE SAME.

198
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,958
- ARE YOU SAYING NO
ONE IN YOUR FAMILY

199
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,583
EVER DISCUSSED THESE
MATTERS WITH YOU?

200
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,250
- WHENEVER I ASKED MAMA
ANYTHING ABOUT VAMPIRES

201
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,833
SHE WOULD GET ALL
WEIRD AND QUIET,

202
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,458
SO I JUST STOPPED ASKING.

203
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,625
- I SEE.

204
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,541
- YOU'RE AWFULLY FRIENDLY TODAY!

205
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,166
- SPEAKING OF FRIENDS, MISTRESS,

206
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,916
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY
CHANGES IN KOUHEI?

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,333
YOU KNOW, SINCE I KISSED HIM?

208
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,083
- OF COURSE THERE HAVEN'T
BEEN ANY CHANGES!

209
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,000
IF HE WON'T CHANGE FOR ME
HE'S NOT GONNA CHANGE FOR YOU!

210
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,458
- FORGIVE ME. MY MISTAKE.

211
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,791
BUT I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND,
LITTLE ONE.

212
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:24,750
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE MY EFFORTS
TO STEAL HIM AWAY FROM YOU.

213
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,791
A MAN LIKE KOUHEI IS CONSIDERED

214
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,625
EXTREMELY VALUABLE
AMONG OUR KIND

215
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,875
BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE QUALITIES
THAT HIS BLOOD CONTAINS.

216
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,666
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE, CHILD.

217
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,166
YOU'VE FOUND THE ONE WITH
FREEDOM IN HIS BLOOD.

218
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:44,250
YOU'VE FOUND
THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

219
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:48,875
I'M BEGINNING TO ENJOY THIS
CONTEST BETWEEN US, MISTRESS.

220
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,666
- ELFRIEDE, WAIT!

221
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,041
THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER?

222
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,750
IS THAT TRUE?

223
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,833
- YOU THINKING ABOUT KOUHEI?

224
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,708
- HE HASN'T CHANGED A BIT SINCE
THE LAST TIME WE SAW HIM.

225
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,791
STILL THE SAME OLD DOPE WITH
A BIG HEART AND A THICK SKULL.

226
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,541
AND MY SEIIJI HASN'T
CHANGED MUCH EITHER, HAS HE?

227
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,458
SMART AND DASHING AND GIFTED.

228
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,583
I DON'T THINK I COULD'VE PICKED
A MORE PERFECT FIANCEE, DO YOU?

229
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,791
- ( she cries )

230
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,500
- YOU COULD BE WRONG ABOUT HIM.

231
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:35,208
FOR ALL YOU KNOW SEIJI
COULD BE A BIG EVIL JERK

232
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,666
UNDERNEATH ALL HIS
TALENT AND BRAINS!

233
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,583
- SORRY, KAORU.
KOUHEI'S CUTE, TOO.

234
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48,541
IF YOU'RE INTO THE WHOLE "BLACK
SHEEP OF THE FAMILY" THING.

235
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,083
- AND THAT'S THE
SHOOTING SCHEDULE.

236
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,583
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
WRITE IT DOWN.

237
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,458
- DON'T WORRY, I GOT IT.

238
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,916
- WELL, I BETTER GET MOVING.
I'VE GOT ANOTHER APPOINTMENT.

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,125
- OH, HIROMI, WAIT.

240
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,125
- I HATE TO ASK,
I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY.

241
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,250
BUT CAN YOU GIVE THIS TO HAZUKI?
SAY IT'S FROM YOU?

242
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,708
- I'M NOT YOUR GOPHER, KOUHEI.

243
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,000
- OF COURSE NOT,
BUT YOU ARE A GOOD FRIEND.

244
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,083
- THIS IS STUPID!
GIVE IT TO HER YOURSELF!

245
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,791
DON'T PUT ME IN THE
MIDDLE OF YOU TWO!

246
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,791
- DID I MENTION YOU
LOOKED GREAT TODAY?

247
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,750
I'M HOME.

248
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,916
- WELL, YOU'RE BACK
EARLY TONIGHT.

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,208
- WHERE ARE ALL THE CUSTOMERS?
DID YOU RAISE YOUR PRICES AGAIN?

250
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,916
- DON'T BE A
SMART-MOUTH, KOUHEI,

251
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,458
SOME NIGHTS ARE JUST SLOW.

252
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,958
THAT STINGS!

253
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,750
- HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DID YOU HURT YOURSELF?

254
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,916
- I THINK I OVERDID IT
TODAY MOVING...

255
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,000
- MOVING? WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

256
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,708
YOU GET SOME NEW
FURNITURE IN OR SOMETHING?

257
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,416
- YOU MEAN HIROMI
DIDN'T TELL YOU? ABOUT THE BED?

258
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,708
- ( she laughs )

259
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,916
- ( door opens )

260
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,375
- HEY, KOUHEI!
CHECK OUT ALL MY NEW STUFF!

261
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,833
BRAND NEW! BED, SHEETS,
PILLOWCASES, THE WORKS!

262
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,750
- I SEE. AND HIROMI BOUGHT
ALL OF THAT FOR YOU.

263
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,458
- MM-HM! ISN'T SHE THE
GREATEST BIG SISTER?

264
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,166
CAN YOU BELIEVE SHE
LIKES ME ENOUGH

265
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,000
TO GIVE ME ALL
THIS COOL STUFF!

266
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,583
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
WAIT, I BET I CAN GUESS!

267
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,791
YOU MESSED UP AT WORK
AGAIN AND HIROMI SCOLDED YOU

268
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,875
SO YOU'RE JEALOUS. SHE
LIKES ME! BULL'S EYE, RIGHT?

269
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,458
- ( slaps her loudly )

270
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,458
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

271
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,458
A SLAVE CAN'T LAY
A HAND ON HIS MASTER.

272
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,750
HOW DARE YOU!

273
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,958
- YOU USED IT.

274
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,250
- USED WHAT? I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

275
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,291
- YOUR CHARM. YOUR HYPNOTIC
EYE! YOU USED IT ON HIROMI?

276
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,541
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, I DID!
SO WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

277
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,666
- I SWEAR, IF YOU EVER
USE IT LIKE THAT AGAIN,

278
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,833
I WILL KICK YOU OUT OF
THIS HOUSE FOR GOOD!

279
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,708
- DON'T YOU EVER
MAKE THREATS TO ME!

280
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,333
IT'S MY POWER AND I CAN
USE IT HOWEVER I WANT!

281
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,875
I'M THE MASTER, NOT YOU!

282
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,458
- IT'S NOT ABOUT MASTERS!
THESE ARE FRIENDS AND FAMILY,

283
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,000
AND YOU CAN'T MANIPULATE THEM
HOWEVER YOU WANT!

284
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,583
- WELL, I HAVE TO! BECAUSE
YOU'RE A MISERABLE SLAVE

285
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,791
WHO WON'T EVEN DO
WHAT HE'S TOLD!

286
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,333
- QUIT ACTING SO SPOILED!

287
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,208
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING,
THEN JUST ASK FOR IT

288
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,208
AND BE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU GET!
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT, CAN YOU?

289
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,416
- OF COURSE I CAN!

290
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,041
- NOT IF THE ANSWER'S NO!
- I CAN, TOO!

291
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,333
- THEN TRY IT! AND YOU'LL SEE
JUST HOW IGNORANT YOU ARE

292
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,041
OF EVERYBODY'S FEELINGS
BUT YOUR OWN!

293
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,083
- ( door slams shut )

294
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,500
- WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY?

295
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,250
I HATE YOU, KOUHEI! I HATE YOU,
I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU!

296
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,833
- ( car engine starts )

297
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,666
- YOU TOOK IT WAY
TOO FAR, YOU IDIOT.

298
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,458
- SO YOU WERE EAVESDROPPING.
THAT'S NICE.

299
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,583
- YOU WERE BOTH SCREAMING YOUR
HEADS OFF BY THE END.

300
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,541
I WOULD'VE NEEDED
EAR-PLUGS NOT TO HEAR.

301
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,208
- I'M FINDING A PART-TIME JOB.
- WHY'S THAT?

302
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,458
- I NEED MONEY TO PAY
HIROMI BACK FOR THAT STUFF.

303
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,791
- YOU FEEL RESPONSIBLE
FOR HER, THEN?

304
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,750
- IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

305
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,125
- I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

306
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,625
HAZUKI'S USE OF HER JAGAN
WAS A MISGUIDED CHOICE.

307
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,500
- IT'S A LOT MORE THAN THAT!

308
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,166
- CONSIDER WHERE SHE CAME FROM.

309
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,916
LOCKED AWAY IN THAT
LONELY CASTLE

310
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,375
LIKE A PRISONER FOR SO LONG.
AND BEFORE THAT,

311
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,833
CUT OFF FROM THE WORLD
BY HER PROTECTIVE MOTHER.

312
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,416
IT'S NATURAL SHE
DOESN'T TRUST US.

313
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,666
IT'S BEEN ENGRAINED
IN HER HEAD.

314
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,125
SHE'S ACTING OUT OF FEAR,

315
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,208
TRYING TO FORCE WHAT
SHE SEES AS INEVITABLE.

316
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,208
THAT WE'LL LEAVE.

317
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,500
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD
UNDERSTAND THAT, KOUHEI.

318
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,416
- DON'T FORGET.
YOU'VE GOT THIS ONE, TOO.

319
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,083
- BUT THAT'S YOUR STORY!
YOU'RE THE SECTION EDITOR!

320
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,375
- SORRY, I'M SWAMPED.
I'M COUNTING ON YOU, KID.

321
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,208
- CAN'T WE TALK
ABOUT THIS FIRST?

322
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,875
- ( she groans )

323
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,375
- I THINK I'M DYING.

324
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,541
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW,
IT'S OUR GREAT EDITOR-IN-CHIEF!

325
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,458
- SO, UH, HOW'S THE
FRONT PAGE COMING, SIR?

326
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,041
- MY HEAD FEELS LIKE
IT'S GOING TO EXPLODE.

327
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,708
I'VE GOT THE
HANGOVER FROM HELL.

328
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,208
- WHAT?

329
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,166
- MAYBE IT'S EVIL SPIRITS.
A PSYCHIC! YEAH, THAT'S IT!

330
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,416
I NEED A PSYCHIC.

331
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,333
- WAIT A MINUTE! WELL,
THAT'S JUST PERFECT.

332
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,041
LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE DOING
THE FRONTPAGE LAYOUT, TOO.

333
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,125
- HIROMI! PHONE CALL, LINE 3!

334
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,541
- UM, CAN YOU TELL 'EM
I'LL CALL 'EM BACK, PLEASE?

335
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,875
- LINE 3!

336
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,541
- OKAY, THANKS FOR THE HELP!

337
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,875
HELLO, HIROMI ANZAI SPEAKING.

338
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,041
- UM, HIROMI?

339
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,416
- HAZUKI? IS THAT YOU, KID?

340
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,958
- YEAH. I, UM,
WANTED TO ASK A FAVOR.

341
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,500
- OKAY. WHAT IS IT?

342
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,166
- WELL... I...

343
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,250
- Kouhei: IF YOU WANT SOMETHING,
THEN JUST ASK FOR IT,

344
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,500
AND BE HAPPY WITH
WHAT YOU GET!

345
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,291
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT,
CAN YOU?

346
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,291
- I CAN!

347
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,666
IT'S NOTHING BIG OR ANYTHING.
I'D LIKE A NEW PILLOW,

348
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,875
TO GO WITH MY NEW
BED AND SHEETS AND STUFF!

349
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,375
- Hiromi: THAT'S THE FAVOR?
A PILLOW?

350
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,333
- YEAH! CAN I HAVE ONE PLEASE?

351
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,541
- DON'T YOU ALREADY?

352
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,458
I MEAN YOU PUT THE CASES
ON SOMETHING, RIGHT?

353
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,791
- HEY, ROMI...
- I'M SORRY, HOLD ON...

354
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,041
PROOF THIS COPY, TOO.

355
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,166
- WHAT? THAT'S NOT
MY JOB AT ALL!

356
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,041
- UM, YEAH. I HAVE A PILLOW.

357
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,250
BUT IT'S REALLY OLD AND MUSHY,
AND IT KIND OF SMELLS.

358
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,666
I WANTED SOMETHING NEW...

359
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,333
- LISTEN, SWEETIE, CAN YOU CALL
ME TOMORROW ABOUT THIS?

360
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,833
I'M IN A DEADLINE
CRUNCH TONIGHT,

361
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,166
AND I REALLY DON'T
HAVE TIME TO TALK.

362
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,000
- BUT I'M ASKING NICELY.

363
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,666
- IT'S A CURSE!
YA HAVE TO HELP ME!

364
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,041
- EDITOR, PLEASE! KNOCK IT OFF!
YOU NEED TO CALL YOUR THERAPIST!

365
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,708
- HIROMI! YOU'RE MY BIG SISTER

366
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,500
AND I REALLY WANT IT
AND I'M SAYING PLEASE!

367
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,458
- EDITOR, STOP!
I'M SORRY, HAZUKI, I GOTTA GO.

368
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,750
- ( hangs up phone )

369
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,583
- HIROMI, WAIT A MINUTE!
DID YOU HEAR ME? HIROMI!

370
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,375
YOU SEE? SHE SAID "NO" TO ME
AND I CAN TAKE IT.

371
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,416
I'M NO GOOD. UNLESS I USE MY
POWERS, NO ONE LISTENS TO ME.

372
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,833
NO ONE CARES.

373
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,041
- ( she gasps )

374
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,750
- GRANDPA SAID YOU WERE
IN HERE BY YOURSELF,

375
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,791
TRYING TO LEARN
NEW WAYS TO FROWN.

376
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,166
- HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, HIROMI?

377
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,208
- YOU SAID YOU WANTED
A NEW PILLOW, DIDN'T YOU?

378
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,625
I HAD TO GO TO THREE STORES

379
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,125
TO FIND A PATTERN I
THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE.

380
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,416
BUT, I THINK I STRUCK
GOLD WITH THIS ONE.

381
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,916
IT'S SUPER CUTE. AND I
BOUGHT YOU AN EXTRA SET

382
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,583
OF BLANKETS AND
SHEETS THAT MATCH IT!

383
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,041
THESE BOYS YOU LIVE WITH

384
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,625
JUST DON'T GET THE JOYS OF
FREQUENTLY-CHANGED BEDDING.

385
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,291
HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE SAD FACE?

386
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,500
I GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE
FOR MY CUTE LITTLE FRIEND

387
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,041
DESPITE MY INSANE WORK SCHEDULE,

388
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,333
AND SHE JUST LOOKS AT ME
LIKE I'VE RIPPED HER HEART OUT!

389
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,875
- YOUR FRIEND?

390
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,583
- WELL, YEAH!
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE, RIGHT?

391
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,125
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG, KID?

392
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:54,541
- THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WRONG.
BUT I WAS SO SCARED THERE WAS!

393
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:02,375
I'M SORRY.
I DID SOMETHING REALLY BAD.

394
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,583
- WOW. I HAD NO IDEA YOU COULD
INFLUENCE PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

395
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,750
I WAS WONDERING WHY
I WAS OBSESSING

396
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,375
ABOUT MATTRESSES ALL DAY.

397
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,458
- I'M SO SORRY I USED IT ON YOU.

398
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,875
- ME TOO. CONSIDERING I
WOULD'VE BOUGHT IT ANYWAY,

399
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,916
IT WAS A SAD WASTE
OF YOUR EFFORT.

400
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,125
- OH! HEY, LOOK! HERE WE ARE!

401
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,333
- IT'S KOUHEI.

402
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,583
- GRANDPA TOLD ME ABOUT IT
WHEN I CAME TO THE HOUSE.

403
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,750
KOUHEI GOT THIS SHOVELING
JOB TO PAY ME BACK

404
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,208
FOR ALL THE STUFF
I BOUGHT FOR YOU.

405
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,083
I COULD TELL HIM IT'S
NOT IMPORTANT TO ME.

406
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,875
BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

407
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,333
KOUHEI'S STUBBORN LIKE THAT.

408
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,458
HE HAS HIS OWN RULES ABOUT
THINGS, AND WHAT MATTERS.

409
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,291
YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T WANT
ME TO TELL YOU THIS,

410
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,166
BUT HE ASKED ME
FOR A FAVOR, TOO.

411
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,125
HE WANTS ME TO USE ANY RESOURCES
I HAVE TO HELP FIND YOUR MOM.

412
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,458
I KNOW HE'S RUDE AND
THICK-HEADED SOMETIMES.

413
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,125
BUT HE CARES ABOUT YOU A LOT.

414
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,583
HE JUST HAS HIS OWN
WAY OF SHOWING IT.

415
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,458
- ( bell rings )

416
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,333
LIKE, TAKE THIS
PRESENT FOR EXAMPLE.

417
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,541
HE WENT OUT AND
BOUGHT IT FOR YOU,

418
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,041
PUT IT IN A NICE GIFT
BAG AND EVERYTHING.

419
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,666
BUT FOR SOME REASON HE TOLD ME

420
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,291
TO GIVE IT YOU INSTEAD
LIKE IT WAS MY IDEA.

421
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,583
BUT HE SHOULD KNOW ME
BETTER THAN THAT.

422
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,791
- KOUHEI.

423
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,000
- ( bell jingles )

424
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,541
- ( he exhales loudly )

425
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,000
- MAN! I COULD SLEEP FOR WEEKS.

426
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,000
- HAZUKI.

427
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,458
WHAT'S THIS?

428
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,875
- I FIGURED YOU'D BE HUNGRY
AFTER ALL YOUR WORK TONIGHT.

429
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,125
- HOW'D YOU...

430
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,291
- ( bell rings )

431
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,791
- THANKS FOR MY PRESENT.

432
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,125
- ( he chuckles )

433
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,583
- HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.

434
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,500
- YOU CAN POUR YOUR OWN TEA.

435
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,333
- ( theme song playing )

436
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

437
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:31,041
- I HAVE FRIENDS. I DO.

438
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,208
- YOU FORGET, MISTRESS.

439
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,875
FRIENDS ARE NOTHING BUT
STRANGERS IN WAITING.

440
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,083
THEY'LL ALWAYS BETRAY YOU
IN THE END.

441
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,291
WELL, TIME FOR A RIDDLE.

442
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,166
NAME A MOTHER WHO WILL
TURN AROUND IF YOU CALL HER.

443
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,708
BUT IF YOU DON'T CALL HER
WILL TURN AROUND ANYWAY.

444
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,000
AND SHE CAN HOLD YOU ALL YOUR
LIFE, BUT NEVER PICK YOU UP.

445
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:12,625
FULL, FULL, FULL, MOON!
AND THE SOLUTION IS...

446
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:15,458
OH NO, MISTRESS LUNA
STOLE THE ANSWER CARD!

447
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,416
I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHAT I DESERVE.

448
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,208
WELL, WE HAVE A SPECIAL
GUEST ARRIVING NEXT TIME

449
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,500
TO TURN EVERYTHING
ON ITS HEAD.

450
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,166
SO YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS!

451
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,083
HAPPY NIGHTS 'TIL THEN. BYE!
