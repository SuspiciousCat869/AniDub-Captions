1
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:21,166
- ( Kouhei breathing heavily )

2
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:35,375
- ( theme song playing )

3
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:38,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

4
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,541
- IT REALLY IS OVER, ISN'T IT?

5
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:28,291
( Hazuki speaking )

6
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,583
- Hmm...

7
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:41,416
- KIND OF WENT OVERBOARD

8
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,583
WITH THE DECORATIONS,
DIDN'T THEY?

9
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:44,166
- Hazuki: ARE YOU
DEAF NOW, DUMMY?

10
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,708
I SAID THAT GOES OVER HERE!

11
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:47,708
- WHAT? YOU DID NOT.

12
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,083
- I MOST CERTAINLY DID,

13
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:51,833
I SAID IT GOES ON THIS SHELF
HERE! RIGHT BEHIND ME!

14
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,750
- YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT!
- DID TOO!

15
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:55,666
- YOU DID NOT!
- DID TOO!

16
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,250
- I KNOW FOR A FACT YOU DIDN'T!

17
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,541
- WELL I TOLD YOU NOW!

18
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:00,500
- EXCELLENT, SO YOU ADMIT
YOU DIDN'T BEFORE!

19
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,500
- I'M NOT ADMITTING ANYTHING,
MORON!

20
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:04,083
BUT SOMEONE HAD TO BE
MATURE ENOUGH

21
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:05,625
TO DROP IT AND YOU
OBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T!

22
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:07,041
- Haiji: AT THIS RATE

23
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,916
YOU'LL NEVER GET YOUR ANTIQUE
SHOP REOPENED, GRANDPA.

24
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,833
SHOULDN'T WE MAKE THEM STOP?
- OH, LET THEM BE.

25
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:13,041
THESE ARGUMENTS
ARE

26
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:14,500
HOW THEY SHOW THEIR FEELINGS
FOR EACH OTHER.

27
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:16,375
THAT'S MINE
AND ELFRIEDE'S CONCLUSION.

28
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:18,166
- THAT'S RIGHT,
IT'S ALL FOR LOVE.

29
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,000
- LOVE?

30
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:22,291
- YOU'RE ARGUING THIS TOO?
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE WRONG!

31
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:24,166
- AM NOT! SHUT UP!
- ARE TOO!

32
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,916
- THAT'S WEIRD. -
Kouhei: NOT THAT I CARE,

33
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,333
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!

34
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:28,875
- Hazuki: SHE WEARS THEM, OKAY!
- Kouhei: AH, COME ON!

35
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,791
- SHE DOES WEAR UNDERWEAR.
I'VE SEEN THEM MYSELF!

36
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:32,458
- ( exclaims )

37
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:35,375
OKAY! WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU FIGHTING ABOUT NOW?

38
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:37,416
- ( both sighing heavily )

39
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,708
- HAIJI! SHOW HIM
WHAT'S UNDER YOUR OUTFIT!

40
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:43,333
- HEY! THAT ISN'T APPROPRIATE!

41
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:49,125
( screaming ) STOP! A SHIKIGAMI
HAS A RIGHT TO PRIVACY!

42
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:53,708
- WELL, THE SHOP'S FINALLY READY
FOR ITS GRAND REOPENING,

43
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:54,375
THAT'S GOOD NEWS RIGHT?

44
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:56,083
- RIGHT.

45
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:58,125
- ( grumbling )

46
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:01,625
- AH, HAIJI. DON'T BE MAD,
WE SAID WE WERE SORRY.

47
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:02,875
- SHUT UP, SLAVE-BOY!

48
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:05,083
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO
EMBARRASSED IN MY LIFE!

49
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:07,250
IF I COULD, I'D VANISH
AND NEVER COME BACK!

50
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:09,208
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I COULD DO THAT FOR YOU.

51
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:12,250
- YOU CAN'T USE YOUR POWER!
MY MASTER TOLD ME!

52
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:15,000
- AND YOU BELIEVE THAT?
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO RISK IT?

53
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,291
- ( squealing )

54
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,583
- GOODNIGHT, EVERYBODY.

55
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:21,791
( yawning )

56
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:27,916
- WE'LL SEE HOW SLAVE BOY FEELS
WHEN HE WAKES UP TOMORROW

57
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,541
AND SEES I'VE WRITTEN "BOOBY"
ON HIS FEET

58
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:31,625
IN MAGIC INK THAT WON'T
EVER COME OFF!

59
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:35,458
"B-O-O" ON HIS RIGHT FOOT.
AND"B-Y" ON HIS LEFT!

60
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,708
- ( sighing )

61
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:40,708
- IS IT REALLY TRUE
WHAT HAIJI SAID ABOUT HIS POWER?

62
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:42,000
- HMM?

63
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:45,583
- HAS HE REALLY LOST
THE USE OF HIS JAGAN?

64
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,333
- Ryuuhei: JUDGING FROM
WHAT I SENSE OF HIS KI,

65
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:48,833
IT'S TRUE.

66
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:52,833
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY
THAT HE DID AT HIS PEAK.

67
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:55,583
- Elfriede: DID HE EXHAUST IT
IN THAT FINAL BATTLE?

68
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:59,250
- NO. KOUHEI'S JAGAN
IS LIKE A BOTTOMLESS WELL.

69
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:01,458
BUT HE'S SEALED IT
BACK UP, HIMSELF.

70
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:03,583
- SEALED IT? BUT WHY?

71
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:07,666
- SIMPLE. SO HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH HAZUKI COULD STAY THE SAME.

72
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:10,291
- ( humming )

73
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:11,708
( gasping )

74
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:13,000
( screaming )

75
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,541
- ( toilet flushing )

76
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:16,250
- ( growling )

77
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:19,958
- Hazuki: YOU IDIOT!

78
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:21,625
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING IN HERE?
- Kouhei: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

79
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:23,250
I HAD TO GO TO THE
BATHROOM, OKAY?

80
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,750
- Hazuki: YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD
ME YOU WERE IN HERE ALREADY!

81
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:28,666
YOU KNOW I TAKE MY BATH
AT NIGHT! IT'S MY ROUTINE!

82
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,833
- WELL, EXCUSE ME!

83
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:31,000
- YOU HID IN HERE ON PURPOSE!

84
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,625
YOU WERE SNEAKING
A PEAK, YOU PERV!

85
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,000
- OH, PLEASE.
- YOU'RE MAD AT ME

86
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:35,416
SO THIS IS HOW YOU GET ME BACK!

87
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,000
BY SPYING ON ME LIKE SOME
KIND OF CREEPY STALKER!

88
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:40,000
- YOU'RE CRAZY. WAIT 'TIL
YOU'VE ACTUALLY MATURED

89
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:42,250
BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME OF THAT.

90
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:46,541
- WHAT? HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT,
YOU JERK! I'M INCREDIBLY MATURE!

91
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:49,500
( sneezing )

92
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:55,125
I WAS FINALLY IN A HAPPY MOOD

93
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:57,583
AND THEN KOUHEI HAD TO MESS
IT UP ALL OVER AGAIN!

94
01:04:57,666 --> 01:05:01,416
DORK, IDIOT! DUMMY!

95
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,916
- Kouhei: YOU'RE CRAZY. WAIT
'TIL YOU'VE ACTUALLY MATURED

96
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,791
BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME OF THAT.

97
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,458
- ( screaming )

98
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:18,291
- ( Hazuki grunting )

99
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:19,625
- ( gasping )

100
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:25,708
- Kouhei: JUST SAY SOMETHING,
HAZ.

101
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:28,333
ARE YOU REALLY STILL MAD AT ME
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

102
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:31,875
- Ryuuhei: WHAT'D YOU
DO THIS TIME, KOUHEI?

103
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:33,041
- Kouhei: NOTHING,
THAT'S MY POINT,

104
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,625
BUT SHE'S
CONVINCED I'M A CREEP.

105
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,291
- Ryuuhei: AND WHY
WOULD SHE THINK THAT?

106
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:38,375
- ( scoffing ) SLAVE BOY
WAS HIDING LIKE A NINJA

107
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:39,375
IN THE RESTROOM

108
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:40,583
WHILE MY MASTER
WAS TAKING A BATH

109
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:42,208
SO HE COULD SEE HER
IN HER BIRTHDAY SUIT!

110
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:43,375
- THAT ISN'T TRUE!

111
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:44,708
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO
MAKE THINGS WORSE

112
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:46,583
WHEN YOU KNOW IT WAS COMPLETELY
ACCIDENTAL?

113
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:48,791
- FIRST THE UNDERWEAR TALK,
NOW THIS!

114
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,708
IT IS TRUE!
AND DON'T LECTURE MY SHIKIGAMI!

115
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:52,750
- WELL, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO

116
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:54,416
IF SHE WASN'T
SPREADING YOUR LIES!

117
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,458
- OH, KOUHEI.
HIDING IN THE BATHROOM?

118
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,416
HOW ON EARTH COULD YOU
DO SUCH A THING?

119
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,291
- SERIOUSLY, THAT'S PRETTY SICK.

120
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:02,541
- NOBODY WAS HIDING ANYWHERE!

121
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,916
I WAS JUST USING THE
FREAKING BATHROOM!

122
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,458
WHY WOULD I WANT TO
SEE HER NAKED ANYWAY?

123
01:06:06,541 --> 01:06:07,500
SHE'S JUST A KID!

124
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:09,041
- ( growling )

125
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:10,333
- ( all gasping )

126
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:16,125
- I'M DONE!

127
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,500
- HEY, HAZ?
- HMM?

128
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:19,666
- YOU'VE GOT SOME RICE
ON YOUR FACE.

129
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,375
- IT'S ON PURPOSE!
IT'S A NEW FASHION TREND!

130
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:24,791
- Kouhei: WHATEVER.

131
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:27,291
- ( all sighing )

132
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:30,708
- ( exclaiming )

133
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:35,750
- AND I THOUGHT THAT FIGHT
WITH JEDA WAS BAD.

134
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:47,416
- ELFRIEDE?
- OH. HEY, HAZUKI.

135
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,000
- SORRY ABOUT MY LITTLE TANTRUM.

136
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:51,541
TELL GRANDPA THAT I'M
SORRY TOO, OKAY?

137
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,791
- EVERY FAMILY HAS THEIR FIGHTS.

138
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,958
- YEAH. I GUESS. OH, I FORGOT!

139
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:58,708
HAVE YOU HEARD IF SEIJI'S HAD
LUCK WITH HIS SEARCH YET?

140
01:06:58,791 --> 01:07:00,875
- NOT SO FAR.
- HMM.

141
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:02,666
HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND HER?

142
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:05,375
- ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HER?
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE ASKING?

143
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:06,875
- NOT REALLY.

144
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:08,958
- SHE IS YOUR HALF SISTER,
AFTER ALL.

145
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:11,416
- THAT'S WHAT SHE'S CLAIMING,
ANYWAY, BUT THERE'S NO PROOF.

146
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,916
SHE COULD'VE MADE IT ALL UP.

147
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,791
- Elfriede: IS THAT
WHAT YOU BELIEVE?

148
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:17,875
- WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED
AFTER THE FIGHT, SHE WAS GONE.

149
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:20,458
ARTE CAN GO WHEREVER SHE WANTS
THAT MAKES HER HAPPY.

150
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:21,333
I DON'T CARE.

151
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:22,708
- ( laughs )

152
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:25,041
- ( gasping )

153
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,750
- EVERY ABLE PSYCHIC
IN THE MIDO CLAN

154
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:28,750
IS LOOKING FOR HER RIGHT NOW.

155
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:31,583
THEY UNDERSTAND
SHE WASN'T THE REAL ENEMY.

156
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:36,583
JUST BE PATIENT.
ARTE CAN'T STAY HIDDEN FOREVER.

157
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:39,708
I'M CERTAIN OF IT, HAZUKI.
THEY'LL FIND HER SOON.

158
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:42,083
- IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW,
I GUESS.

159
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:44,250
- YOU CARE ABOUT HER.

160
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:47,541
- I DO NOT! YOU CAN BE
SO DUMB SOMETIMES!

161
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,791
- ( laughing )
MY MISTAKE.

162
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:53,958
- ( dog barking )

163
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,041
- THEY SHOULD ALL BE ARRIVING
ANY MINUTE NOW.

164
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:05,583
- PERFECT TIMING.

165
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:08,166
- YOU SHOULD STEP OUTSIDE,
HAZUKI. THE MOON IS BEAUTIFUL.

166
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,666
- YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S FULL,
I SAW IT ALREADY.

167
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:14,250
MY TEETH ARE TINGLING
LIKE CRAZY.

168
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,458
OF ALL THE NIGHTS,

169
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:17,458
WHY'D THE MOON HAVE
TO PICK THIS ONE?

170
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,500
- ( grunting )

171
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:22,791
- AND THE WAR RAGES ON...

172
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:24,791
- WHO WANTS TO PARTY?

173
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:27,625
- OH! HI, HIROMI!

174
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:29,458
- GLAD YOU COULD COME.
HOW DO YOU LIKE THE HOUSE?

175
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:32,375
- OH, IT LOOKS
JUST LIKE THE OLD ONE!

176
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,833
LIKE THE FIRE
NEVER EVEN HAPPENED!

177
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:36,583
- Both: GOOD EVENING, FAMILY!

178
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:39,291
- OH, HEY!
( laughing )

179
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:41,833
- WHAT'S UP, GIRLS?
- WE'RE SO HAPPY YOU HAD TIME

180
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:42,958
TO COME AND VISIT.

181
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:44,250
- SO ARE WE!
AND WE BROUGHT GIFTS, TOO!

182
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,250
THERE'S PLUM SAKE
FROM MASTER YAYOI,

183
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:49,416
AND BRAISED VEGETABLES
FROM GRANDMOTHER KOHARU.

184
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,666
- SHE MAKES, LIKE, THE BEST
BRAISED VEGETABLES EVER!

185
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,375
- Hikaru: SHE SAID
SHE ADDED EXTRA KELP,

186
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:55,000
JUST FOR YOU.

187
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:56,958
- Hazuki: AWESOME!

188
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:58,958
- HAVEN'T THOSE TWO
EXPRESSED ENOUGH LOVE

189
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:00,583
FOR THIS WEEK?

190
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:03,125
- HEY. WHAT'RE YOU DOING
DOWN THERE, KAORU?

191
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:08,791
- ( meowing )
- ( all gasping )

192
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:10,750
- ( chuckling ) WELL,
THAT'S AN INTERESTING LOOK.

193
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:12,875
- IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I PUT TOGETHER.

194
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:14,583
DO YOU LIKE IT, KOUHEI?

195
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:16,166
- OH, DEAR.

196
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:20,666
PRAISE HER, KOUHEI!
RIGHT NOW! PRAISE HER GOOD!

197
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,125
- THAT DOESN'T LOOK SAFE.

198
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:24,041
- IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU'RE
STICKING UP FOR YOUR SISTER,

199
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:25,583
HIKARU, BUT THERE'S NO NEED.

200
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,708
SHE LOOKS CUTE! HONESTLY!

201
01:09:27,791 --> 01:09:29,125
- ( meowing )

202
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:31,833
- I CAN TELL THIS IS
GOING TO BE A GREAT NIGHT.

203
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:33,416
- ( meowing )

204
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:38,375
- HEY, HAIJI. YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S NO FUN IN YOUR CAT FORM.

205
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:40,291
YOU KNOW THE RULES
WITH HIROMI.

206
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:41,708
BUT SHE'S DRINKING, YOU SEE?

207
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:44,208
ONCE SHE'S GOOD AND TIPSY
YOU CAN SWITCH BACK AGAIN.

208
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:45,458
- ( cat meowing )

209
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:47,333
- HAVE YOU HEARD FROM SEIJI,
HIKARU?

210
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,958
- I TALKED TO HIM
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

211
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,375
HE SHOULD BE ON HIS WAY OVER.

212
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:52,250
- Ryuuhei: OH, REALLY?
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

213
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,500
- YOU MEAN IT?

214
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:55,666
I DIDN'T THINK SEIJI WOULD HAVE
TIME TO STOP BY.

215
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,916
SINCE HE'S SO BUSY
SEARCHING ALL OVER JAPAN

216
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,083
FOR ARTE AND EVERYTHING.

217
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:00,458
- ( both gasping )

218
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:02,875
- YOU HAVEN'T HEARD YET?

219
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:04,916
- NO, HEARD WHAT?

220
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,166
- OH. I HAVEN'T TOLD KOUHEI
OR HAZUKI YET.

221
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,375
I DIDN'T THINK SEIJI WOULD COME.

222
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:10,208
- WHAT'RE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

223
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:12,500
TELL US WHAT?

224
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,291
- HOPE I HAVEN'T MISSED
THE MAIN COURSE.

225
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:17,250
- WELL, THIS ROOM
JUST GOT HOTTER! HA!

226
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:18,791
- SOMEBODY CUT HER OFF.

227
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,583
- SO, DID YOU
BRING HER WITH YOU, SEIJI?

228
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:22,041
- YES.
- WHAT?

229
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:24,333
- WAIT, WHO ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

230
01:10:24,416 --> 01:10:26,375
- COME IN. DON'T BE SHY.

231
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:29,208
- ( gasping )

232
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:31,333
- ARTE.

233
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:33,625
- LUNA.

234
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,166
- ( chattering )

235
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,625
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND, GRANDPA,

236
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,708
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
SEIJI HAD FOUND HER?

237
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:46,250
- TO PROTECT YOU, HAZUKI.

238
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:47,916
- Seiji: TRUTH IS I'VE HAD HER
FOR A WHILE.

239
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,541
BUT I NEEDED TO
OBSERVE HER FIRST.

240
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,333
- HUNGRY?
- Hazuki: WHAT FOR?

241
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:54,208
- HE HAD TO SEE IF ARTE'S
TRUE NATURE WAS GOOD OR EVIL.

242
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,125
- THAT'S RIGHT. I BROUGHT HER
HERE

243
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:57,625
NOW THAT I'M SURE SHE
MEANS US NO HARM.

244
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:59,708
SHE'S JUST LONELY AND HURTING.

245
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:07,250
- SO WHERE DID YOU FIND HER
AFTER THE BATTLE?

246
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:08,916
- THE MIDO HOUSE IN KYOTO.

247
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,625
- REALLY? BUT I THOUGHT
IT WAS A WRECK NOW.

248
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:14,083
- WELL, IT'S SEEN BETTER DAYS,
I CAN SAY THAT MUCH.

249
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:30,166
- ALL ALONE.

250
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,416
- I TOOK HER TO WHERE THE
MAIN BRANCH OF THE FAMILY

251
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,416
IS STAYING NOW AND
HAD THEM KEEP HER.

252
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,625
BUT SHE WOULDN'T OPEN
UP TO ANY OF US.

253
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:39,416
NOT TO MASTER YAYOI,
OR TO GRANDMOTHER KOHARU,

254
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,416
OR EVEN TO THE TWINS.

255
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,000
- AFTER ALL SHE'S BEEN THROUGH

256
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:44,208
SHE PROBABLY DOESN'T WANT
TO TRUST ANYBODY.

257
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:46,458
- Seiji: ISOLATION CAN WARP
A PERSON'S MIND.

258
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:48,833
I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT FIRSTHAND.

259
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:50,666
- Ryuuhei:
WE ALL HAVE, AT TIMES.

260
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:53,333
- WEEKS GO BY
WITHOUT SEEING ANYONE.

261
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:56,958
PLAYING ALONE. EATING ALONE.

262
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,458
IT ISN'T EASY.

263
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:01,375
- WE'RE HOPING YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CAN OPEN

264
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:02,333
THE CHILD'S HEART, HAZUKI.

265
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:04,125
ARE YOU UP TO THAT CHALLENGE?

266
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:05,458
- WHAT CAN I DO?

267
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:07,458
- Arte: YUM!
- ( all gasping )

268
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:10,291
- PLEASE HELP ME.

269
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:12,208
- ARTE!
- ( laughing )

270
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:15,541
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON,
BUT I'M LIKING IT!

271
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:17,625
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING KISSING HIM?

272
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:19,083
- IT'S A FULL MOON TONIGHT.

273
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:20,708
- I KNOW THAT, BELIEVE ME I DO,

274
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:22,208
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN
GO AROUND AND...

275
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:23,333
- ( screaming )

276
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:25,916
- OH, NOT YOU TOO, ELFRIEDE.

277
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,500
- ( exclaiming ) NOW THIS IS
A GOOD PARTY!

278
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:32,875
- ARE YOU INSANE?

279
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,250
- I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, HAZUKI,

280
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:35,708
I KNOW THIS ISN'T
APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR,

281
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:37,916
BUT WHEN I SAW ARTE DOING IT
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

282
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,416
- WHY DON'T YOU KISS GRANDPA
IF YOU'RE SO HUNGRY?

283
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,791
- ME? YEAH!
THAT ISN'T A BAD IDEA.

284
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:45,541
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T POSSIBLY
DO THAT.

285
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:46,666
- AND WHY NOT?

286
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:47,791
- BECAUSE IF I KISSED RYUUHEI

287
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:49,458
HE WOULD BECOME
MY OBEDIENT SLAVE,

288
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:51,458
FOLLOWING ME AROUND
LIKE SOME MINDLESS ANIMAL.

289
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:53,083
OUR DEAR KOHEI,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

290
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:54,333
IS THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

291
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:56,166
SO I CAN KISS HIM
WITH NO EFFECT.

292
01:12:56,250 --> 01:13:00,583
- ACTUALLY, BEING A SLAVE
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

293
01:13:00,666 --> 01:13:02,625
- I DON'T CARE!
KOHEI'S MY SLAVE

294
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:03,791
AND I'M NOT GONNA SHARE HIM!

295
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:06,083
- WRONG, FANG-HEAD!
KAORU'S HIS FIANCEE,

296
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:07,291
SO SHE'S GOT DIBS!

297
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:08,458
- DON'T START WITH THAT
STUPID CLAIM AGAIN!

298
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:10,625
IT JUST MAKES THINGS
MORE COMPLICATED!

299
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:12,875
- SOMEONE SHOULD MAKE USE OF HIM
IF YOU'RE TOO SHY.

300
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:14,708
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- COME ON.

301
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:16,250
YOU HAVEN'T KISSED HIM TONIGHT.

302
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:19,375
- I KNOW. I'M JUST
NOT THAT HUNGRY, ALL RIGHT?

303
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,416
- ( screaming )
- ( sighing )

304
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:25,916
- I SAID NO KISSING!
- BUT ELFRIEDE DID.

305
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,458
- ONLY AFTER YOU DID IT FIRST!
THIS IS YOUR FAULT, KOUHEI!

306
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:30,875
YOU SHOULD BE A LOYAL SLAVE
INSTEAD OF TURNING YOUR NECK

307
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,083
INTO AN OPEN HOUSE!

308
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:34,791
- I'M NOBODY'S SLAVE, OKAY?
- Hazuki: OH...

309
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:37,000
- OH, DEAR. HE REALLY SAID IT.

310
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:38,791
- Ryuuhei: DIMWIT.
- WHAT?

311
01:13:38,875 --> 01:13:40,750
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THAT
YOU IDIOT!

312
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,416
- ( Kouhei screaming )
- Hazuki: STAND AT ATTENTION

313
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:43,708
- ( loud chattering )

314
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:45,416
- Hazuki: ARTE, I SAID STOP!
- Kouhei: TRUST ME

315
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,250
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT.
- Hazuki: DON'T ENCOURAGE HER!

316
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:54,416
- ( snoring )

317
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:03,083
- I'M TIRED BUT I CAN'T SLEEP.

318
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:05,000
IT'S THE DUMB MOON'S FAULT.

319
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:07,583
MY TEETH FEEL LIKE THEY'RE
GONNA EXPLODE!

320
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:09,375
- Hiromi: NO, I'M SERIOUS.

321
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:12,750
I JUST NEVER ASKED YOU BEFORE
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY NO.

322
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:15,416
- SURE! I THINK
IT'S A SPECTACULAR IDEA.

323
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,291
- THEN LET'S DO IT!

324
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:18,833
LET GET MARRIED NEXT WEEK,
SEIJI,

325
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:20,375
AND THEN HAVE LITTLE
PSYCHIC BABIES.

326
01:14:20,458 --> 01:14:23,125
HOORAY! NOW PINKY-SWEAR!

327
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,750
- HEY, CHECK IT OUT,
HIROMI THINKS HAIJI IS YOU.

328
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,416
- Seiji: THAT'S FUNNY.

329
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,916
- DOES THIS FEEL OKAY?

330
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,458
- OOH, YOU BETCHA.

331
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:32,416
THAT'S THE PERFECT
SPOT, RIGHT THERE!

332
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,083
- AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE MASSEUSE

333
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:35,291
AND HER CLIENT ARE
HAVING A BLAST.

334
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:36,750
- THAT CHILD.

335
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:38,875
DO YOU THINK SHE'LL ACTUALLY
BE ABLE TO GET ALONG HERE?

336
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:42,000
- IF IT'S ARTE YOU MEAN,
I'M SURE SHE'LL DO JUST FINE.

337
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:44,541
- I AGREE. SHE'LL HAVE HAZUKI,
AFTER ALL.

338
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:48,125
- Ryuuhei: YES. ARTE'S JUST LIKE
HAZUKI WAS AT A YOUNGER AGE.

339
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:02,208
- Kouhei: CAN'T SLEEP?

340
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:07,291
- I SLEPT TODAY.

341
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:08,458
- WANT TO PLAY A GAME THEN?

342
01:15:08,541 --> 01:15:11,000
I'M UP FOR ANYTHING
BUT BOUNCY BALL.

343
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:13,416
- NO PLAYING.

344
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,666
WHEN YOU PLAY WITH SOMEONE,
THEY GO AWAY FOREVER.

345
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:22,208
BEING ALONE IS BETTER.

346
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:23,583
- DON'T SAY THAT.

347
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:34,166
- TEETH POUNDING.
CAN'T STAY IN BED.

348
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:41,916
WHAT IS THAT IDIOT UP TO NOW?

349
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,666
- TRAITOR!
- Kouhei: I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,

350
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,708
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

351
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:47,125
LONG TIME AGO,
I LOST SOMEONE TOO.

352
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:51,041
I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE, ACTUALLY.

353
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:57,875
IT HURT SO BAD,
LIKE SOMEONE HAD SUCKED THE LIFE

354
01:15:57,958 --> 01:15:59,000
RIGHT OUT OF MY CHEST.

355
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:00,958
I FELT SO ALONE.

356
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:07,083
I WASN'T, THOUGH.
I HAD GRANDPA AND SEIJI.

357
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:10,583
A FAMILY WHO CARED,
WHO WERE THERE FOR ME.

358
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:13,791
AND REALLY, THAT'S HOW
I GOT TO WHERE I AM TODAY.

359
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:16,500
'CAUSE I COULD
FALL BACK ON THEM.

360
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:24,791
YOU SHOULDN'T SAY
YOU DON'T NEED ANYONE.

361
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:27,250
'CAUSE THERE ARE SOME FRIENDS
WHO NEVER GO AWAY.

362
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:30,625
- OH, KOUHEI.

363
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:36,750
- YOU FEEL SO WARM.

364
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:41,250
- LIKE HAZUKI.
SHE'S A GOOD FRIEND.

365
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:46,458
WHEN SHE FIRST CAME
IT WAS HARD FOR HER, TOO.

366
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,875
SHE'D BEEN LOCKED
IN THAT CASTLE

367
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:49,541
AND DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO TRUST PEOPLE.

368
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:52,000
SHE WAS A REAL HEADACHE.

369
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:55,166
OF COURSE,
SHE STILL IS SOMETIMES.

370
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,375
BUT SINCE WE'VE STUCK TOGETHER
THROUGH THE BAD STUFF,

371
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:59,041
I'VE REALLY GOTTEN TO KNOW HER,

372
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:01,375
AND SEEN THE GREAT STUFF TOO.

373
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:03,541
SHE'S GOT ONE
OF THE BIGGEST HEARTS I KNOW.

374
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:05,083
- Arte: YOU THINK SO?

375
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:06,750
- WHEN GRANDPA AND THE OTHERS
GOT HURT TRYING TO SAVE HER,

376
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,083
SHE FELT SO GUILTY.

377
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:11,000
SHE HATED THE IDEA
OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

378
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:14,541
SHE'S JUST A YOUNG GIRL, BUT
SHE'S CARRIED THIS HUGE BURDEN

379
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:16,208
THINKING SHE'S A CURSE.

380
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:20,750
BUT. WHAT SHE DOESN'T GET
IS IT'S OUR CHOICE TO FIGHT.

381
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:23,333
SHE'S PART OF OUR FAMILY NOW,
AND WE LOVE HER.

382
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:25,041
IT WASN'T ABOUT HEROICS,

383
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:27,750
AND NOBODY'S GOING TO
HOLD IT OVER HER HEAD BUT HER.

384
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:30,500
WE JUST DID IT 'CAUSE
WE WANTED TO BE WITH HER

385
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:32,083
AND LAUGH WITH HER AGAIN.

386
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:36,750
IF YOU STAY HERE, ARTE.
THEN YOU'LL SEE.

387
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,625
HAZUKI!

388
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:46,291
- YOU'RE A TERRIBLE SLAVE.
BUT HONESTLY, I THINK I'M GLAD.

389
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:51,041
SHE IS CUTE.

390
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,375
- YOU HAVE TO
LOOK OUT FOR HER, HAZUKI.

391
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:56,958
- YEAH. WELL, SHE
IS MY HALF-SISTER, AFTER ALL.

392
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:08,125
WE'LL NEVER BE COMPLETELY
OUT OF DANGER, WILL WE?

393
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:10,875
- NO. I GUESS NOT.

394
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:13,375
- OTHER VAMPIRES ARE SURE
TO COME AFTER ME TOO,

395
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:14,916
TRYING TO GET MY POWER.

396
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,666
BUT I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.
'CAUSE I'VE GOT YOU GUYS.

397
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:22,208
AND I'VE GOT YOU MOST OF ALL,
DON'T I, KOUHEI?

398
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:24,291
- ( grunting )

399
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:28,416
- THINGS ARE OKAY, MOTHER.

400
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,250
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME ANYMORE.

401
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:42,000
THANKS A LOT, KOUHEI.

402
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:43,791
- HAZUKI...

403
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:47,458
LISTEN. I SPENT A LONG TIME
WAITING FOR MY MOM, TOO.

404
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:50,625
AND I JUST...

405
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:54,291
I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT YOU LET GO

406
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:55,875
AND ADMIT THAT SHE'S GONE.

407
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:02,958
- YOU MEAN FOR GOOD?

408
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:09,875
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

409
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:13,750
SHE IS GONE.
I'VE KNOWN IT FOR A WHILE.

410
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:15,750
I ONLY...

411
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:19,791
YOU'RE RIGHT, KOUHEI...

412
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:25,083
WE HAVE EACH OTHER.
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

413
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:30,458
- ( crying )

414
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:32,500
KOUHEI!

415
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:36,208
KOUHEI!

416
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:52,583
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

417
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:55,041
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING.
RIGHT, HAZ?

418
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:57,833
THE FULL MOON'S OUT

419
01:19:57,916 --> 01:19:59,625
AND YOU HAVEN'T HAD A
SINGLE DROP YET.

420
01:20:00,666 --> 01:20:03,000
COME ON, YOU'RE STILL A VAMPIRE,
AREN'T YOU?

421
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:07,458
- ( laughing )

422
01:20:16,166 --> 01:20:17,916
- ( exclaiming )
WHAT WAS THAT?

423
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,625
- TELL THE TRUTH, I'VE MATURED
A LITTLE

424
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:21,250
SINCE YOU'VE MET ME, RIGHT?

425
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:25,166
BUT ANYWAY. WELL, HERE I GO!

426
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,958
- IT SURE IS
A BEAUTIFUL MOON TONIGHT.

427
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:42,041
HEY, WHAT'RE YOU TRYING TO DO,
BITE THROUGH ME?

428
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,708
YOU'RE BITING TOO HARD!

429
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:45,208
- DON'T BE A BABY!

430
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:47,375
- WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST
TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE GENTLE

431
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:48,208
WITH THOSE FANGS?

432
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:49,500
- NOT REALLY!

433
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:51,750
- ( Kouhei groaning )
- ( Hazuki laughing )

434
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:01,875
- WELL, GOODBYE, GIRLS.
HIKARU, KAORU.

435
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:03,500
- THANKS FOR HAVING US.

436
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:05,416
- WE HAD A LOT OF FUN.
THANK YOU.

437
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,125
- YOU BE CAREFUL
WHILE YOU'RE TRAVELING.

438
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:08,750
- DON'T WORRY, WE WILL.

439
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:11,416
- I'LL SEE YOU, KAORU.
COME BACK SOON, OKAY?

440
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,458
- ( meowing )

441
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:14,833
- SERIOUSLY THOUGH, KAORU,

442
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:16,208
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING
OUTSIDE IN THAT GETUP.

443
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:17,500
- OH, LIKE YOU'RE ONE TO JUDGE.

444
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:19,458
CAT PAWS LOOK A HECK OF A LOT
BETTER THAN

445
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,833
THAT GHETTO COSTUME YOU
MADE FOR ARTE.

446
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:23,250
- WHAT'S "GHETTO"?

447
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:25,125
- DON'T LISTEN TO HER,
YOU LOOK GREAT!

448
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,500
- AM I GHETTO?
- DON'T YOU ANSWER HER!

449
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:29,625
- HERE, GIVE THIS
TO YOUR ELDERS, DEAR.

450
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:36,208
- ALL RIGHT. IT'S A NICE DAY.
I'LL WALK THEM TO THE STATION.

451
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:42,541
- CAN I COME TOO?

452
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:46,333
- WHAT?
- I WANT TO GO WITH YOU, HAZUKI.

453
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:49,041
-SURE, ARTE.
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA!

454
01:21:57,541 --> 01:22:00,958
- ( laughing )
NOT THAT'S HOW YOU END A SHOW!

455
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:05,166
- ( music playing )

456
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:20,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

457
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:27,250
- SHOW'S OVER!
NOW GO BUY SOME MERCHANDISE!

458
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:28,875
- All: CUE THE CREDITS!

459
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:31,958
- ( theme song playing )

460
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:34,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

461
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:03,708
- HOLD ON, BIG BROTHER!

462
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:05,166
WE MIGHT'VE WRAPPED
UP THE STORY,

463
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,958
BUT WE DIDN'T
WANT THE FUN TO END!

464
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:08,708
SO HERE'S ONE LAST QUESTION!

465
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:10,375
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN
THE SHOW'S OVER,

466
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:12,416
BUT YOU'RE NOT READY
TO SAY GOODBYE?

467
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,250
FULL, FULL, FULL...
MOON!

468
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:17,375
THE ANSWER IS AN ENCORE, DUMMY!

469
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:20,708
NEXT TIME ON MOON PHASE,
IT'S THE REAL LAST EPISODE!

470
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:23,125
"UP AND DOWN, IN THE SUN,
FLOATING AWAY...

471
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:24,333
WHAT IS IT?"

472
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:27,416
YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH
TO FIND OUT! GOODNIGHT!
