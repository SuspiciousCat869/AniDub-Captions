1
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,250
- Hazuki: KOUHEI WON'T DIE.
BECAUSE OF ME.

2
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,291
AND HE WON'T DIE
BECAUSE OF YOU EITHER!

3
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,208
- Luna: WHAT YOU DID
WAS UNFORGIVABLE.

4
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,625
YOU KNOW THAT.

5
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,875
- WHO... WHO ARE YOU?

6
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,208
LUNA.

7
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,375
- THEY SHOWED YOU A
LITTLE BIT OF KINDNESS

8
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,958
AND YOU LET IT
POISON YOUR MIND.

9
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,208
HUMANS ARE SLAVES.

10
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,541
ANIMALS.

11
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:17,000
LOWLY CREATURES PUT HERE
FOR OUR USE.

12
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,958
YOU KILLED ONE OF YOUR OWN KIND
FOR THE SAKE OF A PET.

13
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,125
- HE WAS HURTING
MY FRIENDS.

14
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,833
I HAD TO STOP HIM.

15
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,416
- YOU MURDERED HIM.

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,958
AND YOU BETRAYED FATHER.

17
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,000
YOU BETRAYED OUR KING.

18
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,833
- I'M NEVER GOING BACK.

19
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,250
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
IN FATHER'S CASTLE.

20
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,125
- OH, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

21
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,583
YOU SEE, I DO WANT TO GO BACK.

22
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,375
I MISS IT VERY MUCH.

23
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,375
AND THAT MEANS YOU DO, TOO.

24
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,583
GIVE ME BACK MY BODY.

25
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,708
I WANT IT.

26
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,791
GIVE IT BACK! GIVE IT BACK!

27
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:09,458
GIVE IT BACK!
GIVE IT BACK!

28
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,750
GIVE IT BACK!
GIVE IT BACK!

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,333
- Hazuki: WHO AM I?

30
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,583
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM.

31
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,000
- ( theme song playing )

32
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

33
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,166
- Kouhei: SEIJI'S ANSWERING
MACHINE'S STILL PICKING UP.

34
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,166
I WONDER HOW LONG HE'S
GONNA STAY IN BED.

35
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,041
HE WAS BANGED UP PRETTY GOOD,
I GUESS, BUT STILL...

36
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,875
- Ryuuhei: TAKE IT EASY,
THERE, MEDICINE MAN.

37
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,708
I'D LIKE TO KEEP THAT ARM
IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK.

38
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,166
- HEY. YOU GOT ANY COMPLAINTS

39
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,208
YOU CAN GO CHECK YOURSELF
IN AT THE HOSPITAL AGAIN.

40
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,708
I'M SURE THAT HOT NURSE IS
STILL PINING OVER YOU, OLD MAN.

41
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,083
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, SHE IS.

42
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,166
I BROKE HER HEART, POOR THING.

43
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,041
- ( scoffs ) USING YOUR POWER TO

44
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,666
MAKE YOUNG WOMEN FALL
IN LOVE WITH YOU?

45
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,250
NO WONDER YOU'RE ALL BUSTED UP
LIKE THIS.

46
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,708
THE GODS ARE PUNISHING YOU.

47
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,958
NEXT TIME DON'T USE
YOUR GIFT FOR EVIL.

48
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,083
- OH, THE GODS DON'T CARE.

49
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,458
THEY'VE GOT OTHER REASONS
FOR PUNISHING ME.

50
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,916
BETTER REASONS.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,916
AND I CAN'T SAY I BLAME THEM.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,375
- HUH?

53
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,166
- I WAS CARELESS,
GETTING CAPTURED.

54
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,041
AND I PUT ALL YOUR LIVES
IN DANGER.

55
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,708
THE GODS KNOW THAT.

56
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,916
I'M SORRY, KOUHEI.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
- GRAMPS.

58
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,375
- AW, DON'T YOU WORRY,

59
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,791
I AM PRETTY LUCKY
FOR AN UGLY OLD MAN.

60
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,250
AND IT TAKES AN AWFUL LOT
TO BRING ME DOWN.

61
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,291
( laughing )

62
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,000
HMM. WHAT IS IT, BOY?

63
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,708
- YOU SAID THE SAME
THING YESTERDAY.

64
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,041
AND I WAS JUST REMEMBERING.

65
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,875
- Hazuki: HIROMI!

66
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,541
IS SHE ALL RIGHT? HIROMI!

67
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,250
- Ryuuhei: SHE'S FINE.

68
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,000
UNCONSCIOUS, BUT NOT HURT.

69
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,916
- Hazuki: ( stutters )
AND THE SPELL?

70
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,041
- Ryuuhei: IT'S GONE.

71
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,583
WHATEVER KINKEL DID TO HER,
IT ENDED WHEN HE DIED.

72
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,125
SHE PROBABLY WON'T REMEMBER
ANY OF THIS IN THE MORNING.

73
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,708
- Hazuki: THANK GOODNESS.
YOU WERE ALL IN DANGER.

74
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,291
AND IT WAS MY FAULT.

75
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,708
I'M JUST SO GLAD
EVERYONE'S OKAY.

76
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,833
- NOW. DON'T WORRY, CHILD.

77
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,791
I'M PRETTY LUCKY
FOR AN UGLY OLD MAN.

78
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,458
IT'LL TAKE A WHOLE LOT MORE
THAN THAT TO BRING ME DOWN.

79
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,625
( laughing )

80
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,166
DID I REALLY SAY THAT?
I DON'T RECALL.

81
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,125
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THAT WAS YESTERDAY.

82
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,666
- HUH. NOT TO THIS OLD BRAIN,
IT WASN'T.

83
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,666
- IF IT'S TRUE THAT FORGETFUL
PEOPLE ARE THE HAPPIEST,

84
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,083
THEN WE'VE SURE GOT A LOTTA
HAPPY PEOPLE AROUND.

85
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,208
- HOW'S THAT?

86
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,541
- HIROMI AND THE
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

87
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,666
HAVE NO MEMORIES
OF BEING CONTROLLED BY KINKEL,

88
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,000
AND YOU HAVE NO MEMORY
OF ANYTHING.

89
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,166
GUESS IT PROBABLY MAKES FOR

90
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,875
HAPPIER PEOPLE ALL
AROUND, DON'T YOU THINK?

91
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,416
- Hiromi: I THOUGHT I HEARD
VOICES OUT HERE.

92
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,250
- Kouhei: ( stammers )
HIROMI, HEY!

93
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,791
- Hiromi: HEY. LONG TIME NO SEE!
- Kouhei: YEAH!

94
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,666
- SO, WHAT'S UP
WITH THE BANDAGES?

95
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,541
DID YOU GUYS HAVE A FIGHT?

96
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,166
- Kouhei: UH, NO, ACTUALLY,
WE JUST, UH...

97
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,500
- Ryuuhei: YUP. TERRIBLE FIGHT.

98
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,916
BOY SAID I COULDN'T SWING.
SHOWED HIM, THOUGH.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,958
- Kouhei: RIGHT, RIGHT. BUT,
UH, THAT... IT'S ALL GOOD NOW!

100
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,125
SO ANYWAY. WHAT'VE YOU BEEN
UP TO LATELY?

101
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,625
- YOU SERIOUSLY
HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING

102
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

103
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,250
- MISSING...

104
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,750
- Kouhei: OH, RIGHT!
YOU WERE MISSING!

105
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,875
NOBODY COULD FIND YOU
FOR A COUPLE DAYS, HUH?

106
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,000
WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT?

107
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,625
- WELL, ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW.

108
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,041
THAT'S KINDA THE THING. I LOST
MY MEMORY OF THE PAST FEW DAYS.

109
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,041
I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL,
BUT THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

110
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,208
YOUR CONCERN
IS TOUCHING, THOUGH.

111
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,250
ANYWAY, I CAME HERE SO
WE COULD GO SHOPPING

112
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,916
TO GET MY MIND OFF THE
WHOLE STUPID THING.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,833
- Kouhei: YOU WANT
ME TO GO SHOPPING?

114
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,791
- WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I'M A MASOCHIST?

115
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,208
HEY! YOU FEEL LIKE GOING
SHOPPING WITH ME?

116
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,750
- Kouhei: WHAT? WHO ARE YOU
EVEN TALKING T...

117
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,416
( gasps )

118
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,875
( groans ) SON OF A...

119
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,791
- Hiromi: KOUHEI? GEEZ. WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU? KOUHEI!

120
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,708
- HAZUKI!

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,458
- Hiromi: CONTINUE YOUR DOMESTIC
DISPUTE, THEN! I'LL SHOP ALONE!

122
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,291
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WIGGLE YOUR FINGERS.

123
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,958
- WIGGLE WHAT?

124
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,416
- YOU'RE NOT HURT ANYWHERE?

125
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,291
- WELL... KIND OF.

126
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,625
YOU'RE SQUEEZING MY HAND.

127
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,416
- OH, CRAP, I'M SORRY!

128
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,666
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

129
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,833
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?
YOU SCARED ME.

130
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,083
- WAIT, WHAT?

131
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,750
I SHOULD BE ASKING YOU
THE SAME THING.

132
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,208
I MEAN, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

133
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,208
YOU WERE STANDING OUTSIDE
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, HAZUKI.

134
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,708
- STOP THAT.

135
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,583
- I STOPPED! I LET GO!

136
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,708
DOES IT STILL HURT?
I'M SORRY.

137
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,125
COME ON, HAZ, TALK TO ME.
I'M FREAKIN' OUT HERE.

138
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,708
- IT'S NOT THAT.

139
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,250
- OKAY. WHAT IS IT THEN?

140
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,125
- STOP CALLING ME HAZUKI.
I'M NOT.

141
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,875
MY NAME IS LUNA.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,041
- LUNA?

143
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,708
- THAT'S WHAT YOU CALLED
YOURSELF AT THE CASTLE.

144
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,833
WHO'S LUNA?

145
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,833
WAIT. ARE YOU MESSING
WITH ME AGAIN?

146
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,250
CUT IT OUT.
YOU'RE NOT FUNNY.

147
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,583
- I'M NOT TRYING TO BE FUNNY.

148
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,333
I'M NOT JOKING WITH YOU,
BIG BROTHER.

149
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,750
I PROMISE.

150
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,791
- BIG BROTHER?

151
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,375
OKAY, NOW I KNOW
YOU'RE MESSIN' WITH ME.

152
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,166
WHAT'S GOING ON?

153
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,916
WHENEVER YOU START
CALLING ME BIG BROTHER,

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,375
IT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT SOMETHING.

155
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,083
SO WHAT IS IT? NO, LET ME
GUESS. MORE CLOTHES, RIGHT?

156
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,416
- BUT I...

157
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,333
- COME ON. SPILL IT,
MIDGET, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

158
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,250
TELL ME.

159
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,500
- BUT I REALLY JUST...

160
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,083
- YEAH?

161
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,750
SAY IT...

162
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,000
- ( screams )

163
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,791
- Haiji: HA-HA! NINJA HAIJI!

164
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,875
- OW! DAMN!
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

165
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,083
- FOR UPSETTING MY MASTER.

166
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,500
NOW LEAVE HER ALONE!

167
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,250
WE ARE GOING UPSTAIRS!

168
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,250
- WAIT!

169
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,750
OH, SORRY, ELFRIEDE.

170
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,875
MAN, SHE'S ACTING WEIRD.

171
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,458
- Elfriede: YES.
SHE HAS BEEN ALL DAY.

172
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,000
HUH. I WONDER.

173
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,916
- Ryuuhei: SO YOU'RE
SAYING HAZUKI

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,166
MIGHT NOT BE HAZUKI
AT ALL RIGHT NOW.

175
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,583
- Elfriede: YES.

176
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,625
- Kouhei: OKAY, SO WHO
IS THIS LUNA GIRL, EXACTLY?

177
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,541
- Elfriede: SHE'S A PERSONA
THE MASTER IMPLANTED

178
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,791
IN THE MISTRESS' BRAIN.

179
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,083
- Kouhei: IMPLANTED?

180
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,208
- Elfriede: THROUGH HYPNOSIS.

181
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,416
YES. A KIND OF SECURITY
SYSTEM HE DEVISED

182
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
TO KEEP HER FROM
LEAVING THE CASTLE.

183
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,333
- AND DO YOU KNOW
WHO THIS MASTER IS?

184
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,625
- Elfriede: YES.
HE'S HER FATHER.

185
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,208
- FATHER?

186
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,541
- SHE NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

187
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
- FORTUNATELY...

188
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,416
WHEN THE BARRIER AROUND THE
CASTLE WAS DESTROYED,

189
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,708
HAZUKI WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE,

190
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,500
AND IT SEEMED LUNA
WAS LEFT BEHIND.

191
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,000
SHE STILL EXISTED BUT WITHOUT
THE CONSTANT PRESENCE

192
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,500
OF THE MASTER'S POWER,
SHE REMAINED DORMANT.

193
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,208
- Kouhei: BUT WHY NOW?

194
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,625
- Elfriede: I CAN'T KNOW
FOR CERTAIN.

195
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,750
BUT SHE MAY BE OPENING
HERSELF UP TO LUNA AGAIN

196
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,166
AS A WAY TO ESCAPE.

197
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,708
- TO ESCAPE?
FROM WHAT?

198
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,291
- Elfriede: FROM HER GUILT.

199
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,541
HER FEAR OF HERSELF.

200
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,083
IT'S TRUE THE COUNT
WAS A DESPICABLE PERSON.

201
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,916
BUT SHE KILLED HIM
WITH HER OWN TWO HANDS.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,833
WHAT KIND OF BURDEN IS THAT
FOR A LITTLE GIRL TO BEAR?

203
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,166
AND YOU SEE
LUNA FEELS NO GUILT.

204
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,958
- Haiji: DON'T FORGET ABOUT
THE LEEKS, MASTER.

205
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,750
- SO, SHE SWITCHED PLACES
WITH HER. OH, I GET IT.

206
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,208
- BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

207
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,625
- WHAT?

208
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,375
- THE MISTRESS LUNA FROM BEFORE
WOULD NEVER HAVE COOKED

209
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,791
OR CLEANED FOR MERE
HUMAN BEINGS.

210
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,000
SHE'D CONSIDER IT
BENEATH HER.

211
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,000
- THEN WHY IS SHE NOW?

212
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,000
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT'S CONFUSING.

213
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,833
THE ONLY THING I CAN FIGURE

214
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,500
IS THAT THEY BOTH MIGHT
HAVE MERGED TOGETHER.

215
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,583
- THEY'RE SHARING HAZUKI'S MIND?

216
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,708
- Elfriede: YES.

217
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,541
( Hazuki groans )

218
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,083
- ARE YOU OKAY, MASTER?

219
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,333
- WOW, ELFRIEDE.
THIS STEW IS DELICIOUS!

220
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,333
- IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO
TO REPAY YOU

221
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,458
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN KIND
ENOUGH TO LET ME STAY HERE.

222
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,041
- NOW THAT I KNOW YOU
CAN COOK LIKE THIS,

223
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,333
I THINK WE'LL KEEP YOU.

224
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,166
- WELL, I USED TO COOK
WHEN I WAS HUMAN.

225
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,541
I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW MUCH I MISSED IT.

226
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,541
- HEY, ANY TIME YOU WANNA
TAKE OVER KITCHEN DUTY,

227
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,083
YOU JUST LET US KNOW!

228
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,875
OH, UH... YOUR OMELET ROLL
WAS REALLY GOOD TOO, HAZUKI.

229
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,583
- Hazuki: I'M SORRY.

230
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,541
I'LL TRY TO DO BETTER NEXT TIME.

231
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,416
- WHAT'RE YOU APOLOGIZING FOR?

232
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,833
YOU NEVER APOLOGIZE.
ARE YOU FEELIN' OKAY?

233
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,791
BE CAREFUL, ELFRIEDE.

234
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,333
ELFRIEDE!

235
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,166
- WELL THAT SETTLES THAT.

236
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,208
IT LOOKS LIKE THE MISTRESS
REALLY IS A DAY WALKER.

237
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,625
- Men: WHAT?

238
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,666
- Elfriede: HUMAN BLOOD IS HOW

239
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,625
WE VAMPIRES SUSTAIN
OUR OWN POWERS.

240
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,291
IMMORTAL BLOOD, THE
BLOOD OF OTHER VAMPIRES,

241
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,000
IS HOW WE OBTAIN NEW ONES.

242
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,958
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

243
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,583
- YOU SEE, POWER,
LIKE MY ABILITY TO SUMMON,

244
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,541
OR THE COUNT'S
TO MANIPULATE LIGHT,

245
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,250
CAN BE ABSORBED BY ANY OTHER
VAMPIRE IF HE DRINKS OUR BLOOD.

246
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,000
SO IF ONE OF US
DESIRES A NEW POWER,

247
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,916
WE HAVE ONLY TO FIND
ANOTHER VAMPIRE WHO HAS IT.

248
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,333
OF COURSE, FEW VAMPIRES WILL
SHARE THEIR POWERS WILLINGLY.

249
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,833
- AH, I SEE.

250
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,583
SO THAT'S WHY YOU TASTED
HAZUKI'S BLOOD.

251
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,833
- OH, YES. I'M AFRAID I JUST
COULDN'T RESIST THE OPPORTUNITY.

252
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:09,875
YOUR FAULT, REALLY.

253
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,125
WHEN YOU TOLD ME
SHE STOOD OUT

254
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,875
IN THE SUNLIGHT
WITHOUT BEING BURNT,

255
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,708
I REALIZED THERE COULD ONLY
BE ONE LOGICAL EXPLANATION.

256
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,041
- Kouhei: SO YOU'RE
A DAY WALKER.

257
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,916
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T DIE
THAT DAY WHEN YOU...

258
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,875
- Elfriede: YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

259
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,833
SHE'S NOT JUST A DAY WALKER.

260
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,833
OUR HAZUKI
IS A PERFECT DAY WALKER.

261
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,833
A TALENT NOT EVEN COUNT KINKEL
COULD BOAST OF.

262
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,583
THIS CHILD IS
A VERY POWERFUL VAMPIRE.

263
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,166
- YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

264
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,541
- THAT'S FASCINATING.

265
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,541
- AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW, DID YOU?

266
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,041
THAT YOU WERE A DAY WALKER.

267
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,791
- NOT TILL YESTERDAY.

268
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,291
AND EVEN THEN I WASN'T CERTAIN.

269
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,041
- GOING ON THE VERANDA WAS
A HELL OF A WAY TO TEST IT.

270
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,208
- YESTERDAY I WAS ALMOST
KILLED BY A VAMPIRE

271
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,500
AND TODAY I'M HAPPY WHEN ANOTHER
ONE DISCOVERS A NEW POWER.

272
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,875
LIFE CERTAINLY DOES KNOW HOW TO

273
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,125
KEEP AN OLD MAN
ON HIS TOES, HUH?

274
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,541
( laughs )

275
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,666
- CAN'T YOU BE SERIOUS
FOR EVEN A MINUTE?

276
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,250
- BIG BROTHER,
I WAS WONDERING...

277
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,916
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE WORLD.

278
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,416
IN THE DAYTIME, I MEAN.

279
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,875
WOULD YOU TAKE ME, PLEASE?

280
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,375
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

281
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,625
EVERYTHING IS SO DIFFERENT
AT NIGHT!

282
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,291
KOUHEI, LOOK!
IT'S ALL SO SPARKLY!

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,500
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW STRANGE
EVERYTHING IS.

284
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,291
- YEAH.

285
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,541
IT'S STRANGE JUST WALKING
WITH YOU LIKE THIS.

286
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,291
IN THE SUNLIGHT,
WITHOUT BEING AFRAID.

287
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,291
NOW I'M JUST AFRAID
IT ISN'T REALLY YOU.

288
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,500
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

289
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,291
I MISS THE LITTLE BRAT
I THOUGHT I KNEW.

290
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,208
WHEN IS HAZUKI COMING BACK?

291
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,083
- BIG BROTHER. I, UM...

292
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,958
WELL, I'M GETTING
A LITTLE BIT HUNGRY.

293
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,083
- HUH?

294
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,833
- OVER THERE.

295
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,708
- OH! I SEE.

296
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,041
GO AHEAD, KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

297
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,708
- WOULD YOU GO GET IT, PLEASE?

298
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,833
- I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
- HUH?

299
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,916
- COME ON, JUST GO.

300
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,208
- BUT WHY CAN'T YOU?

301
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,333
- BECAUSE I SAID.

302
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,250
- AW, MAN.

303
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,125
- WOULD YOU JUST HURRY UP AND
GET OVER THERE, YOU BIG JERK?

304
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,625
- HAZUKI? THAT YOU?

305
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,500
ARE YOU BACK TO NORMAL NOW?

306
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,166
HAZUKI?

307
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,166
- NO.

308
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,583
- MY NAME'S... LUNA.

309
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,625
- Kouhei: WHAT IF ELFRIEDE'S
RIGHT ABOUT ALL OF THIS?

310
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,250
IF SHE'S REALLY TRYING
TO ESCAPE HER OWN FEARS...

311
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,541
THEN I'M THE ONE
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE, AREN'T I?

312
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,791
ANYTHING SHE DID,
SHE DID TO SAVE ME.

313
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,375
HOW DO I LIVE WITH THAT?

314
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,500
( gasps )

315
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,583
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

316
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,333
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOIN',
YOU JERK!

317
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,500
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? HEY.

318
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,500
- THANK YOU, KOUHEI.

319
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,500
I MEAN, THANK YOU, BIG BROTHER.

320
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,625
- BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

321
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,625
- Elfriede: THE MASTER MUST HAVE

322
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,833
KEPT HIS SECRET
VERY WELL GUARDED.

323
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,083
I DON'T THINK ANY OTHER
VAMPIRE KNEW THE MISTRESS WAS

324
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,500
A DAY WALKER,
NOT EVEN THE COUNT.

325
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,916
- IS THAT WHY HE WAS SO CAREFUL

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,541
ABOUT KEEPING THE
GIRL LOCKED UP?

327
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,458
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
ELSE TO KNOW HER SECRET?

328
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,083
- IF OTHER VAMPIRES
KNEW ABOUT HER

329
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,291
THEY WOULDN'T REST UNTIL
THEY'D STOLEN HER POWER

330
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,041
AND BECOME
DAY WALKERS THEMSELVES.

331
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,916
AND THEN THEY'D SURELY CHALLENGE
THE MASTER FOR HIS TITLE.

332
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,166
IN THE VAMPIRE WORLD,

333
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,166
WHOEVER HAS THE GREATEST
POWER WILL ALWAYS RULE.

334
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,916
- Ryuuhei: AND YOU? WHAT WILL
YOU DO WITH YOUR NEW ABILITY?

335
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,125
- OH, DON'T WORRY.

336
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,291
ANY POWER I GAINED FROM THE
MISTRESS HAS FADED NOW.

337
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,583
I DIDN'T DRINK ENOUGH
TO TRULY ABSORB IT.

338
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:06,041
UNFORTUNATELY, OTHER VAMPIRES
WON'T BE SO POLITE.

339
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,958
THEY WON'T WAIT FOR HER TO
CUT HERSELF BEFORE THEY DRINK.

340
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,541
AND THEY WILL BE COMING.

341
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,708
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,958
- I WOULD EXPECT SO.

343
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,250
AFTER ALL, THAT LITTLE GIRL

344
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,750
HOLDS THE CURE TO
THEIR GREATEST WEAKNESS.

345
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:21,250
- ALSO, THE MASTER WILL SOON
LEARN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE

346
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,166
AND HE'LL SEND HIS SERVANTS
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

347
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,666
SHE'S VERY VALUABLE TO HIM.

348
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,041
AND HE'LL WANT HER
BACK. QUICKLY.

349
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,500
- YES.

350
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,875
- Kouhei: THEY'LL COME FOR HER.
I KNOW THEY WILL.

351
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,291
THEY'LL NEVER LEAVE
HER ALONE.

352
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,416
ONE VAMPIRE NEARLY
KILLED US ALL.

353
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,083
HOW WILL I BE ABLE
TO PROTECT HER FROM MORE?

354
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,541
- Kouhei: HEY.
- YEAH?

355
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,875
- Kouhei: WE SHOULD PROBABLY
START HEADING BACK.

356
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,666
- IT'S GETTING PRETTY DARK.
- YEAH, BUT...

357
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,041
- COME ON, YOU'VE SEEN
THIS STUFF AT NIGHT BEFORE.

358
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,583
- BUT MY NORMAL HOURS
ARE JUST STARTING.

359
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,875
BESIDES, NOW THAT I CAN
GO OUT DURING THE DAY,

360
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,166
I NEVER NEED TO SLEEP.

361
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,000
I CAN STAY UP 24/7.

362
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,916
- EVEN DAY WALKERS
NEED THEIR REST.

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,166
AND PHOTOGRAPHERS
DEFINITELY NEED TO SLEEP.

364
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,541
SO TAKE YOUR LAST LOOK AROUND,
BRAT, WE'RE GOIN' HOME.

365
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,583
BESIDES, THIS CITY CAN BE
DANGEROUS AT NIGHT.

366
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,041
- YOU'RE NOT TIRED.

367
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,125
YOU'RE JUST WORRIED ABOUT
ME, AREN'T YOU, BIG BROTHER?

368
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,625
IF I'M A BRAT, THEN WHY IS IT

369
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,958
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
AFTER ME LIKE THAT?

370
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,958
- UM, BECAUSE...

371
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,958
- IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
MY SLAVE, ISN'T IT?

372
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,458
- LOOK, HAZUKI... LUNA, WHOEVER
YOU ARE. I AM NOT YOUR SLAVE!

373
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,500
AND I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D
TELL THE OTHER ONE OF YOU

374
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,583
THE SAME THING NEXT
TIME YOU SEE HER.

375
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,208
- THEN WHY DO YOU PROTECT HER?

376
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,875
WHY ARE YOU NICE TO HER?

377
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,750
- I DUNNO.
I GUESS IT'S 'CAUSE, WELL...

378
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,291
IT'S... IT'S BECAUSE...
I OWE HER.

379
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,416
- YOU OWE HER?

380
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,125
- YEAH, THAT'S IT!

381
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,208
HAZUKI SAVED MY LIFE
A FEW TIMES, Y'KNOW?

382
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,666
SO I, UH...
I OWE HER.

383
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,291
I MEAN, HEY, I KNOW I'M NOT
THE GREATEST GUY IN THE WORLD.

384
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,833
BUT ONE THING I KNOW HOW TO DO

385
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,708
IS HONOR THE HECK
OUT OF AN OBLIGATION.

386
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,833
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

387
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,833
HEY, WAIT!

388
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,666
WHERE'RE YOU GOIN'?
OUR PLACE IS THE OTHER WAY.

389
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,541
- I HATE YOU!

390
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,458
( crying )

391
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,958
- ( theme song playing )

392
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,416
- ( singing in French )

393
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,541
- BIG BROTHER,
LET'S PLAY DENTIST, OKAY?

394
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,333
OPEN WIDE!

395
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,333
OOH. I SEE A LOTTA CAVITIES.

396
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,208
WHICH TOOTH SHOULD WE PULL?

397
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:11,291
FULL, FULL, FULL... MOON!

398
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,041
NEXT TIME, ON MOON PHASE,

399
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,208
"IT'S MORE THAN
A RESPONSIBILITY!"

400
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,083
HEY, SPEAKING
OF RESPONSIBILITIES,

401
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,208
WHY DON'T YOU START
BY BRUSHING YOUR TEETH!

402
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,875
YOUR BREATH IS GROSS!

403
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,166
AND YOU COULD USE
A BATH, TOO.

404
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:24,916
BOYS.
