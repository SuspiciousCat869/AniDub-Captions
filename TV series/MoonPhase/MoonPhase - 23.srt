1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:09,541
- ( crackling )

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,791
- ( rattling )

3
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,208
- SOMEONE'S HERE.
- ( gasping )

4
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,541
- HELLO? IS ANYONE HOME?

5
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,000
HOW ON EARTH DOES
AN ENTIRE FAMILY

6
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,083
JUST DISAPPEAR WITHOUT A TRACE?

7
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,458
- JUST A HUMAN.

8
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,000
- Vargas: WHAT DO WE
DO WITH HER?

9
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,375
- Jeda: HOW 'BOUT DINNER?

10
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,125
- ( screaming )

11
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,125
- KOUHEI, KOUHEI, WHAT'S WRONG?

12
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,208
- ( screaming )

13
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,416
- PLEASE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING!

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,916
STOP ACTING LIKE THIS!

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,458
- ( theme song playing )

16
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,541
( singing in Japanese )

17
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,416
- SO IT WASN'T JUST RYUUHEI'S
PLACE THAT WAS DESTROYED.

18
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,000
IT WAS THIS HOUSE TOO?

19
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,208
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,083
- ( thinking ) WHERE DO I
KNOW HER FROM?

21
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,583
OH! SHE'S KOUHEI'S FRIEND!

22
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,125
- Vargas: HOW FORTUNATE.
A LITTLE SNACK.

23
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,708
- MONSTER!

24
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,333
JUST GET AWAY!

25
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,166
- NO. KOUHEI.
WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT?

26
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,083
- ( breathing heavily )

27
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,625
- Yayoi: HAZUKI!

28
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,000
- Hazuki: PLEASE. HELP!

29
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,666
- THIS WILL BE
DIFFICULT TO HEAR.

30
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,833
KOUHEI'S JAGAN HAS MADE
HIM TERRIFIED OF YOU.

31
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:43,875
- ( gasping )

32
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,291
- Hazuki: "BIG BROTHER,
AM I THAT SCARY?"

33
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,541
- DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT
TOUCHING HER, FREAK!

34
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,375
I'LL SCREAM IF YOU DO.

35
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,291
- Vargas: OH, YOU CAN SCREAM
ALL YOU WANT, LITTLE GIRL.

36
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,625
SHE'S TOO FAR IN TO ESCAPE NOW.

37
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,208
- Arte: WHAT'S GOING ON?

38
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,541
- PRINCESS ARTE.

39
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,250
HUH?

40
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,083
DAMN IT!

41
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,083
- YOU'LL BE IN MAJOR TROUBLE
IF I KILL MYSELF.

42
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,791
YOU NEED ME AS A HOSTAGE.

43
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,416
- YOU THINK YOU CAN
BARGAIN WITH US?

44
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,416
- ( gasping )

45
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,291
- MAYBE THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.
YOU REALLY ARE ANNOYING ME.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,250
- PRINCESS?

47
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,666
- IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY TO DIE,
I CAN HELP YOU.

48
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,458
- ( grunting )

49
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,875
- ( gasping )

50
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,416
- ( Jeda laughing )

51
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,958
HOW I'D LOVE TO SUCK YOUR BLOOD.

52
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,666
- ( whimpering )

53
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:58,083
- BIG BROTHER, YOU'RE NOT
ACTUALLY AFRAID OF ME, ARE YOU?

54
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,125
BUT YOU TOLD ME YOU DID ALL
OF THIS TO PROTECT ME!

55
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,458
- ( screaming )

56
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,458
- ( continues screaming )

57
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,125
( groans )

58
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,625
- I KNOW SOMETHING REALLY BAD IS
HAPPENING TO THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY

59
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,458
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO HELP THEM.

60
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,750
- ( clattering )

61
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,708
- PRINCESS, PLEASE UNDERSTAND.

62
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,041
WE NEED THIS GIRL ALIVE

63
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,375
IF WE WANT TO RETURN
MISTRESS LUNA TO OUR MASTER.

64
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:49,083
- WHAT A SAD STORY.
A LOVELY MEAL MISSED.

65
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,708
BECAUSE OF THE THREATS
OF THIS OBNOXIOUS GIRL.

66
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,333
- LET GO OF ME,
YOU DUMB VAMPIRE!

67
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,875
- TELL ME WHY YOU DID IT?

68
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,250
- DID WHAT, CREEP?

69
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,291
- WHY DID YOU GO OUT OF YOUR
WAY TO PROTECT HER?

70
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,333
- 'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS, OKAY?

71
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,958
- THAT'S SO STUPID.

72
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,625
WASTING ALL YOUR TIME
CARING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.

73
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,625
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND...

74
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,625
YOU HEARTLESS BLOOD SUCKER!

75
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,250
- Yayoi: I USED MY KI
TO KNOCK HIM OUT.

76
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,125
HE SHOULD BE MORE
RELAXED WHEN HE WAKES.

77
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,500
- Hazuki: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HIM?

78
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,250
- I REMOVED THE SEAL THAT
SEPARATED KOUHEI FROM HIS JAGAN

79
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,375
EVER SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE BOY.

80
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,750
WITH HIS POWERS UNLOCKED,

81
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,375
HE HAS THE ABILITY TO SEE
THINGS NO ONE ELSE CAN.

82
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,000
AND SOMETHING HE SEES
IN YOU TERRIFIES HIM.

83
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,166
WE SUSPECT HE SEES WHAT
YOU MIGHT BECOME.

84
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,416
- ( gasping )

85
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
- THE LIFE OF A VAMPIRE
IS FILLED WITH EVIL,

86
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,875
SUFFERING, AND BLOOD.

87
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,458
YOU HAVE A TRAGIC PAST
AND A TERRIBLE DESTINY.

88
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,208
IF WE FAIL TO INTERVENE.

89
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,458
KOUHEI SEES THAT
WHEN HE LOOKS AT YOU.

90
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,541
- I'M NOT EVIL.
I'M NOT!

91
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,666
- SOME PART OF KOUHEI STILL
WANTS TO PROTECT YOU.

92
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,333
BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT
HE CAN SEE NOW,

93
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,583
YOU'VE BECOME
A MONSTER TO HIM.

94
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,375
HE FEARS YOU MORE THAN DEATH,

95
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,166
AND THAT FEAR MAKES HIM INSANE.

96
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,958
- I...

97
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,208
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW
I HAD SUCH AN UGLY FATE.

98
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,041
( sobbing )

99
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,125
- Yayoi: I'M SORRY, HAZUKI.

100
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,083
THIS WILL NOT BE EASY FOR YOU.

101
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,375
- ( rustling )

102
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,291
- YEAH!

103
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,708
( chuckling )

104
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,166
I GOT 'EM!

105
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,166
- Koharu: SWEEPING ON
YOUR OWN, KAORU?

106
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,291
- ( Haiji screams )

107
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,333
- WHY ISN'T HAZUKI HELPING YOU?

108
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,166
- ( birds chirping )

109
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,166
- KOUHEI STILL HASN'T
SEEN THIS PLACE.

110
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,708
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE HIM
WHEN HE GETS BETTER.

111
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,916
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIS EYES
LOOK LIKE THAT BEFORE.

112
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,458
IT'S ALL MY STUPID FAULT.

113
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,958
I DID THIS TO HIM.

114
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,125
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME,
HE'D BE FINE.

115
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,875
ALL HE'S EVER
DONE IS PROTECT ME

116
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,375
AND HELP ME AND TRY TO
BECOME STRONG FOR ME.

117
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,166
AND ALL I'VE EVER
DONE IS MAKE HIM SUFFER.

118
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,125
AND STILL, HE WAS ALWAYS
THERE FOR ME.

119
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:42,958
SORRY, KOUHEI.

120
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,541
- Woman: HAZUKI, DEAR.

121
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,875
THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN

122
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,000
YOU WILL FIND SOMEONE
WHO YOU TRULY LOVE.

123
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,208
WHEN THAT DAY ARRIVES,

124
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,000
YOU MUST NOT SEAL THE
BLOOD PACT WITH HIM.

125
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,750
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
NEVER WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE.

126
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,125
MOTHER, IS THIS WHAT YOU
WARNED ME ABOUT THEN?

127
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,333
- Seiji: THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
HE'S HERE BECAUSE OF YOU.

128
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,541
- HUMANS ARE SLAVES. ANIMALS.

129
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,166
LOWLY CREATURES PUT
HERE FOR OUR USE.

130
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,291
- NO, STOP IT!

131
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,208
- ( whimpering )

132
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,166
THE MONSTER THAT I SAW IN HERE
LAST NIGHT, THAT WAS HAZUKI.

133
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,750
BUT HOW COULD IT BE, MASTER?

134
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,041
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON ANYMORE.

135
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,625
IT'S LIKE I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT

136
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,625
AND EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING

137
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,666
IS ALL JUMBLED UP
INSIDE MY HEAD.

138
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,291
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW HER,
I COULDN'T FORGET HER.

139
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,333
I COULDN'T GET HER
OUT OF MY MIND.

140
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,833
SHE'S SO POWERFUL,
BUT FRAGILE TOO.

141
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,125
I WANNA PROTECT HER.
I... I DO!

142
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,583
BUT NOW I'M SEEING THINGS
LIKE I NEVER HAVE BEFORE.

143
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,833
THERE'RE THESE
SHADOWS AROUND HER

144
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,375
AND THEY'RE ALL
SCREAMING IN PAIN.

145
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,250
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS
READY FOR THIS.

146
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,583
I THOUGHT THAT I COULD FIGHT
THROUGH IT ALL BUT I JUST CAN'T!

147
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,625
I CAN'T!

148
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,291
( sobbing )

149
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,458
- ALL WHO POSSESS JAGAN
FACE THESE TERRORS, KOUHEI.

150
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,083
AS I WARNED YOU,

151
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,000
NO ONE IN OUR FAMILY HAS EVER
BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME THEM.

152
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,416
BUT YOU ACCEPTED
YOUR POWER, KOUHEI.

153
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,208
YOU MUST NOW ACCEPT THIS
TERROR SO YOU CAN BEAT IT.

154
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,583
I WON'T PRETEND IT WILL BE EASY,
BUT THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.

155
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,458
REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING
AND USE IT.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,083
I'LL TRY.

157
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,125
I WILL.

158
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,166
- IT'S RECKLESS TO UNLEASH
THIS POWER IN KOUHEI.

159
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,000
HE'S MORE LIKELY TO
HURT HIMSELF THAN AN ENEMY.

160
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,041
BUT I KNOW WE'LL
LOSE WITHOUT HIM.

161
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,916
AND BESIDES, I WOULD LIKE TO
SEE WHAT JAGAN CAN DO.

162
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,458
ALL OF THAT POWER,
IN ONE HALF-TRAINED AMATEUR.

163
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,875
- ( clattering )

164
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,333
- THIS "JAGAN" OF THEIRS MUST BE
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL.

165
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,541
PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T WAIT

166
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,750
UNTIL THE NEXT FULL
MOON TO RETRIEVE HER.

167
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,166
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

168
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,666
- YOU KNOW, MR. VARGAS,

169
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,458
STANDING NEXT TO YOU
REALLY MAKES ME ILL.

170
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,708
- WHAT?

171
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,333
I'M AFRAID I'LL BE WORKING
ALONE FROM NOW ON.

172
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,833
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

173
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,541
- AWAY, PRINCESS. TRY NOT
TO SHED TOO MANY TEARS.

174
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,250
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

175
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,166
- YOU GO ON EARNING YOUR KEEP
BY PLAYING MOMMY TO THIS GIRL.

176
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,875
I HAVE OTHER WAYS
OF IMPRESSING OUR MASTER.

177
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,000
- YOU'RE A FOOL!

178
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,125
- THEY'RE SPLITTING UP, HUH?

179
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,041
- JEDA?

180
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,208
- YES?

181
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,375
- ( popping )

182
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,291
- THE WHOLE TIME WE
TRAVELED TOGETHER,

183
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,041
YOU NEVER PLAYED WITH ME ONCE.

184
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,083
- ( gasping )

185
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,791
- SORRY, PRINCESS.

186
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,708
YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE
FASTER THAN THAT.

187
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,916
- ( clanging )

188
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,541
- ( gasping )

189
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,250
- Hikaru: SURE IS QUIET NOW.

190
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,083
- Arte: I DON'T NEED THAT DUMMY.

191
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,583
- Hikaru: NO?

192
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,291
- Arte: VARGAS AND I CAN
HANDLE THAT BRAT LUNA EASILY.

193
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,500
YOUR FRIEND LEFT YOU
AND YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

194
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,291
YOU'RE FIGHTING
WITH YOUR SISTER.

195
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,750
IS THIS REALLY WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE A VAMPIRE?

196
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,750
IS THIS WHAT
IT'S ALL ABOUT?

197
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,958
NO ONE MATTERS BUT YOU,
NOT EVEN YOUR OWN FAMILY.

198
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,750
YOU'RE MEAN AND CRUEL AND
BEFORE LONG YOU'LL BE ALL ALONE.

199
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,000
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER
TO YOU EITHER, DOES IT?

200
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,083
- ( whistling )

201
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,458
- Arte: SOON.

202
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,875
- ( exploding )

203
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,875
- SOON I'LL MAKE SURE
LUNA'S ALL ALONE TOO.

204
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,958
- KOUHEI.

205
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,625
- Seiji: ALL THIS IS
YOUR FAULT, YOU KNOW.

206
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,041
YOUR SELFISHNESS HAS
ENDANGERED US ALL.

207
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:06,000
WE'VE ALL ENDED UP RISKING
OUR LIVES JUST TO PROTECT YOU.

208
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,666
BUT STILL WE'LL LOSE.
AND THEN WE'LL BE KILLED.

209
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,208
AND IT'LL BE YOUR FAULT.

210
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,375
- SEIJI, PLEASE.

211
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,541
- STOP PUTTING THIS
FAMILY IN DANGER, HAZUKI,

212
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,666
AND GO BACK TO YOUR OWN KIND.

213
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,791
- MY KIND?

214
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,583
- TO THOSE EVIL,
HEARTLESS VAMPIRES

215
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,333
WHO ACTUALLY
WANT YOU AROUND.

216
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,208
- ( gasping )

217
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,958
- BUT PLEASE, CAN'T
YOU TELL HOW

218
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,291
EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE
IS HURTING RIGHT NOW?

219
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,791
- IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

220
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,625
- WILL YOU BE THE ONE TO
EXPLAIN THAT TO THE CHILDREN?

221
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,583
- THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO DO.

222
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,291
- YOU SAY THAT. YOU ACT
LIKE YOU'RE DETACHED.

223
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,333
AND YET, EVERY TIME
KOUHEI FEELS PAIN,

224
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,875
THIS AMULET DIGS INTO
YOUR CHEST ABOVE YOUR HEART.

225
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,291
SO WHILE YOU'RE MAKING
PLANS FROM THE SHADOWS,

226
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,375
ASK YOURSELF, IS THIS TRIAL
OF YOURS WORTH IT?

227
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,750
IF KOUHEI DOES FALL
APART FROM THIS,

228
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,833
AND IF HAZUKI LOSES HERSELF
AS SHE ONCE DID,

229
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,708
THEN WHAT WILL WE
HAVE LEFT TO SAVE?

230
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,208
- I'M GOING HOME NOW.
JUST LET ME GET PAST.

231
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,750
- SURELY YOU'VE REALIZED BY NOW
YOU'RE TOO DIFFERENT.

232
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,875
YOU COMING TO LIVE WITH US
WAS AN EXPERIMENT.

233
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,958
AND IT'S CLEAR TO
ALL OF US THAT IT'S FAILED.

234
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,250
- MOVE IT!

235
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,666
- FACE THE FACTS. YOU'LL
NEVER BE HUMAN, HAZUKI.

236
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,916
I'M JUST BEING HONEST
WITH YOU.

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,166
THERE'S SIMPLY NO PLACE FOR

238
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,083
A CREATURE LIKE
YOU IN OUR HOUSE.

239
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,833
YOU ARE NOT NEEDED
OR WANTED HERE.

240
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,750
THE OTHERS MAY PRETEND
TO PUT UP WITH YOU

241
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,125
TO SPARE YOUR FEELINGS,

242
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,666
BUT THE TRUTH IS YOU AREN'T
ACCEPTED BY ANY OF US.

243
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,375
WE WANT YOU OUT, HAZUKI.
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.

244
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,500
- BUT, THAT CAN'T BE TRUE!

245
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,125
- AND WHY NOT?

246
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,291
- WHAT ABOUT WHAT
KOUHEI SAID TO ME?

247
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,541
- YOU'RE WHAT KEEPS ME GOING,
THROUGH ALL THE HARD STUFF.

248
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,500
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT!

249
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,083
KOUHEI WANTS ME TO BE
WITH HIM. I KNOW HE DOES!

250
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,958
- TAKE A LOOK AT KOUHEI NOW,
HAZUKI. YOU HORRIFY HIM.

251
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,833
THE MERE SIGHT OF YOU
MAKES HIM SCREAM IN TERROR.

252
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,125
- BUT, NO!
THAT'S BECAUSE...

253
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,375
- BECAUSE HE SEES WHAT YOU ARE.

254
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,833
- ( sobbing )

255
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,875
- ( clanging )

256
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,166
- Yayoi: STOP IT, SEIJI!

257
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,291
KOUHEI WILL MASTER HIS JAGAN
AND OVERCOME HIS FEARS.

258
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,083
HE WILL OVERCOME THEM
BECAUSE HE HAS NO OTHER CHOICE.

259
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,333
AND WHEN HE DOES,

260
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,000
HE WILL WANT
HAZUKI WITH HIM.

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,416
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

262
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,458
- ( clattering )

263
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,333
- THE THINGS THAT
YOU HAVE SUFFERED?

264
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,875
THE PAIN THAT KOUHEI IS
DEALING WITH NOW?

265
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,375
DID YOU KNOW THIS
WOULD HAPPEN?

266
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,000
- ( gasping )

267
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,833
- DID YOU FORESEE ALL THIS
FROM THE BEGINNING, OLD MAN?

268
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,375
- I THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE IT.

269
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,000
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW GREAT
HAZUKI'S BURDEN WAS.

270
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,458
- WE'VE MADE MISTAKES.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

271
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,166
BUT THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW.

272
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,208
ALL WE CAN DO IS TRY
TO FIND A WAY THROUGH.

273
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,000
- I HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT USING THE POWER.

274
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,583
- BUT YOU CAN'T.

275
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,083
YOU KNOW IT COULD KILL YOU!

276
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,625
- THERE MAY BE NO OTHER WAY.

277
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,916
- IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO TO HELP?

278
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,000
- ( distant rumbling )

279
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,125
WHAT WAS THAT?

280
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,208
THE MAGIC BARRIER'S BEEN BROKEN!

281
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,333
- ( gasping )

282
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,583
HAIJI, STAY WITH KOUHEI.
MAKE SURE HE'S SAFE!

283
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,708
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

284
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,833
- PLEASE, JUST GO!

285
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,583
- ( rumbling )

286
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,083
- ( Hazuki exclaiming )

287
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,541
- Yayoi: THE TREES
HAVE BEEN POSSESSED.

288
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,083
SUBMIT TO MY CONTROL!

289
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,958
- PLEASE ASSIST US, SPIRITS!

290
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,208
- NOT ENOUGH. HAZUKI,
WE NEED YOUR POWER NOW.

291
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,333
- ( gasping )

292
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,708
- YOU HAVE TO FEED.

293
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,291
- BUT, BUT, KOUHEI!
HE'S TERRIFIED OF ME.

294
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,375
- I TOLD HIM HE HAD
TO BEAT HIS FEAR.

295
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,666
HE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT.

296
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,916
HE HAS NO OTHER OPTIONS.

297
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,166
NOW GO TO HIM!

298
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,750
- RIGHT!

299
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,250
- LOOK OUT!

300
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,541
- WHO'S THERE?

301
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,666
- YOU HAVE TO HURRY!

302
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,083
- ( gasping )

303
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,083
- ( explosion )

304
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,625
- THIS IS OUR FIGHT NOW, TOO.

305
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,291
- WE'RE IN THIS WITH YOU, YAYOI.

306
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,875
- ( panting )

307
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,541
- Seiji: THE MERE SIGHT OF YOU
MAKES HIM SCREAM IN TERROR.

308
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,583
- Yayoi: KOUHEI WILL MASTER HIS
JAGAN AND OVERCOME HIS FEARS.

309
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,125
- PLEASE ACCEPT ME,
KOUHEI. PLEASE.

310
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,041
- WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!
WAKE UP, SLAVE!

311
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,958
- ( knock on door )

312
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,666
- ALL RIGHT, KOUHEI. GOTTA
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

313
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,500
IT'S TIME. COME ON.

314
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,041
- DON'T YOU GET IT? WE CAN'T
DO THIS WITHOUT YOU!

315
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,375
GET OFF YOUR BUTT!

316
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,166
- I HAVE TO GO HELP THEM.
I HAVE TO DO MY PART!

317
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,666
GET UP, OR HAZUKI'S
GOING TO BE TAKEN!

318
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,666
- I NEED YOU.

319
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,916
- Jeda: I DON'T SEE
MISTRESS LUNA.

320
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,958
- ( all gasping )

321
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,541
- Yayoi: YOU AGAIN!

322
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,000
- THERE'S NO POINT IN RESISTING.

323
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,291
- SEIJI!

324
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,708
- IT WOULD'VE BEEN
SO MUCH EASIER

325
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,708
IF YOU HAD JUST
HANDED OVER THE GIRL.

326
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,083
- Ryuuhei: THIS VAMPIRE'S
POSSESSED HIM!

327
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,250
- HAZUKI, THIS IS IT!

328
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,916
- ( Kouhei screaming )

329
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:56,875
- BE STRONG, KOUHEI!

330
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,250
- THE VAMPIRES ARE HERE, KOUHEI.

331
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,333
MASTER YAYOI AND THE OTHERS
ARE TRYING TO FIGHT THEM OFF,

332
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,291
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

333
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,125
I'M HERE BECAUSE
I NEED TO KISS YOU.

334
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,333
KOUHEI!

335
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,333
- ( whimpering )

336
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,625
- ( screaming )

337
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,958
- WHY ARE YOU IN SO MUCH PAIN?

338
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,541
AM I REALLY SO TERRIBLE THAT
I SCARE YOU THIS MUCH, KOUHEI?

339
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,333
- ( screaming )

340
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,083
- ( grunting )

341
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,000
- OH, NO! ARE YOU OKAY?

342
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,750
- THIS HAS ALWAYS
BEEN A ONE-MAN JOB.

343
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,041
I NEVER NEEDED THAT
BUMBLING FOOL VARGAS

344
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,958
OR THE SNOTTY LITTLE PRINCESS.

345
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,625
THE MASTER WILL THANK ONLY ME!

346
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,125
MISTRESS LUNA!

347
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,958
RETURN PEACEFULLY
WITH ME TO YOUR MASTER,

348
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,333
AND I WON'T HAVE TO HURT
YOUR MISERABLE HUMAN PETS.

349
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,625
- THIS REALLY IS ALL MY FAULT.

350
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,208
( sobbing )

351
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,416
KOUHEI?

352
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,833
YOU REMEMBER THE
FIRST TIME WE MET?

353
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,375
I NEEDED YOU TO GET ME
OUT OF THAT CASTLE.

354
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,041
YOU WERE SO STUBBORN
AND FRUSTRATING,

355
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,791
AND SUCH A TERRIBLE SLAVE.

356
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,875
BUT YOU GOT ME OUT.

357
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,041
YOU HELPED ME LOOK
FOR MY MOTHER.

358
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,208
AND YOU GAVE ME A HOME.

359
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,750
YOU FOUGHT WITH ME,
AND TEASED ME,

360
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,041
AND MADE ME WANNA SLAP
YOUR BIG, STUPID HEAD,

361
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,916
BUT YOU WOULD
NEVER GAVE UP ON ME.

362
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,458
YOU GAVE ME THIS GREAT FAMILY

363
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,750
AND MADE ME REALIZE I DIDN'T
HAVE TO BE ALONE ANYMORE.

364
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,750
AND EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T
FOUND MY MOTHER,

365
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,375
IT HASN'T BEEN SO BAD.

366
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,916
BECAUSE I'VE HAD YOU ALL.

367
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,083
YOU GAVE ME THEM.

368
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,958
AND BECAUSE OF YOU,
THEY LEARNED TO ACCEPT ME

369
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,708
AND CARE ABOUT ME AND
TREAT ME LIKE ONE OF THEIR OWN.

370
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,041
NO MATTER HOW HARD THINGS GOT,

371
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,583
YOU WERE ALWAYS THERE
TO PROTECT ME,

372
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,958
AND COME RESCUE ME,

373
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,875
EVEN WHEN I WAS SO AWFUL
I DIDN'T DESERVE IT AT ALL.

374
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,166
YOU REFUSED TO GIVE UP ON ME!

375
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,416
THIS WOULD'VE BEEN A LOT EASIER
TO SAY IF I WAS A NORMAL GIRL.

376
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,875
I'M SURE I COULD'VE SAID IT
SOONER AND BETTER THAN THIS,

377
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,583
BUT I'LL SAY IT NOW.

378
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,625
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

379
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,291
AND I LOVE YOU, KOUHEI!

380
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,958
- ( sobbing )

381
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,791
- ( groaning )

382
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,750
- THIS IS FOR KOUHEI.

383
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,916
PLEASE GIVE IT TO HIM SINCE
I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF.

384
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,166
- BUT, HAZUKI, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

385
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,625
- YOU HAVE TO PROMISE NEVER
TO BOTHER THEM AGAIN.

386
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,541
I'LL GO WITH YOU NOW.
BACK TO "MY KIND."

387
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,208
- ( theme song playing )

388
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,708
( singing in Japanese )

389
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,458
- Hiromi: HELLO, BIG BROTHER!

390
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,250
TIME TO STOP SCREAMING
AND ANSWER A LITTLE RIDDLE.

391
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:04,208
EVEN YOU CAN FIGURE THIS ONE
OUT, I PROMISE. HERE GOES!

392
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,666
WHAT IS BLACK WHEN YOU BUY IT,

393
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,458
RED WHEN YOU USE IT, AND GRAY
WHEN YOU THROW IT AWAY?

394
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,416
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
GIVING UP ALREADY!

395
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,708
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU.

396
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,541
FULL, FULL, FULL MOON!

397
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,250
THE ANSWER IS
CHARCOAL, DUMMY!

398
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,750
NEXT TIME ON MOON PHASE.

399
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:19,875
"GOOD-BYE BIG BROTHER...

400
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,625
I'M GOING BACK?
I'M REALLY GOING BACK?"

401
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,833
TRY TO SMARTEN UP
A BIT BY THEN, OKAY?
