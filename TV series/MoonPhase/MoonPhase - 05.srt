1
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,208
- I'VE HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU, MISTRESS LUNA.

2
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,750
IT'S TRULY AN HONOR.

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:20,458
- IS THAT SO? TOO BAD I CAN'T
SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU.

4
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,625
- NOW, NOW, MISTRESS LUNA.

5
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,041
- WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING ME
THAT? THAT'S NOT WHO I AM!

6
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,541
MY NAME IS HAZUKI!

7
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:30,000
- MY, MY. WHAT A STRANGE
SENSE OF HUMOR YOU HAVE.

8
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:34,208
YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN WATCHING
YOU, WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT.

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,916
WHEN YOU WOULD BATHE
IN THE FULL MOON

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,541
AND RETURN TO YOUR
TRUE SELF AGAIN.

11
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:39,750
SO HERE WE ARE.

12
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,208
YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN.

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,458
IT'S TIME TO RETURN HOME TO
THE CASTLE, MISTRESS LUNA,

14
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,791
WHERE YOU BELONG.

15
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,833
- STOP CALLING ME THAT.
IT'S NOT MY NAME!

16
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,166
- YOU'RE SERIOUS, AREN'T YOU?

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,833
- OF COURSE I AM, YOU FREAK!
NOW, WHO ARE YOU?

18
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,583
- WHAT A TROUBLING SITUATION.

19
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,458
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD
BRING LUNA OUT?

20
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,791
I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO HER.

21
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,083
- TELL ME YOUR NAME!

22
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,541
- FORGIVE ME, MY TERRIBLE
MANNERS. MY NAME IS ELFRIEDE.

23
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,583
I AM SERVANT TO THE STEWARD
OF SCHWARTZ QUELLE CASTLE.

24
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,041
COUNT KINKEL IS MY
MASTER'S NAME.

25
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,958
- ( gasps )

26
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,375
- AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH
MY MASTER'S WISHES,

27
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,541
I HAVE TRAVELED FROM GERMANY TO
BRING YOU HOME SAFELY, MISTRESS.

28
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,875
I HOPE YOU WILL RECOGNIZE
ME FROM NOW ON.

29
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,500
- ( theme song playing )

30
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

31
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,791
- OWIE, WELL, IF YOU'VE COME
TO TAKE ME BACK BY FORCE,

32
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,208
I PROMISE IT WON'T BE EASY.

33
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,458
I'M REALLY GOOD AT
KICKING AND SCREAMING.

34
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,958
- THAT'S NOT MY INTENTION
AT ALL, MISTRESS LUNA.

35
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,583
OUR WISH IS THAT YOU RETURN TO
THE CASTLE OF YOUR OWN VOLITION,

36
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,333
HAPPY AND UNBOUND.

37
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,250
I'VE COME TO EXPLAIN
THE MERITS OF THAT CHOICE.

38
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,000
I HOPE YOU'LL AGREE.

39
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,791
- OH, YOU DO, HUH?
WHAT IF I SAY NO?

40
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,708
- OH DEAR, I HADN'T
ENTERTAINED THAT POSSIBILITY.

41
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,958
IF YOU DON'T RETURN,

42
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,541
THAT MEANS I WON'T BE
ABLE TO FULFILL MY DUTY,

43
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,833
AND THE COUNT WILL BE
VERY UNHAPPY WITH ME.

44
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,083
- I'M AWFULLY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, OKAY?

45
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,291
BUT I'M NOT STEPPING
FOOT IN THAT

46
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,666
DUMB, LONELY CASTLE
AGAIN, YOU UNDERSTAND?

47
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,041
TONIGHT OR EVER.

48
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,750
- ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANNA DO THIS, MISTRESS?

49
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,166
- WE'RE DONE HERE.
I'M NOT GOING BACK. GOODNIGHT.

50
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,583
TELL YOUR FRIEND TO WATCH WHERE
HE'S GOING. LITTLE PEST.

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,750
- ( squeaking )

52
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,125
- WHAT IS HE DOING?

53
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,750
WHAT THE...

54
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,250
- ( Haiji whimpers )

55
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,041
- ( clattering )

56
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,916
- (exclaims ) WHAT'S IT DOING?
HEY! THAT'S DANGEROUS!

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,166
WHOA! IT'S GONNA POKE
SOMEONE'S... HEY!

58
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,083
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

59
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,166
- ( clattering continues )

60
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,458
- ( exclaiming )

61
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,333
THAT DIDN'T FEEL GOOD!

62
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,625
HEY, NO FAIR! I THOUGHT
YOU SAID IT WAS MY CHOICE!

63
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,708
WHAT AM I CHOOSING BETWEEN?

64
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,708
GOING WITH YOU AND
A HOLE IN MY HEAD?

65
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,875
- ( screaming )

66
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,041
- YOU'LL HAVE TO
FORGIVE ME, MY DEAR.

67
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,250
AS I SAID, CONVINCING YOU
WAS MY INTENTION,

68
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,000
BUT I THOUGHT I'D BE
SPEAKING TO MISTRESS LUNA,

69
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,666
WHO'D BE MORE OPEN TO REASON.

70
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,291
I'M AFRAID NOW I NEED TO ALTER
MY TACTICS TO BRING YOU HOME.

71
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,875
- IT'S SO LATE.

72
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,125
I WONDER WHAT
THOSE KIDS COULD BE

73
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,708
DOING OUT AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT.

74
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,750
NOTHING TOO HORRIBLY DANGEROUS,
I HOPE.

75
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,583
- ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
LEAVE ME ALONE!

76
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,000
- REMARKABLE STRENGTH, MISTRESS,

77
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,541
BUT YOUR DELIVERY
NEEDS SOME WORK.

78
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,458
IT LACKS A CERTAIN ELEGANCE.

79
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,666
YOU KNOW, THE COUNT COULD

80
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,750
HELP YOU WITH THAT IF
YOU'RE NICE TO HIM.

81
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,916
- OH, SHUT UP.
LIKE YOU'RE ONE TO TALK!

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,333
YOU'RE USING A BALLED UP RAT
TO DO YOUR DIRTY WORK!

83
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,458
WHERE'S THE ELEGANCE IN THAT?

84
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,375
- INTERESTING POINT.

85
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,666
PERHAPS YOU'LL FIND THIS TO BE A
MORE RESPECTABLE SHOW OF POWER.

86
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,041
- HUH?

87
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,708
- ( roaring )

88
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,750
- ( screaming )

89
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,000
- SURE, I KNOW
THAT PART OF TOWN.

90
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,333
SO IT'S A SPREAD ON
OLD SWEET SHOPS, RIGHT?

91
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,708
- ( indistinct screaming )

92
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,000
- HEY, CAN I USE A CAMERAMAN
FRIEND OF MINE FOR THIS?

93
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,625
HE DOES AWESOME WORK!

94
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,083
GREAT. YOU'RE THE BEST!
I'LL BE IN TOUCH, OKAY?

95
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,916
FINALLY SOME REAL WORK!
KOUHEI'S GONNA BE SO EXCITED.

96
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,416
- ( monster growling )

97
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,833
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

98
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,791
- THOSE EYES... THAT POWER...

99
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,791
SHE DRANK THE BLOOD
OF HER SLAVE.

100
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,583
- ( panting )

101
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,666
YOU'RE TICKING ME OFF!

102
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,416
( exclaiming )

103
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,500
KOUHEI, NO!

104
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:18,791
- ( monster growls in pain )

105
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,333
- IT JUST DISINTEGRATED WHEN
IT GOT CLOSE TO KOUHEI.

106
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,500
KOUHEI?

107
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,416
- HAZUKI?

108
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,208
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM?

109
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,250
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO
SOME MODELING WORK?

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,916
- YOU MORON!

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,291
- HEY, WHAT WAS THAT? I'M SORRY.

112
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,375
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

113
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,625
- WRONG WITH ME?

114
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,250
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,
YOU HAIR-BRAINED IDIOT?

115
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,708
HOW COULD YOU BE FLIRTING
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

116
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,041
- SINCE WHEN WAS I FLIRTING?

117
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,083
I JUST ASKED HER IF I COULD
TAKE HER PHOTOGRAPH.

118
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,333
I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER.

119
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,291
- WELL, AND ISN'T THAT
A CONVENIENT EXCUSE!

120
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,375
SO YOU USE THAT LINE
ON EVERY GIRL YOU MEET?

121
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,625
- NO, ACTUALLY.

122
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,125
ONLY ON THE ONES WHO
SEEM FIT FOR THE JOB.

123
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,333
AND PROFESSIONALLY SPEAKING,

124
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,625
SHE'S WAY HOTTER AND
MORE MATURE THAN YOU.

125
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,708
OH, YEAH, THAT'S REAL MATURE.

126
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,791
- YOUR BLOOD'S SO THIN
IT'S GIVEN YOU BRAIN DAMAGE!

127
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,625
NO WONDER I CAN'T GET
ANY STRENGTH FROM IT.

128
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,416
YOU IDIOT!

129
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,000
- WHAT?

130
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,666
WAIT A MINUTE, ARE YOU TELLING
ME YOU SUCKED MY BLOOD AGAIN?

131
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,916
- GOT ANY COMPLAINTS?

132
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,125
- LOTS OF 'EM!
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE

133
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,375
OF ME WHILE I WAS ASLEEP!

134
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,250
- YOU'RE MY SLAVE!
I DO WHAT I WANT!

135
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,500
- I'M YOUR BODYGUARD!

136
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,875
- WELL YOU'RE DOING A FINE JOB!

137
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,625
HERE'S AN ENEMY
TRYING TO KIDNAP ME,

138
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,458
AND YOU'RE OFFERING
HER PRIVATE SESSIONS!

139
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,750
- STOP MAKING IT SOUND LIKE
THAT! IT'S FOR MY PORTFOLIO.

140
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,375
WAIT, DID YOU SAY "ENEMY"?

141
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,416
- THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

142
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,333
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

143
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:17,416
- NO, NO. I'VE SIMPLY REALIZED
I HAVE MORE TO THINK ABOUT.

144
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,333
I'LL BE LEAVING NOW.

145
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,375
- WHAT?

146
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,208
- ( exclaims in shock )

147
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,125
- HOLD ON. FIRST YOU SAY
YOU WANT TO TALK,

148
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,541
THEN YOU ATTACK,
THEN YOU LEAVE FOR NO REASON?

149
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,041
- ON THE CONTRARY, MISTRESS.

150
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,750
REASON DICTATES MY
ACTIONS ABOVE ALL.

151
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,000
I'LL RETURN IN A FEW DAYS TO

152
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,250
PRESENT A MORE
CONVINCING ARGUMENT.

153
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,125
I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE THIS CHANCE
TO CONTEMPLATE YOUR CHOICES,

154
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,083
AND THEIR EFFECTS.

155
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,958
MAY THE DARK OF NIGHT
PROTECT YOU, IN THE MEAN TIME.

156
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,750
- SO, THAT WOMAN, SHE WAS
ONE OF YOUR KIND, RIGHT?

157
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,166
- YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

158
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,666
I HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD
FROM MY MOTHER YET,

159
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,500
AND THEY'VE ALREADY
TRACKED ME DOWN.

160
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,416
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

161
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,666
- HEY, DON'T WORRY.

162
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,375
SHE JUST SAID SHE WANTED
TO CONVINCE YOU, RIGHT?

163
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,416
SO JUST KEEP SAYING NO.

164
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
- ( sighs ) THAT IS
WHAT SHE SAID.

165
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,041
BUT STILL, I DON'T KNOW.

166
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,250
WHY DO I FEEL SO TIRED, KOUHEI?

167
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,583
I KISSED YOU. I SHOULD HAVE MORE
ENERGY AFTER DRINKING BLOOD.

168
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,333
- HEY. LOOK AT ME, WILL YA?

169
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,750
YEAH, I NOTICED IT THE
FIRST TIME WE MET, TOO.

170
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,000
YOUR EYES TURN KINDA RED.

171
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,875
- DON'T SAY THAT.
I DON'T WANNA KNOW!

172
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,333
NOW WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

173
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,583
- YOU SAID YOU'RE REALLY TIRED,
RIGHT? WELL, HOP ON.

174
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,333
A CAB RIDE IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.
THIS IS THE BEST I CAN DO.

175
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,125
- WHAT, YOU WANNA GIVE
ME A PIGGY-BACK RIDE,

176
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,791
LIKE I'M SOME LITTLE KID?

177
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,083
- JUST GET ON, OKAY?

178
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,375
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACT
LIKE MY BABYSITTER.

179
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,833
YOU'RE MY SLAVE, AND THAT'S IT!

180
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,125
YOU'RE ONLY CARRYING ME
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SLAVES DO.

181
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:07,916
UNDERSTOOD?

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,625
- YES, SIR, MASTER, SIR.

183
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,208
- DON'T GET AN ATTITUDE.
SAY "YES" LIKE YOU MEAN IT!

184
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,333
- "YES LIKE YOU MEAN IT!"

185
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,166
- KOUHEI, DUMMY! SAY YES! 
- YES! 

186
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,541
- BRATTY SMART ALECK!
- YES!

187
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,875
- YOU'RE THE WORST SLAVE EVER!
- I CAN'T BREATHE!

188
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,500
- HAZUKI?

189
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,250
NEVER MIND.

190
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,833
- COME ON, LET'S GO!
- LAST ONE THERE

191
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,500
- GETS THE GROSS CANDY!
- WAIT UP, GUYS!

192
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,250
- ( camera clicking )

193
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,541
- ( all gasping )

194
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,708
- PRETTY COOL, HUH?
- I WANNA PICTURE OF THAT!

195
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:04,916
- TAKE MY PICTURE!
- NO WAY, ME FIRST!

196
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,125
- I'LL RETURN IN A FEW DAYS

197
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,125
TO PRESENT A MORE
CONVINCING ARGUMENT.

198
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,791
I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE THIS CHANCE
TO CONTEMPLATE YOUR CHOICES,

199
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,916
AND THEIR EFFECTS.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,041
- ( yawns )

201
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,666
IT'D TAKE ONE HECK
OF AN ARGUMENT TO

202
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,958
CONVINCE HAZUKI TO GO BACK.

203
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,958
OH WELL, GUESS WE'LL
SEE SOON ENOUGH.

204
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,916
- Children: PRETTY PLEASE,
WOULD YOU TAKE OUR PICTURE?

205
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,041
- WHY DON'T YOU PLAY
THE QUIET GAME NOW?

206
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,625
- WELL, THE NEXT TIME WE GET A
CALL FROM HAUNTED CANDY MONTHLY,

207
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,750
WE'LL BE SET!

208
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,833
- IT HAPPENED AGAIN?

209
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,333
- OH WELL, IT'S
NOT A TOTAL WASTE.

210
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,125
WE'LL RUN THESE
IN OUR MAGAZINE.

211
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,833
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
GHOSTS IN A CANDY SHOP?

212
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,041
- WHAT CAN I SAY? IT'S A GIFT.

213
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,333
- I'LL JUST CALL THE CLIENT

214
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,500
AND TELL 'EM THERE WAS
A TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION.

215
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,750
AND IF I GET ANY MORE
ASSIGNMENTS I CAN PASS YOUR WAY,

216
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,625
I'LL LET YA KNOW.

217
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,208
I'M NOT GIVING UP ON YOU YET.

218
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,500
- THANK YOU. YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

219
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,375
- OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

220
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,541
I'VE GOT A LITTLE PRESENT
TO GIVE YOU, KOUHEI.

221
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,000
- A PRESENT?

222
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,375
- FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

223
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,666
- DARN IT.
THAT STUPID KOUHEI.

224
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,750
TREATING ME LIKE A LITTLE KID

225
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,916
WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE MY SLAVE.

226
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,708
- Kouhei: NO, ACTUALLY.

227
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,125
ONLY ON THE ONES WHO
SEEM FIT FOR THE JOB.

228
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,333
AND PROFESSIONALLY SPEAKING,

229
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,625
SHE'S WAY HOTTER AND
MORE MATURE THAN YOU.

230
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,291
- LIKE I CARE!

231
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,083
- WHO IS HE, MISTRESS LUNA?

232
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,250
YOU DRANK FROM HIS NECK,

233
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,583
YET SOMEHOW, HE DIDN'T
BECOME YOUR SLAVE.

234
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:43,333
AND THAT POWER THAT
ENCIRCLED HIM... WHAT WAS IT?

235
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,125
WITH WHOM HAVE YOU ALLIED?

236
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,625
- Ryuuhei: IN OTHER WORDS,
KOUHEI IS SO SPIRITUALLY INEPT,

237
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,958
SO COMPLETELY BLIND TO
ANYTHING SUPERNATURAL,

238
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:56,125
THAT THE DEMONIC MESSENGER'S
POWERS HAD AN OPPOSITE EFFECT.

239
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,916
DESTROYING IT INSTEAD.

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,666
- I SEE.

241
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,541
SO THE DEMON'S ENERGY
JUST BACKFIRED.

242
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,916
IT WASN'T THAT BIG BROTHER HAD

243
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,458
SOME HIDDEN STRENGTH THAT
CAME OUT IN THE FIGHT?

244
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,750
- NOPE.

245
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,625
IN TERMS OF POWER,
KOUHEI SCORES A ZERO.

246
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,750
( laughs )

247
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,875
- I'D RATHER TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE NOW.

248
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,875
LIKE HOW LONELY AND
BORING THIS SHOP CAN BE

249
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,416
WHEN THERE AREN'T ANY CUSTOMERS.

250
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,916
- QUIET TIMES ARE IMPORTANT.

251
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,625
THEY GIVE US A CHANCE TO TAKE
STOCK AND CLEAR THE DUST.

252
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,750
- I GUESS SO.

253
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,625
- ( Haiji mewing )

254
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,250
- HAIJI. NO CAUSING MISCHIEF.

255
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,375
- ( knocking on door )

256
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,083
- HEY, OPEN THE DOOR! HURRY UP!

257
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:34,750
- WHO IS THAT?

258
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,375
- I THINK IT'S BIG BROTHER!

259
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,166
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S IN TROUBLE.

260
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,500
- AH, THANK GOODNESS...
THESE' RE FOR YOU!

261
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,333
- ( Hazuki screams )

262
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,458
YOU NITWIT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

263
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,583
WOW! I'VE BEEN WANTING
MORE CLOTHES!

264
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,125
YOU CAN ONLY RECYCLE
THE SAME OUTFIT SO MANY TIMES.

265
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,750
THESE ARE THE
COOLEST PRESENTS EVER

266
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,333
AND THERE ARE SO MANY OF 'EM.

267
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,291
- LEAVE IT TO ANOTHER GOOD
CITIZEN OF THE FEMALE RACE

268
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,708
TO NOTICE WHAT YA NEEDED.

269
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,875
HIROMI'S DEFINITELY A
CARD-CARRYING MEMBER.

270
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,250
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?
- MMM-MMM.

271
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,583
- HEY, COME ON,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

272
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,166
YOU FIND SOMETHING
YOU DON'T LIKE IN THERE?

273
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,625
- IT'S MY STUFF. GO AWAY!

274
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,000
- WELL, I'M THE ONE WHO
BROUGHT IT OVER HERE.

275
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,083
JUST LET ME SEE WHAT IT IS.

276
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,750
- IT'S UNDERWEAR, OKAY!

277
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,791
- UNDER... DON'T SHOW ME THAT!

278
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,333
- I WASN'T GOING TO,
YOU NOSY IDIOT!

279
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,666
- ( Ryuuhei chuckles )

280
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,375
- NOW STOP STANDING
THERE STARING.

281
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,166
TAKE THESE THINGS UPSTAIRS.

282
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,541
- HUH? WHY DO I HAVE TO?

283
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,875
- JUST SHUT UP AND GO!

284
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,250
- THANKS FOR THE HELP.

285
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,791
OUCH. DUMB BAGS DON'T FIT!

286
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,166
- ( mewing )

287
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,666
- WHAT, MY FRIEND?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

288
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,416
POOR THING. YOU CAN'T EVEN
TALK IN THAT FORM, CAN YOU?

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,125
AH, WE HAVE A GUEST.

290
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,000
I MUST SAY,
THIS IS A RARE TREAT.

291
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,750
A YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL,
FOREIGN WOMAN,

292
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,958
FINDING HER WAY INTO A
JAPANESE ANTIQUE SHOP,

293
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,500
IN A QUIET PART OF TOWN.

294
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,083
- DO YOU FIND THAT PECULIAR?

295
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,958
- OH, NOT AT ALL. ANTIQUES
WITHSTAND THE TEST OF TIME.

296
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,458
IF THERE WASN'T SOMETHING ABOUT
THEM THAT COULD CAPTURE HEARTS

297
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,041
FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT,

298
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,875
THEN THEY NEVER
WOULD'VE SURVIVED.

299
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,000
- YES. I WOULD
CERTAINLY AGREE.

300
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,666
TRUE BEAUTY SHOULD
TRANSCEND CULTURE

301
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,833
AND FASCINATE ANY
EYES THAT SEE IT.

302
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,041
- WELL, YOU HAVE
DISCRIMINATING TASTE.

303
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,541
THAT'S AN EARLY 17TH CENTURY
IMARI WARE YOU'RE HOLDING.

304
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,500
ITS UNIQUE TEXTURE
AND ARABESQUE DESIGN

305
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,833
MAKE IT QUITE POPULAR AMONG
THE MOST EDUCATED COLLECTORS.

306
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,416
- OH? I HAD NO IDEA.

307
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,916
- IF YOU'RE A FAN OF
THE IMARI STYLE, MADAM,

308
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,500
THERE IS ANOTHER MORE
SUBSTANTIAL PIECE

309
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,625
I'VE RECENTLY
GOTTEN MY HANDS ON.

310
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,791
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE?

311
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,875
- WHY YES, THANK YOU.

312
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,125
OH, MY.

313
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,291
YOU DO KNOW HOW
TO MAKE A GIRL SMILE.

314
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,666
- ( laughing )

315
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,916
- GRANDFATHER, I DIDN'T KNOW
WE HAD A CUSTOMER.

316
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,291
HELLO! WELCOME TO OUR...

317
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,791
- WELL! HI.

318
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,916
- ( Hazuki screams )

319
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,916
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

320
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,083
- WHY DO YOU THINK?

321
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,333
AS PROMISED, I'VE COME
TO SEE YOU AGAIN,

322
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,500
LITTLE ONE, SO WE
CAN FINISH OUR CHAT.

323
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,916
- IT'S ALREADY FINISHED.
I SAID I'M NOT GOING BACK!

324
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,125
- NOW, NOW, MY DEAR,
DON'T THROW A TANTRUM.

325
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,458
WITHOUT A TRANQUIL MIND
AND A POSITIVE OUTLOOK,

326
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,375
HOW WILL WE EVER HAVE
A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION?

327
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,125
- THERE'S NOTHING TO DISCUSS,
YOU JERK!

328
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,666
- GEEZ, HAZUKI, SOUNDS
LIKE YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.

329
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,583
- AH! GOOD EVENING.

330
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,916
- OH, WHOA, IT'S YOU AGAIN. HI.

331
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,375
- DON'T SIT DOWN.
THIS IS JUST BETWEEN US.

332
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,083
- OH, ON THE CONTRARY,
THIS IS PERFECT TIMING.

333
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,333
I WAS HOPING I COULD
SPEAK TO YOU AS WELL.

334
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,708
- TO ME? ABOUT WHAT?

335
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,333
- THE MODELING WORK.
I'D BE DELIGHTED TO TRY IT.

336
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,458
- MODELING WORK?

337
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,083
- HUH?

338
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,000
- DON'T TELL ME
THAT YOU FORGOT.

339
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:04,166
- NO! THERE'S NO FORGETTING
HERE. I JUST UH... I DIDN'T...

340
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,416
LOOK, YOU'RE BEING
SERIOUS RIGHT?

341
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,666
YOU'RE NOT JUST
PULLING MY LEG?

342
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,041
- OH, I'M VERY SERIOUS.

343
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,250
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE,

344
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,291
AND THERE'S SO MUCH
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT.

345
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,916
LIKE, WHAT SORT OF POSES
WOULD YOU WANT ME TO TAKE?

346
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,583
AND BESIDES,

347
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,083
ON A MORE PERSONAL LEVEL, I FIND
YOU IRRESISTIBLY FASCINATING.

348
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,541
- ( giggling )

349
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,541
- ( Hazuki grunts )

350
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,041
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

351
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,125
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE AND
START FLIRTING WITH MY SLAVE.

352
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,541
HE'S NOT COMMUNAL PROPERTY.

353
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,791
- ( laughing ) YOU'RE SO FUNNY!

354
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,541
- WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING
ABOUT NOW, HUH?

355
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,041
- FORGIVE ME,
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE.

356
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,083
IT'S JUST THAT THE COUNT
TOLD ME ABOUT YOU,

357
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,458
AND HOW HEADSTRONG
YOU COULD BE,

358
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,375
BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS
TRYING TO KEEP ME FOCUSED.

359
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,583
I DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS SERIOUS.

360
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,375
- OH, REALLY?
YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN THAT FOR ME?

361
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,541
- OH, YOU DON'T WANNA HEAR THIS.

362
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,416
- GO AHEAD. I CAN TAKE IT.

363
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,583
- YOU'LL BE ANGRY.

364
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,500
- YOU CAN'T SAY YOU KNOW STUFF
ABOUT ME THEN NOT SAY WHAT.

365
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,291
- FINE.

366
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,333
YOU'RE DELICATE, BUT RECKLESS

367
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,166
AND HOT-TEMPERED
AT THE SAME TIME.

368
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,708
YOU SEEM CONFIDENT AND DECISIVE,

369
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,250
BUT IN TRUTH YOU'RE
EASILY SCARED,

370
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,250
QUICK TO RUN FROM DIFFICULTY
WITHOUT CONCERN FOR REASON.

371
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,833
YOU'RE LIKE A CAT
WHO CLIMBS A TREE

372
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,500
THEN CAN'T FIND
HER WAY BACK DOWN.

373
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,458
- AND FURTHERMORE...
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

374
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,083
- REALLY? THERE'S
QUITE A BIT MORE.

375
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,416
- WELL, KEEP IT TO YOURSELF!

376
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,375
I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE
WHILE YOU INSULT ME

377
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,875
JUST 'CAUSE YOU
MAKE IT SOUND SMART.

378
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,125
IS THAT THE ONLY REASON YOU
CAME HERE, TO HARASS ME?

379
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,750
- OH, NOT AT ALL, LITTLE ONE.

380
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,958
MY PURPOSE FOR COMING
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME.

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,458
TO BEG YOU, MISTRESS.
PLEASE RETURN TO THE CASTLE.

382
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,083
- ( grunting )
FOR THE LAST TIME.

383
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,291
GO AWAY!

384
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,375
GO AWAY! GO AWAY! GO AWAY!
GO AWAY! GO AWAY! GO AWAY!

385
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,875
- DEAR, YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN.

386
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,833
YOU'RE THROWING
AN ABSOLUTE TANTRUM.

387
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,166
- GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE!

388
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,958
YOU GOLDEN-HAIRED EYESORE!
YOU RAT-WRANGLING,

389
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,875
POISON-TONGUED VAMPIRE WITCH!

390
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,166
I NEVER WANNA
SEE YOU AGAIN!

391
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,208
- THERE GOES THE
17TH CENTURY...

392
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,208
- ( Hazuki panting )

393
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,166
- HAVE YOU GOTTEN IT OUT
OF YOUR SYSTEM, MISTRESS?

394
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,416
OR IS THERE MORE?

395
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,958
- I'LL SHOW YOU MORE!

396
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:13,958
- HEY!

397
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,125
- I NEED TO SUCK
YOUR BLOOD AGAIN!

398
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,541
- GET OFF ME.
MY NECK'S NOT AN OPEN BAR.

399
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,916
- I'M GOING TO BEAT HER
SENSELESS! I NEED MORE ENERGY!

400
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
- WELL THEN DO SOME JUMPING
JACKS! DON'T SUCK MY BLOOD!

401
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,458
- KOUHEI, YOU DUMMY!

402
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,333
- NO MEANS NO. COME ON.
STOP BEING A LITTLE BRAT.

403
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,666
- ( door sliding open )

404
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,416
- I THINK IT'D BE BETTER
IF I LEFT NOW.

405
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,916
I'LL GIVE YOU A
CHANCE TO CALM DOWN,

406
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,791
AND WE CAN RESUME OUR
CONVERSATION ANOTHER TIME.

407
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,791
HAPPY NIGHTS UNTIL THEN.

408
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,208
- NEVER COME BACK AGAIN!

409
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,208
- UNBELIEVABLE.

410
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,333
- JUST SHUT UP AND
GET SOME SALT!

411
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,125
WE'RE GONNA PURIFY
THIS WHOLE HOUSE!

412
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,291
- SO, THERE REALLY ARE
VAMPIRES LIKE THAT.

413
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,291
I NEED TO HAVE A
LONG TALK WITH HER.

414
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,875
- Hazuki: WHY ARE YOU SUCH
A TERRIBLE SLAVE?

415
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,125
- Elfriede: KOUHEI MORIOKA.

416
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,958
I'M CERTAIN NOW.

417
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,208
EVEN THOUGH MISTRESS LUNA'S
TASTED YOUR BLOOD,

418
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,666
YOU ARE NOT HER SLAVE.

419
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,041
THERE'S ONLY ONE WHO
COULD WITHSTAND THE KISS.

420
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
YOU ARE THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

421
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,458
THE KEY TO CHANGING MY FATE.

422
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,125
- ( theme song playing )

423
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

424
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,458
- Hazuki: OKAY, BIG BROTHER.
IT'S RIDDLE TIME AGAIN,

425
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:03,625
WHO HAS BETTER STORIES TO TELL,
A MONKEY OR A CRAB?

426
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,583
NOW THINK ABOUT IT,
MONKEY OR CRAB?

427
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,458
FULL, FULL, FULL MOON!

428
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,916
TIME'S UP!

429
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,416
THE ANSWER IS, A MONKEY HAS
BETTER STORIES, OF COURSE.

430
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,083
CRABS DON'T HAVE TALES AT ALL.

431
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:20,416
NEXT TIME ON MOON PHASE,
IT'S "HEART THROBS IN KYOTO."

432
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,708
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

433
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,541
AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE
WHAT HAPPENS TO HAIJI.

434
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,041
OKAY, I'VE SAID ENOUGH.
GOODNIGHT, BIG BROTHER.
