1
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,416
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,083
- ( pitter-patter or rain )

4
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,916
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE?

5
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,500
- WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
SCRAPES AND BRUISES, SEIJI.

6
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,208
IT'S A BIT MORE COMPLICATED.

7
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,833
TWO OR THREE OF HIS RIBS
HAVE BEEN SHATTERED.

8
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,666
HE HAS ABDOMINAL LACERATIONS,

9
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,541
AND HIS LUNG HAS A HOLE
THE SIZE OF A FIST.

10
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,875
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT LITTLE BEAST

11
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,458
OF A CHILD DID THIS TO HIM.

12
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,083
KOUHEI WAS THERE TO SAVE HER.

13
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:56,375
HE WAS POWERLESS, BUT HE TRIED
ANYWAY. AND SHE BETRAYED HIM!

14
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,250
- SEIJI, WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT BUILDING

15
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,875
CANNOT BE BLAMED ON HER.

16
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,125
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,500
SHE WAS THE ONE
WHO INFLICTED THE WOUNDS!

18
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,166
- COUNT KINKEL HAD
CONTROL OF HER MIND,

19
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,583
SHE WAS NOTHING
BUT A PUPPET.

20
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,750
ANY ANGER YOU HAVE SHOULD
BE SAVED FOR HIM.

21
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,333
AND THERE'S NO TELLING
WHERE HE IS NOW.

22
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,541
I CAN'T SENSE ANYTHING FROM THE
SHIKIGAMI I SENT AFTER HIM.

23
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,500
WE CAN ONLY HOPE HE
DOESN'T COME FOR MORE.

24
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,958
- HE WON'T MAKE HIS MOVE
IN THE DAYLIGHT.

25
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,916
NOT A BLOODSUCKING
CREATURE LIKE HIM!

26
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:29,416
- BLINDED BY FURY. I WAS RIGHT
TO SEND THE CHILD HOME.

27
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,500
- I'M SO CONFUSED.

28
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,791
WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT ROOM?

29
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,083
- ( thunder rumbles )

30
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,375
- KOUHEI WAS STANDING
IN FRONT OF ME.

31
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,958
I JUST KNEW HE WAS,
LIKE YOU DO IN A DREAM.

32
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,416
BUT THEN...

33
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,583
BIG BROTHER, PLEASE!

34
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,833
WHAT HAPPENED? HOW DID
KOUHEI GET HURT?

35
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,583
IT'S NO USE.
I CAN'T REMEMBER IT AT ALL.

36
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,000
- ( clock ticking )

37
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,375
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
I TRIED EVERYTHING.

38
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,625
- WELL, WHAT EXACTLY IS
KOUHEI SUPPOSED TO BE TO YOU?

39
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,000
- HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE MY SLAVE.

40
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,208
- ( he laughs )

41
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,583
- THAT'S THE LIFE FOR YOU, BOY!
GO ON, NOW!

42
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,166
BE THIS YOUNG GIRL'S SLAVE!

43
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,333
- GIVE IT A REST.
- WELL, HE'S GOT A POINT!

44
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:38,291
YOU CAN'T GO. YOU HAVE TO
STAY WITH YOUR MASTER.

45
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,250
HEY! HAVEN'T YOU PUT
THE SEAWEED IN YET?

46
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,208
- UH-UH. FIGURED I'D
ADD IT IN LATER.

47
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,041
- IT'S MISO SOUP. YOU HAVE TO
COOK THE INGREDIENTS!

48
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,375
- JUST LET ME DO IT!
- HEY!

49
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,125
IT'S MY STUFF! GO AWAY!

50
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,625
WELL, I'M THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT IT OVER HERE,

51
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,250
- JUST LET ME SEE WHAT IT IS!
- IT'S UNDERWEAR, OKAY?

52
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,750
- UNDER... DON'T SHOW ME THAT!

53
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,000
- I WASN'T GOING TO,
YOU NOSY IDIOT!

54
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,541
- YOU THINK I'M JUST GONNA SIT
THERE WHILE YOU SUCK MY BLOOD?

55
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,875
- YOU'RE MY SLAVE, DUMMY!
THAT'S YOUR JOB!

56
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,625
- QUIT CALLING ME YOUR SLAVE!
I'M NOT YOUR SLAVE!

57
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,375
YOU JUST KEEP THINKING
THAT I AM!

58
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,000
- YOU NEVER LISTEN
TO ME, KOUHEI.

59
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,666
YOU'RE A BIG, STUBBORN JERK

60
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,666
WHO MAKES A BIG DEAL OUT
OF THE STUPIDEST THINGS!

61
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,000
BUT STILL,
YOU'RE MY FIRST SLAVE.

62
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,250
- Luna: AND NOW
YOU'RE ALL ALONE AGAIN.

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,708
BUT THAT CAN'T BE HELPED.

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,791
IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME.

65
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,750
LONELINESS IS SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD LEARN TO ACCEPT.

66
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,916
LONELINESS IS YOUR DESTINY.

67
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:25,291
- NO! WHAT IS THAT DOING HERE?
I THREW IT AWAY AT THE CASTLE!

68
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,583
- Luna: BUT YOU
CAN'T BE SURPRISED.

69
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,708
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOUR FATE
TO BE ALONE.

70
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,416
ANY HUMAN WHO GETS CLOSE TO
YOU WILL BE CURSED,

71
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,958
AND INEVITABLY DIE
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU ARE.

72
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,000
YOU DRINK HUMAN BLOOD.

73
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:44,208
YOU DESTROY THEIR LIVES.
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

74
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:49,083
BECAUSE YOU ARE A BLUE BLOOD,
A VAMPIRE OF NOBLE LINEAGE

75
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,708
AND IT IS YOUR RIGHT.

76
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,791
- NO! SHUT UP! I HATE YOU!

77
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,541
I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN
TO YOUR LIES ANYMORE!

78
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,541
- ( door opens )

79
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,750
- MASTER? WHAT'S WRONG?

80
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,833
- LIKE, TAKE THIS PRESENT
FOR EXAMPLE.

81
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,125
HE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT
IT FOR YOU,

82
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,666
PUT IT IN A NICE GIFT
BAG AND EVERYTHING.

83
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,083
BUT FOR SOME REASON HE TOLD ME
TO GIVE IT YOU INSTEAD,

84
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,541
LIKE IT WAS MY IDEA.

85
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,875
- KOUHEI.

86
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,125
I HAVE TO SEE HIM.

87
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,500
- ( pitter-patter of rain )

88
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,458
- COME ON! YOU DIDN'T FORGET
ANYTHING, DID YOU?

89
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,958
- UH-UH.

90
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,583
- HEY, GIRLS. HOW ARE YOU?

91
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,916
- JUST OUR LUCK.

92
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,583
THE ONE PERSON IN THE WORLD
WE DIDN'T WANNA SEE.

93
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:31,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN KYOTO?

94
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,458
- GRANDFATHER RYUUHEI
ASKED US TO COME.

95
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,250
WE DIDN'T GET MANY DETAILS
OVER THE PHONE,

96
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,458
HE JUST SAID KOUHEI WAS HURT.

97
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,833
AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,

98
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,583
WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING
USEFUL AND FILL US IN.

99
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,541
- WHAT?
- TELL US ABOUT KOUHEI!

100
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,041
WHY'S HE IN THE HOSPITAL?

101
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,666
YOU MEAN YOU
LIVE WITH HIM

102
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,708
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

103
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,625
- NO. SORRY.

104
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,416
- WHAT ARE YOU SAD ABOUT?
DID YOU LOSE A FANG?

105
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,458
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

106
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,250
YOU THINK SHE'S WORRIED
ABOUT KOUHEI TOO?

107
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,458
- NO, I'M NOT! I DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT JERK!

108
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,875
I JUST... I HATE LOOKING FOR
NEW SLAVES, THAT'S ALL.

109
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,708
- DON'T WORRY, MASTER!
IT'LL BE A-OK!

110
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,333
- YOU! YOU'RE THAT
SHIKIGAMI THEY SAVED!

111
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,666
- DON'T BOTHER PROTECTING
YOURSELF, MASTER.

112
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,500
KOUHEI'S GONNA BE FINE.

113
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,958
HE'S TOO STUBBORN TO KEEL OVER

114
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,916
FROM AN ITTY-BITTY
INJURY LIKE THIS!

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,250
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU
HIS SURVIVAL!

116
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,125
- THOSE ARE PRETTY UPPITY WORDS,
COMING FROM A TALKING CAT.

117
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,250
- I'LL BE HAPPY
IF YOU'RE RIGHT, THOUGH.

118
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,916
- WELL, YOU'RE ALREADY
HERE, SUCK-FACE.

119
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,166
YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME ALONG.

120
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,625
- YES, WE'RE FAMILY.

121
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,125
THANK YOU.

122
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,333
THE SURGERY'S OVER.

123
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,916
HE'S IN RECOVERY, ON
THE 5TH FLOOR! LET'S GO!

124
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,500
- I'M COMING, KOUHEI.

125
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,791
- BIG BROTHER!

126
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,333
- THE OPERATION WENT WELL.
BUT WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP.

127
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,458
- KOUHEI!

128
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,541
IT'S ALL AROUND HIM.

129
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,708
THE SHADOW OF DEATH.

130
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,083
- THE HOSPITAL STAFF
HAS DONE EVERYTHING

131
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,833
WE COULD'VE
EXPECTED FROM THEM.

132
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,583
BUT IT WON'T BE ENOUGH.

133
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,833
DOCTORS ALONE CAN'T
CURE THIS WOUND.

134
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,083
OUR PERFORMANCE TONIGHT
WILL BE CRITICAL.

135
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,458
ALL THAT YOU'VE
LEARNED WILL BE TESTED

136
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,958
UNDER THE HIGHEST OF STAKES.

137
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,791
- ARE YOU TWO PREPARED?
- YES.

138
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,458
- LET GO!

139
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,166
- LEAVE IT TO US, CHILD.
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

140
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,541
BUT THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO FOR HIM NOW.

141
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,750
- NO, I WANT TO BE
WITH HIM, TOO! HE'S MY SLAVE!

142
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,500
- NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO BE STUBBORN!

143
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,000
- BUT I SAW IT! THE SHADOW
OF DEATH! IT'S CLAIMING HIM!

144
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,250
IF WE DON'T HELP HIM SOON
IT'LL BE TOO LATE!

145
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,208
- ( slap )

146
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,583
- THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
HE'S HERE BECAUSE OF YOU.

147
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,166
AND NOW YOU HAVE THE
NERVE TO INTERFERE

148
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,083
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE HIM.

149
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,416
HOW DEEP DOES YOUR
BLOOD LUST GO?

150
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:43,458
- SEIJI! YOU'RE OUT OF LINE.
BLAME FALLS ON THE COUNT.

151
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,500
- SO YOU SAY.

152
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,291
- YOUR DISSENT HAS BEEN NOTED.

153
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,750
BUT NOW IS NOT THE
TIME TO BRING THIS UP!

154
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,541
- I WON'T SAY MORE BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

155
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,583
BUT WE HUMANS WILL HANDLE
IT FROM HERE.

156
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,375
YOU'D ONLY CAUSE MORE TROUBLE.

157
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,166
- I'M SORRY, CHILD.
PRAY FOR HIS HEALTH.

158
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,875
IT'S THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO.

159
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,916
- ( heart monitor beeping )

160
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,500
- HIS BODY IS STABLE FOR NOW,

161
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,333
BUT THESE ARE NOT
NORMAL INJURIES.

162
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,958
THE SPIRITS HAVE ALREADY
STAKED THEIR CLAIM ON HIM.

163
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,500
WE MUST SYNERGIZE OUR KI,

164
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,250
AND CAST AWAY THE SHADOW
OF DEATH. UNDERSTOOD?

165
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,833
- WE'RE READY.

166
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,541
- SEIJI, YOU MAY BEGIN.

167
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,166
- LOOMING APPARITION THAT
KNOWS NOT OF HEAVEN'S CALL.

168
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,458
HEAR MY COMMAND.

169
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,750
RETURN TO THE DARKNESS
FROM WHICH YOU CAME.

170
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,500
REPAY OUR PATIENCE.
RELEASE THIS SOUL.

171
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,583
BACK NOW TO THE
EDGE OF IMMORTALITY.

172
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,041
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
HE'S HERE BECAUSE OF YOU.

173
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,833
- BUT WE HUMANS
WILL HANDLE IT FROM HERE.

174
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,666
YOU'D ONLY CAUSE MORE TROUBLE.

175
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,500
- PRAY FOR HIS HEALTH.
IT'S THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO.

176
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,833
- THEY'RE RIGHT. HUMANS HELP.

177
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,666
VAMPIRES DESTROY.

178
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,708
- HEAR MY VOICE. HEED MY WORDS.

179
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,958
PASS THROUGH THE DARKNESS INTO
LIGHT. TO OUR WORLD YOU RETURN.

180
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,083
TRAVEL THE PATH
DOWN WHICH I LEAD.

181
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,500
MOVE TOWARD THE THRESHOLD.
RESTORE YOUR WILL.

182
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,291
FOLLOW THE PORTAL BACK TO LIFE.
LEAVE BEHIND...

183
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,250
- CONCENTRATE, GIRLS.
UNITE YOUR KI.

184
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,041
- THROUGH ME IS THE WAY.

185
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,083
- Luna: IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
YOUR FATE TO BE ALONE.

186
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,666
ANY HUMAN WHO GETS CLOSE TO YOU
WILL BE CURSED,

187
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,416
AND INEVITABLY DIE.
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU ARE.

188
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,125
YOU DRINK HUMAN BLOOD.
YOU DESTROY THEIR LIVES.

189
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,250
- HEAR MY VOICE. HEED MY WORDS.

190
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,125
PASS THROUGH THE DARKNESS
INTO LIGHT.

191
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,458
TO OUR WORLD YOU RETURN. TRAVEL
THE PATH DOWN WHICH I LEAD.

192
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,083
MOVE TOWARD THE THRESHOLD.
RESTORE YOUR WILL.

193
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,833
FOLLOW THE PORTAL BACK TO LIFE.

194
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,500
LEAVE BEHIND THE SHADOW
OF DEATH. THROUGH ME IS THE WAY.

195
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,750
RELEASE HIM, SPIRITS.
RETURN HIS SOUL.

196
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,750
RELEASE HIM, SPIRITS. RETURN
HIS SOUL. THROUGH ME IS THE WAY.

197
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,250
IT ISN'T WORKING.
DEATH IS ANCHORED DEEP.

198
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,416
- ( bell jingles )

199
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,500
- ( tires screech )

200
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,250
- HAZUKI! THERE YOU ARE!

201
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,625
- YOU'RE MY SLAVE, DUMMY!

202
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,250
- QUIT CALLING ME YOUR SLAVE!

203
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,458
- I CALL UPON THE ELEMENTS.
EARTH, FIRE, WIND, WATER.

204
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,583
BE HERE NOW. LEND US THE
STRENGTH OF YOUR WILLS.

205
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,958
HEAR MY VOICE. HEED MY WORDS.
PASS THROUGH THE DARKNESS

206
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:44,833
- INTO LIGHT.
- KAORU!

207
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,333
- TO OUR WORLD YOU RETURN...

208
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,041
- THESE RITES HAVE
GONE ON FOR HOURS.

209
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,291
THE BODY CAN'T HANDLE
ANY MORE.

210
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,041
KOUHEI, I'M NOT SURE
WE CAN SAVE YOU.

211
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,000
- ( Kouhei groans )
- BEHIND THE SHADOW OF DEATH...

212
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,250
- ( bell jingles )

213
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,250
- AN OMEN.

214
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,583
- HAZUKI, IT'S OKAY.

215
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,625
I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME NOW.

216
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,208
- MAMA?

217
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:24,083
- MAYBE IT IS TRUE. MAYBE WE
VAMPIRES ARE A CURSED RACE.

218
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,333
- MAMA, WHERE ARE YOU?

219
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,625
- BUT THERE IS MORE
TO US THAN DESTRUCTION

220
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,500
AND THE DRAINING OF LIFE.

221
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,708
THE POWER OF BLOOD
FLOWS TWO WAYS.

222
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,958
AND THERE IS SOME
GOOD YOU CAN DO.

223
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,333
- MAMA!

224
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,666
SOME GOOD I CAN DO?
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN?

225
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,333
- PASS THROUGH THE DARKNESS
INTO LIGHT.

226
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,750
TO OUR WORLD YOU RETURN. TRAVEL
THE PATH DOWN WHICH I LEAD.

227
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,625
MOVE TOWARD THE THRESHOLD.
RESTORE YOUR WILL.

228
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,583
FOLLOW THE PORTAL BACK TO
LIFE. LEAVE BEHIND...

229
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,000
- ( door opens )

230
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,125
- KOUHEI!

231
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,125
- HAZUKI, GO HOME.

232
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,041
- MOVE!

233
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,541
I'M SORRY.

234
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,750
- WHAT'S THIS?

235
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:44,250
- YOU'RE MY FIRST SLAVE, AND I
WON'T LET YOU LEAVE ME NOW.

236
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,000
NOT HERE. NOT LIKE THIS.

237
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,125
IF YOU DO,
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!

238
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,916
- ( heart monitor beeping )

239
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,708
- WHERE'RE YOU GOING, HAZUKI?

240
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,541
- LIKE YOU SAID, IT'S MY FAULT
HE GOT HURT. SO...

241
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,041
- EASY NOW.

242
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,125
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE STILL GOT
A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT PEOPLE.

243
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,375
- BUT I...

244
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,416
- KOUHEI WLL BE DISAPPOINTED

245
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,208
IF YOU ARE NOT HERE
WHEN HE WAKES UP.

246
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,750
- WHAT'S WRONG?

247
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,750
- KOUHEI!
- COME ON!

248
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,458
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING FOR?

249
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,291
- THAT GLOW, WHEN SHE BIT HIM...

250
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,541
- YES. I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT.

251
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,875
IT LOOKED LIKE PART OF
HER LIFE ENERGY.

252
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,208
- THAT'S THE CONCLUSION
I CAME TO AS WELL.

253
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,583
THAT MEANS SHE SHORTENED HER
OWN LIFE TO SAVE HIS.

254
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,250
- SEEMS I WAS WRONG ABOUT
THE LITTLE BEAST AFTER ALL.

255
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,958
- BACK ON YOUR FEET, KAORU.
FEELING BETTER NOW?

256
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,500
- AH, COME ON, YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING ME.

257
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,541
- I MISSED YOU, YOU BIG IDIOT!

258
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,375
- YEAH, I... WAIT A SECOND,
DID YOU BITE ME AGAIN?

259
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,916
- SEE? I TOLD YOU IT'D BE A-OK!

260
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,500
- ( she sighs )

261
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,291
- TOO BAD WE COULDN'T
STAY LONGER.

262
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,833
SCHOOL JUST CAN'T COMPETE WITH
ADVENTURES IN THE PARANORMAL.

263
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,750
MAYBE OUR TEACHER'LL
GET POSSESSED.

264
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,458
WELL, AT LEAST KOUHEI'S OKAY.

265
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,708
WOULDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A
FUTURE HUSBAND ON A SLAB.

266
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,708
- UH-HUH.

267
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,083
- YOU OKAY?

268
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,916
- I JUST HOPE HE ISN'T
STILL IN DANGER.

269
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,375
- ARE YOU REALLY OKAY LEAVING
THE HOSPITAL SO SOON?

270
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,958
- DOCTORS CLEARED IT.

271
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,208
SAID THEY'D NEVER SEEN ANYONE
RECOVER FROM SURGERY THIS FAST.

272
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,666
I FEEL BETTER THAN I
HAVE IN YEARS. OUCH!

273
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,000
- YOU'RE SO FULL OF IT! I TOLD
YOU, YOU SHOULD'VE STAYED!

274
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,416
- SORRY, BRAT.

275
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,833
I TRIED TO BE A HERO, BUT I'M
THE ONE WHO NEEDED SAVING.

276
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,958
- NO, KOUHEI. YOU SAVED ME
IN LOTS OF WAYS.

277
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,708
- OH, MAN. FEELS LIKE I HAVEN'T
BEEN HOME FOR MONTHS.

278
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,708
- WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE
NOW. AND THAT I'M HERE, TOO.

279
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,291
- HAVING TUBES DOWN YOUR
THROAT REALLY MAKES YOU THIRSTY.

280
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,958
BREW ME SOME TEA,
WILL YA, BRAT?

281
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:55,208
- BREW SOME... WHO DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE? MY MASTER?

282
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,666
- I'M THINKING I'M
MORE LIKE A GUY

283
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,166
WHO JUST CRAWLED OFF A GURNEY.

284
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,500
- COME ON, DON'T BE
ALL DIFFICULT.

285
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,291
- OH, I'M BEING DIFFICULT?

286
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,750
A SLAVE DOES NOT TELL
HIS MASTER TO BREW TEA!

287
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,416
- SHOW SOME COMPASSION!
- YOU SHOW SOME DECENCY!

288
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,583
- BRAT!
- JERK!

289
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,750
- ( Kinkel laughs )

290
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,708
- YES, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE LOOK.

291
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,125
HOW MANY YEARS,
DECADES HAS IT BEEN,

292
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,583
SINCE I'VE SEEN THAT
ON YOUR FACE?

293
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,333
YOU WERE MERELY A
HUMAN SLAVE BACK THEN.

294
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,250
I WOULD BE HARD ON YOU,
PUSH YOU, ABUSE YOU.

295
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,125
THEN LOOSEN THE REINS.

296
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:34,208
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'D LOOK AT
ME WITH THOSE IRRESISTIBLE EYES.

297
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,041
I COULD NEVER TELL IF YOU WERE
BEGGING FOR MERCY,

298
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,166
OR BEGGING FOR MORE.

299
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,000
AND WHEN YOU FINALLY SURRENDERED
YOUR HEART TO ME,

300
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,875
I HAD SUCH AN OVERWHELMING
SENSE OF COMPLETION.

301
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,541
- I HATE TO DISAPPOINT
YOU, COUNT,

302
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,791
BUT I'M NOT SO OBEDIENT ANYMORE.

303
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,833
- YES, THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.

304
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,958
THE BLOOD OF THAT BOY IS EVEN
STRONGER THAN I EXPECTED.

305
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,625
HE'S GIVEN YOU THE POWER TO
RESIST ME FOR THIS LONG.

306
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:02,750
AND GIVEN ME THE CHANCE TO BREAK
YOU, ALL OVER AGAIN.

307
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,958
I WILL HAVE TO THANK HIM
MIGHTILY WHEN HE ARRIVES

308
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,791
RATHER SOON
WITH MISTRESS LUNA.

309
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:10,875
- ( she gasps )

310
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,791
- SHE WILL FIND HER TRUE HOME.
AND HE WILL FIND HIS GRAVE.

311
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:23,958
PREPARATIONS FOR THE WELCOMING
PARTY HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE.

312
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:30,083
- ( theme song playing )

313
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

314
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,416
- WELL, HOW'D YOU LIKE
TODAY'S MOON PHASE?

315
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,833
OF COURSE I THOUGHT IT
WAS THE BEST,

316
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,666
BECAUSE BIG BROTHER
ENDED UP OKAY,

317
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,541
AND HE CAME BACK HOME
WHERE HE BELONGS.

318
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,458
EVEN IF HE CAN BE AN ANNOYING
NITWIT SOMETIMES.

319
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,166
BUT THERE'S A NEW PROBLEM.

320
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,875
KOUHEI DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
DOING ANYTHING NOW

321
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,125
AFTER HIS WHOLE ORDEAL!

322
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,875
AND WE'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
SOMETHING QUICK,

323
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,666
BECAUSE THERE'S REAL
TROUBLE ON THE WAY.

324
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,083
NOW THAT THE COUNT
KNOWS THE TRUTH,

325
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,958
HE WON'T STAY AWAY FOR LONG!

326
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,791
NEXT EPISODE: "BIG BROTHER,
GET SOME REST!"

327
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,916
BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU'RE
GONNA NEED IT. SEE YA THEN!
