1
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:18,000
- Hikaru: YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST
WASTING YOUR TIME, YOU FREAKS!

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,458
- IT'S PRETTY!

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,583
- HELLO! ARE YOU LISTENING?

4
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,625
- SO PRETTY.

5
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:28,041
- Vargas: YES. THEY HAVE GOOD
FIREWORKS IN JAPAN.

6
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,083
- DON'T YOU EVEN
REALIZE HOW STUPID IT IS

7
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,625
TO MESS WITH
THE MIDO CLAN?

8
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,083
YOU FANG-FACES BETTER LET
ME GO WHILE THERE'S TIME,

9
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,083
OR IT'S GONNA BE THE LAST
MISTAKE YOU EVER MAKE!

10
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,291
- ( snarling )

11
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,750
- YEAH. YOU HEARD ME!

12
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,208
- QUIET, HUMAN!

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,958
YOU'RE DISTURBING THE PRINCESS.

14
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,083
- NOW TELL ME, PRINCESS ARTE,

15
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,083
WHERE DID YOU GET
THOSE CAT EARS?

16
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,416
- JEDA GAVE THEM TO ME.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
- WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M A SENTIMENTALIST AT HEART.

18
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,500
- Vargas: THERE YOU ARE, JEDA.

19
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,083
- HOW ARE THOSE EYES
OF YOURS, MR. VARGAS?

20
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,500
- I'M FINE. ANY PROGRESS
WITH YOUR SURVEILLANCE?

21
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,708
- NO, NOT REALLY.
I JUST FELT LIKE TAKING A WALK.

22
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,000
- IS THAT YOUR IDEA OF A JOKE?

23
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,750
- Arte: CAN I KILL LUNA NOW?

24
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,208
I WANT TO.
LET ME KILL HER.

25
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,375
- Jeda: SOUNDS FUN
TO ME, PRINCESS.

26
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,375
BUT I'M AFRAID IT WOULD GIVE
OUR MASTER QUITE THE FROWN.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,708
- THEN GIVE ME THIS ONE.

28
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,083
I WANNA KILL HIM INSTEAD.

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,875
AND LUNA CAN WATCH.

30
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,916
- ( theme song playing )

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,416
( singing in Japanese )

32
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,375
- ( Hazuki sighing )

33
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:30,541
- OKEY-DOKE, MASTER!
FOOD'S HERE!

34
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,458
GRANDMA KOHARU MADE
THE BIG ONES!

35
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,208
AND THE LITTLE ONES WERE ALL ME!

36
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,125
THEY'RE ALL BITE-SIZED
AND EASY TO EAT!

37
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,875
I COULDN'T FIT THE PICKLED
PLUMBS IN THE MIDDLE

38
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,916
SO I USED CINNAMON CAKE INSTEAD!

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,958
THE CINNAMON MAKES ME SNEEZE
BUT THEY TASTE REALLY GREAT!

40
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,291
- THANKS, HAIJI. BUT NOT
NOW, I'M NOT HUNGRY.

41
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,083
- BUT THEY'RE YUMMY, MASTER!

42
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,208
- Kouhei: EAT THEM.

43
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,833
- KOUHEI.

44
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,250
- COME ON, YA
HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING

45
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,875
SINCE WE GOT BACK LAST NIGHT.

46
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,583
THAT'S JUST NOT HEALTHY.

47
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,916
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE FOOD.

48
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,750
- MMM. THIS ONE'S GOT FISH.

49
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,291
MAN THAT'S GOOD!

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,416
- ( stomach growling )

51
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,041
- SOUNDS LIKE YOUR
STOMACH'S MORE HONEST

52
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,250
THAN YOUR MOUTH, HAZ.

53
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,500
- DON'T BE STUPID!

54
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,625
- HERE.

55
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,625
HEY, HAIJI,
GRAB SOME TEA, WOULD YA?

56
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:20,958
- YOU BET, SLAVE-BOY!
OPERATION TEA RETRIEVAL!

57
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,166
- COME ON.
- UM.

58
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,625
HIKARU, I BET SHE'S
HUNGRY TOO.

59
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,166
- OH, HAZ.

60
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,416
- IT'S MY FAULT.
I'M A PLAGUE.

61
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,125
- ( wind blowing )

62
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,708
- THAT AGAIN?

63
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,750
SERIOUSLY, YOU NEED TO SHUT UP.

64
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,416
- WHA... EXCUSE ME?

65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,000
- THERE'S NO POINT IN
DWELLING ON REGRETS

66
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,458
AND HATING YOURSELF NOW.

67
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,166
YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
TO DO THAT LATER.

68
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,916
RIGHT NOW YOU NEED
TO EAT AND REST UP

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,500
SO YOU'LL BE READY TO
RESCUE HIKARU WHEN IT'S TIME.

70
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,291
OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA BE
TOO WEAK TO HELP

71
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,125
AND YOU'LL FEEL EVEN MORE
PATHETIC AND MISERABLE.

72
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,083
IT'S THE ONLY APPROACH
THAT MAKES SENSE.

73
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:12,958
RIGHT?

74
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,125
- HM.

75
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,708
- ( Kouhei clears throat )

76
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,583
OKAY, WHERE'S THE TEA?

77
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,000
- OOPSIE, IT SLIPPED.

78
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,375
- OH! HOT!

79
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,833
- I'M SO CLUMSY.

80
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,416
IT DROPPED RIGHT OUT OF
MY FINGERS. IMAGINE THAT!

81
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,375
HEY! HOLD ON!
YOU DID THAT ON...

82
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,250
( groaning )

83
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,500
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL,
SLAVE BOY! YOU'LL HURT YOURSELF!

84
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,541
- ( Hazuki giggling )
- ( Kouhei groaning )

85
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,458
- LOOK AT THAT!
MASTER'S LAUGHING!

86
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,166
- HOW'S A GIRL SUPPOSED
TO BROOD PROPERLY

87
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,916
WHEN YOU'RE SPILLING TEA
ALL OVER THE PLACE?

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,166
- SO IT'S MY FAULT?

89
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,791
- SURE! JUST LIKE IT
ALWAYS IS, SLAVE BOY!

90
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:53,958
- CAN IT!

91
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,583
- ( Hazuki giggling )

92
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,041
- I GUESS THE IMPORTANT THING
IS YOU'RE EATING AGAIN, RIGHT?

93
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,791
THOUGH IF YOU WANT TEA,
YOU'LL HAVE TO DRINK MY HAIR.

94
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,416
- Hazuki: NO. I'M GOOD.

95
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,416
- Yayoi: ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS?

96
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,416
- Ryuuhei: I REALIZE THE RISK,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,000
- KOUHEI HAS MATURED REMARKABLY

98
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,291
IN THE LAST EIGHT
MONTHS NO DOUBT.

99
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,916
BUT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING...

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,041
- EVEN WITH HIS PROGRESS,
THERE'S LITTLE CHANCE

101
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,250
HE'LL BE ABLE TO
COMPLETELY ACCEPT IT NOW.

102
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,625
I KNOW THAT.

103
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,625
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE OUT
OF TIME AND WE HAVE TO TRY.

104
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,208
- IF IT'S REALLY OUR
ONLY CHOICE, SO BE IT.

105
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,875
I JUST HOPE YOU CAN LIVE
WITH THE RESULTS.

106
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,875
- I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE BEING
SO SOFT, MASTER YAYOI.

107
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,500
HE'S NOT A CHILD ANYMORE.

108
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,708
AND THERE IS EVIL THREATENING
THE GIRL HE'S CHOSEN TO PROTECT.

109
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,458
HE CANNOT BE SHIELDED FOREVER.

110
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,958
WE'LL NEVER BE SAFE FROM THEM
IF WE'RE AFRAID TO TAKE A RISK.

111
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,291
YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE.

112
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,625
- THEN IT'S DECIDED.

113
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,708
- AND WHAT ABOUT KOJIRO?
HE'S NOT EVEN HERE.

114
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,500
I MUST SAY I'M HESITANT
TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS

115
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,750
WITHOUT HIS BLESSING.

116
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,125
AFTER ALL, HE IS THE HEAD
OF THE MIDO CLAN.

117
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,250
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

118
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,916
- VERY WELL.
I'LL TALK TO KOUHEI TODAY.

119
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,458
- HEY!

120
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER HERE?

121
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,875
- UH, NOTHING.

122
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,291
- WELL I'VE GOT A QUESTION
FOR YOU, MISTER!

123
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,000
- YOU DO?

124
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,041
- HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
GO AFTER THE VAMPIRES

125
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,541
INSTEAD OF COMING BACK
WITH THE OTHERS?

126
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,958
YOU COULD'VE PICKED
UP THEIR TRAIL IF YOU WANTED!

127
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,291
- I DON'T KNOW, HAIJI.

128
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,666
BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE NEEDED TO

129
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,416
COME UP WITH A
DECENT PLAN FIRST.

130
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,291
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HELP
US MUCH IF I GET CAPTURED TOO.

131
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,125
- SOUNDS LIKE AN AWFULLY
LOGICAL THOUGHT

132
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,541
FOR SOMEONE WHOSE FIANCEE
WAS JUST KIDNAPPED!

133
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,416
I THINK THE REAL REASON IS
'CAUSE YOU WERE TOO SCARED TO!

134
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,125
I DON'T BLAME YOU, THEY WERE
PRETTY SCARY GUYS.

135
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,083
I PROB'LY WOULD'VE
CHICKENED OUT TOO!

136
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,625
- ( agitated ) YOU'RE WRONG!

137
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,541
THAT'S NOT THE REASON.

138
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,875
- UH-OH. MAYBE I WENT
A LITTLE TOO FAR.

139
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,291
- HM.

140
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,416
- THANKS!

141
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,541
- WE'LL SEND YOU A COPY!

142
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,000
WELL THAT TOOK A LOT LESS
TIME THAN WE THOUGHT.

143
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,333
- I THINK WE GOT SOME
PRETTY GOOD SHOTS, TOO.

144
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,166
- IF THINGS KEEP GOING
THIS SMOOTHLY,

145
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,500
WE MIGHT HAVE SOME
FREE TIME ON OUR LAST DAY.

146
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,083
- HMM. SIGHTSEEING IN KYOTO?

147
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,333
YEAH, I THINK I CAN DEAL
WITH THAT.

148
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,791
- ( thinking ) MAYBE I SHOULD
CHECK IT OUT.

149
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,416
- Kouhei: I HAVE JAGAN?

150
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,375
- HM.

151
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,333
- WHAT IS JAGAN?

152
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,583
- IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
POWERFUL PSYCHIC GIFTS.

153
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,208
A KIND OF SUPERNATURAL EYE

154
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,166
THAT ALLOWS HIM TO
NOT ONLY SEE SPIRITS,

155
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,500
BUT DESTROY THEM.

156
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,208
- A POWERFUL PSYCHIC?

157
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,458
THIS KOUHEI?

158
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,041
NO WAY.

159
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,416
HE'S LIKE THE MOST PSYCHICALLY
DENSE PERSON ON THE PLANET.

160
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,958
- WE DID THAT.

161
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,083
WE REALIZED YOU POSSESSED JAGAN
SHORTLY AFTER YOU WERE BORN.

162
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,583
FROM THE START OF YOUR LIFE,
YOU COULD SEE OUR WORLD

163
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,916
AND THE SUPERNATURAL PLANE
IN THE EXACT SAME WAY.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,375
EVEN THE FIERCEST DEMONS

165
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,125
THAT ESCAPED OUR DETECTION
WERE CLEAR TO YOU.

166
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,625
AFTER DELIBERATION, OUR
FAMILY MADE THE DECISION

167
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,083
TO SEAL YOUR POWER
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

168
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,000
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE
BLOCKED THE PSYCHIC CHANNEL

169
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,125
THAT CONNECTED YOUR
JAGAN TO YOUR MIND

170
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,041
AND MADE YOU UNABLE
TO NOTICE THE SUPERNATURAL PLANE

171
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,041
THROUGH THE POWER OF KOTODAMA.

172
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,250
- WHAT'S KOTODAMA?

173
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,791
IT'S THE SPIRITUAL POWER
IN WORDS,

174
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,208
THE BELIEF THAT SPEAKING
A THOUGHT BREATHES LIFE INTO IT.

175
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,000
KOUHEI, DO YOU REMEMBER BEING
TOLD OVER AND OVER

176
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,583
THAT YOU HAD NO PSYCHIC POWER?

177
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,916
- BUT, WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT TO HIM?

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,291
- TRY TO PICTURE IT.

179
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,125
A CHILD IN CONSTANT CONTACT
WITH THE SUPERNATURAL,

180
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,250
SEEMING TO TALK TO EMPTY SPACES,

181
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,666
WARNING OF DEMONS NO
ONE ELSE COULD SEE.

182
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,166
PEOPLE WOULD FEAR AND MOCK HIM,
TURN HIM INTO AN OUTCAST.

183
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,583
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

184
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,833
PSYCHICS AND SPIRITS
ATTRACT EACH OTHER.

185
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,458
IF HE SAW THEM, THEY
COULD SEE HIM TOO.

186
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,666
WE WERE AFRAID HE'D BE
ATTACKED, OR POSSESSED.

187
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,916
WE WERE ONLY TRYING TO KEEP
YOU SAFE FROM HARM, KOUHEI.

188
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,250
- Ryuuhei: KOUHEI, DON'T LOOK!

189
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,333
TURN AROUND AND START WALKING!

190
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,500
- WHAT IS IT, GRANDFATHER?
I WANNA SEE IT TOO!

191
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,375
- IT'S NOTHING!
COME ON, WE'RE GOING HOME.

192
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,833
- LET GO!

193
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:39,958
- KOUHEI!

194
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,083
- COME BACK!

195
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,875
- THERE'S NOTHING!

196
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,333
WHAT'RE YOU GUYS MAKING
SUCH A BIG FUSS ABOUT?

197
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,125
- THAT'S RIGHT.

198
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,375
I NEVER COULD SEE ANYTHING.

199
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,875
AND THAT ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL
LIKE AN OUTCAST, TOO.

200
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,750
- KOUHEI.

201
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,791
- ALL THESE YEARS OF LIES.

202
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,458
HE NEVER KNEW
WHAT HE HAD.

203
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,166
- ( growling and snarling )

204
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,916
- THERE'S NOTHING!

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,041
WHAT'RE YOU GUYS
MAKING SUCH A BIG FUSS ABOUT?

206
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,583
- ( roaring )

207
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,750
- ( snarling )

208
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,166
- Seiji: "THERE'S NOTHING."

209
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,916
THAT'S ALL HE HAD TO SAY AND
THOSE DEMONS WERE DESTROYED.

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,625
THAT'S THE SHEER POWER
OF HIS JAGAN.

211
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,708
IN ALL MY YEARS OF STUDY,
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN CLOSE TO THAT.

212
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,000
IT'S A TALENT YOU HAVE
TO BE BORN WITH.

213
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,750
WHY?

214
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,041
WHY IS HE THE ONLY ONE?

215
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,416
- Kouhei: REMOVE THE SEAL.
I WANNA SAVE HIKARU.

216
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,166
BESIDES, I'D RATHER BE THE ONE

217
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,916
TO FIGHT WITH ARTE
INSTEAD OF HAZUKI.

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,458
I MEAN, IF THAT GIRL REALLY
IS HER HALF SISTER.

219
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,916
- KOUHEI.

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,666
- IF THAT'S YOUR CHOICE,
I'LL REMOVE IT.

221
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,541
BUT I WANT TO MAKE
SURE YOU UNDERSTAND

222
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,916
WHAT YOU'RE AGREEING TO.

223
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,875
JAGAN IS LIKE A VIOLENT TIGER,

224
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,791
AND CONTROLLING IT
TAKES GREAT MENTAL STRENGTH.

225
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,541
NO ONE FROM THE MIDO CLAN HAS

226
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,875
EVER BEEN ABLE TO
DO IT SUCCESSFULLY.

227
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,708
YOU WILL SUFFER.

228
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,041
ARE YOU WILLING TO
RISK YOUR HEALTH,

229
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,708
YOUR SANITY, EVEN YOUR LIFE?

230
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,208
- HIS LIFE?

231
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,708
- YES.
- ( gasping )

232
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,583
- THEN WE'LL PROCEED
WITH ONE MORE DEMAND.

233
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,541
ONCE I'VE REMOVED THE SEAL,
YOU'RE FORBIDDEN TO SEE HAZUKI

234
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,000
UNTIL YOU HAVE FULL
CONTROL OF YOUR JAGAN POWER.

235
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,041
- WHAT?

236
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,583
- YES, I UNDERSTAND.

237
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,458
- WAIT! BUT MASTER,
IF THIS IS GONNA HURT HIM

238
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,125
LET ME STAY AT HIS SIDE SO I
CAN HELP TAKE CARE OF HIM!

239
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,208
- YOU CAN'T.

240
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,333
- I WANNA KNOW WHY!

241
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,458
- HAZUKI, STOP!

242
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,625
THANK YOU. I ACCEPT.

243
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,833
- THIS WILL HURT.

244
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:32,958
- I'M READY.

245
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:35,916
- ( gasping )

246
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,958
- ( Kouhei screaming )

247
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,666
- ( Hazuki panting )

248
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,750
- I KNOW THIS IS HARD,
DEAR, BUT BE PATIENT.

249
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,125
- OH.

250
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,750
WONDER WHAT TIME IT IS.

251
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,666
MUST'VE PASSED OUT
FROM THE PAIN.

252
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,583
MAN, IT STILL HURTS.

253
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,666
- WANT SOME HELP?

254
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,166
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOIN'?
THAT YOU, HAZ?

255
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,333
OH, KAORU.

256
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,333
( sighs ) I'M SORRY.

257
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,708
- THAT'S OKAY. HERE.

258
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,833
- THANKS. THAT'S NICE.

259
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,458
- ( giggles )

260
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,208
- I CAN'T STAND THIS!

261
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,416
HOW COME KAORU GETS TO SEE HIM
AND I DON'T? IT MAKES NO SENSE!

262
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,875
- COULD IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR TEMPER?

263
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,083
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

264
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,708
- ( screaming )

265
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,625
- THAT'S IT!
I'M SEEING HIM!

266
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,083
- MASTER, YOU CAN'T!

267
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,250
- Yayoi: I'M COUNTING
ON YOU, KAORU.

268
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,333
- I KNOW.

269
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,875
- ( Kouhei screams )

270
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,041
WHAT'S GOING ON?

271
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,791
- SO YOU SEE THEM?

272
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,166
- HEY, KAORU, WHAT ARE THEY?

273
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,750
- DEMONIC SPIRITS.

274
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,958
- OH, IS THAT ALL?

275
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,750
OH, MAN! I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO SEE 'EM THIS CLEARLY BEFORE.

276
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,416
- ( spirits growling )
- ( Kouhei whimpering )

277
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,000
HEY. WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

278
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,625
- Yayoi: TRY TO MAKE
THEM VANISH.

279
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,250
- HUH?

280
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,291
- UP TO THIS POINT YOU'VE BEEN
USING YOUR POWER UNCONSCIOUSLY

281
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,041
TO MAKE DEMONS THAT THREATENED
YOU DISAPPEAR, KOUHEI.

282
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,958
NOW YOU MUST LEARN TO DO IT
CONSCIOUSLY, ON COMMAND.

283
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,625
- MAKE THEM VANISH?
DOING WHAT?

284
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,791
- USE YOUR MIND, KOUHEI.

285
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,291
- AND WILL THEM
OUT OF EXISTENCE.

286
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,416
- WILL THEM, HUH?

287
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,833
- ( snarling )

288
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,750
- ( screaming )

289
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,625
- THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE! I JUST
GOT MY POWERS TODAY!

290
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,291
- YOU FOOL.
DON'T RUN FROM THEM.

291
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,625
- BUT, MASTER!
CUT ME SOME SLACK!

292
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,583
- THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE! I JUST
GOT MY POWERS TODAY!

293
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,375
- YOU FOOL.
DON'T RUN FROM THEM.

294
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,458
- BUT, MASTER!
CUT ME SOME SLACK!

295
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:13,541
- THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE! I JUST
GOT MY POWERS TODAY!

296
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,708
- YOU FOOL.
DON'T RUN FROM THEM.

297
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,166
- AREN'T YOU LISTENING?
I SAID CUT ME SOME SLACK!

298
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,750
- KAORU, DON'T!

299
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,083
I'M NOT JUST GONNA STAND HERE

300
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,125
AND WATCH WHILE BROTHER
KOUHEI GETS HURT.

301
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,583
MAYBE WE ARE PUSHING
HIM TOO QUICKLY.

302
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,000
I'M THE ONE WHO SUMMONED THEM,

303
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,291
AND IF ANYONE'S GONNA GET
HURT I'D RATHER IT BE ME.

304
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,416
- NO!

305
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:34,916
- KAORU.

306
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,541
- ( cackling )

307
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,291
- LEAVE HER ALONE!

308
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,125
- ( growling )

309
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,375
- DAMN IT!

310
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,458
( shouts ) JUST...

311
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,541
GO...

312
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,875
AWAY!

313
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,458
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

314
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,541
- I'M FINE. AND I'M SORRY.

315
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,208
- YOU DID WHAT WAS NECESSARY.

316
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,166
JUST DON'T PUSH YOURSELF
TOO HARD, EITHER.

317
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,750
THIS ISN'T EASY WORK.

318
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,500
- I DON'T MIND. I LIKE
WORKING WITH KOUHEI.

319
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,375
- YOU DID WELL.

320
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,583
- I GUESS I AM A BIT TIRED.

321
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,750
- OKAY. NOW'S MY CHANCE!

322
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,958
( Hazuki giggling )

323
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,250
( screaming )

324
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,750
- WOW. LOOKS LIKE
A BARRIER SPELL.

325
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,625
- NO FAIR! MASTER YAYOI IS
A BIG, FRICKIN' MEANIE!

326
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,375
- ( yawning )

327
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,125
I'M GLAD THAT WORKED
AND ALL, BUT I'M BEAT.

328
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,166
I THINK I COULD
SLEEP FOR A WEEK.

329
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,875
- WHY CAN'T I SEE HIM?

330
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,333
- AH! WHAT A SPECTACULAR DAY!

331
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,125
- YEAH.

332
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,750
- KOUHEI'S DOING REALLY WELL.

333
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,833
HE'S BEEN IN THERE
FOR THREE DAYS!

334
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,833
HE'S LIKE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
THAN HE WAS AT THE OLD HOUSE.

335
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,500
- WE SURE HAD FUN THERE, HUH?

336
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,000
- YOU BETCHA!
LOTS OF LAUGHS!

337
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,333
- IT WAS ALL THANKS TO HIM.
- HM?

338
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:49,333
- KOUHEI FREED ME AND
BROUGHT ME TO YOU GUYS.

339
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,666
HE'S MADE MY LIFE
SO MUCH BETTER.

340
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,041
- HAZUKI, DEAR.

341
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,333
THERE WILL COME A TIME

342
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,250
WHEN YOU WILL FIND
SOMEONE WHO YOU TRULY LOVE.

343
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,458
WHEN THAT DAY ARRIVES,

344
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,416
YOU MUST NOT SEAL THE
BLOOD PACT WITH HIM.

345
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,375
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
NEVER WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE.

346
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:08,125
- BUT IT'S TOO LATE.
I ALREADY DID.

347
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,375
- Ryuuhei: IT MUST BE HARD
FOR HER, POOR CHILD.

348
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,375
BUT THE GREATEST PAINS
ARE YET TO COME.

349
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,250
- Vargas: WELL,
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

350
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,041
- ( gasping )

351
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,333
- ( both gasping )

352
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,916
- MY GOD! WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

353
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,416
- ( swishing )

354
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,625
- ( grunting )

355
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:42,750
( grunting )

356
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,291
I THINK I'M STARTIN' TO
GET THE HANG OF IT.

357
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,000
( gasping )

358
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,500
- EAT 'EM WHEN YOU GET TIRED.
HANG IN THERE, ALL RIGHT?

359
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,041
- HAZUKI?

360
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,166
- KOUHEI!

361
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,625
- I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

362
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,291
- HOW COULD YOU TELL?

363
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,333
- WELL, I DIDN'T FIGURE ANYBODY
ELSE'D BE VISITING ME RIGHT NOW.

364
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,250
YOU KEEP PRETTY LATE HOURS.

365
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,416
HOW'S LIFE?

366
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,041
- UM, OKAY, I GUESS.

367
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,500
HOW ABOUT YOU, DON'T YOU
GET BORED IN THERE?

368
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,625
- THEY KEEP ME BUSY.

369
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,041
- THAT'S GOOD. I WORRY.

370
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,500
- I'M GETTING A LOT BETTER AT
CONTROLLING MY POWER, THOUGH.

371
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,416
SHOULD BE OUTTA HERE
SOONER THAN I THOUGHT.

372
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,750
HAZUKI? YOU THERE?

373
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,625
- I'M SORRY.

374
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,958
- FOR WHAT?

375
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,666
- I'M USELESS. I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING TO HELP.

376
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,833
- AH, COME ON.

377
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,458
- BUT IT'S TRUE.

378
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,250
- IS NOT! DON'T YOU REALIZE?

379
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,583
YOU'RE HELPING ME A LOT
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IS.

380
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,708
YOU'RE WHAT KEEPS ME GOING
THROUGH ALL THE HARD STUFF.

381
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,625
( smirks ) AFTER ALL,
I GOTTA BE A GOOD SLAVE.

382
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,750
- KOUHEI...

383
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,208
I MISS YOU, THOUGH.

384
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,916
- YEAH. BUT RULES ARE RULES.

385
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,583
- SURE, I KNOW.

386
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,083
WELL HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, OKAY?

387
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,208
- YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

388
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,833
I AM DUE FOR A BATHROOM BREAK.

389
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,666
AND SINCE THERE'S
NOT ONE IN HERE,

390
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,416
I'LL HAVE TO MAKE MY WAY ACROSS
THE MAIN DECK IN A SECOND.

391
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,083
IF I HAPPEN TO RUN INTO
SOMEONE WHILE I'M OUT THERE,

392
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,750
I DON'T SEE HOW
THAT'S MY FAULT.

393
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,125
- OH, THAT'S TRUE! I SEE HOW
THAT COULD HAPPEN ACCIDENTALLY.

394
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,625
- WELL, IT'S BEEN GREAT TALKIN'
TO YA, I'VE GOTTA GO NOW.

395
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,083
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER, HAZUKI!

396
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,291
- HI, KOUHEI!

397
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,625
( gasping )

398
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,333
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU'RE TREMBLING, KOUHEI.

399
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,333
- GET BACK!

400
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,375
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? IT'S ME. HAZUKI.

401
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,291
- DON'T TOUCH ME!

402
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,000
- KOUHEI?

403
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,041
- PLEASE GET BACK!
YOU'RE A MONSTER!

404
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,000
- ( bell ringing )

405
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,166
- ( theme song playing )

406
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,666
( singing in Japanese )

407
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,375
- Arte: FORGET LUNA. YOU'LL DO
RIDDLES WITH ME NOW.

408
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:05,750
WHAT STARTS WITH T, ENDS
WITH T, AND IS FULL OF TEA?

409
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:08,458
FULL, FULL, FULL, MOON.

410
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,625
THE ANSWER'S A TEAPOT.

411
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,291
THERE. WASN'T THAT MORE FUN?

412
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,666
WELL YOU BETTER LIKE IT,

413
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,500
BECAUSE YOU'LL KEEP PLAYING
WITH ME UNTIL YOU'RE DEAD.

414
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,750
NEXT TIME,

415
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,333
"BIG BROTHER, AM I THAT SCARY?"

416
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,958
I'M GOING TO BED NOW.

417
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,125
SING THE NURSERY RHYME
UNTIL I FALL ASLEEP, OKAY?
