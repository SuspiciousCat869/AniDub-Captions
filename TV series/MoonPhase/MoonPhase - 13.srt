1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,541
- Kouhei: GRANDPA!

2
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:14,750
GRANDPA!

3
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,375
- ( coughing )

4
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,083
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP KOUHEI!

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,291
IT'S KINKEL!

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,791
HE'S... HE'S...

7
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,000
A DAY WALKER!

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,500
- ( theme song playing )

9
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,250
- ( gasping )

11
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,125
- ( groaning )

12
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,458
- KOUHEI!

13
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,416
- MISTRESS, DON'T!

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,916
- LET ME GO! I CAN'T JUST
WATCH HIM KILL KOUHEI.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,166
- GETTING YOURSELF KILLED
BY THE SUN WON'T HELP ANYTHING.

16
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,666
- ( Kouhei groaning )

17
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,375
- YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF
WHAT THE COUNT CAN DO.

18
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,541
TAKING ON OTHER FORMS.

19
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,208
THAT'S HIS GREATEST POWER.

20
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,708
HE CAN BEND THE LIGHT
SURROUNDING HIM

21
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,166
TO CREATE AN IMAGE.

22
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,708
ANY APPEARANCE HE CHOOSES.

23
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,041
OR JUST CURVE THE RAYS
AROUND HIMSELF.

24
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,541
DISAPPEAR ENTIRELY.

25
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,291
MAKE IT SO THE SUNLIGHT
NEVER TOUCHES HIS BODY AT ALL.

26
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,333
- ( gasping )

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,708
- THAT'S HOW HE'S SURVIVED
FOR 900 YEARS,

28
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,708
THROUGH PLAGUES,
HUNTS, CRUSADES.

29
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:02,083
HE'S MASTERED THE MOST VALUABLE
POWER ANY VAMPIRE CAN POSSESS.

30
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,458
HE'S A DAY WALKER.

31
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,791
- ( gasping )

32
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,916
SO THIS WAS ALL
JUST ANOTHER TRAP?

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,916
TO GET KOUHEI
OUT THERE ON HIS OWN?

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,250
- BY USING SOMEONE KOUHEI LOVES.

35
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,958
THAT'S HOW THE COUNT WORKS.

36
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,375
- BUT WHY?

37
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,416
WHY DOES HE PLAY THESE GAMES
TO MAKE PEOPLE HURT?

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,750
- ( thinking ) BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU LOVE.

39
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,500
THE PAIN YOU CAN CAUSE
IN THESE HUMANS YOU DESPISE.

40
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,708
BY TOYING WITH EMOTIONS
YOU'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD.

41
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,208
ISN'T THAT RIGHT? FATHER.

42
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,833
- TAIRAIFU!

43
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,708
WHERE'D HE GO?

44
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,250
( groaning )

45
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,916
- YOU CHILDREN ARE
BEGINNING TO BORE ME.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,791
TIME TO SAY GOODBYE,
VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

47
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,541
- KINKEL! YOU BASTARD.

48
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,708
- OH. SO YOU CAN STILL TALK.

49
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,041
YOU HURT... SEIJI.

50
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,708
- AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE UPSET?

51
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,208
( laughs )

52
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,875
YOU HUMANS. ALWAYS SO NOBLE
WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE.

53
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,916
- ( screaming )

54
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,791
- AND MAKE NO MISTAKE.

55
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,291
YOU WILL DIE.

56
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,875
NO AMOUNT OF NOBILITY
WILL SAVE YOU.

57
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,416
- WHY?

58
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,500
- WHY? BECAUSE, YOU SEE, BOY,

59
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:36,125
I CANNOT ALLOW AN ABOMINATION
LIKE YOU TO CONTINUE LIVING.

60
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,791
A WOULD-BE SLAVE WITH THE
POWER OF A VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

61
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,875
SUCH AN ABSURDITY
IS NOT TO BE BORN!

62
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:42,916
- ( screaming )

63
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:44,916
- Hazuki: LEAVE HIM ALONE!

64
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,416
LEAVE KOUHEI ALONE
AND I'LL GO WITH YOU.

65
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,041
- IS THAT SO?

66
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,416
- THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

67
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,916
FOR ME TO COME BACK
TO THE CASTLE.

68
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,333
WELL, I WILL, BUT ONLY
IF YOU LET HIM GO.

69
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,291
- ARE YOU TRYING TO
BARGAIN WITH ME?

70
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,958
- DO YOU WANT ME TO
COME BACK WITH YOU OR NOT?

71
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,000
IF YOU KILL HIM
I'LL NEVER GO WITH YOU. NEVER!

72
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,458
- I'M AFRAID THIS VIRUS
IS TOO MUCH OF A THREAT

73
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,958
TO LEAVE LYING AROUND.

74
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,083
HE WILL BRING CHAOS TO
THE ENTIRE VAMPIRE ORDER.

75
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,166
JUST LOOK WHAT HE DID TO THAT
TRAITOROUS WOMAN NEXT TO YOU.

76
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,791
- YOU FORGET, FATHER, WHO
I LEARNED MY TREACHERY FROM.

77
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,291
- Hazuki: I SEE.

78
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,666
WELL THEN, THAT MEANS
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

79
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,375
MISTRESS, BE CAREFUL!

80
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:35,208
- STAY BACK! I HAVE ONE THING TO
BARGAIN WITH THAT HE CAN'T RISK.

81
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,833
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, COUNT?

82
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,708
I HAVE MY LIFE.

83
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,208
WELL?

84
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,041
- Kinkel: ( thinking ) I BELIEVE
SHE'S SERIOUS.

85
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,250
WHAT IS THIS BOY TO HER?

86
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,791
VAMPIRE'S LOVER OR NOT, TO HER
HE SHOULD JUST BE A SLAVE.

87
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,125
WHAT WOULD DRIVE HER TO

88
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:57,583
SACRIFICE HER OWN LIFE
FOR A MORTAL? CURIOUS.

89
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,791
- WAIT. HE'S...

90
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:03,750
( gasping )

91
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,291
SUMMON!

92
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,666
- ELFRIEDE!

93
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,208
- FOOL.

94
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,125
- IF I'M A FOOL FOR WANTING
TO FREE MYSELF FROM YOU,

95
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,500
THEN I CHOOSE TO
REVEL IN MY FOOLISHNESS.

96
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,916
- ( laughs )

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,750
YOU REALLY THOUGHT
YOU COULD HURT ME?

98
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:42,916
- Ryuuhei: KOUHEI, RUN!

99
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,875
GOGYOU HAKKI!

100
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,500
- ( explosion booms )

101
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,125
- ( groaning )

102
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,250
GRANDPA?

103
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,958
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

104
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,583
- GRANDPA! OH MY GOSH!

105
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,208
THANK GOODNESS.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

106
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,416
- ( Kinkel laughing )

107
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:13,083
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE.

108
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,166
I THINK THAT DESERVES AN AWARD.

109
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,458
TELL YOU WHAT.

110
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,000
HAND OVER MISTRESS LUNA
AND THE VAMPIRE'S LOVER.

111
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,166
AND THE REST OF YOU
CAN ESCAPE WITH YOUR LIVES.

112
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,625
- ( sarcastically ) HOW KIND.

113
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,750
- CALL IT A GIFT OF GOODWILL.

114
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,125
I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU
TIME TO THINK IT OVER.

115
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,500
TWO HOURS.

116
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,541
( chuckling )

117
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,875
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

118
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,833
WHY NOT FINISH THIS
BEFORE WE HAVE TIME TO PLAN?

119
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,416
- Elfriede: BECAUSE IT'S
A GAME TO HIM.

120
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,833
HE'S TOYING WITH US.

121
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,000
ENJOYING THE POWER.

122
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,083
HE WANTS US TO SUFFER
BEFORE WE DIE.

123
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,875
- Seiji: I'M SORRY I...

124
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,208
I WASN'T MUCH USE OUT THERE.

125
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,083
- ( meows )

126
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,166
- DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

127
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,583
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYONE ON EARTH

128
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,750
WHO COULD'VE DEFEATED
HIM WITHOUT ANY HELP.

129
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:00,875
RIGHT, HAZUKI?

130
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:01,916
- HMM.

131
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,916
WHAT IS THIS?

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,291
- Seiji: IT'S A TALISMAN
THAT WARDS AGAINST IMPOSTERS.

133
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,541
I PUT UP A SPIRITUAL BARRIER

134
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,666
SO THE COUNT WON'T BE
ABLE TO SNEAK IN HERE.

135
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,458
EVEN IF HE TRIES TO
APPEAR IN DISGUISE

136
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,416
OR MAKE HIMSELF INVISIBLE,

137
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,791
IN HERE, HE'LL APPEAR
IN HIS TRUE FORM.

138
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,000
- SO, WE'RE SAFE FOR A WHILE,
AT LEAST. THAT'S GOOD.

139
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,750
- SURE. WE'RE SAFE FOR A WHILE.

140
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,166
BUT WE CAN'T STAY LOCKED UP
IN THIS ROOM FOREVER, RIGHT?

141
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,708
- RIGHT, BUT HOW DO WE LEAVE

142
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,291
WHEN WE KNOW HE'S
WAITING RIGHT OUTSIDE?

143
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,375
WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING
WHEN OR IF HE SLEEPS,

144
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,833
NOW THAT WE KNOW
HE'S A DAY WALKER.

145
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,666
- SO WE DO STAY HERE FOREVER.

146
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,916
- WELL, YOU CAN IF YOU WANT.

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,541
BUT I'VE BEEN AWAY
FROM THE ANTIQUE STORE

148
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,916
JUST ABOUT LONG ENOUGH.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,708
I'M STARTING TO MISS
THE SMELL OF THE PLACE,

150
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,916
SO I THINK I'LL BE HEADING
HOME NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,541
WELL, HOW 'BOUT IT, KIDS? READY?

152
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,833
- SO YOU THINK WE SHOULD FIGHT.

153
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,166
- IT'S NOT A MATTER OF "IF."

154
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,583
THE ONLY REAL QUESTION IS "HOW."

155
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,333
- THERE'S JUST ONE WAY.

156
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,708
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DEFEAT HIM

157
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,458
YOU'LL HAVE TO HURT HIM
WHILE HE'S IN THE SUNLIGHT.

158
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,625
WITH PAIN DISTRACTING HIM,

159
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,375
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO
DIVERT ALL THE RAYS.

160
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,916
THEN IF YOU'RE LUCKY,

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,833
AND IF THE WOUND YOU GIVE HIM
IS DEEP AND PAINFUL ENOUGH,

162
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,750
THE SUN WILL DO
THE REST OF THE WORK.

163
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,541
IF HE CAN'T FIND
SHELTER QUICKLY,

164
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,375
HE'LL BURN TO DEATH
WITHIN MINUTES.

165
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:19,416
- BUT HOW? HOW DO WE HURT
HIM? I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T YET.

166
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,333
- WELL, NOW,
I MAY KNOW A FEW TRICKS.

167
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,375
- ( clock ticking )

168
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,000
- ( clock chiming )

169
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,083
- MIGHT WORK.

170
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,625
- IT'S GOOD. I'D SAY IT'S THE
ONLY WAY WE STAND A CHANCE.

171
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,375
- KOUHEI?

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,958
I DON'T WANT A NEW SLAVE,
SO BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

173
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,500
PROMISE ME YOU WILL.

174
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,583
- YEAH.

175
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,458
- I DON'T WANT A NEW SLAVE,
SO BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

176
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,625
PROMISE ME YOU WILL.

177
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,375
- ( laughs ) I SEE,
MISTRESS LUNA.

178
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,708
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
SO DETERMINED TO SAVE HIM.

179
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,458
YOU'VE FALLEN VICTIM
TO THEIR WEAKNESS.

180
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,500
I'M GLAD I GAVE THEM THIS TIME.

181
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,666
( laughs )

182
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,791
THIS IS GOING TO BE EVEN
MORE FUN THAN I ANTICIPATED.

183
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,500
- Ryuuhei: I WOULD SAY
WE CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY.

184
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,125
BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.

185
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,166
- Seiji: GREAT.

186
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,000
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIGHT
WITH WRITER'S CRAMP?

187
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,500
- NEXT TIME DON'T LET YOURSELF
GET OUT OF PRACTICE.

188
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,375
- Hazuki: IT'S ABOUT TEN MINUTES
FROM HERE TO THE LAKE.

189
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,833
IT MIGHT ONLY TAKE FIVE
IF YOU RUN.

190
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,416
- THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH
WATER THERE, THAT'S FOR SURE.

191
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,541
THIS JUST MIGHT WORK.

192
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,375
IT HAS TO WORK.

193
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,708
OKAY, HERE GOES NOTHIN'!

194
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,750
( gasps )

195
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,250
I'LL BE FINE. BACK BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT, KID.

196
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,458
- DON'T WORRY, MISTRESS.

197
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,625
KOUHEI WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

198
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,666
BOTH OF US ARE
WATCHING OVER HIM NOW.

199
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,000
- THANK YOU, ELFRIEDE.

200
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,291
- ( shouting ) HEY! KINKEL!
YOU PAYIN' ATTENTION?

201
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,833
'CAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL!

202
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,166
YOU CAN KILL ME IF YOU WANT,
BUT YOU LEAVE HAZUKI OUT OF IT.

203
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,041
SHE'S JUST A KID, AND SHE'S
NEVER DONE ANYTHING TO ANYONE.

204
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,375
ARE YOU HEARIN' ME?

205
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,916
YOU STAY AWAY FROM HER!
JUST LET HER WALK!

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,375
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S
A THREAT TO YOUR KIND.

207
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,750
SO, WE HAVE A DEAL OR NOT?

208
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,083
( thinking ) DAMN IT.

209
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,666
MAYBE HE'S ON TO US.

210
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,083
COME ON.

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,333
- TELL ME. DID YOU
HONESTLY THINK

212
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,875
THAT I WOULD ACCEPT THIS DEAL?

213
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,208
FAREWELL.

214
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,500
- Ryuuhei: GOGYOU SOSHOU!

215
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,625
DOSHOUGON!

216
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,666
- THAT LIGHT. WHAT IS IT?

217
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,208
- ( thinking ) LET'S SEE HOW YOU
HANDLE THIS ONE, COUNT.

218
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,291
GOLD SHARDS,
PULLED FROM THE EARTH.

219
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,958
ENOUGH TO REFRACT
THE LIGHT AROUND YOU

220
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,583
AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT
TO MAINTAIN YOUR FACADE.

221
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,291
NOW, SHOW US YOUR TRUE SELF!

222
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,041
- ( Kinkel laughing )

223
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,375
- IT WAS JUST AN ILLUSION.

224
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,458
- THE REAL ONE MUST BE NEARBY.

225
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,625
GOGYOU SOSHOU. DOSHOUGON!

226
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,541
( gasping )

227
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,208
- ELFRIEDE, NOW!

228
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,333
- SUMMON!

229
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,875
- Kinkel: ELFRIEDE.

230
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,125
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN KILL
ME WITH A SIMPLE INCARNATION?

231
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,625
- ( thinking ) ALL I NEED TO DO
IS KEEP HIM STILL FOR A WHILE.

232
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,666
- Seiji: THERE!

233
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,916
GOGYOU SOSHOU.

234
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,708
SUISHOMOKU!

235
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,375
- ( laughs )

236
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,958
HOLD ME HERE
AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

237
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,916
WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO
YOU WHEN YOU HAVE NO WEAPON?

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,708
- OH, BUT WE DO, KINKEL.

239
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,791
- WHAT?

240
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,333
- SURELY YOU KNOW
THE ELEMENTS ARE CLOSELY TIED.

241
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,708
WE ALREADY MADE GOLD.
FROM EARTH!

242
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,458
NOW LET'S SEE IF WE CAN MAKE
WOOD FROM WATER!

243
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,416
- NO!

244
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,791
- FINISH HIM.
AND I'LL BE FREE.

245
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,250
- COME ON.

246
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,916
- ( both coughing )

247
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,791
- KOUHEI? GRANDPA!

248
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,916
- ( Ryuuhei coughing )

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,208
HERE!

250
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,916
- Kouhei: WE DID IT, HAZUKI!
KINKEL IS DEAD!

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,041
- THEN IT'S OVER?

252
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,833
- COME ON. I WANNA
WATCH YOU BURN, YOU BASTARD.

253
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,541
THERE'S NO ESCAPING
DEATH THIS TIME.

254
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,500
THE SUN CAN SEE YOU
FOR WHAT YOU ARE.

255
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,958
- ( Ryuuhei screaming )

256
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,625
- GRANDPA, NO!

257
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,166
- KOUHEI! WHAT HAPPENED?
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

258
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,416
- GOGYOU SOSHOU! DOSHOUGON!

259
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,291
- A FAKE!

260
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,291
- ( groaning )

261
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,000
- ELFRIEDE, NO!

262
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,875
- KOUHEI!

263
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,708
ARE YOU HURT?

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,041
- LOOK OUT!

265
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,458
- SEIJI!

266
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,958
- PLEASE, NO.

267
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,375
- Kinkel: THIS ISN'T OVER.

268
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,125
- I GUESS HE GOT HURT, TOO.

269
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,250
- NO, HE'S GETTING AWAY.

270
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,041
- HE WAS TRYING TO
GET OUT OF THE SUNLIGHT.

271
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,166
HE'S STILL ALIVE,
AND I'M GOING AFTER HIM.

272
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,041
- WAIT! NO!

273
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,708
- NO, DON'T GO. IT'S A TRAP!

274
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:54,916
- Kouhei: HAZUKI!

275
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,666
- ( gasping )

276
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,500
- HAZUKI, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
COMING UP HERE ON YOUR OWN?

277
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,500
- I WANT YOU TO
GET OUT OF HERE, KOUHEI.

278
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,875
- AH, GOOD, YOU'VE BOTH ARRIVED.

279
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,000
- Kouhei: SHOW YOURSELF!

280
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,666
- PUT HIM DOWN!

281
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,750
- ( Kinkel laughs )

282
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,750
WELCOME TO THE CLOSING ACT,
MY FRIENDS.

283
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,375
- KINKEL!

284
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,625
- BUT THERE'S SO MUCH BLOOD.
HOW CAN YOU BE...

285
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,875
- ( laughs )

286
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,333
DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING
YOU SEE, DEAR.

287
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,333
THE BLOOD'S REAL,
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT MINE.

288
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,916
I KNEW YOU'D FOLLOW ME
IF YOU BELIEVED I WAS HURT,

289
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,166
DREAMING YOU COULD
FINISH ME OFF.

290
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,958
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THIS FINAL
SCENE HAD A SMALLER AUDIENCE.

291
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,625
SO YOU COULD GIVE
YOUR PAIN TO ME AND ME ALONE.

292
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,916
- MY PAIN?

293
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,083
- YES. LET ME
DEMONSTRATE, SHALL I?

294
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,125
- ( gasping )

295
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,625
- I'M TOLD THE MOST PAINFUL
EXPERIENCE ON EARTH

296
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,833
IS LOSING THE ONE YOU LOVE.

297
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,208
- LEAVE HIM ALONE!

298
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,666
LET GO!

299
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,458
- IT'S TOO LATE.

300
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,125
YOU ALREADY SEALED
HIS FATE A LONG TIME AGO.

301
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,625
FROM THE TIME YOU
ACCEPTED THE HELP

302
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,250
OF THIS HUMAN
AND HIS FRIENDS,

303
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,625
YOU WERE HEADED TOWARD
THIS VERY MOMENT.

304
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,750
YOU CHOSE HIS DEATH
WHEN YOU CHOSE HIM.

305
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,791
- NO.

306
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,416
- ( sinister laugh )

307
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,583
- NO, PLEASE!
- AH, AH, AH.

308
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,125
WATCH YOUR STEP, MISTRESS.

309
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,250
NOW PAY ATTENTION
TO THE GRAND FINALE.

310
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,416
I'D HATE FOR YOU
TO MISS THIS PART,

311
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,791
WHEN YOU WORKED
SO HARD TO CAUSE IT.

312
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,416
- HAZU... KI!

313
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,458
( screaming )

314
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,416
- KOUHEI.

315
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,000
- THERE IS SUCH BEAUTY IN PAIN.

316
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,833
IN THE ANGUISH OF DEATH
AND THE IMPOTENCE OF GUILT.

317
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,958
WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO SEES IT?

318
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,291
( chuckling )

319
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,833
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

320
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,791
IT IS MY FAULT HE'S DYING.

321
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,208
I CAUSED IT ALL.

322
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,791
NO.

323
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,875
KOUHEI WON'T DIE
BECAUSE OF ME.

324
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,875
AND HE WON'T DIE

( yells )

328
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,791
YOU STUPID CHILD.

329
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,375
- Elfriede: YOU TALKED
ABOUT THE LOOK IN MY EYES

330
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,541
WHEN YOU'D HURT ME.

331
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,666
NEVER KNOWING IF I WAS
BEGGING FOR MERCY OR FOR MORE.

332
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,375
BUT THIS IS WHAT
I WAS BEGGING FOR.

333
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,125
TO SEE THAT FEAR IN YOU.

334
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,583
- ELFRIEDE!

335
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,333

336
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,958
YOU TRAITOR!

337
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,333
( screaming )

338
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,250
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

339
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,250
I'VE CHOSEN TO
REVEL IN MY FOOLISHNESS, FATHER.

340
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,166
- ( screaming )

341
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,708
YOU'RE NOTHING!

342
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,625
AND I AM A BLUE BLOOD!

343
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,041
DAMN YOU!

344
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:02,791
I'VE LIVED FOR 900 YEARS.

345
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,041
YOU'LL NEVER KILL ME!

346
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,583
NEVER! NEVER.

347
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,000
NEVER...

348
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,708
- OH, MAN!

349
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,875
- AN AGE OF TORMENT HAS ENDED.

350
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,416
AFTER 900 YEARS, COUNT HEINRICH
VON KINKEL IS FINALLY DEAD.

351
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,125
YOU TWO OKAY?

352
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,791
- YEAH.

353
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,083
- WE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS,

354
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,958
CHECK IN WITH THE OTHERS,
TELL THEM IT'S OVER.

355
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,375
- KOUHEI?

356
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,291
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T DIE.

357
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,541
BUT YOU THINK NEXT
TIME YOU COULD DO IT

358
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,750
WITHOUT WORRYING
ME SO MUCH?

359
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:50,875
- RIGHT.

360
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,708
- ( thinking ) LET THEM REST.
THEY DESERVE IT.

361
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:02,791
- ( wind whooshing )

362
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,083
- GOODBYE...

363
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,791
FATHER.

366
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,666
- Kinkel: ALL RIGHT, MISTRESS.

367
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,333
A PARTING RIDDLE FOR YOU.

368
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:05,666
GIVE ME AIR AND I LIVE, GIVE
ME WATER AND I DIE. WHAT AM I?

369
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,333
I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE
NO PROBLEM WITH THIS ONE.

370
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:11,666
FULL, FULL, FULL MOON.

371
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,208
NEXT TIME ON MOON PHASE.

00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,708
EPISODE 14.

373
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,458
"BIG BROTHER,
WILL YOU WALK WITH ME?"

374
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,833
HAVE YOU GUESSED THE ANSWER YET?

375
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,291
FIRE.

376
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,000
GOODBYE, MISTRESS...

377
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,541
FOR NOW.
