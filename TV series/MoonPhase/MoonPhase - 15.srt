1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,541
- Kouhei: HEY...
- ( gasps )

2
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,208
- WE NEED TO TALK, OKAY?

3
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,916
I WANNA PATCH THINGS UP.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,416
WOULD YA STOP IGNORING ME?

5
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,291
YA HAVEN'T TALKED TO ME
SINCE OUR LITTLE BLOW-OUT,

6
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,208
SO CLEARLY SOMETHING'S WRONG.

7
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,750
COME ON! TALK TO ME!

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,541
I CAN'T READ
YOUR FREAKIN' MIND, HAZUKI!

9
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,583
WHATEVER YOU'RE
MAD ABOUT, TELL ME.

10
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,791
HEY!

11
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,000
- ( Japanese song playing )

12
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,875
- HE'S A JERK,
YOU'RE A BRAT, WE GET IT.

13
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,250
WOULD YOU PLEASE
KEEP IT DOWN? OOH.

14
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,625
( chuckling )

15
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,208
- YOU ARE SUCH A KLUTZ!

16
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,708
- OKAY, LOOK. THAT WAS
JUST CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT.

17
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,000
( laughing )

18
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,500
- ( theme song playing )

19
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:34,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

21
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,875
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GOING ON BETWEEN THOSE TWO?

22
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,208
- I DON'T KNOW. BUT
SOMETHING, THAT'S FOR SURE.

23
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,250
- Ryuuhei: THEY'VE BEEN
LIKE THIS FOR AT LEAST A WEEK.

24
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,875
- Elfriede: I KNOW.
IT TRULY IS A MYSTERY.

25
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,666
IF I WERE TO VENTURE A GUESS...

26
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,083
- Ryuuhei: MM-HMM?

27
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,916
- I'D SAY THE PROBLEM
IS MOST LIKELY THE RESULT OF...

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,625
WELL, A LOVERS' QUARREL.

29
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,416
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

30
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,708
- RYUUHEI, PLEASE!

31
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,375
DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME!
IT WAS ONLY A THEORY!

32
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,583
- FORGIVE ME, DEAR.

33
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,916
BUT THE THOUGHT
OF THOSE TWO...

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,125
- Both: HOW COULD YA THINK
I WOULD DO THAT?

35
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,958
- Elfriede: OH! YOU MEAN
YOU WOULDN'T, KOUHEI?

36
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,416
- SHE'S A FREAKING KID!

37
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
- AND IT WAS JUST GETTING JUICY.

38
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,958
WELL, LET'S SEE THEN.

39
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,291
IF IT ISN'T LOVE, THEN WHAT
ELSE COULD IT POSSIBLY BE?

40
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,750
- WELL, WHEN YOU TWO FIGURE
IT OUT YOU LET ME KNOW, OKAY?

41
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,333
AH!

42
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,875
- SO, IS THERE SOMETHING
THAT'S BOTHERING YOU, MASTER?

43
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,666
'CAUSE YOU SEEM
KINDA DOWN IN THE DUMPS.

44
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,166
- YEAH, BUT IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

45
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,916
- ( knock on the door )

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,083
- IT'S ELFRIEDE.
MAY I COME IN?

47
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,333
- IT'S UNLOCKED.

48
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,958
DOES GRANDPA NEED ME
FOR SOMETHING?

49
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,875
- NO, I JUST WANTED TO COME DOWN
HERE AND SEE HOW YOU WERE DOING.

50
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,333
YOU JUST SEEM SO...
SO TROUBLED.

51
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,750
- I THINK YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, ELFRIEDE.

52
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,083
I WAS JUST
SAYING THE SAME.

53
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,166
- WHY DON'T YOU BOTH
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

54
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,583
- I THINK KOUHEI'S
DONE SOMETHING

55
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,416
TO UPSET YOU, MISTRESS.

56
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,000
( chuckles )

57
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,583
IT WASN'T HARD TO SEE...

58
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,125
FRIENDS WHO ARE AS
CLOSE AS YOU TWO

59
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,083
DON'T JUST STOP
TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER.

60
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,791
UNLESS SOMETHING HAS GONE AWRY.

61
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,166
- WELL, HE SAID...

62
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,583
HE SAID THAT HE WASN'T
MY SLAVE.

63
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,916
HE SAID HE'S ONLY WITH ME

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,500
BECAUSE HE THINKS HE
OWES ME SOMETHING.

65
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,875
- SO THAT'S IT.

66
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,291
MISTRESS?

67
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,250
I'M SURE YOU'RE ALREADY
WELL AWARE OF IT,

68
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,916
BUT THERE IS A
FULL MOON TONIGHT.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,666
AND IT'LL ONLY BE
A FEW MORE HOURS

70
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,333
BEFORE WE FEEL ITS
STRONG AFFECT.

71
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:34,041
AS VAMPIRES WE CAN SENSE WHEN
THE HUNT IS UPON US.

72
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,916
THE THIRST WASHES OVER US AND

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,333
WE CAN FEEL IT PULSING LIKE
FIRE THROUGH OUR VEINS.

74
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,833
AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO

75
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,625
THAT THIS THIRST
MUST BE QUENCHED.

76
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,958
- WELL, NOW THAT YOU
MENTION IT...

77
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,416
- THERE'S ALWAYS KOUHEI.

78
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,291
BUT WHO KNOWS
IF HE'LL BE AROUND?

79
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,958
I MEAN, HE ISN'T THE MOST
OBEDIENT SLAVE, DEAR.

80
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,666
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

81
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,500
I CAN'T REALLY DEPEND ON HIM.

82
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,166
- THERE, YOU SEE? YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

83
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,541
- I GUESS HE WENT SOMEWHERE.

84
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,833
- Elfriede: YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

85
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,166
EVENTUALLY KOUHEI'S CHARITY
WILL RUN DRY.

86
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,916
YOU SHOULD FIND
SOMEONE ELSE NOW.

87
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,625
- Ryuuhei: WOULD YOU
HOLD STILL?

88
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,875
- Kouhei: HEY, I'M TRYING!

89
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,666
COME ON, GRAMPS!

90
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,833
WHY CAN'T YA CLEAN DURING
THE DAY LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?

91
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,166
- IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING,
"DO IT WHEN YOU THINK OF IT

92
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,166
AND YOU'LL ALWAYS GET
THINGS DONE."

93
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,250
- SO TELL ME SOMETHING.
- WHAT?

94
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,375
- Ryuuhei: YOU AND THE CHILD...

95
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,083
- YEAH?

96
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,583
- DO YOU THINK THE REASON SHE'S
BEEN SO DETERMINED TO AVOID YOU

97
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,458
IS SOMEHOW BECAUSE OF YOU?

98
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,666
HAVE YOU DONE SOMETHING
TO UPSET HER?

99
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,416
- UH, WELL I...

100
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,541
I DON'T THINK THAT
I'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

101
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,666
- YES, PERHAPS,
BUT MAYBE DEEP DOWN

102
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,166
YOU BOTH HAVE FEELINGS
FOR EACH OTHER

103
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,416
BUT WON'T ADMIT IT.
IS THAT IT?

104
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,125
- ( Ryuuhei screams )
- Kouhei: DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

105
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,333
- HAZUKI NEEDS ME AND

106
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,875
I'M A RESPONSIBLE
PERSON AND THAT'S IT!

107
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,666
I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIAL
FEELINGS FOR HER, OKAY?

108
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,833
- WELL, IF YOU SAY SO.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,583
- COULD WE PLEASE DROP IT?

110
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,500
- ( phone ringing )

111
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,500
HEY, GRANDPA,
THE PHONE'S RINGING.

112
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,625
- THEN ANSWER IT!

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,541
- HELLO?
OH HEY, HIROMI, WHAT'S UP?

114
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,875
A JOB?

115
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,791
REALLY?

116
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,750
WELL SURE, BUT NOW?

117
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,208
- THAT'S THE NATURE
OF THE BUSINESS.

118
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,875
IT'S JUST A PRODUCT PIECE
SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO

119
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,333
DEAL WITH ANY OF THOSE MODELS
THAT INTIMIDATE YOU.

120
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO COME
RIGHT AWAY, OKAY?

121
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,125
BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY TIME
THE CLIENT CAN MEET WITH US,

122
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,416
AND I ASSURED 'EM
YOU'D BE AVAILABLE.

123
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,625
YOU KNOW, SINCE
YOU'RE A BIG LOSER

124
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,416
AND HAVE NO SOCIAL LIFE AND ALL.

125
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,708
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D
DO WITHOUT FRIENDS LIKE YOU.

126
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,833
- Haiji: MASTER?

127
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,333
- ( gasps )

128
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,083
HOW COME YOU'RE IN HERE
ALL BY YOURSELF?

129
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,250
- HAIJI! SHH!

130
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,500
- WHY? IS SOMEBODY ASLEEP?

131
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,875
- JUST HUSH! I'LL EXPLAIN
IT ALL TO YOU LATER.

132
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,583
- OOH. YOU'RE PLAYING THAT
QUIET GAME, AREN'T YOU?

133
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,458
- MM-HMM.

134
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,166
- ( whispers ) HEY KOUHEI,
KEEP IT DOWN.

135
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,250
MASTER SAID WE HAVE TO BE QUIET.

136
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,791
- UH, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
HANGING OUT IN HERE, HAZUKI?

137
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,833
- NOT... NOT LONG...

138
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,500
SO DO YOU HAVE
TO GO TO WORK NOW?

139
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,666
- YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO TAKE THAT LONG.

140
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,750
AND THE EXTRA MONEY'LL
BE NICE.

141
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,041
I COULD EVEN TAKE YOU OUT
TO EAT AFTER I'M DONE.

142
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,666
THAT WAY YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TO COOK.

143
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,416
I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIAL
FEELINGS FOR HER, OKAY?

144
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:44,958
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

145
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,375
- NO, THANK YOU!

146
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,333
- WHAT NOW?

147
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,208
I CAN'T WIN WITH THAT GIRL.

148
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,083
- Elfriede: GOOD
EVENING, KOUHEI.

149
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,083
- ELFRIEDE.

150
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT TONIGHT?

151
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,375
- WHO, ME?

152
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,666
OH, I'M JUST
ADMIRING THE FULL MOON.

153
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,416
A PERFECTLY GLORIOUS NIGHT
FOR A MAN HUNT.

154
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,833
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

155
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,625
WELL, UNLESS OF COURSE...

156
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:27,333
YOU WOULD BE GENEROUS ENOUGH
TO SPARE ME THE TROUBLE.

157
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,666
- GEE, I'D REALLY LOVE TO BUT
I NEED TO GET TO WORK.

158
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,333
SO, UH, YEAH.

159
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,875
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! DO
YOU KNOW WHERE HAZUKI IS?

160
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,125
- WHY?
- JUST TELL ME, ELFRIEDE.

161
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,791
- SHE IS A VAMPIRE AFTER ALL.

162
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,125
I'M SURE SHE'S OUT
ON THE HUNT AS WELL.

163
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I THOUGHT
THAT WAS WHAT I WAS HERE FOR!

164
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,791
- OH, PLEASE, KOUHEI.

165
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,208
YOU TOLD HER YOURSELF THAT YOU
WEREN'T HER SLAVE.

166
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,416
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE NEEDS TO BE
FAITHFUL TO YOU, RIGHT?

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,083
FOR US VAMPIRES, PROCURING
WAYS TO QUENCH OUR THIRST

168
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,875
IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR
VERY SURVIVAL.

169
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,541
AND YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR
THAT YOU'RE NOT DEPENDABLE.

170
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,000
SO PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LEAVE
THE MISTRESS ALONE!

171
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:06,958
UH...

172
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,416
- I CAN'T.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,916
I... I TRY...

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,250
BUT I... I JUST CAN'T!

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
- MY GOODNESS... I NEVER KNEW
HE WAS SO DRAMATIC.

176
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,708
WELL, I'D BEST BE OFF.

177
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,916
THE MOONLIGHT
DOESN'T LAST FOREVER.

178
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,541
- GRANDPA, TALK TO ME!
IS HAZUKI AT HOME?

179
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,000
- Ryuuhei: SHE WENT TO
THE CONVENIENCE STORE

180
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,333
RIGHT AFTER YOU LEFT.

181
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,375
BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO GET
SO WORKED UP ABOUT IT.

182
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,625
SHE TOLD ME SHE'D BE BACK

183
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,333
AS SOON AS SHE GOT
SOMETHING TO EAT.

184
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,250
- YEAH, THANKS.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF!

185
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,416
- GOOD LUCK, MY BOY.

186
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,500
- MAN.

187
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,166
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LET
HER GET TO ME.

188
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,500
WHY IS SHE DOING THIS?

189
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,541
DAMN IT!

190
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,958
FIGURES. SHE'S ALREADY
TAKEN OFF.

191
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,750
- FULL, FULL, FULL, MOON!

192
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,333
- SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,666
- HEY HAIJI, I WAS THINKING...

194
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,000
- ABOUT WHAT?

195
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,250
- WELL, MAYBE IT ISN'T
A GREAT IDEA FOR ME TO

196
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,416
KEEP HANGING AROUND WITH
BIG BROTHER ALL THE TIME.

197
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,625
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE
UP ON KOUHEI BUT

198
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,583
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND I
DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

199
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,625
I CAN FEEL HER.
SHE'S IN MY HEAD AGAIN.

200
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,750
- WHY DON'T WE GO HOME, MASTER?

201
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,666
- I'VE GOT THIS WEIRD FEELING,
LIKE I'M NOT ME.

202
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,125
IT'S AS IF THERE'S SOMEBODY
ELSE INSIDE OF ME

203
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,916
TELLING ME WHAT TO THINK.

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,625
AND I'M COMPLETELY POWERLESS
AGAINST IT.

205
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,125
- Luna: BUT KOUHEI
TOLD YOU HIMSELF

206
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,958
HE DIDN'T WANNA
BE YOUR SLAVE.

207
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,083
SO THERE'S NO REASON FOR
US TO STAY WITH HIM.

208
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,125
WE CAN FIND A PLACE WHERE
WE TRULY BELONG.

209
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,750
NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND
A NEW SLAVE.

210
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,375
- Hazuki: NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND
A NEW SLAVE.

211
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,750
- Luna: A BETTER SLAVE.

212
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,500
- Hazuki: A BETTER SLAVE.

213
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,750
- BOTH: WE MUST FIND A NEW
SLAVE, A BETTER SLAVE.

214
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

215
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,666
- DAMMIT! WHERE IS SHE?

216
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,125
I KNOW SHE THINKS
SHE DOESN'T NEED ME,

217
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,666
BUT THIS CITY ISN'T SAFE
FOR A GIRL LIKE HER.

218
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,291
SOMEONE'S GOTTA PROTECT HER!

219
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,250
AM I KIDDING MYSELF?

220
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,041
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T NEED ME.

221
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,750
MAYBE SHE'LL BE HAPPIER
THIS WAY.

222
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,666
IS THIS ALL I AM TO HER?

223
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,708
HARD TIMES AND BAD NEWS?

224
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,791
WHAT IF SHE'S MOVED ON?

225
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,875
FOUND SOMEONE ELSE?

226
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,250
DAMN IT. WHAT THE HELL
AM I TALKING ABOUT?

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,708
SHE'S NOT MY FAMILY.

228
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,166
AND I'M NOT HER SLAVE!

229
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,166
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

230
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,125
WHERE DID SHE GO AND WHY
THE HELL DO I CARE, ANYWAY?

231
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,583
WHY IS IT EATING ME UP?

232
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,750
WHY DO I FEEL SO DESPERATE
TO FIND HER? DAMN IT!

233
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,208
- 'SCUSE ME...

234
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,208
- HELLO, THERE.
ARE YOU ADDRESSING ME?

235
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,916
- THIS MAY SOUND STRANGE, BUT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE MY SLAVE?

236
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,208
- PLAY SLAVE TO A BEAUTIFUL
YOUNG WOMAN LIKE YOU?

237
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:24,875
WHY, I'D BE HONORED.

238
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,916
- THANK YOU. I WAS HOPING
YOU'D SAY THAT.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,125
- SO TELL ME, WHAT DO YOUR
SLAVES DO FOR YOU?

240
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,250
- ( gasps )

241
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,791
- DON'T START ACTING
SHY NOW, DEAR.

242
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:51,833
- I CAN'T DO IT.

243
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,625
( sobs )

244
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,208
I DON'T WANT ANOTHER SLAVE.

245
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,333
I WANT BIG BROTHER, THAT'S IT!

246
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,916
- Kouhei: HAZUKI!

247
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,125
( panting )

248
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,916
- KOUHEI, YOU'RE HERE.

249
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,333
- YOU'VE GOTTA STOP WITH THESE

250
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,583
MIDNIGHT STROLLS
THROUGH THE PARK!

251
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,541
DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT KINDA
PLACE THIS IS?

252
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,916
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY SHE DOES!

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,500
- I'D STAY OUT OF THIS
IF I WERE YOU.

254
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,750
- ME STAY OUT OF IT?
I WAS HERE FIRST!

255
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,291
WHAT DO YOU
WANT WITH HER, ANYWAY?

256
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,625
- WHAT DO I WANT WITH HER?

257
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,125
HEY, WHO D'YOU THINK
YOU ARE, BUDDY?

258
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,291
- NOT THAT IT'S YOUR CONCERN,

259
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,458
BUT I JUST AGREED
TO BECOME HER SLAVE.

260
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,458
- WAIT, SO YOU ALREADY?

261
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,958
- NO, NOT YET.

262
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,291
- ( sighs )

263
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,083
- TRUST ME, BOY, YOU'RE WAY TOO
- HEY, HANDS OFF!

264
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,875
- MEDIOCRE FOR THIS ONE.
- MEDIOCRE?

265
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,125
- ( chuckles ) WELL,
DON'T GET MAD AT ME.

266
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,000
COMPARED TO MY HANDSOME FACE
MEDIOCRE IS BEING GENEROUS.

267
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,791
HONESTLY, KID.

268
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,583
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE,
SO SHOVE OFF.

269
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,083
- OKAY. THAT'S ENOUGH, MAN!

270
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,791
UH?

271
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,750
- RECONSIDERING THAT MAN
ABOUT NOW?

272
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,625
RELAX. WE'RE NOT IN THE 1950S!

273
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,000
SHE CAN BE WITH A WOMAN
IF SHE WANTS!

274
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,916
- Both: ( gasp ) A WOMAN?

275
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,708
- COME, MY GIRL.

276
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,666
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU AWAY TO A
MAGICAL LAND OF MILK AND HONEY.

277
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,166
- HOLD ON.

278
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,750
- LET GO OF HER!

279
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,625
- ARE WE THROUGH HERE?

280
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,375
- KOUHEI! WAIT!

281
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,666
- COME FAR AWAY, TO OUR VERY
OWN FORBIDDEN FRONTIER.

282
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,041
- FASCINATING.
SO YOU WANNA BE A SLAVE?

283
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,583
WELL, I THINK
THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

284
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,375
- Hazuki: PUT ME DOWN!

285
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,750
JUST STOP INTERFERING
IN MY LIFE, OKAY?

286
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,333
- INTERFERING?

287
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,458
- IT'S A FULL MOON TONIGHT
AND I'M THIRSTY FOR A KISS!

288
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,083
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO MESS
IT ALL UP?

289
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,791
- ISN'T THAT WHAT I'M HERE FOR?

290
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,458
I THOUGHT WE'D SETTLED
THAT BY NOW!

291
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,250
STOP BEING SO DIFFICULT!

292
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,791
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?
- WHAT?

293
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,875
- JUST 'CAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE I'M
SOME BURDEN YOU HAVE TO BEAR?

294
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,250
IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN I DON'T
WANT YOU AROUND!

295
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,583
I DON'T WANNA BE SOMETHING
YOU PUT UP WITH.

296
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,791
SOME TERRIBLE JOB YOU
HATE BUT GO TO ANYWAY,

297
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,833
BECAUSE YOU THINK
IT'S YOUR OBLIGATION.

298
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,791
- OBLIGATION? COME ON.

299
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,750
- DON'T YOU GET IT? I'M HERE
WITH YOU BECAUSE I WANT TO BE.

300
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,375
I DON'T HAVE SOME
NOBLE REASON. I JUST...

301
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,166
( sobbing )

302
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,333
- I SEE.

303
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,666
I'M SO STUPID.

304
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,083
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
WHY YOU WERE SO UPSET, BRAT?

305
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,166
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
SO FREAKIN' STUBBORN,

306
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,333
DO EVERYTHING YOUR OWN WAY,
AND YOU'RE SO SURE

307
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,916
YOU'LL GET DROPPED, YOU PROTECT
YOURSELF AND SHUT DOWN.

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,875
AND YOU KNOW, EVERYONE SAYS
I DO THE SAME THING.

309
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,000
THIS LUNA THING
HASN'T CHANGED YOU.

310
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,041
THE GIRL STANDING IN FRONT OF
ME IS STILL THE GIRL I LOVE,

311
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,625
AND THE GIRL I CARE ABOUT
SO VERY MUCH.

312
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,666
- ( sobbing )

313
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,125
SO TELL ME, KOUHEI.

314
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:15,166
WOULD IT MAKE YOU HAPPY,
IF I TOLD YOU...

315
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,083
IF I SAID I LOVED YOU, TOO?

316
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,208
- JUST DON'T LEAVE AGAIN,
THAT'S ALL I NEED FROM YOU.

317
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,375
OH, YEAH. YOU SAID YOU
WERE THIRSTY, RIGHT?

318
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,625
- THANK YOU, KOUHEI.

319
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,791
- Hazuki: I WAS WRONG.

320
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,208
I CAN STAY HERE. IT'S HOME.

321
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,958
- Luna: NO. THIS IS NOT OUR
HOME, WE DON'T BELONG HERE.

322
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,833
DON'T FORGET THE CASTLE
IS OUR REAL HOME.

323
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,958
- Hazuki: I LOVE THIS PLACE.

324
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,208
HE'S MY FAMILY.

325
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,583
AND MY HOME.

326
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,500
I'M EXACTLY WHERE I SHOULD BE.

327
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,708
- ( moans softly )

328
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,208
- KOUHEI, TELEPHONE.

329
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,000
- WHO IS IT?
- HIROMI. SHE SOUNDS MAD.

330
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,875
- OH, CRAP!
I COMPLETELY FORGOT!

331
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,208
- OH BOY, SHE'S GONA KILL ME.

332
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,875
I GUESS I'D BETTER GO
BEG OR SOMETHIN'.

333
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,958
- Hazuki: HA!
GET A SCOLDING, DUMMY?

334
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,416
- AW, SHUT YOUR FACE.

335
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,625
HAZUKI? YOU SOUND LIKE YOU!

336
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,333
I MEAN YOU REALLY SOUND LIKE
YOU ARE YOU YOU AGAIN?

337
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,916
- GET OFF OF ME, YOU JERK!
YOU'RE WEIRD!

338
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,083
- Ryuuhei: SHE'S BEEN LIKE THAT
ALL MORNING, KOUHEI.

339
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,583
BACK TO HER OLD SELF!

340
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,625
ELFRIEDE SAYS SUCKING YOUR BLOOD
IS PROBABLY WHAT DID IT!

341
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,250
SEE, I KEEP TELLING PEOPLE
YOU'RE NOT ENTIRELY USELESS!

342
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,583
- Kouhei: SO YOU'RE BACK
TO NORMAL?

343
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,750
WELL, THAT'S GREAT!

344
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,875
- NOW WHAT'S WRONG?

345
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,500
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO
DISAPPOINTED ALL OF A SUDDEN?

346
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,708
- NO, IT'S NOTHING, I MEAN
OBVIOUSLY I'M HAPPY IT'S OVER.

347
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,333
I JUST KNOW THAT THE
LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED,

348
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,708
YOUR MEMORY GOT KIND OF HAZY,

349
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,250
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

350
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,916
- DON'T WORRY.
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

351
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,375
ALL OF IT, EVERY SINGLE MOMENT
IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.

352
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,250
WALKING WITH HAIJI,
JUMPING AROUND IN THE SUN...

353
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,125
AND ESPECIALLY LAST NIGHT...

354
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,583
- YOU DON'T SAY...

355
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,083
- HAZUKI AND LUNA ARE BOTH ME,
JUST DIFFERENT SIDES.

356
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,208
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT
BETTER NOW.

357
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,416
BOTH OF THEIR MEMORIES
ARE MINE.

358
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,333
I'VE BEEN THINKING, KOUHEI...

359
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,125
IT'S MY FAULT YOU MISSED YOUR
PHOTO ASSIGNMENT WITH HIROMI

360
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,875
YESTERDAY 'CAUSE YOU WERE
DEALING WITH ME THE ENTIRE TIME.

361
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,916
I'D LIKE TO GO WITH YOU
TO APOLOGIZE TO HER.

362
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,375
- ( laughs ) THAT'S AWFUL MATURE
OF YOU, HAZUKI.

363
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,541
- SHUT UP.

364
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,833
- YOU SURE YOU'RE BACK
TO NORMAL?

365
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,125
- I'M ALWAYS MATURE!

366
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,375
YOU'RE JUST TOO
DUMB TO REALIZE IT!

367
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,250
-I DUNNO, I BETTER GO ALONE.

368
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,375
I'M AFRAID WHEN WE GET THERE,

369
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,500
YOUR HEAD MIGHT START
SPINNING AROUND!

370
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,250
- YOU'RE SUCH A JERK!

371
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,333
- THE SWEET SOUND
OF CONTENTION.

372
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,291
THINGS ARE FINALLY
BACK TO NORMAL.

373
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,541
- YES. IT SURE SOUNDS
THAT WAY TO ME.

374
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,625
- BY THE WAY ELFRIEDE,
I'VE BEEN WONDERING,

375
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,250
DID EVERYTHING
GO WELL LAST NIGHT?

376
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,041
- WHY, THANK YOU FOR ASKING.
I HAD A DELICIOUS TIME.

377
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,916
- Pinky: A MAGICAL LAND
OF MILK AND HONEY.

378
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,458
- LOVELY TO HEAR, BUT THAT'S
NOT QUITE WHAT I MEANT.

379
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,500
- DON'T WORRY.
IT'S ALL UNDER CONTROL.

380
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:39,208
I'VE POSTED MY HELPERS ON LOOK
OUTS IN ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS.

381
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,750
THEY SHOULD NOTIFY US OF
ANY SUPERNATURAL PURSUERS

382
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,166
WHO COME LOOKING FOR HAZUKI.

383
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,500
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN BUSY.

384
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,875
- I'VE PLACED SEVERAL PROTECTIVE

385
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,125
BARRIER INCANTATIONS
ON THE HOUSE.

386
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,625
WHO KNOWS HOW
EFFECTIVE THEY'LL BE,

387
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,166
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL THE
PRECAUTIONS WE CAN MANAGE.

388
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,250
JUST LOOK
AT THEIR SMILING FACES.

389
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,958
I WANT TO PRESERVE THEM
AS LONG AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

390
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,083
- YEAH.

391
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,250
- ( thunder crashes )

392
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,000
- Mario: SO, COUNT KINKEL HAS
DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE,

393
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,041
AND SCHWARTZ QUELLE
STANDS EMPTY?

394
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,875
I UNDERSTAND, MY MASTER.

395
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,583
I WILL BRING THE MISTRESS
BACK WITHOUT FAIL...

396
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,916
TO THE PLACE SHE BELONGS.

397
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,125
- ( theme song playing )

398
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

399
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,500
- Hazuki: SO I'VE BEEN
THINKING, BIG BROTHER,

400
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,250
WE SHOULD BECOME DOCTORS
AND SOLVE MEDICAL MYSTERIES.

401
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:07,375
MAYBE WE COULD FIGURE OUT
HOW VAMPIRES REALLY WORK!

402
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,291
OKAY, AFTER MY COUNT DOWN,
LET'S START STUDYING

403
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,666
SO WE CAN GET INTO
MED SCHOOL! READY?

404
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,541
FULL, FULL, FULL, MOON!

405
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,250
NEXT TIME
ON MOON PHASE,

406
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,500
"I HAVE TO EAT CAT-EAR BUNS!"

407
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,958
HOW'S THE STUDYING
GOING, KOUHEI?

408
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,166
HEY! WAKE UP!

409
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,750
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET INTO
MED SCHOOL LIKE THIS!
