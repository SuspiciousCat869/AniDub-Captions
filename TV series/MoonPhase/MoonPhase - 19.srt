1
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,750
- EIGHT MONTHS AND NOTHING
IS CHANGED AT ALL.

2
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,333
YOU'D THINK THE CITY
COULD CLEAN THE LOT

3
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,125
SO IT WOULDN'T BE AN EYESORE.

4
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

5
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,041
STOP IT, CHIEF.

6
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,458
YOU'RE KNEELING DOWN
LIKE IT'S A GRAVE!

7
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,375
THEY'RE NOT DEAD,
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

8
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,208
QUIT ACTING LIKE THEY ARE.

9
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,416
- HIROMI, COME ON.

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,125
- THEY'RE ALIVE, ALL OF THEM.

11
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,000
I JUST HAVEN'T FOUND THEM YET,
THAT'S ALL.

12
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,333
- IF THEY'RE ALIVE

13
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,875
THEN WHY HAVEN'T THEY
GOTTEN IN TOUCH WITH YOU,

14
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,125
EVEN ONCE IN ALL THIS TIME?

15
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,833
YOU AREN'T EXACTLY A STRANGER.

16
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,625
LET THEM GO.

17
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,208
- LET THEM GO, CHIEF?

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,083
THEY'RE ALIVE!

19
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,166
THERE MUST BE A GOOD REASON

20
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,375
WHY THEY CAN'T GET
IN CONTACT WITH ME.

21
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,291
MAYBE THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

22
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,083
- IN TROUBLE WITH WHOM?

23
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,625
RYUUHEI, SEIJI, ELFRIEDE,
KOUHEI, AND HAZUKI.

24
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:32,208
HARDLY A LIST OF USUAL SUSPECTS
RUNNING FROM THE LAW.

25
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:36,125
WHAT REASON WOULD THEY
HAVE TO SUDDENLY DISAPPEAR?

26
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,666
LIKE WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MYSTERIES

27
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,625
TO DEAL WITH IN
OUR OWN MAGAZINE.

28
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,166
- HIROMI, CHIEF,

29
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,875
FORGIVE US.

30
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,541
WE JUST NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME.

31
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,625
- ( theme song playing )

32
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

33
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,375
- Hazuki: "DAY ON THE MOUNTAIN,
MONKEY IN THE SPA,

34
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,958
"THE CAT'S WHISKERS...
AND WHO ARE YOU?"

35
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,875
I GO UP THE MOUNTAIN
ONCE A MONTH.

36
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,708
FOR ONE DAY,
I'M ALLOWED TO SEE KOUHEI.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,625
AND I'M ALLOWED
TO KISS HIM, TOO.

38
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,416
- ( grunting )

39
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,500
- HAS YOUR THIRST
BEEN QUENCHED, HAZUKI?

40
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,125
- YES, FOR NOW, AT LEAST.

41
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,208
- I UNDERSTAND KOUHEI SAVED
YOU FROM SOME TROUBLE.

42
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,958
-HE USED A SPELL, MASTER YAYOI!
I DIDN'T KNOW HE COULD DO THAT!

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,958
- CONSIDERING WHERE HE STARTED,
THAT'S CERTAINLY PROGRESS.

44
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,541
BUT OUR BOY'S STILL
WEAKER THAN A BABY BIRD.

45
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,708
- CAN'T WE AT LEAST SAY
I'M LIKE A LION CUB?

46
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,708
- YOU'RE NO CAT, SLAVE BOY.

47
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,000
- MIND YOUR OWN
BUSINESS, MIDGET.

48
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,750
I'M DOIN' THE BEST
I CAN OUT HERE, OKAY.

49
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,875
- ( laughs )

50
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,625
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU BELIEVE
THAT TO BE TRUE, KOUHEI.

51
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,541
THAT'S JUST PROOF YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO, MY FRIEND.

52
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,666
- ( all laughing )

53
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,583
- HEY, CATGIRL.
WHAT'RE YOU LAUGHING AT?

54
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,625
- I ONLY LAUGH AT YOU
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU, SLAVE BOY!

55
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,000
- YAYOI IS THE HEAD OF THE
MAIN BRANCH OF THE MIDO FAMILY.

56
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,375
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
ALL THE BRANCHES CONNECT,

57
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,208
BUT NO ONE ARGUES
THAT IN THE MIDO CLAN,

58
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,041
YAYOI'S NUMBER ONE, AT LEAST
THAT'S WHAT HIKARU TOLD ME.

59
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,000
- Kouhei: GO AWAY?
WHY DO I HAVE TO DO THAT?

60
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,541
- KOUHEI...

61
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,708
- I'M SORRY BUT I DON'T SEE HOW
BEING SEPARATED FROM HAZUKI

62
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,208
IS GOING TO HELP ME
WITH MY TRAINING!

63
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,500
I DIDN'T ABANDON GRANDPA

64
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,916
JUST SO I COULD COME HERE
AND ABANDON HER, TOO!

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
- NOW JUST HOLD ON.

66
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,041
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
YOU COULD PROTECT HER

67
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,916
IF SHE WAS ATTACKED RIGHT NOW?

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,791
- ( sighs )

69
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,333
- I THOUGHT THE POINT
OF YOUR TRAINING

70
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,875
WAS THAT YOU KNEW YOU COULDN'T.

71
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,291
- KOUHEI...

72
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,333
- THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY.

73
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,791
WHILE YOU'RE WORKING
TO GET STRONGER,

74
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,208
I WILL PROTECT HAZUKI.

75
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,666
REAL TRAINING REQUIRES SOLITUDE.

76
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,291
YOU MUST BE SELF-RELIANT

77
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,375
THAT IS A RULE THAT
CANNOT BE COMPROMISED.

78
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,250
EITHER OBEY IT OR LEAVE
THE MOUNTAIN NOW.

79
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,333
- DO WHAT HE SAYS, BIG BROTHER.
I'LL BE OKAY.

80
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,875
- BUT I SWORE.

81
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,083
- PLEASE, KOUHEI. TRAIN HARD
AND GET STRONGER, ALL RIGHT?

82
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,458
I NEED A SLAVE I CAN DEPEND ON.

83
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,041
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
ON OUR TRIP, ISN'T IT?

84
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,208
SO, PINKIE SWEAR.

85
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,583
PROMISE YOU'LL DO YOUR BEST
TO GET STRONGER QUICKLY.

86
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,416
IT'S GONNA BE REALLY
BORING AROUND HERE

87
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,000
WITHOUT YOU TO SCREAM AT.

88
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,625
- HAZUKI.

89
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,000
- COME ON. PINKY SWEAR.

90
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,000
- YEAH, OKAY.

91
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,833
- PINKIE SWEAR, IF YOU LIE,

92
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,250
CROSS YOUR HEART, HOPE TO DIE,
A THOUSAND NEEDLES IN YOUR EYE!

93
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,791
YOU REALLY ARE DOING YOUR BEST,
RIGHT, KOUHEI?

94
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,041
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

95
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,166
- ( groaning )

96
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,625
- SHE'S SUCKING HIS BLOOD!

97
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,541
- CUT IT OUT, YOU FRUITCAKE!

98
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,000
- NO NEED FOR NAME-CALLING.

99
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,666
- TASTES LIKE IRON.

100
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,750
- WELL, WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING?
MAPLE SYRUP?

101
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,958
- UH, THAT WAS UNEXPECTED.

102
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,166
- I'LL SAY. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HER?

103
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,500
- IT HAPPENED SO FAST,
I WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD.

104
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,708
- MASTER YAYOI,
HE NEEDS LOTS MORE TRAINING.

105
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,916
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,666
- MORE TRAINING FOR SLAVE BOY.

107
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,083
- REALLY KAORU,
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

108
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,500
- BECAUSE IT JUST ISN'T FAIR.

109
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,458
HAZUKI GETS TO, YOU KNOW...

110
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,541
- OH NO.

111
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,041
- THIS ISN'T GOOD.

112
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,958
- OH! SHE'S JUST LIKE YOU,
MASTER, LOOK.

113
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,250
- ( mewing )

114
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,875
- UM, KAORU?

115
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,458
- ( purring )

116
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,125
- SHE'S SO CUTE.
TELL HER SHE'S CUTE, KOUHEI.

117
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,916
OH PLEASE, JUST SAY IT.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,958
- UH. OKAY. KAORU. YOU'RE...

119
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,875
- HAVE TO BUTT IN,
DON'T YA, FANGS?

120
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,000
- THAT'S RIGHT!

121
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,166
- YOU'RE SO CUTE WITH YOUR
CAT EARS. OH, YES YOU ARE.

122
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,208
- I HAVE A TAIL TOO.
LOOK AT MY CUTE LITTLE TAIL.

123
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,333
- PERFECT. LOOK, SEE?
IT'S A CATTAIL.

124
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,291
HEY, BONEHEAD!
WHY AREN'T YOU LOOKING?

125
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,583
TELL HER HOW CUTE
SHE IS, KOUHEI!

126
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,583
- OKAY, UH, YOU'RE...

127
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,875
- LET HIM SAY IT.
- NOT A CHANCE.

128
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,791
- DEMON!
- THAT ALL YA GOT?

129
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,000
- WOULD YOU TWO STOP?

130
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,041
- ALL RIGHT, FIGHTERS!
TAKE YOUR PLACES, PLEASE! READY?

131
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,375
- MY GOODNESS, KOUHEI.
MUST BE NICE TO BE SO POPULAR.

132
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,125
- NO, IT'S NOT! ARE YOU CRAZY?

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,458
- MASTER YAYOI, IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG? WHAT IS IT?

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,750
- HIKARU. KAORU.
COME OUTSIDE WITH ME.

135
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,333
- HUH?
- OKAY.

136
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,458
- YES, HAIJI, YOU TOO.

137
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,500
- WAY AHEAD OF YA!

138
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,416
- WHAT ABOUT US?

139
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,333
- YEAH, SENSEI,
DON'T JUST LEAVE US HERE.

140
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,708
- QUIET!

141
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,625
CAN'T YOU SEE
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU?

142
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,125
THAT'S BETTER.

143
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,750
- Hikaru: MASTER YAYOI,
WHAT IS IT?

144
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,916
- Yayoi: SOMEONE
HAS BROKEN THROUGH

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,833
THE FIRST BARRIERS
AROUND  THE MOUNTAIN.

146
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,458
- Haiji: UH-OH.

147
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,291
- I NEED TO CHECK IT OUT.

148
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,375
I WANT YOU GIRLS TO MAKE SURE

149
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,583
HAZUKI NEVER GETS
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

150
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,125
- Girls: YES, SIR!

151
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,375
- HAIJI, COME WITH ME.
- CAN DO!

152
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,958
- AND NOW IT BEGINS.

153
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,375
- ( Kouhei clears throat )

154
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,750
SO, UH, ANYWAY,
HERE WE ARE.

155
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,666
- HERE YOU GO!

156
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,166
YOUR RICE FOR THE NEXT MONTH.

157
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,958
AND THEN, I KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT AND ALL,

158
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,291
BUT WITH NOTHING BUT RICE
AND MOUNTAIN FERNS TO EAT

159
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,875
YOU AREN'T GETTING
A VERY BALANCED DIET,

160
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,291
SO I THOUGHT I'D
HELP YOU OUT A BIT.

161
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,291
TA-DA!

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,916
- GEEZ, WHAT'D YOU DO,
ROB A DRUGSTORE?

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,333
I JUST ASKED GRANDMOTHER
KOHARU TO ORDER THEM FOR ME.

164
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,833
I SAID I WANTED THEM
ALL FOR MYSELF.

165
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,166
CONSIDERING THAT I'M THE MASTER
AND YOU'RE THE SLAVE,

166
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,416
I SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME
LOOKING AFTER YOU.

167
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,541
DON'T WORRY, YOU CAN PAY
ME FOR EVERYTHING LATER,

168
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,333
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

169
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,041
I KEPT THE RECEIPT.

170
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,958
- THANKS, HAZUKI,
THIS MEANS A LOT TO ME.

171
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,500
- WELL, I CAN'T HAVE MY
FOOD SOURCE MALNOURISHED.

172
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,833
- YOU'RE SUCH A LITTLE BRAT.

173
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,291
- ( giggles )

174
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,458
- SO, WANNA GO FOR A WALK?
- SURE.

175
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,333
- IT'S COLD OUT, THOUGH.
DID YOU BRING A JACKET?

176
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,375
- I'M FINE.

177
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,916
- ( wind blowing )

178
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,458
- VAMPIRES, THIS MOUNTAIN IS

179
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,125
UNDER THE CARE OF
THE MIDO FAMILY.

180
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,750
YOU WILL NOT HAVE YOUR WAY.

181
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,708
- Jeda: WE'RE GOING IN CIRCLES.

182
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:58,208
NO MATTER HOW FAR WE WALK,
WE END UP IN THE SAME PLACE.

183
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,083
WHOEVER IS PROTECTING
MISTRESS LUNA

184
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,750
HAS PUT SOME KIND
OF SPELL ON US.

185
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,875
- SOME KIND OF EASTERN MAGIC?

186
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,250
- SO IT WOULD SEEM,
AND VERY POWERFUL, TOO.

187
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,791
- FEELS...SO...GOOD...

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,875
OH, COZY.

189
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,958
- WELL, GOOD TO
KNOW HER HOLINESS

190
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,583
IS TAKING THIS SO SERIOUSLY.

191
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,416
- BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY, JEDA.

192
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,250
- OH, EXCUSE ME.
ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY PRINCESS.

193
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,000
YOU'RE SUCH A
LOYAL SLAVE, VARGAS.

194
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,416
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

195
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,541
- WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME HERE.

196
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,291
BUT BY ALL MEANS,
LET THE MISTRESS ENJOY HER BATH.

197
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,333
- WHO GOES THERE?

198
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,583
- ( monkey chattering )

199
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,791
- WHO GOES THERE?

200
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,208
- ( monkey chattering )

201
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,958
- I SAID WHO GOES THERE?

202
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,333
- ( monkey chattering )

203
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,166
- IT'S A MONKEY.

204
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,875
- ( gasps ) LOOK OUT, PRINCESS!
IT MIGHT BE DANGEROUS!

205
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,041
- GET OUT OF THERE! IMMEDIATELY!
- IT'S OKAY.

206
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,083
- COME ON! QUICKLY!

207
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,458
- CUTE MONKEY.

208
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,875
- NO ONE EVER LISTENS.

209
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,125
- HERE WE ARE.

210
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,500
GO.

211
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,791
GOOD WORK.

212
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,750
- I WONDER WHERE JEDA WENT.

213
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,958
- I DON'T LIKE JEDA.

214
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,583
HE'S NEVER EVEN PLAYED WITH
ME ONCE. I DON'T LIKE HIM.

215
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,875
- IT'S NO USE TAKING IT
PERSONALLY, MISTRESS.

216
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,708
IT'S JUST THE WAY HE IS.

217
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,208
- I'M FINISHED, MONKEY,
GIVE THE EARS BACK.

218
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,958
- HEY! RETURN THE
PRINCESS' CAT EARS!

219
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,583
- DON'T LIKE THE BAD MONKEY.

220
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,291
- I TOLD YOU
YOU'D NEED A JACKET.

221
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,125
- I'M OKAY.

222
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,083
- REALLY? THEN YOU
DON'T WANT THIS?

223
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,083
- Hikaru: I WISH I COULD HEAR
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

224
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,041
THE SOUND OF THE WATER'S
TOO LOUD. LET'S GET CLOSER.

225
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,291
OKAY, KAORU?

226
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,166
- ( mewing )

227
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,000
- WHAT'S WRONG, HAZ?

228
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,625
- NOTHING.

229
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,500
- IS IT KAORU? YOU KNOW YOU
SHOULDN'T LET THAT GET TO YOU.

230
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,666
- KAORU DOESN'T
BOTHER ME AT ALL.

231
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,583
- OH, IS THAT RIGHT?
THEN WAS WITH THE TANTRUM?

232
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:06,625
- OKAY, FINE. MAYBE SHE
BOTHERS ME JUST A LITTLE BIT.

233
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,583
AFTER ALL, SHE'S YOUR FIANCEE.

234
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,625
- HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
TELL YOU? THAT'S A TOTAL JOKE.

235
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,250
IT MEANS NOTHING.
OUR FAMILY DECIDED THAT.

236
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,333
- IF IT'S SO OBVIOUSLY NOTHING,
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER THAT.

237
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,208
- I HONESTLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS FIGHT IS ABOUT.

238
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,458
I'M DOING ALL THIS TRAINING
FOR YOU, AREN'T I?

239
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,541
SO I CAN KEEP YOU SAFE.

240
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,458
- I KNOW, BUT...
- FOR YOU.

241
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,333
AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT FOR
GRANDPA AND ELFRIEDE, TOO.

242
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,083
- YEAH, I MISS THEM, TOO.

243
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,083
- IT'S HARD WHEN
I THINK ABOUT THEM.

244
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,125
BUT I CAN'T LET IT
HOLD ME BACK FOREVER.

245
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,000
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN

246
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,750
TO MOVE FORWARD, KID, OKAY?

247
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,708
- YEAH, OKAY.

248
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,250
- SURE, WE'VE GOT OUR PROBLEMS,

249
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,500
BUT LATELY THINGS
JUST SEEM DIFFERENT.

250
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,041
I FEEL LIKE I'M
BEHIND THE WHEEL,

251
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,833
LIKE WHAT I DO REALLY
MATTERS, YA KNOW?

252
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,833
- ( chuckles )

253
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,625
WELL, LISTEN TO MR. CONFIDENCE.

254
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,958
YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE
YOURSELF AT ALL, KOUHEI.

255
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,750
- OH, GEE, THANKS A LOT.

256
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,625
- REALLY. IT'S KINDA NICE.

257
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,625
- KAORU?

258
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,083
HEY. YOU DROPPED THIS.

259
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,541
- THANK YOU, SISTER.

260
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,833
I WAS THINKING, MAYBE NEXT
TIME I'LL ADD WHISKERS, TOO.

261
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,958
- THANKS FOR THE WARM
WELCOME, STRANGER.

262
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:03,541
- IT TAKES CONSIDERABLE SKILL
TO BREAK THE MIDO BARRIER.

263
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:07,541
- YOU HONOR ME, SIR.
I AM JEDA, THE PUPPET MASTER.

264
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,416
AND WHO ARE YOU?

265
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,083
- I WON'T WASTE MY NAME
ON VAMPIRE EARS.

266
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,291
- NO WAY!

267
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,875
- I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'D BE WILLING

268
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,083
TO SURRENDER MISTRESS LUNA?

269
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,000
I'D RATHER NOT KILL
ANYONE I DON'T HAVE TO.

270
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,416
- I KNOW NO GIRL BY THAT NAME.

271
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,208
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

272
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,291
- SO IT SEEMS.

273
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,125
- THEN LET'S BEGIN.

274
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,625
( grunting )

275
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,583
THERE'S NO ESCAPING.

276
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,208
I'LL FIND YOU NO
MATTER WHERE YOU RUN.

277
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,000
RESIGN YOURSELF TO DIE.

278
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,500
- RESIGN YOURSELF TO
SHUTTING YOUR ICKY FACE!

279
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,666
- PESKY LITTLE DEMON!

280
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,125
- CARELESSNESS IS
THE GREATEST FOE.

281
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,208
CAUGHT IN YOUR OWN FOUL WEB.

282
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,166
- MOVED TO THE BASE OF
THE MOUNTAIN?

283
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,083
TO DO THIS TO
SOMEONE OF MY TALENTS.

284
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,708
WELL, THIS IS GETTING
MORE INTERESTING.

285
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,791
- SEE YOU IN A MONTH, OKAY?

286
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,916
OH, AND GIRLS? PLEASE, FOR
ME, WATCH OUT FOR HER.

287
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,958
- FINE.
- 'KAY.

288
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,250
NEXT TIME I VISIT YOU I'LL HAVE
WHISKERS, TOO, BROTHER KOUHEI.

289
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,583
- WHEN I'M DONE TRAINING,
THEN I'LL EAT RICE.

290
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,291
- ( Hazuki gasps )

291
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,625
- NOW WHAT'S WRONG?

292
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,750
- I FORGOT SOMETHING.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

293
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,791
- HUH? HAZUKI, WAIT!

294
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,166
- MAN, THIS IS LIKE
EATING CARDBOARD.

295
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,166
OH, WELL. YOU CAN'T
BE SELF-SUFFICIENT

296
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,958
IF YOU'RE LETTING SOMEONE
FEED YOU, RIGHT?

297
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,250
- KOUHEI!

298
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,958
- HAZUKI! HEY, UH, WHAT'RE
YOU DOING BACK SO SOON, HUH?

299
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,833
THIS ISN'T MY DINNER,
BY THE WAY. NO.

300
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,500
IT'S JUST A LITTLE SNACK,
THAT'S ALL!

301
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,583
YOU OKAY?

302
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,125
- ( crying ) NO...

303
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,375
- HEY, COME ON.

304
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,083
IT'S HARD THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT, RIGHT?

305
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,375
LISTEN, KIDDO, I KNOW.
IT'S HARD FOR ME TOO.

306
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,708
I JUST HAVE TO FINISH TRAINING
AND THEN I'LL BE BACK.

307
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,833
- BUT WHEN? HOW LONG?

308
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:25,291
- IT'S HARD TO SAY.
BUT YOU REMEMBER MY PROMISE.

309
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,250
I'M DOING MY BEST SO I CAN GET
BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS I CAN.

310
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,666
YOU JUST HAVE TO
