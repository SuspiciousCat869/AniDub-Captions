1
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,333
Oh, yeah...
It's affected my work...

2
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,916
Now that we all
know they're real...

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
it's a lot harder to
write vampire manga.

4
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,250
But I hear your
past works...

5
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,208
are selling better
than they ever have!

6
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,833
And now they're on TV...

7
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,041
So you must really
be raking it in!

8
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,208
I guess so...

9
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,458
Yeah... sure!

10
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,166
Vampire mania has
gotten so wild,

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,875
some people even
idolize them!

12
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,000
Yumi, you've actually
been bitten by a vampire,

13
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,458
can you tell us about that?

14
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,750
I was given the vaccine
right after it happened...

15
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,625
And as you can see,
I wasn't turned...

16
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,250
But let me tell you, when
I was bitten it felt so good!

17
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,541
Wha...? Nanami...

18
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:01,916
Yuzuru...

19
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,666
No, wait!

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,250
Nanami, come back!

21
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:30,875
[Music]

22
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,791
That night...

23
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,791
under the light of
the pale moon...

24
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,166
I experienced
an end to love.

25
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,750
It had been a month since
the chapel was taken over...

26
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,458
and it seemed like
some kind of peace

27
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,750
had finally returned
to the school...

28
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,708
But that was only
on the surface...

29
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,791
deep scars still
remained...

30
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,750
And I began to feel
the distance growing

31
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,458
between Akira and me
with each passing day...

32
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,541
Werewolves...

33
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,750
The Earth Clan.

34
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,791
The destiny that awaited
some side of him I didn't know.

35
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,125
But it was so much
deeper than that...

36
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,291
She was in his heart...

37
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,375
And she had
always been there.

38
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,416
According to a
government survey...

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,833
when asked the question,

40
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,541
"Would you want to
become a vampire?"

41
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,375
Thirty percent of
the under twenty-five

42
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,625
demographic answered "yes."

43
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:55,333
And it appears... eternal life
was the most popular reason.

44
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,583
Well, at least our plans

45
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,583
are finally starting
to come together.

46
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,333
Yes... but there is still
one troubling rumor.

47
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,166
Supposedly a number of
vampires broke out of the bund

48
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,958
and are now roaming
the city at night.

49
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,000
I thought I'd
made it clear

50
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,625
the bund was to
be sealed off...

51
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,208
Breakouts cannot
be tolerated

52
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,416
if we wish to maintain any
semblance of security.

53
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,458
I want you to
investigate...

54
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,000
Determine if it's true.

55
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,166
I brought a draft of the student
council officer invitation...

56
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,541
I'm sorry...
but it looks like

57
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,208
they're not planning to
come back after all.

58
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,500
I see.

59
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,708
We have a counselor

60
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,375
who specializes in
vampire-related PTSD...

61
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,083
Maybe the former
student council members

62
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,750
could use some counseling?

63
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,041
No, we can't force them to do
something they don't want to.

64
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,125
It's almost like there's
two different Minas...

65
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,833
One shows concern and has
compassion for the weak...

66
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,791
While the other
finds cruel delight

67
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,875
in punishing her followers...

68
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,916
and fights for keeps,
like she did with Akira...

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,083
But which one is
the real Mina?

70
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,125
Yuki... Why are you
staring at me like that?

71
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,583
I know my beauty
can be shocking...

72
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,750
But you have a lovely face

73
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,666
that's worth
staring at as well.

74
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,041
You're teasing
me the same way

75
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,583
you tease Akira, aren't you?

76
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,125
When we first reunited

77
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,833
he grew flustered with
every little comment.

78
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,500
But he has this calm
about him lately,

79
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,833
it's almost bizarre...

80
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,750
If he were here, he would
be saying to me,

81
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,375
"Yeah, yeah, you're
cute Princess"...

82
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,416
something like that.

83
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,708
That's a great impression!

84
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,791
Well, I am always
watching him...

85
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,666
It's the one thing I
never grow tired of.

86
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,875
Yeah, so... anyway, if you
could just take a look at this;

87
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,000
it's a draft I wrote...

88
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,666
I'm sorry, I brought the wrong
notebook along with me...!

89
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,958
I'll be right back!

90
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,083
You sunbathing?

91
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,875
Hang around
vampires too long

92
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,541
and you start to
go all nocturnal...

93
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,416
You start to miss
the sun, don't ya?

94
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,833
That seat belongs
to someone else.

95
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,375
Aw, your beloved
princess...?

96
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,791
Well I'm not moving,
so you'll have to make me...

97
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,958
If you dare.

98
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,875
Nice try!

99
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,916
What is that...
around your neck?

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,875
You mean this...?

101
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,500
It's very
precious to me...

102
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,833
It's just a replica,

103
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,208
but the person most
important to me

104
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,500
has one just like it.

105
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,458
By the way, Akira...

106
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,666
Yeah?

107
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,208
How long you gonna
keep coppin' a feel?

108
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,500
Oh, baby!

109
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,541
Are you okay?
What was all that noise?

110
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,416
Akira!

111
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,083
Yuki...! I, uh... it's
not what you think!

112
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,583
I was just taking a nap
and I fell out of my chair,

113
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,958
'cause I'm an idiot!

114
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,750
Let me guess, you're
waiting for the princess?

115
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,583
You got it...

116
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,166
So, is she finished
up with her work yet?

117
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,875
Not quite, I think she
might be a little bit longer.

118
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,791
I really shouldn't
spend all this time

119
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,291
by the princess' side...

120
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,166
Even if it means I have to
quit the student council...

121
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,708
Seeing them together is
just too painful for me.

122
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,208
What're you doing?!

123
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,791
That's...!

124
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,750
I must say this is
rather unexpected.

125
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,791
I didn't realize that
you're an aspiring novelist.

126
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,541
But... Princess...

127
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,833
That's so mean!

128
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,583
It was rude of me to read
it without asking you...

129
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,458
but once I started I honestly
couldn't put it down.

130
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,083
Your narrative skills
are captivating, Yuki...

131
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,541
I was swept up
by the story.

132
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,708
You're lying...

133
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,166
And why would
I do that...?

134
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,333
I've read everything from
Ulysses to Oliver Twist,

135
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,708
so you can trust
my opinion...

136
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,041
I'm never wrong.

137
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,041
Now, granted, it's not
quite at the level of

138
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,458
Byron or Rimbaud...

139
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,541
But your writing exudes
a unique tenderness

140
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,041
and a youthful spirit.

141
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,750
And that... has to
come from your heart...

142
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,791
It's a quality that
cannot be taught.

143
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,083
Yeah right...

144
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,375
You're just saying
that to me to be nice.

145
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,125
You shouldn't sell
yourself short...

146
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,875
You have an inner
warmth to you...

147
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,541
I've seen it with
my own eyes, Yuki...

148
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,958
You even shed
tears for me

149
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,416
after I intimidated you
and told you to be gone.

150
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,625
No, Akira!

151
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,375
That's not necessarily...

152
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,500
The truth is...

153
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,708
there are now two things

154
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,500
for which I owe
you an apology.

155
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,833
Two things?

156
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,208
I lied to you
about this ring.

157
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,708
Akira didn't
give it to me.

158
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,500
Please, I beg your
forgiveness...

159
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,375
I was envious of you...

160
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,833
Because your
connection with him...

161
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,916
was not born out of
servitude or fate...

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,958
but instead it was out
of honest camaraderie.

163
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,375
Oh, Princess...

164
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,375
Yuki?

165
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,958
There's nothing for
you to apologize for.

166
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,916
You and I...
We're kinda the same...

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,916
We both love Akira...

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,875
and I think we'd
make great allies!

169
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,958
You would consider me...

170
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:53,958
your friend?

171
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,250
You're kind and brave
and compassionate...

172
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,250
I always hoped if
I ever made a friend

173
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,750
it would be with
someone like you.

174
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,666
Wait...! Does being friends
with me upset you?!

175
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,083
No, I... I don't
deserve your friendship!

176
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,625
I thought... you were
a horrible person...

177
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,916
and I was so
jealous of you!

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,916
Then the two of us
should work together...

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,333
Let us help each other
where the other is lacking...

180
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,833
We might even make a
surprisingly good team!

181
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,541
"Tomorrow is
always fresh...

182
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,041
with no mistakes in it."

183
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,708
That's "Anne of Green Gables,"
right...?

184
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,958
I'm afraid I lack Anne's
red hair and freckles...

185
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,833
but do you think you
can accept me anyway?

186
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,791
With pleasure!

187
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,583
By the way, may I
ask you something?

188
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,958
Yeah sure, what is it?

189
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,250
Occasionally in your novel

190
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,375
I came across terms that
I wasn't familiar with...

191
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,583
"Aggressive top", "seductive
bottom", and "BDSM"...

192
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,083
So what are these things...?

193
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,208
Are they codes for something
from Japanese literature?

194
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,916
Is something wrong?

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
Uh...! Everything's
just fine...!

196
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,833
Right, Princess?!

197
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,708
Akira doesn't know
about my writing yet...

198
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,041
Please don't say
anything to him.

199
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,000
I won't, Yuki.

200
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,708
What's going on...?

201
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,125
If the princess is being
mean to you just say so.

202
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,166
Akira! I was not
being mean to her...!

203
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,250
How could you say that
about a pretty girl like me?

204
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,041
Yeah, yeah, you're
cute Princess.

205
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,375
Okay, this is seriously
weirding me out...

206
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,375
I thought you two
were fighting.

207
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,500
Of course we're not!

208
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,541
Right, Princess?

209
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,916
We're confidantes now.

210
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,708
I don't get it...

211
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,166
Nice, isn't it...?

212
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,625
Finding a friend with whom
to share common feelings?

213
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:37,125
Finally... I had rediscovered
my ability to smile.

214
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,166
But I should have realized

215
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,416
that it wouldn't
last very long...

216
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,208
Because little
did we know...

217
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,583
another series of tragic,
horrifying events

218
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,750
had already begun...

219
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,625
Hey! Kid...!

220
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,958
What're you doin'
out so late?

221
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,750
Hi, Officer...

222
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,666
I'm just looking
for someone...

223
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,666
I'm going...
to the vampire bund.

224
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,583
That right...? So you wanna
meet a vampire, huh, kid...?

225
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,583
Then let me
help ya find one!

226
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,458
Do not bare your
fangs in public...

227
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,291
Show some couth.

228
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,000
Apparently the rumors
about vampires

229
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,958
sneaking out of the
bund to feed are true.

230
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,166
He self-destructed?

231
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,416
Excuse me, are you
a vampire, too?

232
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,541
I'm looking for someone
who might be on the bund...

233
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,958
Is there any way
you can take me?

234
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,166
I'm sorry, but I can't...

235
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,458
Humans are not allowed
access to the bund...

236
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,000
You will find no one
but vampires there.

237
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,750
But... the person
I'm looking for...

238
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,083
My neighbor...
she is a vampire!

239
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,125
Your neighbor...?

240
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,541
So she's not family?

241
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,083
No, but we're very close.

242
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,708
She looked after me ever
since I was little...

243
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,458
And what would this
girl's name be?

244
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,833
Her name is Nanami...

245
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,375
Nanami Shinonome.

246
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,416
My, my, aren't you a
daring little girl...?

247
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,583
And you look so innocent,
too, don't you!

248
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,250
Nicely done,
my little piglet.

249
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,750
Now come here.

250
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,416
Nanami Shinonome?

251
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,250
You mean the student
council president?!

252
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,041
All of the students who
were attacked at the church...

253
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,958
were given the
vaccine afterward.

254
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,625
But it seems
Miss Shinonome

255
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,458
has been a vampire
for some time now...

256
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,125
so the vaccine
was useless.

257
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,000
There is a record of her
entering the special zone...

258
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,500
However, there have
been no signs of her

259
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,750
at her assigned residence.

260
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,791
So then what does that mean
about the other students

261
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:25,875
who were sent
there with her?

262
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,375
We can't find them...

263
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,583
There are dozens of vampires
who were sent to the island,

264
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,125
but have since
gone missing.

265
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,416
As far as we know they're not
even in the special zone...

266
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,791
It's shocking to think

267
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,541
that somehow we've lost
vampires from the bund

268
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,291
without even knowing it...

269
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,875
Whoever is behind this had
a well-thought out plan.

270
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,125
Do you think that...
it's Telomere?

271
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,416
Possibly...

272
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,708
But they're too proud
to keep quiet for long.

273
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,875
If it was them,
they'll reveal themselves.

274
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,083
But Nanami doesn't
have a master now...

275
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,750
'cause Jean Marais's dead.

276
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,541
Well, if she isn't
roaming free...

277
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,625
then she may be serving
a new master now.

278
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,583
Do you think she
would do that?

279
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,750
At this point, I wouldn't
put anything past her.

280
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,958
She isn't heartless...

281
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,625
she's plagued with
worry and delusions

282
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,250
we cannot begin
to imagine...

283
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,083
someone may be using
that against her.

284
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,166
Delusions?

285
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,333
Do not worry...

286
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,208
For I will be Nanami
Shinonome's savior.

287
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,041
Yuki, I want you to wait
here and look after Yuzuru...

288
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,291
Let's go, Akira.

289
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,916
Yuzuru...

290
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,500
What do you want with him?

291
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,458
Is it your intention
to try and turn him?

292
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,916
Princess Mina...

293
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,583
It seems you've
abandoned your morals

294
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,750
since the last
time I saw you.

295
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,291
As per the blood pact,
thou shalt obey thy ruler...

296
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,208
Nanami Shinonome!

297
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,083
You must return to the vampire
bund with me this instant.

298
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,416
What's this...?

299
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,125
You refuse to
obey my order?

300
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,333
So someone else has
gotten to her...!

301
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,458
Akira!

302
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:03,958
Akira!

303
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm okay!

304
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,125
Damn you!

305
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,291
Princess...!
Heads up, Vera...!

306
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,958
It's an ambush,
I can smell it!

307
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,333
Nest One to Fang Leader...

308
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,250
Requesting backup.

309
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,000
Copy! Fang Leader out!

310
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,166
Where's the Princess?!

311
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,458
I'm right behind her!

312
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,041
Okay, I'm on my way!

313
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,250
Cease your
running, Nanami.

314
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,125
I will do whatever I must.

315
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,750
Please allow
me to save you.

316
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,541
Wow Princess,
you're so generous!

317
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,000
The ruler of all the
creatures of the night...

318
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,416
Feeling indebted to a
helpless young vampire

319
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,708
of the lowest
social order...

320
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,583
Disappointing,
to say the least.

321
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,125
Let me introduce myself...

322
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,375
You may call
me Hysterica...

323
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,625
A pleasure.

324
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,916
I take it you're Nanami's
new master, then...

325
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,333
'Hysterica' was it...?

326
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,625
What is your scheme,
gathering vampires like this?

327
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,333
Stay behind me, Princess.

328
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,458
So, you're the wolf boy
I've heard so much about...

329
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,041
A knight in furry armor.

330
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,416
I wonder if you
can handle...

331
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,791
fighting my entire army.

332
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,500
Hiko?!

333
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,541
Hear me now...!

334
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,208
Surely some
among you...

335
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,666
were never given a choice
in becoming vampires.

336
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,375
I'm giving you one now...

337
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,666
Come join me!

338
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,541
Do so and I swear to
nurture and protect you

339
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,416
to my utmost ability.

340
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,083
I had no idea that you
were such a fool, Princess!

341
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,416
And you call yourself
"ruler of the vampires"?!

342
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,708
The throne is mine by right
of the noble true-blood

343
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,125
that flows
within my veins...

344
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,291
But your true
nature is showing.

345
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,833
Watch what you say, or you
might give yourself away.

346
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,083
Destroy them!

347
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,583
We eight are the elite
Beowulf Soldiers...

348
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,666
We have been sent by
Sir Wolfgang Regendorf

349
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,416
to serve and protect our
beloved Princess Mina.

350
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,041
Give us your
orders, ma'am.

351
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,458
Leave Hysterica and
the girl unharmed.

352
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,166
As for the others,

353
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,416
you may return them all
to the dust of the earth!

354
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
-Right!
-Right!

355
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,833
Go now and prove thy
allegiance to me!

356
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,000
Show them your power,
Wolf Boys!

357
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,500
Draw your weapons!

358
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,458
As I'd expect from the
princess's guard dogs...

359
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,000
You guys mean business.

360
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,375
Die!

361
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,833
Now reveal your scheme
to me, Hysterica.

362
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,750
Nanami!

363
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,333
Stop being so
reckless, Princess!

364
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,333
Don't go, Nanami!

365
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,750
Are you so worried about
her that you'd ignore me...?

366
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,416
I will not be mocked!

367
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,458
Vera!

368
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,041
Allow me to handle her.

369
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,125
Very well.

370
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,750
Well, doesn't this bring
back some fond memories?

371
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,125
Hey, Veratos...!

372
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,500
When was the last time
we saw each other...

373
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,875
Nineteen Hundred?

374
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,333
No, I think it was
Nineteen-Eighteen in Paris,

375
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,791
Francesca.

376
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,916
I'm afraid she
doesn't exist anymore.

377
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,833
I go by "Hysterica"
these days.

378
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,416
So you've changed
your name again...?

379
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,166
Am I correct in assuming

380
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,083
you change masters with
the same reckless abandon?

381
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,000
I don't feel the need
to blindly worship

382
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,125
a single master like
you do, Veratos.

383
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,250
So what now...?

384
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,541
Are you serving
Telomere?

385
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,625
What's with the
ridiculous get-up?

386
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,041
You've fallen far since
the days of high society

387
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,958
when you were Veratos
the Black Ruby.

388
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,625
You're pathetic...

389
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,166
You should have come
with me back then...

390
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,500
You could've had everything
you ever wanted.

391
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,750
You still don't
get it, do you...?

392
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,958
I do not want for
anything now...

393
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,833
And the princess' trust
is all that I need.

394
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,458
Why do you insist
on being loyal

395
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,041
to that silly little girl?

396
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,291
She'll ruin everything

397
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,291
trying to turn the world
into her playground...

398
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,125
Her self-made reign
means nothing!

399
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,166
Enough! Do not disparage
my princess any further...

400
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,291
Or I will show no mercy!

401
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,166
I've been waiting
for this moment.

402
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,291
Let's finish what we
started ninety years ago!

403
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,416
Yuzuru... no...

404
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,125
Where did she go?!

405
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:27,791
What's wrong? Your mom
didn't come get ya?

406
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,166
She's absorbed in her
day-trading, like always...

407
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,458
How does she think you're
supposed to get home?

408
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,666
Come with me...
I'm kinda on my own, too.

409
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,166
I'll make us some food...

410
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,625
We can have
dinner together!

411
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,916
So are you as
lonely as I am?

412
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,666
No, I'm not lonely...

413
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,458
'Cause I have you, silly!

414
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,708
Nanami!

415
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,291
Don't go...! Don't
leave me, Nanami!

416
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,791
Please don't go!

417
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,791
Nanami... I take it
that you resent me.

418
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,208
Yes I do...

419
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,041
I resent you, but not
because of what you made me!

420
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,666
I don't care
about that...!

421
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,875
I tried to act like
it was nothing...

422
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,958
I tried so hard
to fight it!

423
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,125
You mean how you
feel about the boy?

424
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,708
Don't say it!

425
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,875
My god...

426
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,500
If Yuzuru ever found out

427
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,583
I had such shameful
feelings for him...

428
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,500
But... I'm obsessed...

429
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,291
I just can't help myself!

430
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,083
Even as we speak,
I want him so bad

431
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,625
it feels like my
heart is gonna burst!

432
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,375
Kill me...! Do it now!

433
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,708
Kill me before I'm
forced to defile him!

434
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,916
Nanami...

435
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,208
Do it...!

436
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,125
Kill me, before I make
him hate me...! Please!

437
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,500
Nanami!

438
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,708
Yuzuru!

439
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,333
Nanami!

440
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,583
No...! Don't look...!

441
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,208
Don't look at me like this!

442
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,208
Nanami!

443
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,958
Stay away from me!

444
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,375
She said stay
away little boy!

445
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,083
Yuzuru!

446
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,166
Please... stop!

447
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,541
Vera!

448
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,458
Princess... I apologize...

449
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,791
I underestimated her.

450
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,041
Just my luck,
I step away for a moment

451
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,250
and things finally
start to get interesting!

452
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,083
I think it's about time
for me to get going;

453
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,041
we've had enough fun
for one evening.

454
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,958
You'll find out about
my "scheme" soon enough.

455
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,458
Hysterica...! What
are you planning?!

456
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,583
A magnificent event...

457
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,916
to teach all the cowardly
humans a lesson...

458
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,458
about the true
terror of vampires...

459
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,583
Come back here!

460
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,333
Persistent little
wolf cub, aren't you?

461
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,291
Outta the way!

462
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,583
Take cover!

463
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,250
Princess!

464
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,708
I'm okay, Vera...

465
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,708
Akira was able
to protect me.

466
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,958
Self-destructions...

467
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,125
Damn you, Telomere...

468
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,625
As if stuffing yourselves
full of explosives

469
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,500
wasn't bad enough...

470
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,041
You had to come up
with something worse.

471
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:56,833
[Music]

472
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,000
Dance with the
Vampire Maids!

473
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,916
Part... um,
what are we on again?

474
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,333
Here's the creator
of the manga!

475
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,583
Hey! Thank you!

476
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,500
So why haven't we been
in the show much lately?

477
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,958
It's not my fault.

478
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,541
There's nothing for any
of you to do right now.

479
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,916
Whoa! Controversial remarks!

480
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,125
Don't blame me.

481
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,125
Mr. Yoshino handles
the series structure.

482
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,833
But... Aren't you the writer?!

483
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,291
What? Do you think
manga creators

484
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,125
have any control over
