1
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,500
'Scuse me?

2
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:31,875
Hey...

3
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,833
What's wrong?
Does your tummy hurt?

4
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,333
It is time.

5
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,750
Theirs was the story
of a promise...

6
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,666
A tale of the great
ruler of monsters

7
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,708
and the boy who
gave his all to her.

8
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,500
Looking back,

9
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,708
I can't help but think
that this was the day

10
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:13,666
everything started
to fall apart.

11
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,291
He's best known for destroying
the Byzantine Empire,

12
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,125
and despite resistance from the
lords of the Balkan Peninsula,

13
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,583
It's Dracula, right?!

14
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,125
Well, yes...

15
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,291
That's true.

16
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,916
So as you can see,

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,833
Vlad Tepes of Romania
is an example of...

18
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,083
Dude... He's real?!

19
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,750
So Dracula was
a true story?

20
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:31,916
Yeah, I thought
everybody knew that.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,791
That vampire princess
is named Tepes!

22
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,375
Everyone, please...
Calm down.

23
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,041
There's no
reason to worry.

24
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,000
The real Vlad Tepes
was different...

25
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,875
He was nothing
like Dracula...

26
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,166
Sister Laura?

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,625
Yes, Akira?

28
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,875
Sorry to interrupt...

29
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,083
but I really gotta pee.

30
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,208
Um, sure...

31
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,708
Please go ahead.

32
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,041
That was a good
one, dumbass.

33
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,625
Way to freak everyone out.

34
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,583
Vampires became the popular
topic of conversation

35
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,791
on campus...

36
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,916
I don't know why,

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,458
but every time the
subject came up

38
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,416
he seemed to get upset.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,333
Even at this point,
I still had no idea...

40
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,166
Of course, how
could I have known

41
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,666
when he had forgotten
what happened himself...

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,958
Damn it... Why?

43
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,208
Why do I feel so uneasy?

44
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:29,166
Their story began a
long, long time ago...

45
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,458
Long before I'd had the pleasure
of meeting Akira Kaburagi...

46
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,666
Before he lived
within my thoughts...

47
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,708
[Music]

48
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,791
The chief cabinet secretary's
announcement confirms

49
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,916
that self-proclaimed "ruler
of the vampires", Mina Tepes,

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,625
has legally purchased
Tokyo Landfill #0...

51
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:21,041
As a result, the government
is facing public scrutiny.

52
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,291
Whoa, they seriously
bought the whole thing?!

53
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,250
Those vampires
must be loaded!

54
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,333
Don't tell me you actually
believe in vampires.

55
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,833
I saw them myself on last
week's "Scales of Astrea".

56
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,416
That was the real deal!

57
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, if you
believe in vampires

58
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,750
then what about all the
other monsters, huh...?

59
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,291
Do you think
werewolves exist, too?

60
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,250
Yeah, and what
about Frankenstein?

61
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,875
Oh, hey Yuki.

62
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,833
I have a lunch
delivery for you.

63
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,833
Thanks.

64
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,458
Caught ya.

65
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,916
Did you see anything?

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,250
You saw.

67
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,291
No, I didn't.

68
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,250
You liar...!
I know you saw!

69
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,291
I swear I didn't
see anything, Yuki!

70
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,333
Okay, you got me...

71
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,541
I caught a quick glimpse;
sorry about that...

72
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,250
It wasn't a bad view if
it makes ya feel better.

73
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,666
Don't be creepy, Akira.

74
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,833
Geez, what do you
want me to say?!

75
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,250
I don't know...
I just figured that...

76
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,458
Maybe you'd be a little more
interested in what you saw...

77
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,791
What was that?
You say something?

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,208
Thanks a lot, Yuki.

79
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,916
It's nice to have
someone worry about me...

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Sorry I did that.

81
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,375
Sorry about that.

82
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,208
I know. I shouldn't have
left in the middle of class.

83
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,250
You idiot.

84
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,583
You had me worried.

85
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,833
Do you have a minute, Yuki...?

86
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,416
I have a few
questions for you

87
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,166
about the student council
financial report...

88
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,791
It'll only take
just a second.

89
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,666
Yeah, sure thing, Nanami.

90
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,750
Don't be such a wuss, man.

91
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,708
Ryohei, you think I
should have made a move?

92
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,000
She'd probably beat the crap
out of you if you tried.

93
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,375
I think you're right.

94
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,083
That Yuki is pretty
cute, though.

95
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,625
Yeah.

96
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,583
I don't get it, dude.

97
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,166
Why don't you try harder?

98
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,750
Try harder at what?

99
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,708
I don't know. Everything.

100
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,916
I don't know how
to explain it...

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,875
But I just feel like
things are fine

102
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,875
the way they are, you know?

103
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,500
I don't know what's
gotten into you lately...

104
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,583
You used to be so
much cooler before.

105
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,166
Well... I guess...

106
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,708
nothing you can do.

107
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,833
Sorry.

108
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,208
Dude! We've been looking
all over for you, Ryohei.

109
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,041
So you're a... member of the
student council, right...?

110
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,583
Do you think you could
do us a favor?

111
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,791
Let me guess, you want
the AV room again.

112
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,291
What for?

113
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,458
Princess Mina is gonna have
another press conference!

114
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,291
And we want to see
it on the big screen.

115
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,000
Man, you guys
are pathetic...

116
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,125
You really believe that
vampire crap...?

117
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,833
Go watch it at home 'cause
you're not seein' it here.

118
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,458
Would you talk some sense
into your friend here, Akira?

119
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,916
You wanna see Mina,
too, don't you?

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,666
Who's this Mina person?

121
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,458
How can you not
know who she is?

122
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,250
Yeah, the whole school's been
talking about her nonstop;

123
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,416
she's the ruler
of the vampires!

124
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,291
Oh yeah...

125
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,500
Quit playing dumb;

126
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,958
you know what
we're talking about.

127
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,166
You were interviewed on
that "Scales of Astrea" show!

128
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,083
Sorry but vampires just
don't interest me...

129
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,458
And I'm not really
big on TV or the news.

130
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,708
Hey, we're not done
talking to you!

131
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,833
I can't seem to get away
from all this vampire talk...

132
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,750
Why does it make
me feel like this?

133
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,208
Is there something
I can help you with?

134
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,500
-Hey, you!
-Stay away!

135
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,500
Akira?!

136
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,833
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

137
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,375
Yeah...

138
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,625
I'll be fine...

139
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,541
Sorry for worrying you.

140
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,833
It's okay but you gave me
a good scare this time.

141
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,708
I don't know
what happened...

142
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,333
It kinda scared me too.

143
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,083
That head injury you had
last year was pretty hardcore.

144
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,750
Maybe what happened
today is somehow related.

145
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,125
I think you need
to go to the doctor

146
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,416
and double check everything.

147
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,791
Just to be safe.

148
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,708
Alright, Dr. Yuki.

149
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,708
Cut it out; I'm serious...!

150
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,791
I want you to promise me
that you'll go to the doctor

151
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,250
and get yourself checked out.

152
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,250
I'm gonna go...

153
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,541
I just can't today.

154
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,875
So I need to
try harder, huh?

155
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,750
Truth number one:

156
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,666
I drink the blood
of human beings!

157
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,666
Truth two:

158
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,958
I'm dedicated to the karma
of the immortal!

159
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,166
Truth three:

160
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,458
I have been chosen
to govern...

161
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,000
The world of the dead!

162
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,208
Mina Tepes?

163
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,958
The one and only.

164
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,583
Are you... for real?

165
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,666
What do you mean by
that... dear sir...?

166
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,458
Are you asking me if I'm
really... a vampire?

167
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,916
Or are you asking me whether
or not I'm truly Mina Tepes?

168
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,875
I guess it doesn't
matter either way...

169
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,541
the answer is the same...

170
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,250
You see, I am the
ruler of the vam...

171
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,666
Hey, wait...!
Come back here!

172
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,458
Damn it...! I hate
these dumb clothes...!

173
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,041
I can't move at all!

174
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,916
Please do not assume that
I am always this helpless.

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,125
Why have you been
following me around?

176
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,375
And why were you
crying last time?

177
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,041
You don't remember...

178
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,333
You really have lost
all your memories.

179
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,041
Princess!

180
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,166
What the hell...?!

181
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,833
What do those bastards
think they're doing?

182
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,291
You saved me...

183
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,625
What's going on...?

184
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:09,875
Are they after you?

185
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,208
An attack?

186
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,625
Does that mean it's begun?

187
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,250
No, those aren't our men.

188
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,458
Must be somebody else.

189
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,083
Yeah...

190
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,833
I'm sure that
many of our kind

191
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,708
have been waiting for an
opportunity like this.

192
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,916
May I have your attention:

193
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,083
due to unforeseen
circumstances,

194
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,916
service has temporarily
been halted.

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,875
We apologize for
the inconvenience.

196
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,958
Who are those guys
who're after you?

197
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,500
It's hard to say...

198
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,416
There are many who would
love to see me dead...

199
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,875
Both human and
nonhuman alike.

200
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,500
And they just attack you
out of nowhere like that?!

201
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,083
You start to get used
to it after a while...

202
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,750
They'll try just
about anything

203
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,666
because they know it's
not easy to kill me.

204
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,250
Well, that is
until now anyway.

205
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,125
I'm afraid my shade gel
is beginning to wear off.

206
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,125
What the hell
is shade gel?

207
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,916
It's a drug that when
applied topically

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,916
can prevent our cells from
being destroyed by sunlight...

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,041
I have about
a minute left.

210
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,708
What happens when
your time's up?

211
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,125
The sunlight will
turn me into ash.

212
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,500
How can you be so
flippant about it?!

213
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,916
Whatever shall I do?

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,750
This is quite
a predicament.

215
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,166
I have shade gel with me,

216
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,000
but I cannot put
it on myself.

217
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,416
Damn it.

218
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,541
How did I get
dragged into this?

219
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,083
What do you mean?

220
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,750
I don't get why I
have to help you...

221
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,458
I mean, don't you
have servants?

222
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,750
Hurry up. This dress isn't
going to come off by itself.

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,083
I may have the
body of a child...

224
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,666
But don't worry, I'm actually
hundreds of years old.

225
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,166
So there's no reason for me to
feel weird about this, right?

226
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,791
So not true...

227
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,750
Still creepy.

228
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,458
Just hurry and put it on...

229
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,416
I can't do it by myself.

230
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,375
You want me to
put it on you?

231
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,416
No way.

232
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,458
Is that a problem...?

233
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,625
I told you, I may
look like a child

234
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,041
but I'm much
older than you.

235
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,458
I know... But it's
still freakin' creepy!

236
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,833
So, uh... Tell me...

237
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you always have people
trying to kill you like that?

238
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,500
Unfortunately, yes.

239
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,666
Then why were you walking
around in broad daylight

240
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,833
without a bodyguard?

241
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,458
That seems pretty careless.

242
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,458
It was your pinky...

243
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,166
It called out to me.

244
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,625
That's why I
risked it all...

245
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,958
to come and find you...

246
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:13,791
but it seems...

247
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,750
I was wrong in doing so.

248
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:21,875
Who's there?!

249
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,541
It's the police!

250
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,166
There was a terrorist
bombing down the street...

251
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,250
We are looking for
possible witnesses...

252
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,333
Do you mind if we ask
you a few questions?

253
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,291
Liar!

254
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,833
Impressive talent,
young man...

255
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,208
Tell me: How did you
know they were assassins?

256
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,708
It sounds weird but...

257
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,833
I could smell it.

258
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,166
My... What do
we have here...?

259
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,708
Now I'm being
attacked by humans...?

260
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,875
Well... Do you want to tell
me who you work for...?

261
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,666
Or shall I just force you to
talk with a bite on the neck?

262
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,291
Behold!

263
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,708
This is the power
of the vampire.

264
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,500
This is who we truly are.

265
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,083
I swear I saw
Akira back there...

266
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,583
I'll be safe once I
make it to the bund...

267
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,166
Thank you very much...

268
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,625
You saved my life.

269
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,166
Honestly...

270
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,416
I still can't believe
you're really a vampire.

271
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,958
I don't know why after
everything you've seen today.

272
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,541
Let me ask you something,

273
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,625
why did you suddenly
reveal yourself

274
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,500
and announce you
were building a bund?

275
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,916
This is my way of
preparing for battle...

276
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,708
Now let me ask
you something...

277
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,750
Do you feel happy...?

278
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,125
The way you are now?

279
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:22,916
It's tough to say
since I've lost my memory.

280
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,583
I was in an
accident last year

281
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,625
and I woke up with amnesia...

282
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,000
Isn't that crazy?

283
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,458
16 years gone in
the blink of an eye.

284
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,625
But...

285
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,166
I have friends
that stuck by me,

286
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,416
even though I couldn't
remember them...

287
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,083
And a sweet girl who's
always worried about me...

288
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,250
So I guess...

289
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,375
I'm happy.

290
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,041
I must be going.

291
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,416
Until we meet again...

292
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,375
Akira...

293
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,958
The reason I was crying

294
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,000
was because I was
so happy to see you.

295
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,916
I don't get it;
how do you know my name?

296
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,500
I've been expecting
you, Princess.

297
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,375
Someone very important
would like to meet with you...

298
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,625
So I have been sent as
your personal guide.

299
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,875
Is that so...?

300
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,291
Where will you take me?

301
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,041
To our organization.

302
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,250
Oh... So I have
another enemy?

303
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,625
Why you, hey...!

304
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,708
Stay back...!

305
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,916
This is the realm
of the night!

306
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,458
As one who lives
in the daylight,

307
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,416
you have no business
getting involved!

308
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,250
Princess!

309
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,541
You're coming with me!

310
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,708
Let go!

311
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,833
You won't get
away from me.

312
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,916
Who are you...?

313
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,333
Which clan are you from?

314
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,583
Damn it!

315
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,291
She warned you not
to get involved!

316
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,625
Stop it...!

317
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,416
He has nothing
to do with this!

318
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,416
Are you crying?

319
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,458
Is he really that
important to you?

320
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,791
You're not talking, huh...?

321
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:46,833
Fine then.

322
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,708
Akira!

323
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,125
Why do you cry for me?

324
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,458
Why are you crying?

325
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,916
Does your tummy hurt?

326
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,791
Princess...

327
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,625
There's no
reason to cry...

328
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,500
I'll always be
by your side...

329
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,041
I promise that
I'll protect you.

330
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,958
I'll always be
there for you.

331
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,916
I promise...

332
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,791
Princess...

333
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,833
Don't cry...

334
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,458
Please.

335
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,166
Akira!

336
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:29,791
What a landing...

337
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,416
That was the end of him.

338
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,625
What the hell...

339
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,666
He can't be...

340
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,458
This is...

341
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,083
my true form.

342
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,083
He's a member of
the Earth clan!

343
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,958
Oh, Akira!

344
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,250
Theirs was the story
of a promise...

345
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,791
Akira...!

346
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,250
A tale of the great
ruler of monsters

347
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,333
and the boy who gave
his all to her...

348
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:46,208
It was a tale of
loyalty and devotion...

349
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,291
and the fleeting love
that they shared.

350
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:57,083
[Music]

351
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,958
Dance with the vampire maids!

352
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,375
Part 2!

353
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,958
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

354
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,666
How dare you put
your grubby hands

355
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,250
on our princess,
you pervert...!

356
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,041
For that you must die!

357
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,625
This might sting
a little at first,

358
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,958
but it'll be over quickly.

359
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,250
I'm not some perv

360
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,250
who's attracted to
flat-chested preteens!

361
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,958
Who are you calling
flat-chested, Akira?

362
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,500
Who wants to watch
me fillet a werewolf?

363
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,583
I do!

364
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,708
Don't worry. I'll
try to make it fast!
