1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,916
It happened on what seemed
like an ordinary day,

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,291
on a quiet,
residential street...

3
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,041
Well, I better get going.

4
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,375
'Kay... See ya!

5
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,291
I wanna suck your blood.

6
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:51,750
At first I
was totally like,

7
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,125
"cut it out, creep!"

8
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,083
That's when the guy
jumped out and grabbed me.

9
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,125
I thought, "Oh crap!

10
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,833
He must be a molester!"

11
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,958
There have been all these
unexplained deaths lately-

12
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,208
maybe it was him.

13
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,333
Then all of a sudden I
was bitten by something.

14
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,375
I didn't even have
time to defend myself.

15
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,416
I guess I must've
passed out after that...

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,166
All I know is that
when I woke up,

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,083
everything around me had
been completely torn up!

18
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,416
Would you mind showing
us the bite marks, miss?

19
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,416
Luckily for Ms. A,

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,708
these were the only
injuries she received.

21
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,791
Unfortunately, these
types of assaults

22
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,208
have been on
the rise lately.

23
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,208
In fact, the city has
seen seven murders

24
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,833
in the last three months.

25
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,541
The victims,
all young women,

26
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,583
were left with puncture
marks on their necks

27
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,125
that look very similar
to those of Ms. A.

28
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,583
This startling information

29
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,458
has fueled a rumor
about the attacker

30
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,083
that has forced
the people of Japan

31
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,791
to ask themselves...

32
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,083
Could these brutal attacks

33
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,375
have been the
work of a vampire?

34
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,625
Would a vampire be
able to go undetected

35
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,375
in modern day Japan?

36
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,000
Is it possible that the
attacks in Suginami

37
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,500
are the work of a creature

38
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,583
that, until now, has thrived
only in novels and movies?!

39
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,375
We'll find out when
the facts are weighed

40
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,750
by the scales
of the goddess.

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,708
Our question tonight:

42
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,666
Do vampires really exist?

43
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,541
Let's put it
in the balance!

44
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,291
And the judgment is...

45
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,916
False! Vampires do not exist!

46
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,875
Welcome, everyone, to
the Scales of Astrea...

47
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,125
You know the drill...

48
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,000
Here we weigh the facts
and find the truth!

49
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,041
We break down mysteries and
legends live from our studio!

50
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,166
After the suspicious
attacks in Suginami

51
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,375
we decided that tonight's
debate should be...

52
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,791
Whether or not vampires
really exist...

53
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,875
I can't wait to see
the final judgment!

54
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,958
Well, our first
judgment was false...

55
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,250
But as you know
that could change

56
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,083
over the course of the show.

57
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,416
Okay... How about we check in
with our panel of judges...?

58
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,125
We've got an eclectic
bunch tonight....

59
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,541
That's true...

60
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,833
Our first guest... is a
world-renowned historian...

61
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,750
Professor Isao Ebikawa!

62
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,125
Tell us what you think.

63
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,583
Vampires do not exist...

64
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,875
but... if you
can prove me wrong

65
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,083
then I would certainly
love to meet one of them.

66
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,916
Our next guest is a
famous comedienne...

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,500
Her film, "Go Home,
Forty-Something",

68
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,750
is in theaters now...

69
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:23,916
Ms Hiroe Ubayama.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,166
Hi, everybody...!
I'm thrilled to be here!

71
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,000
So you don't think
they exist either?

72
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,875
I hope not!
They're so scary!

73
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,625
I mean, I can handle
ghosts and goblins,

74
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,000
but the vampires really
scare the crap outta me...

75
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,125
I'm anemic... I need
all the blood I've got.

76
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,500
Our next judge is
a real beauty...

77
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,041
And many of you may
recognize her as Miss July...

78
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,375
Please welcome, Yumi!

79
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,750
This is awesome...!

80
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,083
I totally love vampire
movies and manga and stuff!

81
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,916
So is that why
you voted 'true'?

82
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,333
Dracula and the
other vamps...

83
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,083
They're all just
so freakin' sexy!

84
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,458
Well, I've got a treat for
you vampire manga lovers...!

85
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,833
Sitting next
to you is the...

86
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,083
I know! I love Bloody Waltz!

87
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,333
And I'm so excited to meet
the man who's behind it.

88
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,833
He's a famous
manga artist...

89
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,708
who's best known for his
Bloody Waltz manga series...

90
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,750
Let's hear it for
Nozomu Tamaki!

91
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,333
In my opinion,
they don't exist...

92
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,583
Vampires are fiction...

93
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,333
That's why I write
manga about them.

94
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,041
Aw... man.

95
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,291
Well, we do have
another judge

96
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,666
who voted with you, Yumi...

97
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,416
You got it...! He believes
vampires really do exist.

98
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,666
I'll give you an
eternal kiss...

99
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,875
my love.

100
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,750
The ladies are excited
about our next guest...!

101
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,416
In the new
Bloody Waltz film...

102
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,916
He plays Ryo Hibuse...

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,041
the sexy vampire prince.

104
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,416
Give a warm welcome
to Seiichi Hirai.

105
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,708
I'm afraid I have to
disagree with Mr. Tamaki...

106
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,375
Playing a vampire has
lead me to believe

107
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,166
it's possible that
they could exist...

108
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,500
A vampire...

109
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,500
is the embodiment
of darkness.

110
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,875
Oh wow...! He's so hot!

111
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,416
Come and get it, baby!

112
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,833
So far...

113
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,583
The Scales of Astrea
have weighed in 3 to 2...

114
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,958
What'll be the
final verdict?

115
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,875
We've got compelling
evidence for both sides...

116
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,500
and exciting guests
who'll weigh in!

117
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,666
Oh, now I'm intrigued.

118
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,708
You should be...

119
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,333
Today's show is
going to be great!

120
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,333
Well, I can't wait to
see how it turns out.

121
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,583
Be sure to stay with us...

122
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,125
I'm your host for
the evening...

123
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,208
Yukinobu Tokita.

124
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,416
And I'm...
Mr. Tokita's co-host...

125
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,583
My name... is Akane Sasanuma.

126
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,291
All right then...

127
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,500
For the final judgment,

128
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,750
we'll have everyone weigh in;

129
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,791
our panel of judges,
our studio audience,

130
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,708
the viewers at home and even
the people on the street!

131
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,208
Nella's at Shibuya Station.

132
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,666
You there, Nella?

133
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,750
Yes, sir!

134
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,416
Everyone watching
us in Shibuya

135
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,625
is going to have a chance
to cast their vote as well.

136
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,041
Those votes will
then be tallied

137
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,250
and will become part
of our final verdict.

138
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,666
What will the goddess say...?

139
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,958
Do vampires exist,
or are they fiction...?

140
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,250
Let's put it in the balance!

141
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,291
This program is
brought to you by

142
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,000
Lorenzo Chemical Industries:

143
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,916
striving for a
better tomorrow...

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,083
And Wolf Pack
Total Security...

145
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,500
Also, the new
"Bloody Waltz" movie,

146
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,083
in theaters now.

147
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,041
I guess it's time to
get the ball rolling...

148
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,458
Let's bring out our first
proposer of the evening!

149
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,083
My name is Nero Tanaka...

150
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,583
Thank you for having me.

151
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,041
I was just wondering...

152
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,375
Would you all
mind telling me

153
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,666
what you know
about vampires?

154
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,875
Ooh, me! They suck blood!

155
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:35,875
Yes, that's true.

156
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:36,875
Anyone else?

157
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,750
Me! Me! I've got one!

158
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,666
Um... They are weak against
crosses and garlic!

159
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,250
It's fascinating
that vampires have

160
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,333
such an extensive
list of weaknesses.

161
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,833
There're just so many...

162
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,375
They can't come in contact
with water or sunlight...

163
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,583
They can't cast a shadow

164
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,750
and they don't
have reflections.

165
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,750
It's amazing we find
them frightening at all.

166
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,708
But that vulnerability
is why women love them.

167
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,458
Now tell me Mr. Tamaki...

168
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,208
How do you handle
these flaws?

169
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,875
I don't want my
characters to seem weak,

170
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,375
so I throw most of them out...

171
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,666
I have kept the sunlight turning
them into ash bit, though.

172
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,541
I don't know if
you're aware...

173
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,458
But documented
vampire-related assaults

174
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,708
are happening at an increasing
rate throughout the world...

175
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,666
These attacks have been
happening everywhere lately!

176
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,208
Oh no! Don't tell me that...!

177
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,958
I'm gonna have to start buying
stock in iron pills now!

178
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm so sorry!

179
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,125
I didn't mean to
scare anyone...

180
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,500
But while incidents like
the Suginami cases are rare-

181
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,833
they seem to be happening
more frequently now...

182
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,500
We have been seeing more and
more witnesses come forward.

183
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,541
It's probably because
of the bad economy.

184
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,541
You think?

185
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,958
He's right...
There's a theory

186
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,250
that vampires are popular
in bad economic times,

187
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,416
while Frankenstein is
popular in good times.

188
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,333
Huh, but I thought Japan's
economy wasn't hit as hard...

189
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,708
Yeah, we're okay...

190
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,833
But even so... last
year's "dollar crisis"...

191
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,333
sent the global economy
into a tail spin,

192
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,291
and we have yet to work
our way out of it.

193
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,708
When people
feel downtrodden

194
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,666
they start to look outside
the box for anything

195
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,458
that'll make their
lives more exciting.

196
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,125
Change your mind, Yumi?

197
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, Professor Ebikawa
is, like, way smart.

198
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,166
For example, this bizarre
Suginami attacks

199
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,208
have caused all this hype in
the media... That means...

200
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,041
What does that have to
do with the economy?

201
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,000
A failing economy tends to
leave people wanting more:

202
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,041
whether it's in their careers,
their home lives,

203
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,208
or what have you.

204
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,583
Vampires offer people

205
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,041
this mysterious, exciting,
and enticing world...

206
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,375
It's the break
from reality

207
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,625
they so desperately need.

208
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,833
I see...

209
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,666
It's so enticing that
some find themselves

210
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,208
at the point of obsession...

211
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,041
The attacks were likely
caused by someone

212
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,458
who's acting out
something they've read

213
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,375
in their favorite manga

214
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,583
or that they saw
in an anime...

215
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,708
They're escaping into
a world of fiction

216
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,958
rather than living in our
world of harsh reality.

217
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,625
They've lost their
minds, completely...

218
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,750
Of course, that's
just my opinion.

219
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,208
I really don't think
it's fair for you

220
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,708
to blame the attacks on
manga and anime, Professor.

221
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,333
I'm not blaming
anime and manga

222
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,000
any more than I would
blame any other form

223
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,833
of popular culture
involving vampires...

224
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,208
Let's be realistic,
even if they did exist...

225
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,833
they simply have
too many weaknesses

226
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,291
to survive in our world.

227
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,958
Well... It looks like our debate
is starting to get heated...

228
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,791
Why don't we hear what the
members of our audience

229
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,166
have to say on
the subject...

230
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,500
Who've you got
there, Akane?

231
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,250
Are you awake,
little girl?

232
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,875
It's pretty late
for you to be up.

233
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,416
You must be sleepy, huh?

234
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,250
I'm just bored 'cause
I don't know much about

235
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,625
pop culture here.

236
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,666
And why is that...?

237
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,375
Are you from
another country?

238
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,750
I'm from Romania.

239
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,375
You're from the
land of vampires...

240
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,208
So, tell me...
How do you feel about them;

241
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,083
do you think they exist?

242
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,541
Would you tell us why?

243
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,250
I'm sorry... but can I ask you
about something first...?

244
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,333
Have you ever met
a vampire before?

245
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,458
I've never met one,

246
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,708
but I'd assume
they're very much like

247
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,416
what you read
about in books.

248
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,916
But I don't understand...

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,875
I thought those were
just made-up stories...

250
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,708
You really think those ladies
were attacked by... vampires?

251
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:49,791
I'm not sure...

252
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,041
Then how can you
say without a doubt

253
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,208
that they don't exist...?

254
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,833
Obviously, you still
have a suspicion

255
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,625
that the attacker could
have been a vampire...

256
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,708
-Am I right?
-Um, well...

257
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,916
She has a point and being
that she's from Romania

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,125
she's probably more
knowledgeable on the subject.

259
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,041
But this debate
isn't over yet!

260
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,333
We've got
compelling evidence

261
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,208
that could change your vote!

262
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,958
As mentioned, the young
lady we're calling Ms. A

263
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,833
was the latest victim of
the Suginami attacks...

264
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,125
She claims that when she
regained consciousness

265
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,166
after the attack,

266
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,833
everything had been destroyed.

267
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,625
We scoured the
area for witnesses,

268
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,791
but to no avail...

269
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,958
until we received a
mysterious call...

270
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,625
You know somethin'
about the attacks?

271
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,208
Yes, it was one
of our agents

272
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,208
who stepped in and
saved the girl's life...

273
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,000
Unfortunately, we were unable
to apprehend the suspect.

274
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,541
However, I promise
when we do,

275
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,791
we'll take care
of the matter.

276
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,875
But I don't understand...

277
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,125
why did you get involved?

278
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,166
We were ordered to do
so by the princess...

279
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,500
She's been deeply troubled

280
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,708
by this rogue vampire's
antics for some time now.

281
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,666
So she gave out an
order for his capture.

282
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,708
The "princess"?

283
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,708
Yes, the ruler of
the vampire race.

284
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,083
Part of the
"true blood" lineage

285
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,000
that has existed
for centuries.

286
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,208
And then we were
contacted by a woman

287
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,166
claiming to serve the
ruler of all vampires...!

288
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,750
Sensing our skepticism,

289
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,083
she asked us to meet with
her at a secret location.

290
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,541
Hello and welcome...

291
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,583
to the princess's mansion.

292
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,666
Now let's bring out our
very special guest...

293
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,125
Welcome Ms. Veratos!

294
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,791
This is impossible...

295
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,083
I don't believe it...

296
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,208
That's a great set of titties.

297
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,083
She's definitely
got me beat.

298
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,875
Professor Ebikawa...

299
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,708
It looks like you have
something you'd like to say.

300
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,916
Not really...

301
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,666
I simply find this
very hard to believe...

302
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,625
Servant of the "ruler
of the vampires"...?

303
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,541
I mean... it's laughable.

304
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,958
You may be a
great actress,

305
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,125
but it'll take more
than that to sway me.

306
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,875
I'm sure I'll be able
to convince you all.

307
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,875
I dunno...

308
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,958
Cause I'm not buying it.

309
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,000
I understand that
"seeing is believing"...

310
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,791
So I've brought along
some evidence...

311
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,875
I have no doubt it will sway
your judgment in my favor.

312
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,750
Yes...! Wait until
you see it...!

313
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,375
The lovely Ms. eratos...

314
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,000
is about to
blow your mind!

315
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,583
This significant
piece of evidence

316
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,208
was recovered at the scene of
Ms. A's attack in Suginami...

317
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,000
It's the vampire's arm!

318
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,875
Ms. Veratos...

319
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,166
You said this was
actual evidence

320
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,166
from the scene of the crime?

321
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,416
That's correct...

322
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,000
The severed arm
of the vampire...

323
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,208
who was foolish enough to
attack Ms. A in broad daylight.

324
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,125
Why does it look frozen?

325
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,458
That's because it's been
encased in a special polymer

326
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,666
that will prevent
it from decaying

327
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,916
or breaking down
in direct sunlight.

328
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,791
Made by... our sponsor,
Lorenzo Pharmaceuticals.

329
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,500
Yes, sir... I was told that
the cellular tissue inside

330
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,333
is still alive.

331
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,541
That's so gross!

332
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,833
This is bullshit...

333
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,583
Have you done any
biochemical testing...?

334
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,125
What does the DNA say?

335
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,375
If you expect
me to believe

336
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,375
that this is actually
the arm of a vampire,

337
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,333
then I need to see some
sort of scientific proof.

338
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,541
Let me ask you something,
Professor Ebikawa...

339
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,041
You seem utterly determined

340
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,041
to disprove the
existence of vampires...

341
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,625
-Are you frightened by us?
-Absolutely not!

342
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,916
Good. I'm glad...

343
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,375
There's no reason
to fear us-

344
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,791
we're not going
to harm you...

345
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,083
We're discerning predators-

346
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,208
we don't attack
unless agitated.

347
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,708
Let's say that is the
severed arm of a vampire...

348
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,125
What the hell are you doing
showing it off in public?

349
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,791
If it was real, surely
you'd want to keep it hidden.

350
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,666
That's not
necessarily true.

351
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,041
Did you have some
input, little girl?

352
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,500
Ms. Veratos said one of her
mistress's agents failed

353
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,666
to apprehend and kill
the monster, right?

354
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,791
And we know the arm
is still alive...

355
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,083
What's your point?

356
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,500
It's kind of like that
old Japanese folk tale.

357
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,583
You know, the one where
the ogre loses his arm

358
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,333
and then he comes
back for it later.

359
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,833
The Ogre of Rashomon...?

360
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,416
But I don't get
the connection.

361
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,958
Maybe... the ruler
of the vampires

362
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,250
thought that if the arm was
presented on television...

363
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,041
its owner would come out
of hiding to repossess it...

364
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,708
Get it?!

365
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,750
Well, things are certainly
getting intense here

366
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,291
in the studio...

367
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,041
Let's hear what our viewers in
Shibuya Station have to say.

368
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,791
-Take it away, Nella!
-Right...!

369
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,041
Excuse me, may I
ask you a question?

370
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,125
No, it can't be...

371
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,083
I'm sorry...
Did you want something?

372
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,916
You okay, Nella?

373
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,375
Yeah, I'm good...!

374
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,000
So, uh, do you think it's
possible that vampires exist?

375
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,541
What...? That's a
stupid question...

376
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,000
No, they don't exist.

377
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,166
Sorry to burst your
bubble, little girl,

378
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,875
but there aren't many
believers out there...

379
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,208
So is that it...?

380
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,000
I assume we've reached
our verdict, am I right?

381
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,166
Not just yet...

382
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,916
I won't give up that
easily, Professor...

383
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,375
I can prove
the arm is real

384
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,458
by subjecting it
to direct sunlight.

385
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,875
As soon as the light
hits it, it'll turn...

386
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,041
This is ridiculous!

387
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,875
There's no direct
sunlight in the studio...

388
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,958
You can just drop your
little act, okay...?

389
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,625
It's obvious that you ladies
are actors hired on by the show!

390
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,708
How sad...

391
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,125
I thought you'd
be convinced ...

392
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,208
I swear I've been
completely honest with you

393
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,375
this entire time.

394
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,083
Is that so...?

395
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,458
And you really
expect us to believe

396
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,750
that you work for
the ruler of vampires?

397
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,791
You're a good
actress and all

398
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,250
but I can see
through that lie.

399
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,583
I'm sorry but I don't
believe a word of it...

400
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,708
So I'm changing
my vote right now.

401
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,458
Looks like you've lost
the argument, ladies...

402
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,375
Vampires are nothing
more than fiction...

403
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,083
They simply do not exist...

404
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,250
They're no different than
Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy.

405
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,291
I don't blame you for
not believing me...

406
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,750
We've remained
secretive...

407
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,583
For centuries, we've
hidden in the background

408
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,083
of mankind's history.

409
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,750
Over the years, we've purposely
leaked false information

410
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,000
about our race...

411
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,041
hoping to further
fictionalize our existence.

412
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,500
Meanwhile, we've been
working behind the scenes;

413
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,541
manipulating your wars,
your economies

414
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,541
and even your religions.

415
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,791
If that's true...

416
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,500
then why would you reveal
yourselves here...?

417
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,541
I'd think you'd want a better
outlet than a crappy TV show.

418
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,375
Oh, it wasn't our plan

419
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,791
to reveal ourselves
to you at this time...

420
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,208
That is, until this renegade
vampire went on a rampage.

421
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,625
We knew we had to stop
him at any cost...

422
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,958
Even if it meant revealing
ourselves to you.

423
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,875
The royal family forbids
that vampires kill recklessly

424
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,333
or feed upon the innocent.

425
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,500
Only a lowlife would
disobey that order

426
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,416
and be so shamefully
indiscreet about it.

427
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,916
So you have your
own society,

428
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,250
including a ruling family?

429
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,375
That's correct...

430
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,041
Those of royal blood
are our leaders...

431
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,958
and the three clans
and their bloodlines

432
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,416
follow closely behind.

433
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,708
Blood relation
grows thinner

434
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,833
as you go farther
down the bloodline...

435
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,416
As a result,
lower-ranking vampires

436
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,416
are required to obey
the higher-ranked.

437
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,958
That is the law
of the vampire.

438
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,541
It's what holds our
society together.

439
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,750
We are attempting to lure
out the lowest of the low...

440
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,833
One I hesitate to
call a true vampire...

441
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,250
He's a low-ranking traitor

442
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,708
who obviously has no
pride in his race.

443
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,458
Despicable, don't
you think...?

444
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,708
Mr. Movie Vampire?

445
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,041
Well, I, uh...

446
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,875
Surely you have
an opinion...?

447
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,125
The owner of this arm
must be a lowlife...

448
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,750
to kill against order.

449
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,666
Shut up, you bitch...!

450
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,041
I've heard...
enough from you!

451
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,166
May I ask you a question,
Mr. Manga Artist?

452
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,625
On which hand does the
character of Ryo Hibuse

453
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,833
wear a glove
in your manga?

454
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,208
On his left hand,
of cour...

455
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,208
Fine! It's me...!

456
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,041
I am the noble king
of the night!

457
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,750
I refuse to obey...!

458
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,875
I make my own rules!

459
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,416
I was hoping we'd
be reunited...

460
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,583
I've missed you.

461
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,250
You're a vampire?

462
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,416
What?!

463
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,333
Let me give you
an eternal kiss...

464
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,791
my love.

465
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,333
She's so delicious!

466
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,875
No... you've gotta
be kidding...

467
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,625
Vampires really do exist?!

468
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,541
How dare you call
me a lowlife...!

469
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,750
Die!

470
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,416
Nelly! Nero!

471
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,625
Beowulfs!

472
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,500
Damn you all!

473
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:49,958
What the hell?!

474
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,500
Why are you still filming?!

475
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,416
We can't miss this!
It's ratings gold...!

476
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,625
Go after him with
portable camera #4!

477
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,166
Yukinobu, go with him!

478
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,291
You, up there!
After him!

479
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,541
What do you think
you're doing?!

480
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,291
Stop this broadcast
immediately!

481
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,250
-Don't worry about them, Vera.
-But Princess...

482
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,000
The situation has escalated
beyond what we expected.

483
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,916
We'll simply
accelerate our plans.

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,250
Are you sure?

485
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,666
-Where's the portable camera?
-On the roof, sir!

486
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,250
Get us connected!

487
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,375
We're coming to you live from
the roof of the TVC building!

488
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,583
This is unbelievable!

489
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,333
Vampires really do exist!

490
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,833
They're right here
in front of us!

491
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,583
The agent I sent failed
to fulfill his duty...

492
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,875
You were to be killed
for your disobedience...

493
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,458
This time... I will do it.

494
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,500
Not just yet, Wolf.

495
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,208
Princess!

496
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,791
I will handle the traitor.

497
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,041
-Is that understood?
-Yes, ma'am.

498
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,125
You can tell me what's
happened to Akira afterwards.

499
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,375
Yes, ma'am.

500
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,916
Well, I knew the prospect of
appearing on a television show

501
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,166
would lure you
out of hiding...

502
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,500
However, I didn't expect
you to be quite so bold.

503
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,708
It seems this world is
full of surprises...

504
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,333
Wouldn't you agree
with me...?

505
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,000
You scum.

506
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,750
I find your true
form hideous...

507
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,041
I'm not surprised;

508
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,291
our true forms are but a
reflection of our hearts.

509
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,166
So this is the embodiment
of what a black heart

510
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,416
and an arrogant ego
looks like...

511
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,750
How unfortunate.

512
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,583
Shut up!

513
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,625
What in the hell...

514
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,833
How were you
able to stop me?!

515
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,083
My name is Mina Tepes.

516
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,750
Blood descendant
of Vlad Tepes,

517
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,291
known as Vlad the Impaler.

518
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,750
I am the ruler of
the vampire race.

519
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,625
You have brought
shame to our people...

520
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,041
For that you must die.

521
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,375
I beg you...

522
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,375
spare me...

523
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,625
please!

524
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,208
I have a message for
all of you humans...

525
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,875
Remember what
you've seen today...

526
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,208
This is the power
of the vampire race.

527
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,416
Excuse me, miss...

528
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Are you really the
ruler of the vampires?

529
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,916
You dare to doubt me...?

530
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,916
Oh, dear...
Must I... suck your blood?

531
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,541
Our bloodlines are
tied to the darkness...

532
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,958
For centuries we
have hidden...

533
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,708
in the dark of night, in the
shadows of human history.

534
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,958
That is... until
today, anyway.

535
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,166
W-why reveal yourself now?

536
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,416
That bund over there...

537
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,625
Tokyo Landfill #0...

538
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,208
That place... will become
something special.

539
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,875
On that land
I will establish

540
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,333
the kingdom of
the vampire race.

541
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,916
It will be known
hence as...

542
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,541
The vampire bund.

543
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,958
Now then...

544
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,458
come dance with me.

545
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:57,125
[Music]

546
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,291
Dance with the vampire maids!

547
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,416
Part one!

548
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,083
There he is! The
target's been located!

549
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,833
-Nero, you take the right!
-Okay!

550
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,875
And Nella, you
attack from the left!

551
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:34,750
Got it!

552
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,416
I saw you on that
"Scales of Astrea" show!

553
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,750
Why're you attacking me?!

554
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,125
Sorry, but we can't
allow you to be here.

555
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,375
What? But why not?

556
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,875
Gotcha! You can do it, Nelly!

557
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,041
One good hit
to the noggin'

558
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,041
and we'll make you
lose your memory!

559
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,625
Yeah, and knock
me unconscious!
