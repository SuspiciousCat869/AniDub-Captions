1
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,458
Here she comes.

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,958
Everybody, run!

3
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,583
Holy crap...!

4
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,041
That chick's insane.

5
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,791
Where'd you come from?

6
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,500
At the request of the
three noble lords...

7
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,708
And as required by the ancient
pact of the royal family...

8
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,916
I have been sent to
perform a purity inquiry.

9
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,250
Hold it right there!

10
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:37,625
The next inquiry isn't
for another 3 years...

11
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,333
Why are you doing this?

12
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,583
It's okay... Vera...

13
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,208
I had a suspicion...

14
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,666
I knew these scoundrels would
try something like this.

15
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,166
You may proceed.

16
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:57,916
[Music]

17
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,500
So you're telling
me everything

18
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,208
those guys from
the Three Clans

19
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,083
were saying about being
her future husband...

20
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,458
I'm afraid it's all true.

21
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,166
The princess is obligated

22
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,250
to marry and bear the
child of one of those men

23
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,875
in order to preserve the
royal family's blood line.

24
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,458
Aw, come on, kid...

25
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,708
You didn't seriously think

26
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,625
you were gonna be with
her forever, did you?

27
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,833
I just figured...

28
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:49,875
Are you kidding me?

29
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not gonna happen...

30
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,291
You and the princess come
from two different worlds.

31
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,666
Your time together's
almost up.

32
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,250
Do you know what she's
doing right now?

33
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,250
She's fighting back the
only way she can...

34
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,333
It's probably
happening as we speak.

35
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,458
A purity inquiry!

36
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,041
That's correct...

37
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,625
It's a physical
exam to determine

38
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,666
whether or not her
body is pure enough

39
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,291
to be the royal mother.

40
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,583
How could they do that!

41
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,083
It's an inquiry
in name only.

42
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,541
In reality, it's a
display of power.

43
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,958
What they're doing is

44
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:32,125
essentially reminding the
princess of who's in charge.

45
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,666
That her body belongs
to the Three Clans.

46
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,833
It's the Stigma spray...

47
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll put the top up.

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,333
I don't understand...

49
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,583
What reason do they have

50
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,416
for making the princess
go through all this?

51
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,666
Are you sure that
you wanna know?

52
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, tell me!

53
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,750
A long time ago,

54
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,958
there was a civil war
within vampire society.

55
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,166
Rozenmann, Li and
Ivanovic's clans

56
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,625
revolted against
the royal family.

57
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,791
They were able to overthrow

58
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,625
and completely absorb
the other clans

59
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,916
leaving them as the
last 3 standing.

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,916
Then they invaded
Tepes territory...

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,625
They burned the royal castle
and harassed the people...

62
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,083
Our ruler at the time,
Queen Lucrezia,

63
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,500
was driven from her land
and she died at their hands.

64
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,166
What!

65
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,250
But they knew our race would
face the prospect of extinction

66
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,916
if they ended the
true-blood lineage...

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,750
So they let
Princess Mina live

68
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,500
but merely as a
vessel of royal blood.

69
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,000
In exchange for her life,

70
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,541
she would have to undergo a
purity inquiry every decade.

71
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,916
A long time has
passed since then

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and the development of the
artificial blood known as Stigma

73
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,291
has freed us
from our fate.

74
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,583
We no longer have to feed
on humans to survive

75
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,541
and as a result we are
living beside them.

76
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,541
The darkness
and the light

77
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,041
which were once so separate
have started to blend...

78
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,708
We dwell in more
of a twilight now.

79
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,791
This intermixing has
caused some confusion,

80
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,333
which has bred radical
groups like Telomere,

81
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,500
which are comprised of
both vampires and humans.

82
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,750
On the bright side,

83
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,666
this new relationship we
have with the human race

84
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,208
has allowed the princess
to build the vampire bund.

85
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,541
However, I worry that she
will forever be constrained

86
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,791
by the Three Clans...

87
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,291
With each inquiry it's
as if they're saying,

88
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,041
You may be our ruler,

89
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,958
but one day your
body will be ours.

90
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
They've attempted to
capture her spirit as well

91
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,166
but thankfully
she's fought hard

92
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,166
to keep that from happening.

93
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,583
Princess...

94
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,833
I'm sorry you had to
witness the inquiry...

95
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,791
Forgive me...

96
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,041
But now you know
what it means

97
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,166
to be ruler of
the vampires...

98
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,458
This is horrible!

99
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,500
I can't even imagine what
you're going through!

100
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,083
You have to tell
Akira about...

101
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,958
No...! I don't want
him to see me...

102
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,916
not when I'm so weak...

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,416
I can't see him...

104
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,541
not like this...

105
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,375
But I bet he could help get
you out of this situation!

106
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,458
Don't be ridiculous.

107
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,333
Akira could never solve
this problem for me...

108
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,750
You're wrong!

109
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,625
Princess...

110
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,750
He cares more about you...

111
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,500
than anybody else
in this world.

112
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,666
What?

113
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,625
I was just thinking

114
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,583
about the first time
I ever met Akira...

115
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,916
Are you talking about...

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,041
seven years... ago?

117
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,208
No, it was ten
years before that.

118
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,333
The first time I met him

119
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,791
was just a few hours
after he was born.

120
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,041
I had just been subjected to
an inquiry back then, too...

121
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,208
I couldn't help but feel
that he was my salvation.

122
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,666
No longer would I feel
so utterly alone...

123
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,750
Akira...

124
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,291
Akira...

125
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,166
Where are you...

126
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,750
Please hurry back...

127
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,875
I need you to save me...

128
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,958
So let me get
this straight,

129
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,166
whoever kills me wins
the bet. Is that it?

130
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,250
Yeah, and nobody's
gonna come help you.

131
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,875
That's fine by me.

132
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,791
If scheming,
hate and madness

133
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,250
are the chains holding
the princess down...

134
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,500
I'll cut through every
last one of them.

135
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,458
Just be careful
out there, kid.

136
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,666
You're starting to sound
like someone from Telomere.

137
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,041
I don't suppose
you remember

138
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,083
what you saw on that
mission a year ago

139
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,208
I guess that's the last
little piece of your memory

140
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,125
that hasn't made it
back to you quite yet.

141
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,625
How can you be so sure?

142
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,750
Because I don't think you would
be acting like this right now

143
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,291
if you had your memory
back completely.

144
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,500
I might side with
the Three Clans

145
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,083
depending on how you react
when you get that piece back.

146
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,041
But for now,
I'm on your side.

147
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,000
Just take care of
yourself, alright?

148
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,541
So it's safe
for me to assume

149
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,625
you're not going
to be an enemy...

150
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,458
at least for
the time being?

151
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,333
Yeah.

152
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,083
Do me a favor and give a
message to the princess...

153
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,666
Tell her that
I won't die...

154
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,083
and I promise to come
back to her alive...

155
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,916
And please, remind
her to stay strong.

156
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,666
I'll pass that along.

157
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,125
I will come back, Princess!

158
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,750
Okay, here I go...!

159
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,916
One...!

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,250
Two...!

161
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,791
Three...!

162
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,666
Four!

163
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,416
Shh!

164
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,250
Shhh...

165
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,416
Seven...!

166
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,583
Eight...!

167
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,125
Nine...!

168
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,041
Ten! You guys ready!

169
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,291
I'm ready!

170
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,875
Hello Princess...

171
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,666
I see things haven't
changed since the old days.

172
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,125
There's no sense
in moping around

173
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,916
feeling sorry
for yourself...

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,166
Don't forget there's
someone out there

175
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,583
who's risking his very
life to set you free.

176
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,958
Alphonse, did
you see Akira?

177
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,833
Yes, and he asked me to
deliver a message for him...

178
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,875
He said to tell
you he won't die;

179
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,125
he promises to come
back to you alive...

180
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,791
And he wants you
to stay strong.

181
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,375
But how can he promise that?

182
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,500
I mean, considering
what he's up against!

183
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,916
He's determined to defeat
each of the assassins

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,166
that have been
sent after him.

185
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,208
He's out there on his own,

186
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,416
fighting three extremely
skilled hired killers

187
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,375
with nothing but his wits.

188
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,750
Anyone else would
run for their life

189
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,541
but he's determined to fight...

190
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,041
and it's all for
you, Princess.

191
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,791
So he wants me...

192
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,125
to be strong for him.

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,083
He wants me to fight...

194
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,708
Then I'll gladly do so!

195
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,541
Yuki, bring Vera to me!

196
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,875
Right!

197
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,166
Thank you, Alphonse.

198
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,583
Don't die on me, kid.

199
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,208
Sir Alphonse.

200
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,541
Go ahead and laugh...

201
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,083
I'm a child's messenger.

202
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,083
Telomere?

203
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,333
Yes, it seems
the organization...

204
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,583
has secretly placed their
pawns in this game as well.

205
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,875
Pardon... Could you
please say that again?

206
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,291
I said that I would
like to participate

207
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,541
in your little game
with a wager of my own...

208
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,875
I bet you gentlemen

209
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,708
that Akira will survive
your assassin's attacks

210
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,750
and come back here alive...

211
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,375
And... if I lose

212
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,208
I shall give you my body,
my future and my entirety.

213
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,875
Well, this is
quite a surprise!

214
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,333
It would appear that
the odds are stacked

215
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,916
against you, Princess.

216
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,625
Yes, but I thought that was
the definition of gambling...

217
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,041
To risk something...

218
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,875
Akira is out there
fighting all alone...

219
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,750
The least I can do is put my
own life on the line as well.

220
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,166
Now when you say you'll
give us your entirety,

221
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,583
is that also including your
true-blood legacy Ivanovic!

222
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,500
Well, Princess...

223
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,666
Are you prepared to
surrender that as well?

224
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,791
The true-blood legacy...

225
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,375
What is he talking about?

226
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,875
Answer me now!

227
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,916
That's exactly what
entirety means...

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,666
You don't doubt me, do you?

229
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,083
That's all I need to know.

230
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,708
The stakes to
our little wager

231
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,125
have been raised
exponentially.

232
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,583
Our assassins have
spun a lethal web

233
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,000
to catch that wolf
pup of yours...

234
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,500
Let's see if he can
chew his way out...

235
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,833
I highly doubt it.

236
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,208
Damn it...!

237
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,875
I can't even get
close to her!

238
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,541
Here goes nothin'...

239
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,583
No... why!

240
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,208
What the hell
was I thinking?

241
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,875
How could I be so stupid?

242
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,750
Let's make a deal,
Akira Kaburagi...

243
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,166
I will let you survive if
you'll be honest with me.

244
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,791
One year ago,
you went to the ruins

245
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,250
of the Tepes royal castle

246
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,750
on a secret mission
led by your father,

247
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,916
Wolfgang Regendorf.

248
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,583
It's said that you
discovered a grave secret

249
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,833
about the legacy of the
true-bloods that day.

250
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,958
What did you see
in the castle?

251
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,875
Akira Kaburagi...

252
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,833
Tell me, what did you see!

253
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,166
I swear, you can be
such a numbskull, Akira.

254
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,708
Mei Ren...

255
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,416
But you know... it's one of
the things I love about you.

256
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,333
Vampires are tough, huh?

257
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,375
I was worried about
you for a second there.

258
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,625
Mei Ren, I...

259
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,791
I didn't know you...

260
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,041
One assassin down
and one to go.

261
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,166
May I have your attention

262
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,375
This is an important message

263
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,083
from the Special
Zone Government.

264
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,500
Hostile clan operatives
have infiltrated the bund.

265
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,333
They aim to capture and
kill Akira Kaburagi,

266
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,500
a devoted servant
of Princess Mina's.

267
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,125
They are likely locked
in combat at this moment.

268
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,333
We ask that all
citizens please refrain

269
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,208
from going outside until the
situation has been resolved.

270
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,125
I had no idea that
you're a beast-person...

271
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,625
just like me.

272
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,375
Sorry I never told you...

273
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,208
I'm the sole
survivor of a race

274
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,750
that was destroyed during the
civil war between the clans.

275
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,000
So what's the
matter, Akira...

276
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,750
Why did you allow yourself
to be so badly wounded?

277
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,041
You should have transformed.

278
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,791
I tried to but
I couldn't...

279
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,916
Damn...! I don't
know what's wrong.

280
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,166
It must've been a
real shock to you...

281
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,625
being betrayed by the
princess like that.

282
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,250
What are you talking about?

283
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,291
I can only assume
that's how you felt...

284
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,500
You didn't know
that she was engaged

285
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,041
to someone else, did you?

286
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,166
Shock like that can throw
off your whole system...

287
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,500
You know, as beast-people
we're not able to transform

288
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,291
unless our bodies allow it.

289
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,000
Take this sedative...

290
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,041
But be careful;
it's kinda strong.

291
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,291
But I don't...

292
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,708
I don't feel betrayed
by the princess...!

293
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,625
She's fighting for her life
against the Three Clans...!

294
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,958
Despite the humiliation
they've put her through!

295
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,750
Because that's her duty...

296
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,541
As the ruler of the vampires
she has no choice...

297
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,291
Hey, you gotta stop...

298
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,333
Just give it up...

299
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,166
Don't you remember what I
said the last time we met...

300
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,625
No matter how much
he may desire it...

301
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,083
the butterfly can never
be with the flower...

302
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,375
Can you feel it...

303
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,625
That's my heart
beating in my chest...

304
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,041
Don't you see,
we're different from them.

305
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,083
Because we both have
a beating heart.

306
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,958
Humans... and vampires...

307
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,333
Neither race
would accept us

308
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,791
if they knew what
we really are.

309
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,333
I am the only one who
understands you...

310
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,041
what you're
going through...

311
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,833
And only I can love you.

312
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,458
No!

313
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,500
Akira...

314
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,958
You're coming with me!

315
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,375
Akira!

316
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,583
Where is she?

317
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,125
Oh, Akira...

318
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,125
How could you?

319
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,541
Damn it, why
won't you die!

320
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,500
I don't understand...

321
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,416
Why are you being so hateful to
me all of a sudden...

322
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,583
I've been so
worried about you...

323
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:55,000
That evil Princess Mina
hasn't gotten to you, has she?

324
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,291
Please Akira...

325
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,416
Tell me what you
saw that day.

326
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,875
What was it that you saw
at the Tepes castle

327
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,625
that made you lose
your memory...

328
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,708
Tell me, and I'll let you do
whatever you want to my body.

329
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,541
I've had enough...

330
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,208
You monster...

331
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,791
How dare you defile Yuki!

332
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,583
I was trying to
be nice to you...

333
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,875
but it's too late...

334
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,666
I'll just make
you tell me!

335
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,083
Why won't you tell me!

336
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,875
It's the least
you could do...

337
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,250
After you toyed with
my heart and dumped me!

338
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,041
I'm done playing games...

339
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,000
You better tell me what
you saw that day?

340
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,833
I...

341
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,875
Akira...

342
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,041
Princess...

343
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,416
You're safe now...

344
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,791
I'm here for you.

345
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,458
And you can tell
me anything.

346
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,291
Okay?

347
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,458
Please, Akira...

348
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,875
Tell me...

349
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,791
I want to know
what you saw...

350
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,708
Don't call my name...

351
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,333
with that voice...

352
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,083
Wha... What is the matter
with you, Akira...!

353
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,583
Don't you recognize
your beloved Mina!

354
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,666
Don't call my name...

355
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,541
with that voice...

356
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,458
and in that form!

357
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,375
Please, Akira...

358
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,041
Don't you die on me...

359
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,500
Though Akira had regained
most of his memory...

360
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,625
There was still one
important piece of the puzzle

361
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,083
that was eluding him.

362
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,000
Neither Princess Mina
nor I had

363
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,458
any way of knowing
what it was...

364
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,208
It was a secret hidden deep
within his subconscious.

365
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,125
We felt completely helpless.

366
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,833
All we could do was
pray for his safety...

367
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,083
and wait for the distant
dawn to end the night.

368
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:56,916
[Music]

369
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,791
Dance With the
Vampire Maids...!

370
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,500
The Revenge Chapter!

371
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,375
The Princess is finally
going to be ours!

372
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:29,708
Whoa, spicy!

373
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh, I'm sorry is that
not to your liking?

374
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,666
What the hell are you doing!

375
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,833
Just styling your hair
like you asked me to.

376
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,875
You look dirty!

377
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,000
Let's give you a bath!

378
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,458
Stop this nonsense!

379
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:42,000
How dare you patronize
the Three Clans!

380
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,583
What do you ladies
think you're doing!

381
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,958
Help us, Vera!

382
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:47,500
Just give them a good
punch to the gut, like this!

383
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,458
Yes, ma'am!

384
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,583
The Tepes household is scary...
