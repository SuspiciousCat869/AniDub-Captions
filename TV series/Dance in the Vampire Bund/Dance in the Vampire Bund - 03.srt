What the hell...

3
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,833
He can't be...

4
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:34,958
He's one... of

5
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,083
the Earth Clan.

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,833
Oh, Akira!

7
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,250
Man, that was a
crazy dream...

8
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,916
Where am I?

9
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,708
Wait a minute...

10
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,583
so that wasn't
a dream...?

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,833
Akira...

12
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,291
This isn't a dream...

13
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,458
is it?

14
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,458
Tell me, Akira...

15
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,416
What is my name?

16
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,791
You are... Princess Mina.

17
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,708
Good and what is
your full name?

18
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,625
Akira Kaburagi Regendorf.

19
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,208
Now tell me who you are.

20
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,541
I'm a werewolf...

21
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,250
of the Earth Clan.

22
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,583
Excellent!

23
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,500
We bid you good
morning, Your Highness!

24
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,708
Although technically...

25
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,625
it's not morning anymore!

26
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,375
Who are you people?

27
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,125
These girls
are my maids...

28
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,375
Good morning Nelly,
Nero and Nella...

29
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,875
Now get to work!

30
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,833
Your wish is our command!

31
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,208
Move your hands...

32
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,833
They're just going
to get in the way.

33
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,083
No it's fine, I can
manage on my own!

34
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,333
Are you refusing to
let me do my job?

35
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,541
Princess, please!

36
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,916
Would you call off the
scary maid lady...?!

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What the heck is
going on here?!

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,625
What do you
think...? Is it 'me'?

39
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,333
That outfit you're
wearing...!

40
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,166
Pretty sharp, don't you think?

41
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,208
She was like a
summer thunderstorm

42
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,500
that strikes
without warning...

43

bringing chaos to
a quiet afternoon.

44
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello, my name
is Mina Tepes...

45
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,250
I've recently arrived
in your country...

46
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,916
I am so pleased to make
all of your acquaintances.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,583
This isn't gonna
end well...

48
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,958
That was the day
everything changed...

49
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,000
The day our peaceful school
suddenly became a stage...

50
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,583
for the dazzling
rondo of the vampires.

00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,791
What's she doing here?!

55
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,083
Check it out!

56
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,083
What?!

57
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,916
Princess... You can go ahead

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,666
and pick your seat now.

59
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,125
A word, Sister Laura?

60
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,458
Uh... Yes?!

61
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,041
You don't have to worry...

62
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,458
I promise that I'm
not going to bite you.

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,333
Well, it just so
happens that one of my

64
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,000
royal servants is a
student in this class...

65
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,125
If you have no objections,

66
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,250
I would like to be
seated next to him.

67
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,625
Your royal... servant?

68
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,791
Correct...

69
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,458
Akira Kaburagi.

70
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,500
What?! No way!

71
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,708
Seriously?!

72
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,750
Sister... My apologies,

73
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,833
I intended today only
as a greeting...

74
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,500
I'll stop interrupting
your class.

75
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,875
Akira... I want
you to come

76
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,750
to the Chairwoman's
Office after class...

77
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,541
Understood?

78
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,916
Yeah, got it...

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
Oh...

80
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,916
Okay, what the hell?!

81
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,250
When'd you become that
vampire's servant?!

82
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,375
Yeah, man, what did the
princess mean by that?!

83
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,708
You told us you didn't
give a crap about vampires!

84
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,208
Butt out guys, I got this!

85
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,125
Hey, I think we have a
right to know... Ryohei!

86
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,041
Yeah, tell us!
What's she want with you?!

87
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,625
Whoa!

88
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,125
Toilet.

89
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,041
-Nice, what was that?
-He ran away!

90
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,041
Akira! Wait!

91
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,875
That is so not fair!

92
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,125
Spill it, Yuki...

93
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,291
Did you know about
this...? He trusts you.

94
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,958
May I have your
attention please...

95
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,416
Addressing all student
council members;

96
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,625
an emergency council meeting
will be commencing shortly...

97
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,208
All executives and class
officers, please report

98
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,708
to the student council
office immediately.

99
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,208
Yuki, wait!

100
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,958
I repeat... Addressing all
student council members...

101
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,208
Damn, guys!
Get off my back!

102
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,625
I could use an explanation
for all of this, too.

103
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,833
I've gotten some of
my memory back...

104
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,375
but nowhere
near all of it!

105
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,666
Next year...

106
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,125
on your seventeenth
birthday,...

107
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,416
In accordance with
our ancestral vows...

108
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,375
you will be remanded to
the princess' service...

109
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,875
where you will
remain at her side.

110
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,583
This assignment...

111
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,291
will serve as a litmus
test to gauge your ability

112
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,333
to handle responsibility.

113
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,625
Do your best.

114
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,250
I know, Dad.

115
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,625
And I will.

116
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,458
It must've been
after that when I--

117
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,750
Damn it...!

118
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,416
That's where it's
still all fuzzy...

119
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,916
I thought that I might
find you up here.

120
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,833
Yeah... Hey...!

121
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,875
With the exception
of the administration

122
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,125
and the instructors...

123
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,458
everything at this academy

124
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,041
is run by the
students themselves!

125
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,750
Our esteemed chairwoman
founded the school

126
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,416
on this very principle...!

127
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,333
And to simply
ignore precedent

128
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,458
and allow vampires to enroll
without student approval...

129
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,875
Is unthinkable!

130
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,166
I'm taking this
directly to her

131
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,750
and putting an end to it!

132
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,541
Wait, directly to who?

133
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,541
So you're saying...

134
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,416
the chairwoman
is actually here?!

135
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,875
They say she hasn't
even shown her face

136
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,041
since the day she
opened the school!

137
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,166
Don't question her.

138
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,750
I'm sure the President's
thought this out.

139
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,875
You have a good
reason for doing this?

140
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,666
Or are you just
that scared...

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,708
Do not be afraid, people!

142
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,083
As we speak, the
rest of the world

143
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,083
is being overrun by
these bloodsuckers!

144
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,125
As the student council
it's our duty to make sure

145
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,041
the same thing doesn't
happen to our beloved school!

146
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,791
Oh... So you're not?

147
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,000
Not me...

148
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,416
I swear I'm not
a vampire, Yuki.

149
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,791
But then...

150
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,000
How are you the
princess's servant?

151
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,125
Well, it's like a
family obligation...

152
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,500
I don't know. It's
kinda hard to explain.

153
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,750
What, you mean like an
arranged marriage or something?

154
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,125
It's not like that...! My
dad ordered me to do it...

155
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,625
Not that I really
have any idea

156
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,833
what the point of it all is...

157
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,458
So, your memory...

158
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,750
is it starting
to come back?

159
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,541
Yeah ...

160
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,416
It's still just bits
and pieces, though...

161
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,916
But...

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,291
At least now...

163
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,291
I guess I'm finally
beginning to remember

164
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,500
who I really am.

165
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,416
Or what I am...

166
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,041
Anyway, forget I
said anything...

167
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,916
I'm sorry I've had you
worried all this time.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,291
It's okay...

169
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,500
I'm glad for you...

170
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,958
Really.

171
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,333
Thank you.

172
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,500
Well, I, uh, better
get a move on...

173
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,958
I've made her wait
long enough...

174
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,583
See ya later, Yuki!

175
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,291
Where is he?

176
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,791
I would imagine that he's
still quite confused

177
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,333
at the moment...

178
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,583
All of this happened to
him so quickly, after all.

179
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,791
Yeah, you're right...

180
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,458
Guess it's to be expected.

181
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,875
What do you people
think you're doing...?!

182
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,416
You can't just barge in!

183
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,250
It's my understanding that
the chairwoman is in there!

184
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,708
What should we do?

185
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,791
It's okay...
Let her in.

186
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,708
We beg your pardon.

187
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,916
Miss Chairwoman...

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,166
Why have you
permitted a vampire

189
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,916
to enroll in this school?!

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,208
I'm sorry,

191
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,125
but I didn't catch
your name, young lady.

192
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,041
Student Council President
Nanami Shinonome...

193
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:23,000
So tell me... Is this monster
blackmailing you or something?!

194
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,166
Is that the question you
marched down here to ask?

195
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,416
Yes... I want to know...

196
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,708
I understand...

197
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,000
And your concern
is duly noted.

198
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,041
You heard the
young lady...

199
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,416
Anything to say on the
matter, Madam Chairwoman?

200
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,541
Obviously, I can't
blackmail myself...

201
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,250
Nor would I, as
attending this academy

202
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,625
was the reason I built
it in the first place.

203
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,750
I am the founder and
also the chairwoman

204
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,750
of this
prestigious academy...

205
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,541
I am Mina Tepes.

206
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,416
No way!

207
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,666
Yeah, very funny!

208
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,750
You can't be
the chairwoman,

209
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,041
I mean, you're just a kid!

210
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,500
Have you already
forgotten what I am...?

211
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,041
I have lived decades longer

212
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,958
than the three of
you have combined.

213
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,125
-C'mon! You've gotta be
-That's enough!

214
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,458
Of course...

215
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,958
It all makes sense now.

216
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,166
I knew there was something
strange about this school...

217
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,000
How all the windows are
made of polarized glass...

218
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,541
and the gym was
built underground...

219
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,958
It's all because...

220
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,250
You're a clever girl.

221
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,000
I have only recently
arrived on campus,

222
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,541
but I am happy to see
the school has grown

223
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,708
into a valued
place of learning.

224
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,250
The students are cheerful

225
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,958
and self-reliance
fills the halls...

226
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,250
I can't thank you
enough for your efforts.

227
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,375
Because of you, this will
be the perfect school

228
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,083
for our children
when the vampire bund

229
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,000
is finally established.

230
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,958
You can't be serious!

231
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,375
We didn't fight
tooth and nail

232
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,750
for the betterment
of this school,

233
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,750
just so you could turn it
into a den for you people!

234
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,958
For vampires!

235
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,708
I hear you want to be
a lawyer one day,

236
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,458
Miss Shinonome...

237
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,333
Is that correct?

238
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,416
We have no privacy,
either...?!

239
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,916
Serve out your student
council term without incident,

240
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,291
and I'll
provide a scholarship

241
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,833
and recommendation to the
university of your choice.

242
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,208
You're horrible!

243
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,833
All right, Miss
Shinonome...

244
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,291
Are you finished
with your questions?

245
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,750
I am not.

246
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,958
Then I'll have to ask you
to come back another time...

247
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,250
The chairwoman has a
very busy schedule...

248
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,083
Damn you.

249
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,541
Hey... Sorry I'm late, uh--

250
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,416
I guess I've caught
you at a bad time...

251
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,583
Akira...! One moment!

252
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,333
So I take it you really want
me gone from this school?

253
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:39,958
Yes!

254
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,833
In that case, how
about a small wager?

255
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,166
You gave this to
me, right Yuki?

256
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,708
So then...

257
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,166
does that mean...

258
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,125
that we're...?

259
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,708
This is Student Council
President

260
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,166
Nanami Shinonome.

261
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,750
By this time, I'm sure you've
all heard that Mina Tepes,

262
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,041
the self-proclaimed
ruler of the vampires,

263
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,250
has transferred to
our academy.

264
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,583
The Student Council is adamantly
opposed to this outrage!

265
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,125
And so, in direct
response...

266
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,375
I use my council authority
to announce a boycott

267
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,291
on afternoon classes!

268
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,666
Furthermore,
after negotiating

269
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,250
with the school's
administration...

270
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,958
We've reached an
agreement and succeeded

271
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,041
in winning a major concession.

272
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,458
If we can catch
her servant...

273
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,291
second-year student,
Akira Kaburagi...

274
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,750
the princess will withdraw
her transfer to our school.

275
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,375
My fellow students...!

276
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,416
Allowing vampires into our
school is reckless...!

277
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,916
It must not be permitted!

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You all know what
you have to do...!

279
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,333
Capture Akira Kaburagi...!

280
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,000
Protect the sanctity
of this institution...!

281
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,000
And protect our
peaceful academy!

282
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,500
Also...

283
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,000
Whoever catches
him will be rewarded

284
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,625
by the student council.

285
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,916
We will give the
winner's class,

286
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,916
or designated
club, extra funding!

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Hell yeah!

288
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,791
Damn it, Saijo...!
By doing that,

289
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,041
we're just stooping
to the vampire's level.

290
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,000
People need something
tangible to fight for.

291
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,833
Well, I suppose
you're right....

292
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,958
Let's get started.

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,250
Yuzuru.

294
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,250
Please give me the strength
to get through this.

295
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,833
For cryin' out loud...

296
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,083
Talk about fuel
for the fire,

297
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,625
this is like pourin'
oil on hot embers...

298
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,666
You can do it, Akira.

299
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,458
And you can bite
me, Princess.

300
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,416
You're not coming
down with a cold,

301
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,875
are you Princess?

302
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,458
No... We aren't susceptible
to the common cold.

303
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,375
I wish I was so fortunate.

304
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,125
As for this meeting, I
believe it should prove

305
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,833
to be a watershed moment
in trying to pass the

306
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,083
Special Zone
Establishment Bill...

307
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,958
I must admit to you,
I have high hopes!

308
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,791
Well... It's time to set
foot on the battlefield.

309
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,333
Akira Kaburagi's been
spotted in Building Number Two!

310
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,500
Got it!...

311
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,958
I'm on my way!

312
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,541
Seriously? Wanted signs...?

313
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,916
When did anyone have
time to make these,

314
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,541
much less
put 'em up?

315
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,916
My cell phone!

316
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,041
Uh... hi!

317
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,166
Later!

318
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,000
I found him!

319
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,833
Hey, Akira! Over here!

320
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,208
For Princess
Mina's sake...!

321
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,416
Don't let 'em getcha, dude!

322
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,791
You can do it!

323
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,250
Thanks, I owe ya one!

324
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Wow, you student council
executive officers

325
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,625
are really good at your
jobs, aren't you?

326
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,791
Found you!

327
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,541
Oh, come on!

328
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,416
There is only one thing I
want from you gentlemen today.

329
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,166
And that is the
ratification of the

330
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,166
Special Zone
Establishment Bill,

331
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,375
which the esteemed Mr. surugi's
faction has submitted...

332
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,958
It's that simple.

333
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,875
If only your politicians had
the spines to be so decisive...

334
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,041
Japan would not be in the
dire financial straits

335
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,125
it is today.

336
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,500
Vera. Show them what I mean.

337
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,500
Ma'am.

338
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,791
I would like you gentlemen
to take a look at this first...

339
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,416
Then we can discuss
the matter further.

340
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,958
Impossible!

341
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,916
That's preposterous!
Is this accurate?!

342
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,708
I assure you, it is...

343
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,583
So what are your
thoughts, gentlemen?

344
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,125
This is insane...!

345
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,708
Why won't they just
let up for a second?!

346
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,750
My club needs funding!

347
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,208
Damn it...! It's
always about the money!

348
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,250
Of course it is!

349
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,125
I can assure you, gentlemen,
that I am not bluffing...

350
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,333
Approve the
bund's creation,

351
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,416
or I'll withdraw
these corporations.

352
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,916
I'll find out what
you're up to...

353
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,250
I swear it!

354
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,875
We can't allow that...!
We would be ruined!

355
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,750
Well, that was the plan...

356
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,541
Those companies were
strategically chosen

357
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,208
to do the most damage.

358
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,708
I'm sorry, Princess, we're
not able to give you

359
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,666
a definitive answer
right away...

360
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,666
Give us some time to look
over these documents

361
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,125
and we'll get back to you.

362
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,416
So naïve...

363
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,833
You're all so
incredibly naïve!

364
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,708
You're certainly
welcome to waste time

365
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,916
and avoid the situation,

366
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,291
but it will not
turn in your favor.

367
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,041
In fact, you will only drive
yourselves into a corner,

368
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,375
as the clock
ticks away,

369
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,500
and you run out of
places to try and hide!

370
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,041
There's no escape now!

371
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,083
You, gentlemen, are
this nation's elite...

372
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,916
You, few, determine
the fate of the land

373
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
in accordance to the
will of the people!

374
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,416
You should just
give it up already!

375
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,250
Will you grant
our proposal?

376
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,625
Or will you turn us
away and make things

377
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,625
more difficult for yourselves?

378
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,250
It's your decision.

379
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,916
Where'd he go?

380
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,750
I think I lost 'em...

381
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,875
That was
impressive, Akira.

382
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,000
You... you saw all that?

383
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:42,166
I guess it's true, you
really have lost your memory.

384
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,000
Wow... That flustered look is
really doing something for me.

385
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,000
You're the princess's
servant, huh?

386
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,833
Do you also "serve"
her in the nighttime?

387
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,541
You kiddin' me?!

388
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,208
Then explain this.

389
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,458
I added my contact info...

390
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,875
That way you can
get a hold of me.

391
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,458
Mei Ren?

392
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,916
I am beat!

393
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,458
You did have a
workout... of sorts.

394
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,833
You can say that again...

395
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,666
So... how was your
meeting today?

396
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,125
It was a joke...

397
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,708
I think the student
council might have

398
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,083
more backbone than the
politicians of this country.

399
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,125
So... How are you feeling...?

400
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,750
Has the rest of your
memory filled back in yet?

401
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,125
Nope, it's still
full of holes.

402
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,208
I feel like there's...
so much I don't remember.

403
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,125
Even... the promise you made
to me seven years ago?

404
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,083
I made a promise...?
Doesn't ring any bells...

405
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,833
Oh, I see...

406
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,083
Well, I guess it's
to be expected...

407
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,541
Your memory has only
started to come back to you...

408
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,375
But if you just
give it some time...

409
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,583
I'm sure you'll
begin to remember

410
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,333
everything more clearly...

411
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,375
You've always been
light-hearted and carefree-

412
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,250
You dare... to fool me!

413
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,250
Take this!

414
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,541
Ow! Okay,
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

415
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,041
Cut it out!

416
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,791
I'm glad to have
you back,...

417
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,291
Akira.

418
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,708
Me too.

419
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,083
Thanks, Princess.

420
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,250
Man, Nanami's been workin'
herself to the bone.

421
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,375
I appreciate you
walking me home.

422
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,833
Not a problem...

423
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,791
I wouldn't wanna leave you
all by yourself out here...

424
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,083
So, it must've
been quite a shock

425
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,125
to find out about
Akira today...

426
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,291
There's something I think
about to this very day...

427
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,708
Back then, I was so
focused on Akira

428
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,666
it never even
occurred to me...

429
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,166
I honestly
didn't have time

430
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,291
to worry about
anything else...

431
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,208
I can't help but wonder
what would've happened

432
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,958
if I had waited for Nanami...

433
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,833
I wonder if things would
have turned out differently...

434
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,166
I managed all
right today...

435
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,208
but I can only imagine...

436
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,083
that things are gonna
get tougher from here.

437
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,083
Never fear... I have a plan.

438
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,750
So... tell me...

439
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,833
Why did you go out of your
way to visit the school

440
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,958
while there's so much
other chaos going on?

441
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,708
What are you
up to exactly?

442
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,541
I'm sorry, Akira...

443
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,375
But that's none
of your concern.

444
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,625
No!

445
00:21:51,416 --> 00:22:01,500
[Music]

446
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,375
"Dance with the Vampire Maids"

447
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,666
Part Three!

448
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,541
Must! Have! Extra! Funding!

449
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,083
C'mon guys! I
can't believe you!

450
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,041
Unleashing the flood!

451
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,708
Now I'll attack with
Strawberry Poison Frog Arrows!

452
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,333
That's kinda lame.

453
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,916
Okay, Strawberry
Poison Frog Blow Darts!

454
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,333
Really? Frogs...?

455
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,875
How 'bout
something flashier?

456
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,041
Super Earth
Destruction Bomb!

457
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,875
Are you trying to kill me?!

458
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,375
Now you ask?!

459
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,458
Seriously!

460
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,666
Oh, for crying out loud!
