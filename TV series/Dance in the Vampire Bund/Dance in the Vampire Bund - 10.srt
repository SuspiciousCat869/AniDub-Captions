1
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,125
I promise that
I'll protect you.

2
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,875
Princess!

3
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,416
No... way...

4
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,750
I'm going to kill you...

5
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,166
I'm going to kill you...

6
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:14,541
'The hell?

7
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,750
Did you have
another nightmare?

8
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,208
I guess...

9
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,666
What're you doing here?!

10
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,333
I've been so busy
lately we haven't had

11
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,791
an opportunity to
spend time together...

12
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,750
so I decided to come
by and see you now.

13
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,708
But you had the
nerve to be asleep

14
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:29,958
when I snuck into
your room...

15
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,791
So instead of waking you
I decided to sit here

16
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,833
and admire you
while you slept.

17
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:36,375
You were watching me
sleep? That's creepy.

18
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,291
Well... I like it.

19
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,166
Don't get me wrong, you've
grown into a handsome man...

20
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,333
but when you're sleeping,

21
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,708
you look just like
the little boy

22
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,291
that I met so
many years ago.

23
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,791
Hey I was wondering...

24
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,166
What are those
weird flowers

25
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,375
that are blooming in
the greenhouse?

26
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,083
They're cleomes.

27
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,083
I used to have a
little hiding place...

28
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,458
and I had a beautiful
flower garden there...

29
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,083
In fact, all of the
flowers in the greenhouse

30
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,291
were transplanted
from that garden.

31
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,750
Cleomes...

32
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,291
So tell me, Akira...

33
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,500
Are you going to be
available this weekend?

34
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, why?

35
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, I thought...

36
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,708
Since establishment of the bund
is finally underway and all...

37
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,333
I thought maybe...

38
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,041
I thought maybe I could
take a few days off

39
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,875
to spend with you.

40
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,916
Want to go look at
flowers with me?

41
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,791
I would love to...

42
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,166
Oh no...! I'm sorry, but
I have plans this weekend.

43
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,541
What?!

44
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,250
But I'm totally free
next weekend...!

45
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,333
We can go wherever
you want to!

46
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,791
Do you promise me?

47
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,416
Yeah.

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:46,500
[Music]

49
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:52,666
[Music]

50
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,083
It happened on a
peaceful afternoon

51
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,375
after the terrorism turmoil
had seemingly ended...

52
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,916
Everything appeared to be
calm within the bund...

53
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,875
This place is
beautiful, isn't it?

54
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,916
It is... But are you
sure that it's okay...

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,791
for us to join you?

56
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,458
Of course it is.

57
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,083
Though you are a servant
to the princess,

58
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,375
when you're not on duty,

59
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,708
you are considered
a friend...

60
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,250
You're welcome here.

61
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,458
Nanami was now living with
Yuzuru in the vampire bund.

62
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,958
Princess Mina had taken
her in as one of her maids,

63
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,458
and she was also allowed
to return to school.

64
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,041
Are you becoming
accustomed to it?

65
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,333
Yeah... It takes some
getting used to at first,

66
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,833
but I'd do anything
to be with Nanami...

67
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't thank you
and Akira enough.

68
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,666
That is so
incredibly sweet...

69
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,166
You two are precious.

70
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,666
We started to believe
that our lives

71
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,708
were finally peaceful...

72
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,416
It felt like all was
well with the world...

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,541
So where is Akira, anyway?

74
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,083
I don't know.
I invited him to come,

75
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,500
but he declined...

76
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,583
He told me that he had to
take care of some business.

77
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,708
But suddenly our tale
took a cruel, new turn...

78
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,583
Oh well, he's missing out!

79
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,375
We can have plenty
of fun without him!

80
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,916
Yeah!

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,166
The events that unfolded
between that moment

82
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,625
and the following morning
scarred each of us forever;

83
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,458
me... Princess Mina...

84
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,500
and Akira...

85
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,583
The memory of that day
would haunt all of us

86
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,500
for years to come...

87
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,833
I'm surprised...

88
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,291
When I called you,
I honestly didn't think

89
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,916
you were going to meet me.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,500
You're such an
obedient werewolf.

91
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,666
Well, it's not like I
had much of a choice.

92
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,625
You've helped me
out in the past

93
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,083
so I kind of owed you one.

94
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,083
Are you saying that you
feel indebted to me?

95
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,666
'Indebted' is such
a strong word...

96
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,708
Anyway, I've got
some questions

97
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,541
that only you can
answer for me.

98
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,458
From the top...
I'm thirty-two...

99
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,375
twenty-three...

100
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,708
thirty-three.

101
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,416
Uh...

102
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,041
And just so you
know, I'm a virgin.

103
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,750
You don't believe
me...? I'm not lying...

104
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,875
However, you
could be my first?

105
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,750
What is wrong
with you...?!

106
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,250
We're in public in
the middle of the day!

107
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,666
So you only do it
at night...? Pervert.

108
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,791
Just who are you
calling a pervert, huh?!

109
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,250
Do you like it?

110
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,416
Why, you!

111
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,625
Catch me if you can!

112
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:40,875
Damn it!

113
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,000
This water feels great...!

114
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,958
You should come and
join me, Akira!

115
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,458
Lunatic.

116
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,625
Looks like I won our
little game of tag.

117
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,875
Yeah, whatever.

118
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,666
-Mei Ren, your shirt-
-What...?

119
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,958
Uh-oh...

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,375
I can't believe you...

121
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,875
Why aren't you wearing
a bra or something...?!

122
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,416
You can see right through.

123
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,708
I guess you caught me.

124
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,250
C'mon, let's
get outta here.

125
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,458
Geez, don't you
have any modesty?

126
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,250
Did you seriously think I was
gonna be cool with that?

127
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, I certainly didn't
expect to get yelled at

128
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,958
for giving you a peek!

129
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,416
Are you jealous?

130
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
You don't want any other
guys seeing the goods, huh?

131
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,750
Alright, I think you've had
enough fun at my expense...

132
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,000
Can we get down
to business now?

133
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,416
Looks like someone can't
handle being teased.

134
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,666
You're no fun, Akira.

135
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,166
Just leave me
alone, would ya?

136
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,833
Those flowers...

137
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,958
I've seen 'em before.

138
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,333
They're cleomes.

139
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,916
They're different
from other flowers...

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,791
because they only
bloom at night.

141
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,333
They bloom at night?

142
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,208
They go by another
name as well...

143
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,125
Go ahead and take a
closer look at them...

144
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,750
Do they remind
you of anything?

145
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,458
They kind of look like...

146
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,958
flowers with
butterflies on them.

147
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,250
Exactly...

148
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,666
They're Butterfly Flowers.

149
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,916
You know, there's a
heartbreaking legend about 'em.

150
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,833
It's said that there
once was a butterfly

151
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,041
that was searching for love.

152
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,375
One day he came upon
another beautiful butterfly

153
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,208
and it was love
at first sight.

154
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,208
But the butterfly
soon realized

155
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,916
that his love remained perfectly
still on top of a flower,

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,166
his beloved never moved
a single inch...

157
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,416
Even so, he continued to
woo his love day and night,

158
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,000
while his life slowly
slipped away from him...

159
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,666
The butterfly eventually
ran out of strength

160
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,041
and fell to the ground...

161
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,166
Meanwhile, his love's
wings fluttered in the wind...

162
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,666
Although his beloved
looked like another butterfly,

163
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,708
turns out it was,
in fact, a flower.

164
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,333
A cleome that
simply stood there

165
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,583
with its petal swaying
in the breeze.

166
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,916
A Butterfly Flower...

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,708
That reminds me of...

168
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,375
Are you having
a good time?

169
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,916
Yeah! I know that it's
not possible but...

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,125
it would be even nicer...

171
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,375
if we could be
out in the sun.

172
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,875
Well, we can make
that happen...

173
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,750
Believe it or not,
this castle was built

174
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,791
with a special function
that allows sunlight

175
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,041
in with just the
touch of a button.

176
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,708
You're so mean!
Don't tease me like that!

177
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,875
Cut it out!

178
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,958
You know... I thought
vampires were...

179
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,208
supposed to be more
stylish than humans.

180
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,625
Are you making a snide
remark about my swim suit?

181
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,333
No, it's just not what
I expected...!

182
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,708
I don't know...

183
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,875
when you transformed
you just looked so-

184
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,791
I asked you to never speak of
what you saw that day, Yuki.

185
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,250
I've been in this immature
form for quite a while now.

186
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,958
As a result, most people
treat me like a child...

187
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,916
so I've taken to
dressing like one...

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,875
even though I find
it embarrassing

189
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,958
and totally out of character.

190
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,333
I find... even Akira
treats me like a child,

191
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,458
though he knows better.

192
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,291
But... Why don't you
like the other form?

193
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,875
Oh, I do...

194
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,458
I wish I could stay
that way forever...

195
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,583
I dream of someday being a
size that matches Akira...

196
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,125
then we'll finally...

197
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,000
be able to embrace.

198
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,583
Although I may complain
about my childish appearance,

199
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,916
I am truly grateful
for this body...

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,833
It's kept me from doing
the unthinkable...

201
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,625
And it gives Akira...

202
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,333
a reason to
stay by my side.

203
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,750
That makes sense...

204
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,541
What?!

205
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,500
Princess...! A message
from the Port Authority!

206
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,541
Three ships - the
Abokyu, the Kremlin,

207
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,833
and the Sanssouci

208
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,000
-are currently
approaching the bund!

209
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,166
I learned a lot today.

210
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,666
You really know
your flowers, huh?

211
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,083
No... it's just that cleomes
were the favorite flower

212
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,500
of someone who was
important to me.

213
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,416
I gotta tell you,

214
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,916
I'm surprised that you
weren't able to recognize

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,041
those flowers yourself...

216
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,041
It's obvious that your memory
isn't completely back yet.

217
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,166
The main reason I asked you
to meet me here today, Akira,

218
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,875
was so that I could
assess your memory loss,

219
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,583
see how much of
it has returned.

220
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,833
Why is that?

221
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,125
I'm sorry, but I
can't tell you.

222
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,583
All I'll say is that
when you do remember,

223
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,708
blood will flow.

224
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,750
Just who are you, Mei Ren?

225
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,625
I've already
told you that.

226
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:09,833
Well I don't believe you.

227
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,125
That doesn't
really matter...

228
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,083
Just know that you're not
all alone in this world...

229
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,041
I understand you
more than anyone.

230
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,541
More than any human...

231
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,833
more than any vampire...

232
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,458
I'm the only one who
truly understands you.

233
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,041
What do you mean?

234
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,791
Very soon you'll be
faced with a dilemma

235
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,041
the likes of which you've
never experienced before.

236
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,541
I'm on your side...

237
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,500
I wanna see you
survive, if possible.

238
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,250
Akira...

239
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,083
The Three Clans?

240
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,166
That's correct.

241
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,250
They are the three living
"true blood" lineages...

242
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,958
Long ago, hundreds of
vampire clans ruled

243
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,166
various territories
throughout the world.

244
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,875
We prospered far and wide.

245
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,916
Unfortunately, only
three of those clans

246
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,791
have been able to survive...

247
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,000
Li, Ivanovic
and Rozenmann...

248
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,083
They are my subjects
and my blood relatives.

249
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,166
They're also... my nemeses...

250
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,833
Nemeses?

251
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,375
There is an internal
feud of sorts

252
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,958
that's been going on
for centuries now.

253
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,583
Because we live for
eternity our quarrels...

254
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,666
are quite lengthy and
not easily abated.

255
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,000
So what do you think
of my fighting outfit?

256
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,791
Fighting outfit?

257
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:25,750
There's no need
to worry...

258
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,125
It won't get physical...

259
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,541
Causing harm to me would
mean the end of our race...

260
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,500
they don't have the
nerve to touch me.

261
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,083
They have no
power over me...

262
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,541
They've reduced
themselves...

263
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,958
to plotting, intimidation,
and deception.

264
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,750
In their minds...

265
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,750
another word for
ruler is "trickster".

266
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,416
Princess...

267
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,250
Shouldn't you wait
until Akira comes back?

268
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,458
I can't!

269
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,125
This is my problem...

270
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,875
I cannot allow him
to get involved.

271
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,916
But why not...? He
can protect you!

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,833
I've spared him from
this aspect of my life

273
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,833
and I shall continue
to do so...

274
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,541
There are some things even
he doesn't need to know.

275
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,791
Don't worry, Yuki...

276
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,208
I will not lose to them...

277
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,458
I promise.

278
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,500
Good luck, Princess...

279
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,041
What?!

280
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,416
She told me not to
say anything to you,

281
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,875
but I thought you
should know...

282
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,750
Is this what you
were talking about?

283
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,833
'Fraid so... You're
gonna go anyway...

284
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,791
-aren't you?
-Yeah.

285
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,291
Tell me...

286
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,791
Why are you so fixated
on the Princess?

287
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,375
Because I made a promise.

288
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,625
Is that all?

289
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,541
No...

290
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,333
I knew it...

291
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,833
Don't forget.

292
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,833
No matter how much the
butterfly may wish for it...

293
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,166
He can never be
with the flower.

294
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,000
How good of you gentlemen
to pay a visit to my new home.

295
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,208
I hope you can forgive us for
stopping by unannounced.

296
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,250
We waited to be invited
to the housewarming

297
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,916
with baited breath...

298
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,083
but our impatience
got the best of us.

299
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,166
Shall I assume the invitation
was lost in the mail?

300
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,625
My sincerest
apologies, gentlemen...

301
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,750
I'm afraid it's been one
troublesome incident

302
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,500
after another around here.

303
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,333
You mean Telomere?

304
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,708
The world around us is
continually changing

305
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,791
despite the fact that you
sit in your castles...

306
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,583
simply glaring
at one another.

307
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,916
I find it quite
amusing you're using

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,291
the Telomere as an
excuse, Princess.

309
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,375
It's become quite obvious
that you've chosen to ignore us,

310
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,583
your guardians, as
you continue to push

311
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,166
your own plans forward.

312
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,041
Sorry, are you implying
that I should

313
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,625
ask the three of you
for permission

314
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,416
whenever I want
to do something?

315
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,250
Though we are blood relatives
I am still your master.

316
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,833
I kindly ask that you do not
interfere with my matters.

317
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,791
I've had enough
of your impudence!

318
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,041
Let's be honest,

319
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,000
though we belong to a
"true blood" lineage,

320
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,625
the royal family's power...

321
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,625
means very little anymore.

322
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,791
Your "ruler of
the vampires"

323
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,250
act can no longer
go on without us.

324
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,708
It is you three who
mean little now.

325
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,416
Let me ask you this...

326
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,291
You allowed this to become
the Tepes royal castle,

327
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,625
did you not?

328
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,375
Have you not permitted me
to live here as ruler,

329
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,958
all of this time,
without question?

330
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,791
You three have continually
tried to constrain me...

331
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,875
You have stood in my way

332
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,083
and reprimanded me
for my actions.

333
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,541
And yet, this castle was
built on my behalf...

334
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,916
Was it not?!

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,208
I am still here!

336
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,458
That, more than anything,

337
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,250
is proof of my rule
over not only you,

338
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,791
but all vampires.

339
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,500
Don't you see,
gentlemen...?

340
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,791
There is no one who
can rule over me!

341
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,583
You've become quite the
spitfire recently, haven't you?

342
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,208
I see your point...

343
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,791
And perhaps
you're right...

344
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,125
that there is no one among the
vampires who can control you.

345
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,166
However, even if
that is the case...

346
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,250
you still cannot defy the
principles of our lineage.

347
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,958
You haven't forgotten
about that, have you?

348
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,958
Of course you haven't,
my bride-to-be.

349
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,458
What do you mean I can't?!

350
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,750
Sorry, but it's
a direct order

351
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,166
from the princess herself...

352
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,583
Akira Kaburagi is not
allowed on the island.

353
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,916
Aw, man... This is ridiculous!

354
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,250
I'll just have
to call someone-

355
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,583
Hey, Vera...?

356
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,083
What does he mean by that?

357
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,875
As you know, you have
a responsibility

358
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,375
to the vampire race...

359
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,541
As the head of the
royal family,

360
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,750
you are entrusted with--

361
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,125
Believe me, I am
well aware of my duty.

362
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,583
I must partner with
another noble of the

363
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,083
"true blood" lineage...

364
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,291
and produce an heir that
will keep the lineage intact.

365
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,583
That's correct.

366
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,041
We four are the
only vampires left

367
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,416
who carry the bloodline
of the ancient clans.

368
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,250
And the only one among us who
can carry a child is you...

369
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,875
my dear, Princess Mina.

370
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,791
You will be forced
to marry one of us

371
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,000
and then bear that
man's child...

372
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,375
That is our lineage's
responsibility

373
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,500
to the vampire race...

374
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,791
It is our fate.

375
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,500
And I would never dare
to question fate...

376
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,791
You do realize
that this puts me

377
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,375
in quite a predicament...

378
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,500
If only there was a way
for this immature female body

379
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,041
to bear a child...

380
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,083
Then I would be happy
to go forth with my duty

381
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,291
and marry one
of you gentlemen.

382
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,875
Yes, so you have
continually said.

383
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,791
All the while, we three have
continued to circle around you,

384
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,000
patiently waiting
in a holding pattern.

385
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,708
We've grown weary
of playing that game,

386
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,083
Princess...

387
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,166
So we decided to make
things more interesting

388
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,916
by placing a little wager.

389
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,833
What kind of wager?

390
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,166
Well, we have heard there
is an Earth Clan pup

391
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,000
who's been stuck to
your side as of late.

392
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,541
Rumor has it the two of you
are quite fond of one another.

393
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,333
Akira has nothing
to do with this!

394
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,958
I'm told the dog is
currently in corridor

395
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,125
Put us through ...

396
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,500
I know that
you're watching.

397
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,875
Can you hear me, werewolf?

398
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,291
Upon our arrival
to the bund...

399
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,541
each of us released a deadly
assassin from our clan...

400
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,166
They've been ordered
to hunt you down.

401
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,208
We've chosen our strongest

402
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,333
and most vicious subordinates
to stand off against you.

403
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,583
None of their targets have
ever survived an attack.

404
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,208
Those voices!

405
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,583
The Three Clans?!

406
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,416
In case you hadn't already
noticed you are their target...

407
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,333
The beloved wolf pup
of Princess Mina.

408
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,833
The master of the assassin
who slays you by dawn...

409
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,750
Will be the winner
of our wager...

410
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,125
and shall marry
Princess Mina.

411
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,958
You should feel honored
to have been chosen

412
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,041
to take on such an
important role.

413
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,750
Now die.

414
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,125
Damn it!

415
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,791
Well... Let the dog
hunt begin, yes?

416
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,916
Stop it! Call off your
assassins at once!

417
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,500
I don't understand
why you're upset...

418
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,250
The boy is just
a lowly servant.

419
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,833
No, that's not true...!
Akira means much more to me-

420
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,625
Because he's
your beloved...?

421
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,500
You can't fool me, Princess.

422
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,708
He is nothing but
a lowly werewolf...

423
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,208
You cannot be with him...

424
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,666
It simply can't happen...

425
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,250
The two of you are separated
by lineage and lifespan...

426
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,083
It's impossible for you
to make a life together...

427
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,750
He is of the other world.

428
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,416
Princess, you
need to realize...

429
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,083
whether you like it or not,
you only have three options.

430
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,708
If you choose him over
us then you'll be turning

431
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,500
your back on the
entire vampire race.

432
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,875
But, the choice
is yours...

433
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,583
Akira...

434
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,750
No matter how much the
butterfly may wish for it...

435
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,958
He can never be
with the flower.

436
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,291
Don't let their
words get to you!

437
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,708
I'm gonna make it
through this...

438
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,208
I promise...

439
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,791
Princess!

440
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,083
If you gentlemen are
finished with your business...

441
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,625
you may retire
to the salon.

442
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,875
We're not finished.

443
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,750
No...

444
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,666
At the request of the
three noble lords...

445
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,833
And as required by the ancient
pact of the royal family...

446
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,208
I have been sent to
perform a purity inquiry.

447
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:24,458
[Music]

448
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:34,458
[Music]

449
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:43,916
[Music]

450
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,416
Dance with the
Vampire Maids!

451
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,833
Part 10!

452
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,208
Put your arm into it!

453
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,791
You can't shine
silverware like that!

454
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,250
Um... Okay.

455
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,916
Say "sir" before
and after you reply!

456
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,458
Sir! Yes, sir!

457
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,750
Tell me about yourself!

458
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,041
I'm a cute girl
with glasses!

459
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,250
You can do
better than that!

460
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,708
I'm a cute girl with
glasses and big boobs!

461
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,500
How old is your boyfriend?!

462
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,541
I said how old?!

463
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,708
Uh, way too young!

464
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:42,875
And what's his name?

465
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,500
-It's Yuzuru...
-Louder!

466
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,125
We're really
whipping her into shape!

467
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,125
The Maid Squad is
gonna be unstoppable!
