1
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,833
Somehow, the princess snuck out
of the executive building

2
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,375
without an escort.

3
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,458
She's likely headed for the
residential block of the bund;

4
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,708
where the developers live.

5
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,458
Go find her!

6
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,791
Geez...

7
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,958
Mailman, Mailman

8
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,916
Do your duty.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,833
Send this letter

10
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,666
To my cutie.

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,541
Don't you stop

12
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,291
And don't you delay.

13
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,458
It has to get to her

14
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,041
Right away.

15
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,708
How many days is
it gonna take?

16
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:02,875
One...

17
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,375
Two...

18
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,250
Three...

19
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,791
Four...

20
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,500
You can do it...!

21
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,250
Six...

22
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,875
Seven....

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,875
You're not very good
at jumping rope.

24
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,333
I just need a little
more practice!

25
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,416
I'll show you!

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,833
The next time I
jump I swear to you

27
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,833
that I will cross the
10 jump threshold!

28
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,833
But you can't
even make it to 8!

29
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,250
I guess you've
got a point...

30
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,041
Then I'll make it to 10.

31
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,583
One...

32
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,791
Two...

33
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,000
Three...

34
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,333
Four...

35
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:47,125
[Music]

36
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,375
Since revealing herself
to the human race,

37
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,500
Princess Mina Tepes,

38
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,083
the supposed vampire ruler,

39
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,750
has repeatedly given
the same statement

40
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,291
each time she's
been questioned.

41
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,333
The only exception being
her sworn testimony

42
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,500
before parliament.

43
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,458
She's just announced

44
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,916
that she will be holding
a press conference

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,416
to set the record straight.

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,708
As you ordered,

47
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,625
all evidence of the attack
has been cleared...

48
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,916
And Nanami Shinonome is being
treated as an absentee.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,333
Does Akira know the truth?

50
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,375
No ma'am, we've completely
covered our tracks.

51
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,625
Well done.

52
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,958
Hey Princess,
sorry to interrupt,

53
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,000
but Nelly asked me to
bring you a fresh towel.

54
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,750
Thank you, Akira...

55
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,291
You can leave
it on the chair.

56
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,250
This doesn't make
you uncomfortable?

57
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,583
Not in the least.

58
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,500
I've come to realize
you're just messing with me.

59
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, I think...

60
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,916
If the special
zone is established

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,208
it would be an unprecedented
event and a story

62
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,333
any journalist
would die for.

63
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,000
Tell us what you think
about Princess Mina Tepes,

64
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,708
the vampire ruler.

65
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,083
I'll refrain,

66
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,000
but at this time,
I will say that

67
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,500
my opinion may change

68
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,708
depending upon the outcome
of the press conference.

69
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,791
I don't know about this...

70
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,208
You sure it's a good idea?

71
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,583
Well...

72
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,583
look who's suddenly concerned
about my well-being.

73
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,791
Please don't do that.

74
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,875
You know how much I hate the
smell of that damn shade gel.

75
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,500
You're so mean...

76
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,875
We're doing our utmost
to ensure security.

77
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,833
All members of the press
coming onto the bund

78
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,708
are being checked thoroughly.

79
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,416
Their personal effects
are being inspected

80
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,708
for foreign objects,

81
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,041
and they're undergoing
physical examinations.

82
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,916
We're testing...

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,500
to ensure that
they're all human.

84
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,125
Hello?

85
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:00,875
Princess.

86
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,291
I was wondering when
you'd show up, old fox.

87
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,166
Your timing is impeccable.

88
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,458
It's been a long time...

89
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,708
dear Juneau.

90
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,333
Dear Princess...

91
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,166
Please know that I, Juneau
the Marquis of Dermaille...

92
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,250
am pleased to look upon your
lovely visage once again.

93
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,541
I see you haven't given up

94
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,375
your tongue twisting
manner of speech...

95
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,125
Tell me... what brings you
all this way, old friend?

96
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,708
May we speak privately...?

97
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,000
This is not a discussion

98
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,208
I would care for your
guard dogs to overhear.

99
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,458
The Earth clan are
dignified knights...

100
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,750
They have been protecting the
royal family for centuries...

101
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:43,916
You should not
speak of them

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
in such a disrespectful
manner.

103
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,500
So... the princess has
resorted to guard dogs

104
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,416
and a henchwoman
of lowly blood!

105
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,875
You heard what he said.

106
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,541
I came here to assist the
princess, not to bicker.

107
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,041
My soldiers will protect
her from this point forward.

108
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,833
I suggest you call off
your dogs, my lady.

109
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,416
And why don't you go
back to the forest...?

110
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,083
Return to whence you came
from and find a new master!

111
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,250
Who the hell is
that old man?

112
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,458
Juneau, the Marquis
of Dermaille...

113
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,500
He's the head of a
line of nobles...

114
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,125
ones who serve the
Tepes royal family.

115
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,125
I hope you'll forgive
me, Sir Wolf...

116
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,916
I never should've given
in to his provocations.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,666
I know that's
what he wanted.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,416
He must have felt the
development of the bund...

119
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,291
was simply too important an
event to be overlooked...

120
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,083
I assume he's come here to
secure his own interests...

121
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,583
which puts us in an
advantageous position.

122
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes, that's true.

123
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,833
And if that's the case...

124
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,166
we need only do what is
expected, nothing more...

125
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,416
Lady Vera.

126
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,541
Not to interfere,

127
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,541
but have you and Sir Wolf had
an opportunity to talk yet?

128
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,041
No, we haven't...

129
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,666
I was told he's my father,

130
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,416
but I don't have
any memory of him.

131
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,000
I gotta say...

132
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,583
this whole thing's
caught me off guard.

133
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,083
How?

134
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,125
I didn't think vampire society
would be so complicated.

135
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,333
It's really not too
difficult to understand...

136
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,125
You see, the royal family
has absolute authority...

137
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,958
Therefore, we have
constant battles

138
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,375
between lineages that hope
to gain that power.

139
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,666
The princess ardently desires
to develop this bund...

140
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,625
I will not allow anyone to take
advantage of the situation

141
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,791
or prevent that
from happening.

142
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,916
I will do whatever
it takes...

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,500
to make it happen...

144
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,000
Anything at all.

145
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,666
Can I ask you something?

146
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,791
Why are you so
devoted to Mina?

147
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,041
Well, because she
means everything to me.

148
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,958
Now let me ask you
something, Akira.

149
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you think you're worthy

150
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,708
of being a servant
to the princess?

151
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,458
Do you think you'll be able to
live up to her expectations?

152
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,541
I'm just going to do
all I can for right now.

153
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,458
I don't know if I'm
worthy or not...

154
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,666
I don't...

155
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,041
But I made a promise
to her a long time.

156
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,750
Those are property of
the Marquis of Dermaille.

157
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,583
So they're
already arriving.

158
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,583
Geez, they just
keep coming...

159
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,708
I know and this is
just the beginning.

160
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,166
There's just so many...

161
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,958
The scoundrel who
attacked the princess

162
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,416
in front of you
the other day.

163
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,625
He was a vampire... correct?

164
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,875
Yeah...

165
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,375
The thought of a vampire
threatening her life

166
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,125
is completely inconceivable.

167
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,166
Why? Because she has
absolute authority?

168
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,458
No, it's more
complicated than that.

169
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,875
Why has the princess
chosen this place...?

170
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,583
She doesn't belong in the
far reaches of Asia...

171
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,875
It's unthinkable...!

172
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,333
I cannot allow it!

173
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,083
My lord!

174
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,333
What?!

175
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:40,958
C4...?!

176
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,333
Do we know who?!

177
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,208
Well, what do you mean
"more complicated"?

178
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,041
The death of the princess
would be catastrophic for us...

179
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,833
It... would mean the end
of the vampire race.

180
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,041
Interesting ...

181
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,875
The wind's starting
to pick up.

182
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,000
We're coming to you live

183
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,333
from the Central Management
Center on Tokyo Landfill #0.

184
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,791
An unprecedented press
conference with Mina Tepes

185
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,083
is being held here today.

186
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,083
Everyone is waiting
with anticipation

187
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,208
to hear the message of
the ruler of the vampires

188
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,000
and the owner
of this island.

189
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,208
I'd like to take
this opportunity

190
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,041
to thank each of you for
accepting my invitation.

191
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,416
I promise to answer
all of your questions

192
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,083
to the best of my ability.

193
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,125
So you may ask to
your hearts' content.

194
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,041
The conference
has begun...

195
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,625
This blunder of
theirs is a disgrace.

196
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,375
We'd better get
going, Vera...

197
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,125
We've gotta go
clean up their mess.

198
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,708
It has been discovered

199
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,583
that one of the agents
I brought along with me

200
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,916
has gone missing...

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,250
We are attempting to locate
his whereabouts now.

202
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,166
And you think this
man is responsible

203
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,333
for stealing the bomb?

204
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes... That is my suspicion...

205
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,250
He was a newly
recruited agent

206
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,000
who joined shortly
before our departure.

207
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,958
Therefore, I am unfamiliar
with his background.

208
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,291
So you're saying, you
have no idea who he is?

209
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,500
Yes, ma'am...

210
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,791
I'm truly sorry,

211
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,291
but your announcement
of the press conference

212
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,833
caught me by surprise.

213
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,541
If I had been
told in advance,

214
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,583
I would have had the time

215
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,125
to conduct a more
thorough screening

216
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,875
of our new agents.

217
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,583
A deadly weapon
has gone missing...

218
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,375
The princess is at
risk because of you!

219
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,708
Silence, wench...!

220
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,791
Although his background
is unknown...

221
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,833
at least we know that
the person suspected

222
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,166
of stealing the
bomb is a vampire.

223
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,750
You can deny it
all you want,

224
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,125
but the reality is that
there are vampires out there

225
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,333
who would harm
our mistress.

226
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,791
I realize the severity
of the situation.

227
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,208
The princess is in danger

228
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,166
and I am partially at fault...

229
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,833
However, simply knowing that
the suspect is a vampire

230
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,750
will help us to keep
her protected.

231
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,916
Your logic doesn't
make any sense!

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,041
I've heard enough.

233
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,958
The press conference will
go on as scheduled...

234
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,166
Dermaille, you will remain
in charge of security

235
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,250
as I have ordered.

236
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,500
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,541
Princess...

238
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,625
Damn it... I can't
believe she trusts him.

239
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,250
So... any word on the bomb?

240
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,166
We've been searching,

241
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,083
but we haven't
had any luck.

242
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,875
It's gonna be
difficult to find him.

243
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,250
There are so many
places to hide,

244
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,166
since nobody's really
moved here yet.

245
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,333
He has to come out
sooner or later.

246
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,833
Judging by the
timing of the theft,

247
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,083
I think it's safe to assume

248
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,541
that he intends
to use the bomb

249
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,125
during the press
conference.

250
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,000
The question is:
where is he hiding?

251
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,708
No way...

252
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,458
First of all, on behalf
of all of us here,

253
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,000
I would like to thank you for
answering our questions today.

254
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,416
I was wondering if you
could tell us about

255
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,125
establishing the
Special Zone.

256
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,541
How are you able to
get the government...

257
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,708
Uh, Princess?

258
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,125
My apologies...

259
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,000
I had imagined the
first question

260
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,583
would be something
more fundamental.

261
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,333
I was expecting "Are
you really a vampire?"

262
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,500
Something like that.

263
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,000
I assume after the
"Scales of Astrea" show

264
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,875
there's no need for me to
answer such questions.

265
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,250
It seems that program
turned many into believers.

266
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,833
However, I'd guess that

267
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,041
there are probably more
skeptics here today.

268
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,000
But that's to be expected.

269
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,208
As journalists, you
forsake sensationalism

270
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,166
and deliver the hard facts.

271
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,041
I assume what you'd
really like to know

272
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,416
is how a little girl
from a foreign country

273
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,583
plans to negotiate
to obtain this bund

274
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,666
from the Japanese
government...

275
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,375
So, shall I start there?

276
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,625
Exactly!

277
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,416
That's the question
we've all been asking.

278
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,708
She must be running
some kind of scheme.

279
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,125
What does she
mean by "bund"?

280
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,541
Like the one in Shanghai.

281
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,333
The answer to that
is one word...

282
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,833
Money.

283
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,958
This government's failed
economic policies

284
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,958
have caused the national
deficit to skyrocket

285
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,875
to one quadrillion yen.

286
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,000
I am prepared to assume
the entire amount

287
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,666
as soon as the
Special Zone is approved.

288
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,125
As I'm sure you're aware,
this country's economy

289
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,833
has been on the
rise recently...

290
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,375
And do you know why?

291
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,958
Just prior to
this upswing,

292
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,000
we transferred many of your
failing corporations

293
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,708
into our control.

294
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,208
We are also responsible

295
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,833
for many of your large scale,
public works projects,

296
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,208
including Landfill #0.

297
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,500
We did this for you to
lay the groundwork...

298
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,208
You see, by helping
you grow stronger,

299
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,000
we thereby improved
our chances

300
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,833
of getting you to
help us in return.

301
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,333
Let me put this bluntly,

302
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,500
if the Special Zone
is not approved...

303
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,250
I'll have no choice but to
withdraw our financial support.

304
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,125
That's blackmail!

305
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,166
Why should we continue
to give to someone

306
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,250
who refuses to
return the favor?

307
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,250
I'm sorry, but we did
not come to this country

308
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,291
to be charitable.

309
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,041
I would like to take
this opportunity

310
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,458
to clarify what this means

311
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,541
and what I'm asking of
the Japanese government

312
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,500
and its citizens.

313
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,708
I currently have ownership
of Landfill #0...

314
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,958
Meaning we have exclusive
land and building

315
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,416
rights on the bund...

316
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,291
However, I would
like this land...

317
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,708
to be recognized as leased
territory belonging to us.

318
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,375
I demand that there be no
term limit on the lease.

319
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,041
The vampire bund will
belong to us indefinitely.

320
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,583
It will be a settlement

321
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,916
much like Hong Kong
and Shanghai once were.

322
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,958
Land that exists
within a country,

323
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,500
but is actually a separate
nation entirely.

324
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,166
We will not be Japanese,

325
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,541
but a chaotic mixture
of different cultures.

326
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,916
That is my desire...

327
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,916
I want to create a
kingdom of vampires,

328
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,708
by vampires, for vampires...!

329
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,000
On the vampire bund!

330
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,000
What do you want at
a time like this?

331
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,791
-Old man!
-Old man...?

332
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,000
Who is this?

333
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,791
The members of
the press...

334
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,791
did you check them as
they came in today?

335
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,708
Don't be ridiculous, boy...!

336
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:57,916
Of course we checked them...

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,958
Each person was
physically searched

338
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,083
and their
equipment examined.

339
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,750
Are you sure
they're all human?!

340
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,125
Did you test them at the
door to the interview

341
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,416
to make sure there're
no vampires?

342
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,916
That's not necessary.

343
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,916
We tested everyone
coming onto the island.

344
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,666
What is it, Akira...!

345
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,375
What's going on?

346
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,791
We have to hurry...

347
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,500
I smelled shade gel on
one of the reporters

348
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,625
who walked past us.

349
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,125
But we ran tests

350
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,000
to ensure that everyone
who arrived was human.

351
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,541
Someone must've changed.

352
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,625
You don't mean...

353
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,833
That's the only
explanation...

354
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,000
One of those
reporters was human

355
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,416
when they got to the island,

356
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,083
but they somehow became
a vampire while here.

357
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,541
Why would anyone do that?!

358
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,416
Because a vampire
can hide a bomb...

359
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,875
Get it...?

360
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,458
Remove a few organs and it'd
be easy to smuggle inside.

361
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,666
Lady Vera...

362
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,666
We found a large amount of
blood in the hotel room

363
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,708
of one of the reporters
at the conference.

364
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,583
We've also come across
internal organs

365
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,875
that our suspect has
recently removed.

366
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:55,875
Who is it?

367
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,333
CNN newscaster...

368
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,583
Nicole Edelman.

369
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,416
Miss Tepes,

370
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,791
may I ask how you were able to
afford the astronomical sum of

371
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,291
one quadrillion yen?

372
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,291
My ancestors have
quietly been amassing

373
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,625
an unparalleled fortune
for centuries...

374
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,125
We were already wealthy

375
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,375
when your people were
working with stone tools...

376
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,375
So splurging on
something like this...

377
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,166
would hardly even make
a dent in our finances.

378
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,208
The thought of that much
money is incomprehensible.

379
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,291
And how can you expect
us to believe you?

380
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,041
After all, this is
based on the premise

381
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,041
that you're
actually a vampire.

382
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,500
I knew we would reach this
point sooner or later.

383
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,041
I'm at a loss right now...

384
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,125
I simply have no way to
prove to you all

385
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,875
that I am indeed a vampire...

386
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,958
Surely you don't expect me to
expose myself to sunlight...

387
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,083
I could drive a stake
through my heart,

388
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,791
but that'd only prove
my own mortality.

389
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,666
I know... I could always just
suck the blood of one of you

390
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,083
to prove my point.

391
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,833
My, my...

392
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,416
I never would've imagined
that I'd actually have a taker.

393
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,208
Are you really who
you claim to be...?

394
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,166
Are you the ruler
of the vampires...

395
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,583
I don't need to
suck your blood...

396
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,916
Because it's obvious

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,041
that someone has
already beat me to it.

398
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,875
Vera!

399
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,208
Rip her open!

400
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,208
There's no time!

401
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,000
It's already
been activated!

402
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,083
Hurry and disarm
it, Akira!

403
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,000
One of the first things young
Beowulf soldiers are taught is

404
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,208
how to disarm a bomb.

405
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,125
But I don't remember
any of that stuff!

406
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,916
We must leave, Princess...

407
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,416
It's too dangerous!

408
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,666
Calm down, fools!

409
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,125
Quiet!

410
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,291
Are you there, Wolf?

411
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,000
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, ma'am.

412
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,291
-You know what to do.
-Right...

413
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,791
Akira...! Go to elevator 3!

414
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,916
We have temporarily
disabled the car.

415
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,041
I want you to throw the
bomb down the shaft!

416
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,375
It will be fine
down there...

417
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,250
Do it!

418
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,750
Open... the doors!

419
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,583
It exploded and that's it...?

420
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,708
Hey, Vera...?

421
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,083
What the hell's down there?

422
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,000
You'll find out
soon enough.

423
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,000
Surely that was enough to
prove to all of you skeptics

424
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,958
that vampires do exist.

425
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,541
What you have seen...

426
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,875
and what you have heard...

427
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,666
spread it throughout
the world!

428
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,000
Tell everyone what
happened here today.

429
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,416
This is our world,
the world of darkness...

430
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,541
Where blood and death
rule above all else.

431
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,375
But there is no need
for any of you to worry.

432
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,250
For as long as you remain
good neighbors to us...

433
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,458
I promise that we will
never be a threat to you

434
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,833
or to your loved ones.

435
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,041
But if you ever
disappoint me,

436
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,958
the story will be different...

437
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,625
That is all I have to
say to you for now...

438
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,916
I bid you goodnight.

439
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,541
You may return
to your world.

440
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,375
Prime Minister...

441
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,833
The bipartisan coalition
has just submitted

442
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,791
the Special Zone
Establishment Bill!

443
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,791
Sorry Princess,

444
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,250
but I'm not so sure about
that old Marquis guy...

445
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,541
Shouldn't you
have fired him,

446
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,250
or at least demoted him?

447
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,041
Don't worry
about Dermaille.

448
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,333
Killing me and
ending our race

449
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,250
wouldn't benefit
him in any way.

450
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,166
Besides, he would never
have the courage to do so.

451
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,875
Your success on this
mission means that

452
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,125
Juneau can no longer
disparage you...

453
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,208
Keep up the good
work, my friend.

454
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,333
Hold on...

455
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,166
You mean you meant
for this to happen?

456
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,416
I can't tell you how
much it meant to me,

457
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,208
seeing you out there
fighting for me,

458
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,708
without any regard for
your own well-being.

459
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,916
That's the Akira Kaburagi...

460
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,333
that I've come
to know so well.

461
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,166
I guess that means Dermaille
wasn't the only one being

462
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,833
tested today, was he?

463
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,208
I am fully aware

464
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,958
that you've had considerable
doubts about me...

465
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,416
Consider us even.

466
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,625
Seems like the more
time I spend with you...

467
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,208
the more confused I get.

468
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,833
One minute you're blackmailing
an entire nation...

469
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:38,791
and the next
you're pouting,

470
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,666
because you can't jump rope.

471
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,583
Hold on...
How do you know that?!

472
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,916
I saw everything;

473
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,833
even your promise to
"make it all the way to 10."

474
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,291
What...?

475
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,541
The only reason I even
played that ridiculous game

476
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,875
is because those children
insisted upon it!

477
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:53,958
You know...

478
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,500
It was nice to see you...

479
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,541
like that.

480
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,791
I mean, watching
you play jump rope

481
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,125
with those human children...

482
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,583
It was almost
like you were...

483
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,916
Those children aren't human,
they're fangless vampires.

484
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,125
They're members
of our race

485
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,458
who have chosen to
remove their fangs

486
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,416
and who have
rejected the act

487
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,166
of sucking the
blood of humans.

488
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,166
In fact, there are many
"fangless" among the volunteers

489
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,375
who are working hard to
help establish the bund.

490
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,541
Although they have
become vampires,

491
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,166
they don't want to lose
touch with their humanity.

492
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,291
Unfortunately, because of
the way they've chosen

493
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,750
to live their lives,

494
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,958
they are persecuted by both
humans and vampires alike.

495
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,833
But once the bund
is established...

496
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,250
they will have a place
that they can call home...

497
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,708
Finally.

498
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,208
Is that why you're
building the bund?

499
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,416
For these "fangless" vampires?

500
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,458
Sadly, no.

501
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,916
I wish it were.

502
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,250
Suddenly, the existence of
vampires became a reality...

503
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,083
Some chose to dismiss
it as a strange incident

504
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,041
in a far-off corner
of the Orient.

505
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,250
Others scoffed,

506
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,791
claiming the attack at
the press conference

507
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,250
was nothing more
than fiction

508
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,708
created by a
television show.

509
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,750
Although outwardly they
seemed skeptical, deep inside,

510
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,625
everyone was now
forced to believe.

511
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,250
Little did we know then,

512
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,541
but the ripples caused
by this quiet shock

513
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:14,416
were silently and steadily
closing in on Akira and I...

514
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,291
And there was nothing
we could do...

515
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,666
to prepare ourselves
for what would happen.

516
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:26,958
[Music]

517
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,833
Dance with the vampire maids!

518
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,333
Part 4!

519
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,041
So what's troubling
you, young man?

520
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,000
I have amnesia and it's
causing problems for me.

521
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,583
I don't even recognize
my own father!

522
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,583
I'm just not sure I can
keep up with everyone.

523
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm lost without
my memories-

524
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,291
Don't let them get to you...!

525
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,916
So you have amnesia...
big deal!

526
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,583
That's a part of what
makes you who you are!

527
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,875
Maybe it'll get
you out of work!

528
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,208
If I were you, I'd milk
it as long as you can.

529
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,541
Uh...

530
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:14,958
Okay, take care!
Next patient!

531
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,333
Our coworker isn't taking
her work seriously.

532
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,708
What do you think
we should do?

533
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:19,916
I think you should
tell your coworker...

534
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,041
We're talking about you, dummy!
