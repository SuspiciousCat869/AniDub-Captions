2
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,250
I think that look suits
you, my little piglet.

3
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,500
It's fitting of
your anguished soul.

4
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,541
Do what I ask of you and
I will grant your wish.

5
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,833
"What does eternity mean?"

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,875
the boy asked the
ruler of monsters.

7
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,750
Eternal life...

8
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,708
Eternal love...

9
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,750
The eternal
flow of time...

10
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,958
At first glance these all
appear to be wondrous things,

11
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,500
but they can also
be very cruel...

12
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,000
Forever is a long time...

13
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,291
It has been one month

14
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,875
since the vampire
bund's establishment...

15
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,916
Today, Princess Mina Tepes
released this message:

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,916
I thank you all from
the bottom of my heart

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,916
for your great
understanding

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,083
and cooperation in regard to the
vampire bund's establishment.

19
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,666
What language
is she speaking?

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,083
It's ancient Sumerian.

21
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,625
Why not just
speak English?

22
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,666
Those subtitles
don't match at all...

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,416
What she's really
saying is...

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,375
"Let's settle this
once and for all...

25
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,166
meet me tonight
at sundown...

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,416
I'll be waiting for
you on the bund."

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,666
What does that mean?

28
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,083
She's sending
a challenge...

29
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,041
Meant for Hysterica.

30
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,583
It's a daring move...

31
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,416
I hope she knows
what she's doing.

32
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:50,291
[Music]

33
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,250
We found these vials

34
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,458
hidden inside the
bodies of the vampires

35
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,541
who were working
for Hysterica.

36
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,833
According to our analysis,

37
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,583
the contents are a
chemically- synthesized,

38
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,416
cellulose-based drug.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,625
We found that when
this drug is mixed

40
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,208
with the blood of a vampire...

41
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,625
a chemical reaction
is triggered,

42
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,625
causing spontaneous combustion.

43
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,125
It's called Agni's Blood.

44
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,833
In medieval times,
vampire warriors

45
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,333
who were captured
by their enemy

46
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,958
would bite down
on a tube of it

47
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,625
that they had hidden
in their mouth.

48
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,375
The resulting explosion
would completely

49
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,875
obliterate any
enemies nearby.

50
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,250
Correct...

51
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,500
However, this is a new and
enhanced version of it,

52
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,833
which has benefitted
from modern science.

53
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,625
What would Hysterica use
something like that for?

54
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,750
My guess would be
suicide bombings...

55
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,166
Upon first glance,

56
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,291
vampires look like
ordinary humans;

57
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,708
no one would suspect that
they were a walking bomb.

58
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,333
She's going to plant vampires
throughout the city,

59
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,041
then detonate them.

60
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,708
But what is her goal?

61
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,958
She wants to
remind the humans

62
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,625
that vampires are still
a viable threat.

63
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,416
If Vera is correct
and she is indeed

64
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,083
under the guidance
of Telomere...

65
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,500
then we have to
stop her at once.

66
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,833
Here's the thing...

67
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,166
I realize that this is
an... enhanced version,

68
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,958
but Agni's Blood isn't strong
enough to do much damage.

69
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,333
So that would limit her
possible targets, right?

70
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,250
That's true...

71
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,166
But if it was detonated
in a crowded area,

72
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,916
the resulting carnage
would be unfathomable.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,166
My point exactly...

74
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,833
These Agni's Blood capsules

75
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,291
have a lethal range
of 65 feet...

76
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,833
And they could easily
kill thousands

77
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,666
if set off in an
enclosed area.

78
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,083
So what will they do?

79
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,958
They will attack
the subways.

80
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,958
I'm almost certain
they're going to attempt

81
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,125
to attack from underground
using the subway system...

82
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,791
I imagine they'll target
the lines that pose

83
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,291
the least risk in
terms of mobility...

84
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,875
We have to be
ready for them.

85
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,833
But then how is she planning
on issuing the orders?

86
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,375
Via cell phone...

87
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,041
We have reason to
believe that Hysterica

88
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,750
has been using a cell phone
to send self-destruct codes.

89
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,541
As you all know, there are
cell antennas everywhere...

90
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,416
It is practically
impossible to avoid them,

91
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,041
so instead we'll have
to come up with a way

92
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,041
to block their signal.

93
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,291
3000 Beowulf soldiers
have started searching

94
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,500
for the enemy
throughout the city...

95
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,416
I'm afraid I have
to get going, too.

96
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,166
Don't worry, Yuki...

97
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,041
This is what I
was born to do...

98
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,375
I mean, the Earth Clan was
brought about for this...

99
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,083
to hunt down vampires.

100
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,916
We have 15,000 times
better hearing than humans...

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,666
and our sense of smell's
100,000 times stronger...

102
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,125
So I'm not worried;

103
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,083
sniffing them out underground
should be a cinch.

104
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,958
Just please be
careful Akira...

105
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,666
I will...

106
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,166
Enough about me, how are
things going with you...?

107
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,708
Did you talk to
Yuzuru's parents?

108
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,000
What'd they say?

109
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,458
When I finally got
a hold of them,

110
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,708
they asked if I would
look after him.

111
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,791
Apparently the establishment
of the vampire bund

112
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,500
made the stock
market go haywire,

113
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,958
so they don't have
any time for him...

114
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,791
How can they even call
themselves parents? !

115
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,916
I guess it must be
a bad situation

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,208
if it's got you all
bent out of shape.

117
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,083
But now... I understand
why they're close...

118
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,375
Yuzuru and Nanami don't
have anyone but each other.

119
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,583
I know. Nanami's life
certainly hasn't been easy...

120
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,000
Her parents divorced when
she was really young...

121
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,291
What do you think
the princess

122
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,166
is going to do about
the two of them...?

123
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,666
I'd hate for them
to be separated.

124
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,916
I dunno...

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,041
But I'm sure that she
has a couple ideas.

126
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,875
At least I hope so...

127
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,333
Something has to be done
to help those two...

128
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,791
It must be hard...

129
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,916
How are your
scratches doing...?

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,041
They aren't still
hurting you, are they?

131
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,625
No, I'm feeling
better now, thanks.

132
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,625
Um...

133
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,500
Do you mind if I
ask you something?

134
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,375
Oh, no, not at all.

135
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,625
I was just wondering,

136
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,875
how did you become
a vampire...?

137
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,458
I mean, were you
attacked by one of them,

138
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,541
like Nanami was?

139
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,791
No, I wasn't...

140
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,291
I became a vampire...

141
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,333
because I offered my blood
to our previous ruler...

142
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,958
Princess Mina's mother...

143
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,291
You see, I chose to become
a child of the darkness.

144
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,916
That doesn't
make any sense...

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,375
Who would choose to
become a vampire? !

146
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,291
I'm sorry, Vera.

147
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,833
That's fine...

148
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:09,500
I made the choice because I
deeply admired Queen Lucrezia...

149
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,291
I wanted to be by her side

150
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,166
and do what I could
to help her...

151
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,000
It's as simple as that.

152
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,916
Before the queen passed
away she called to me...

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,833
She asked that I take
care of Princess Mina ...

154
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,041
Since that day, the princess
has been my everything.

155
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,000
Vampires aren't as cold hearted
as most humans think...

156
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,791
We are beings who live
through our hearts...

157
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,625
With just one feeling a
vampire can live forever...

158
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,291
All it takes is
one feeling...?

159
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,916
This is Alpha Team.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,750
Two marks on Shinjuku
Station platform,

161
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,208
Marunouchi Line.

00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,333
Tango Team. One mark at
Nagatacho Station ticket gate,

163
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,791
Hanzomon Line.

164
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,041
Charlie Team.

165
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,375
Two marks in Tokyo
Station, Marunouchi Line.

166
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,750
Omega Team.

167
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,708
Two marks in Toranomon
Station, Ginza Line.

168
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,000
Zebra Team.

169
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,083
One mark in Sakuradamon,
Yurakucho Line.

170
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,875
Three marks in
Kasumigaseki,

171
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,458
All clear in
Waseda- Tozai Line!

172
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,083
Listen up gentlemen,

173
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,708
I want you to
continue to scour

174
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,541
the subway stations
until you've identified

175
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,791
every last enemy.

176
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,625
But... do not engage until
the princess has nullified

177
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,416
the enemy's
self-destruct order.

178
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,041
Princess...

179
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,958
We have just detected
unidentified aircraft

180
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,583
approaching from
the Tokyo Bay area.

181
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,125
She's here...

182
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,125
How good of you to
come, Lady Hysterica.

183
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,916
I would never turn down
a personal invite

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,500
from you, Princess.

185
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,583
However, I must say
that I'm very curious

186
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,458
as to why you've
asked me here.

187
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,000
Let me get to the point,

188
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,125
I have no desire to
play your games...

189
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,500
Anyway, I'm sure that
you already know

190
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,000
what I'm up to by now.

191
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,708
Isn't this
country wonderful?

192
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,750
You can trust that
your cell phone

193
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,166
will work no matter
where you are,

194
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,375
whether you're underground

195
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,375
or 30 stories
up in the air.

196
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,750
Wasn't it Baudrillard
that once said ...

197
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,958
civilization revenges
itself upon Man?

198
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,875
My demands are extremely
simple, Princess...

199
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,791
I just want you to get in
that helicopter with me.

200
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,041
That's all you have to do

201
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,375
and we'll avoid any
kind of confrontation.

202
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,958
And isn't that
what's best?

203
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,541
You wouldn't want to get
civilians caught up in this,

204
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,083
would you?

205
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,416
Is that all...?

206
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,125
Well, it certainly does
sound extremely simple...

207
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,208
And I'm sure it would
be totally risk-free.

208
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,875
However...

209
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,500
You never know when there
may be an unforeseen accident.

210
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,500
You bitch...! Don't you care
what happens to the humans? !

211
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,916
Calm down, Hysterica,

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,750
you wouldn't want your anger
to get the best of you.

213
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,541
Damn you!

214
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,250
You haven't
even noticed...

215
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,291
Look down.

216
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,666
Now!

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,500
I don't think you
realize the severity

218
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,958
of what you've done.

219
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,250
Now thousands of humans
in the subway system

220
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,541
are about to die.

221
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,833
And it's all
because of you...

222
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,958
Princess Mina!

223
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,708
What the hell is this?

224
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,125
Correct me if I'm wrong,

225
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,666
but I believe it's
called chaff.

226
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,166
I know they look
like nothing more

227
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,833
than scraps of
aluminum foil...

228
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:34,958
But they're capable
of jamming any

229
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,625
and all electrical
signals...

230
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,750
They completely block
all communications.

231
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,833
Surely you didn't
think I'd decided...

232
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,875
to throw you into this
building without reason.

233
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,916
You see, this particular
structure is 30-stories high,

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,416
which basically
makes it one, big box...

235
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,458
And I've filled this box
with all kinds of signal

236
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,833
disrupting materials...

237
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,333
As well as
interference from

238
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,375
every type of jamming device
I could possibly find.

239
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,833
Which means it'd be
impossible for a wavelength

240
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,541
of any kind to leak
out of the building.

241
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,208
I'm sorry but...

242
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,833
I don't think you'll
find a signal in here.

243
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,875
Alright, knights
of mine...

244
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,625
the hunt is on...

245
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,375
Toranomon, clear!

246
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,375
Otemachi B, clear!

247
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,583
Wipe them out!

248
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,166
If you miss even
a single target,

249
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,583
then we're all done for!

250
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,375
I hate to say it, but
you've lost this round...

251
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,041
And just so you know...

252
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,791
every exit in this building
has been sealed shut.

253
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,708
There's only one
way out of here...

254
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,041
You're not going
anywhere, Hysterica!

255
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,000
Can you hear me up there,
my little piglet...?

256
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,208
You haven't given up and
died on me, have you?

257
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,833
I want you to get
to the roof...!

258
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,458
Use your cell phone to
send out the order!

259
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,916
If you do this for
me I promise you...

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,041
I promise that I'll free
you from my service...

261
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,750
Then you can finally
be with that boy.

262
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,458
Yuzuru...

263
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,083
Yuzuru...

264
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,041
Don't do it, Nanami!

265
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,750
So much for your plan,

266
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,375
it appears that my
direct transmissions

267
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,583
have no problem
going through!

268
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,541
You may be ruler
of the vampires,

269
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,458
but I doubt that even

270
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,666
you could make
it through

271
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,875
a point-blank explosion
unscathed.

272
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,833
Go ahead and
try something...

273
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,916
One move and I'll blow
you to the moon...

274
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
All I need is your head
to take back with me.

275
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,250
So I can prove to everyone
that I've defeated you.

276
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,666
Princess!

277
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,208
Don't forget who you're
dealing with here...

278
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,500
Veratos!

279
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,375
I am not the innocent
girl you once knew...

280
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,250
I will kill to get my way!

281
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,375
Alpha Team here...

282
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,750
We have 2 targets
that are on the run.

283
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,333
Target B has just
been cleared...

284
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,541
Found the other one?

285
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,416
I'm in pursuit now!

286
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,208
Hold it!

287
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,333
Hiko? !

288
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,375
Kill him, Akira!

289
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,916
No... Hiko...!

290
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,875
Wait!

291
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,250
Yuzuru...

292
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,708
Yuzuru...

293
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,791
Nanami...

294
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,333
Oh, Yuzuru...

295
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,750
My Yuzuru...

296
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,416
Yuzuru!

297
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,375
Please...

298
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,375
Come to me...

299
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,291
You're her last
hope, Yuzuru.

300
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,833
It's up to you now.

301
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,875
A master's control is
extremely powerful,

302
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,291
nearly impossible to disobey.

303
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,708
Although that is the case,
resisting an obsession

304
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,208
is even harder for a vampire.

305
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,625
Do you know what
Nanami's obsession is?

306
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,458
-Is it me?
-That's correct...

307
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,375
As a vampire she is
completely obsessed ...

308
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,875
And the stronger that her
obsession is for you...

309
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,416
the better our
chances will be of

310
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,250
pulling her over
to our side.

311
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,125
She'll be torn between her
duty and her instinct...

312
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,208
Hopefully our
plan will work.

313
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,416
Please, Nanami...

314
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,458
Won't you come to me...?

315
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,958
Please?

316
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,291
Why're you just
standing around...?!

317
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,250
Get moving already!

318
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,583
No, Nanami!

319
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,958
Look at me!

320
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,625
You want me, don't you? !

321
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,875
Yes... I will be all yours...

322
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,291
if you'll come to me!

323
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,625
Nanami... I'm sorry...

324
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,375
Hiko!

325
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,416
Wait! Hiko!

326
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,125
Everyone move to the
back of the train!

327
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,541
Hey, Akira...

328
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,916
Hey, dude...

329
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,375
Man, you're a lot faster
than I thought you'd be...!

330
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,750
I really had to run
to catch up with you...

331
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,250
There's no need to be
worried, everything's cool...

332
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,708
I won't hurt you;

333
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,875
I just want the two
of us to talk... 'kay?

334
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,500
It's too late...

335
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,875
I didn't mean for
this to happen...

336
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,458
I thought that things were going
to be different, y'know...?

337
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,750
But they're not...

338
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,250
Nothing has
changed at all.

339
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,666
Listen...

340
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,833
The weak will always
be that way...

341
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,625
And the strong will always
take advantage of them...

342
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,916
I guess that's just the
way the world works.

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,208
I can't keep on
living like this...

344
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,125
I just can't
do it anymore.

345
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,958
No, don't say that,
Hiko...!

346
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,208
Things can be different;
don't just give up...!

347
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,416
Let's talk about this;
I'm here for you!

348
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,958
Akira...

349
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,541
I wish I would've
talked to you more

350
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,083
when I had the chance...

351
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,000
None of this
would've happened...

352
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,708
It's not too late to
make a change...!

353
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,000
It's never too late!

354
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,416
I had one friend...

355
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,833
Thanks, Akira.

356
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,000
No!

357
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,250
Eternity...

358
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:49,666
It's like a long and winding
river with no end in sight.

359
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,333
Unless you have something
to keep you afloat...

360
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,458
you're sure to be
washed away and drown.

361
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,375
No!

362
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,500
Oh, no!

363
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,875
Vera!

364
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,000
Vera!

365
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,416
My, my...

366
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,791
What a sad ending to
your little love story...

367
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,375
But when you
think about it,

368
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,791
I guess that's the
way to go...

369
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,333
If you're going to die,

370
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,500
it might as well be at the
hands of the one you love...

371
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,458
Don't cry, my
little piglet.

372
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,875
I'll be sending your boyfriend
to hell right behind you.

373
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,125
You've caused enough
problems, you brat...

374
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,541
It's time to die!

375
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,125
What the hell...!
Who are you? !

376
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,083
Wait, is that
you, Princess? !

377
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,666
Look at you.

378
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,083
My goodness...

379
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,750
That's quite a
transformation.

380
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,291
I can't wait to tell
the Three Clans

381
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,166
that little Mina's
all grown up.

382
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,166
This is fantastic!

383
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,583
I'm sure they'd love to
know the truth about you.

384
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,041
No one who sees this form

385
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,250
ever lives to talk
about it, Hysterica.

386
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,458
Is that so...?

387
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,000
Then I'll be the first!

388
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,166
Oh no, those
innocent children

389
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,083
are going to fall
to their deaths!

390
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,875
That was impressive...

391
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,958
Not only did you dutifully
save a human brat,

392
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,666
but you also saved the
body of a dead girl.

393
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,916
Bravo, that's
quite a feat.

394
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,416
You're a piece of work.

395
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,458
Too bad it was in vain...

396
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,000
Once I send out the
self-destruct code it's over...

397
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,041
You'll be blown sky high.

398
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,416
There's still time
to stop me, though...

399
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,375
All you have to do is drop
the boy and the corpse,

400
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,250
then come up
here and kill me.

401
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,583
Go ahead...

402
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,125
You can't do it, can you?

403
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,666
I suspected as much.

404
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,583
You disappoint me...

405
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,291
I really don't think
that you're worthy

406
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,250
of being a leader of
our new world order.

407
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,708
You're with Telomere...

408
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,125
I knew it.

409
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,833
Guess I'm the winner
of this round...

410
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,625
Now you'll be forced
to live for eternity

411
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,333
as a slave to
the Three Clans!

412
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,875
I've got some information
you're going to love.

413
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,166
I know a secret
about Princess Mina.

414
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,916
Well hello, Hysterica.

415
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,250
Just what are you
so excited about?

416
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,875
But I didn't call you-

417
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,250
You're still alive...
my piglet...

418
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,666
but why...

419
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,833
are you...

420
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,875
attacking your master.

421
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,916
You are no longer her
master, Hysterica...

422
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,708
You see, the stake that
Nanami was stabbed with

423
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,666
was actually hollow.

424
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,625
Inside of it was
a DNA culture

425
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,166
that was extracted from
her new master...

426
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,458
me.

427
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,958
You took her over?

428
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,791
I was able to beat you
at your own game...

429
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,666
She is no longer
under your control;

430
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,166
she's mine now.
It's all over...

431
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,875
Who knows, you might
have been victorious

432
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,625
if only you had blown
us to smithereens

433
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,708
when you had the chance...

434
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,958
But you let your ego
get in the way...

435
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,333
And you were too arrogant
to realize your mistakes.

436
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,166
I win.

437
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,875
I thought we were going
to finish what we started,

438
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,666
Francesca? !

439
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,375
How could you...

440
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,666
You lied;

441
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,833
you said we'd
always be together...

442
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,125
Fran...

443
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,166
Princess...

444
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,125
Vera...

445
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,875
I was the one who turned
Francesca into a vampire.

446
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,375
I couldn't bear
to watch her die

447
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,666
after her entire family was
killed by the Spanish Flu...

448
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,500
Well, it's all over now...

449
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,458
She can be free.

450
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,041
Nanami...

451
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,833
I want you to come
and work for me.

452
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,083
Sure... Whatever
you say, Princess.

453
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,875
Once you enter the bund
you'll never be able

454
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,750
to see Yuzuru again...

455
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,708
Will you still come
with me, knowing that?

456
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,125
-Vera?
-Yes

457
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,208
Have you ever regretted
becoming a vampire?

458
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,333
Not once...

459
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,666
I have no regrets.

460
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,625
Princess!

461
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,041
Akira! Are you all right? !

462
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,541
Is Nanami okay?

463
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,541
Eternity...

464
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:44,000
It's like a long and winding
river with no end in sight.

465
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,541
Unless you have something
to keep you afloat...

466
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,166
you're sure to
be washed away.

467
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,291
I'm glad that you
were able to save her.

468
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,125
I was worried...

469
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,708
But I'm afraid I
wasn't as successful...

470
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,166
I lost Hiko.

471
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,333
There's no need
to be upset...

472
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,250
Every day you
grow stronger...

473
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,541
And one day...

474
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,458
You will surpass them all.

475
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,541
It seems there's
been some commotion

476
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,125
over in Tokyo this evening.

477
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,708
Yes...

478
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,958
I think it's wonderful
that she was successful

479
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,791
in building the bund for
our people, however...

480
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,166
it means nothing if
she can't control it.

481
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,625
I agree...

482
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,666
She's just a child who's
playing a game of war.

483
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,708
Gentlemen, I realize it's
not quite time yet,

484
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:37,708
but what do you say the three
of us pay a courtesy visit...?

485
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,041
To the girl who
will become our bride?

486
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:51,125
[Music]

487
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:59,166
[Music]

488
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,291
On his 17th birthday,

489
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,916
the wolf boy, Akira,
has a fated reunion.

490
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,833
Who are you?

491
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,791
It's good to see
you again, Akira.

492
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,625
But I don't know you!

493
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:37,000
Don't lie. How could you
possibly forget my touch?

494
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,041
Stop...

495
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,125
A torrent of
unbridled pathos...

496
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:44,375
Their requiem as they fall
into the abyss of love...

497
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,166
A forbidden story for
young adults by Yuki Saegusa!

498
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,041
The Rose and the Wolf!
Coming soon!

499
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:49,875
There's no such book!

500
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:50,791
Better start writing!
