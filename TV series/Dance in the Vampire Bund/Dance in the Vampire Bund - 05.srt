1
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,708
One day a young boy
asked a question

2
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,541
to the great ruler
of monsters...

3
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:32,000
He asked, "Why do you
always look so unhappy?

4
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,833
You aren't always going to be
sad like this, are you?"

5
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,083
The ruler replied...

6
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:42,000
"If you will promise
to grant my wish

7
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,583
then I promise to you that
I will stop being sad."

8
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,041
"But I should warn you, if
you ever break the promise

9
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,416
you've made to me

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,708
then I may devour you."

11
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:03,875
Whoa. It was a dream.

12
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,666
Is there something wrong?

13
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,125
What do you think
you're doing...?!

14
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,666
And why the hell do you
keep sneaking in my bed-

15
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,458
What is that tied
around your neck?

16
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,333
Oh, this...? It's
special to me...

17
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,125
It represents a promise.

18
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,500
A promise?

19
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,166
Yeah...

20
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,833
Princess, did you see
someone come into the room?

21
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:37,916
Geez.

22
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:54,250
[Music]

23
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,333
On the left hand side, you have
a finite number of primes

24
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,000
as a result of
reductio ad absurdum.

25
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,541
However, the right side
is a harmonic series,

26
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,000
which diverges into
positive infinity.

27
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,000
This is a contradiction.

28
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,083
This inconsistency proves
to us that the postulation

29
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,333
that prime numbers are
finite is incongruous.

30
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,875
Which also indicates
that the opposite

31
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,125
of this postulation is true.

32
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,416
Meaning that there exists
an infinite number of primes.

33
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,750
To that I say, quod
erat demonstrandum...

34
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:40,833
That should
complete my proof.

35
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,416
-Thank you.
-That was flawless...

36
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Thank you, Princess.

37
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,833
Call me, Mina;

38
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm just another student
in your classroom.

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,625
Oh... I'm so sorry!

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,083
That was my fault.

41
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,875
Uh... Thanks a lot.

42
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,000
They look at you like you're
some kinda animal in the zoo.

43
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,750
I'd prefer to think of
myself as a vicious beast.

44
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,333
I don't see that.

45
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,625
Well, I am the ruler
of the vampires...

46
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,208
I wouldn't be living up
to expectations

47
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,458
if I didn't instill some
sense of fear into humans.

48
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,416
However, it has proven
to be a difficult task,

49
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,041
because I'm so adorable.

50
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,083
I knew that was coming.

51
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,166
Hey! Coach wants the guys
outside for a game of soccer!

52
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,583
You should go...

53
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,416
I would hate for
you to miss out

54
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,791
on such an opportunity ...

55
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,666
I will be fine
on my own, Akira.

56
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,333
-I don't know...
-What's that...?

57
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,291
Sounds like someone's
worried about me.

58
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,833
No, I'm worried
about everybody else.

59
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,375
I'll show you...

60
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,375
I am enrolled as a student
here just like the rest of you.

61
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,625
I hereby declare that I
will successfully make it

62
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,875
through this entire school
day as a regular student!

63
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,875
This afternoon we will be
making a main course

64
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,666
of simmered meat and potatoes

65
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,666
with an omelet as
the side dish.

66
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,208
I don't mean to be rude...

67
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,166
but have you ever...
cooked, Princess?

68
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,291
Call me Mina...!

69
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,291
Don't worry about me...

70
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,708
I may not be the best,

71
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,375
but I know a thing or
two about cooking.

72
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,458
Okay, then could you
tell me what this is?

73
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,875
It's a razor!

74
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,250
And what about this?

75
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,625
That is a tea whisk. An
inelegant one at that.

76
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,666
Well, alright...

77
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,833
Mina's going to
need a partner.

78
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,541
Do I have any volunteers?

79
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,666
I'll be her partner,
Sister Laura.

80
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,541
Is this an inconvenience?

81
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,291
No, uh... Actually...
I, uh...

82
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,833
I was hoping to get to
know you better, Princess.

83
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,791
Would you please just
call me Mina from now on?

84
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,250
Okay... Where do you
want me to begin?

85
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,541
Let's see...

86
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,958
Why don't you go ahead
and crack an egg for me?

87
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,250
Crack an egg...
Crack an egg...

88
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,458
Here... ...

89
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,458
goes!

90
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,833
Oh no, Mina...

91
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,833
What... the...

92
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,041
Why do they
shatter so easily? !

93
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,041
That's absolutely
ridiculous!

94
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,375
I thought the whole
purpose of these shells

95
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,083
was to protect the lives
of newborn chickens? !

96
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,250
Be honest...

97
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,500
You've never cooked
before, have you?

98
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,916
I'll have you know...

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,458
I have been in the
kitchen many times!

100
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,041
But it's your first
time cooking, right?

101
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,333
That's so unfair...

102
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,250
Okay... I'll show you
how to crack an egg...

103
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,541
It's not a big deal...

104
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,625
You just lightly tap
it on a flat surface.

105
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,666
You're really
good at that.

106
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,958
Um, thanks Princess.

107
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,625
Here's something I
bet you didn't know.

108
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,916
Omelets are one of
Akira's favorite foods.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,166
Really...?! Then I will work
hard to perfect this technique!

110
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,125
Wait... How do you know
that's his favorite?

111
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,291
Well because...

112
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,375
we're classmates,
you know?

113
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,750
I guess we'd better
get started then.

114
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,208
Here we go.

115
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,708
That was the first
conversatio n

116
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,666
I ever had with
Princess Mina.

117
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,791
I was completely
fascinated by her.

118
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,041
Here was this
mysterious little girl

119
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,708
who could be so
arrogant, almost rude.

120
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,750
But I saw something
within her.

121
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,625
There was another
side to her,

122
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,625
one that was
distant and lonely.

123
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,458
At the time, I hadn't yet
realized her true terror

124
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,041
or her true sorrow.

125
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,208
Go on! Try it, Akira.

126
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,583
-It's good!
-You like it?

127
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,750
It's delicious.

128
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,250
Did you really make
this, Princess?

129
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,083
Of course I did...

130
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,750
Now try the simmered
meat and potatoes...

131
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,375
That's my masterpiece.

132
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,125
Don't mind if I do...

133
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,750
All that running around on
the soccer field made me hungry.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,125
Yes, Vera...?

135
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,750
Huh...? The television?

136
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,000
In a news conference
this afternoon,

137
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,625
Prime Minister Mizoguchi

138
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,916
expressed his
adamant opposition

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,291
to the bipartisan coalition's

140
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,041
Special Zone
Establishment Bill.

141
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,666
He warned that he is
prepared to dissolve

142
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,041
the assembly if need be.

143
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,625
In response, the
bipartisan coalition's

144
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,375
chief representative,
Mr. surugi, has said that

145
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,750
he is now in ta-

146
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, this is unfortunate.
I'm on my way right now.

147
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,208
Would you call Alphonse
just to be on the safe side...?

148
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,791
Thank you, Vera.

149
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,583
I have to leave
early today...

150
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,291
I have some urgent business
that I need to attend to.

151
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,333
Okay, then... I'll
tell my teachers.

152
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,416
That isn't necessary.

153
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll be going alone.

154
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,375
I want you to remain
here and attend class.

155
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,666
You can't help me with
these political dealings.

156
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,666
It would be a
waste of your time.

157
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,291
But Princess...

158
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,625
Trying to sneak a peek?

159
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,708
It's not here...

160
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,125
What's not there?

161
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,333
Akira asked me to look for
a ring that he's lost...

162
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,708
But I haven't
had any luck.

163
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,458
I can't find the
damn thing anywhere.

164
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,583
A ring...? No way...!

165
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,208
You don't think he was gonna
give it to the princess,

166
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,458
do you...?!

167
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,291
That would be
quite scandalous.

168
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,208
What will people say? !

169
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,125
Nella?

170
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,500
Yes?

171
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,208
Alphonse has asked
that you meet with him.

172
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,083
Really? Yeah...

173
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,791
I've been watching the
two of them all day...

174
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,208
It's disgusting...

175
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,083
Akira's stuck to that
vampire like glue...

176
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,333
I just can't trust
that guy anymore.

177
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,458
Well then...

178
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,750
I guess we can't
depend on him,

179
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,041
so we'll just have
to do what we can,

180
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,083
to keep ourselves
protected.

181
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,291
We can't have a repeat of
what happened to Nanami.

182
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,458
Wait, what do you mean? !

183
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,916
I thought that
was just a rumor!

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,375
Yeah, that seems to be a
common misconception...

185
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,416
Here...

186
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,875
Take one look at those and
you'll know it isn't a rumor.

187
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,416
Those photos... were sent
to the student council

188
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,083
from an anonymous source.

189
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,958
I haven't the time to
stay here and chat...

190
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,000
So please finish your
business with me at once.

191
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,083
Business?

192
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,541
I can tell there's something
you want to say to me.

193
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,958
Well, there is
one thing...

194
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,541
Go ahead.

195
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,333
It's about about
Nanami Shinonome,

196
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,958
the student council president...

197
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,791
Everybody says she's
skipping school,

198
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,958
but I know her pretty well
and that's not like her.

199
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,791
What are you insinuating?

200
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,708
Well, I heard a rumor
that the real reason

201
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,916
she's not at school is because
she was attacked by vampires.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,125
Somehow that seems
more likely...

203
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,625
Oh... So your little friend
has gone missing...

204
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,083
and you suspect that
I'm behind it somehow.

205
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:06,958
I do.

206
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,041
I see... Aren't you brave?

207
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,791
Where did you
get that ring?

208
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,833
It's just a little
trinket that I wear.

209
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,291
But that's the ring
I gave to Akira!

210
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,750
Why do you--

211
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,291
He gave it to me as
a sign of his

212
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,000
undying loyalty.

213
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,625
You're lying!
He wouldn't do that!

214
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,958
How can you be so sure? !

215
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,125
I just know...

216
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,791
It signifies something
special between us

217
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,375
and I know he wouldn't
just throw that away!

218
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,250
It represents a promise.

219
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,958
I see... So it was you.

220
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,875
You were the one...

221
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,000
I know Akira very well and
he would never give away

222
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,333
something that had been
given to him as a gift.

223
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,666
So why do you have it? !

224
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,958
I've heard about
enough out of you.

225
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,625
I don't know what happened
between the two of you

226
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,083
in the past, but let me
give you a warning...

227
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,833
Akira belongs to
me now, understand? !

228
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,583
He was born and raised
for the sole purpose of

229
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,500
becoming my servant...!

230
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,291
Which means every
drop of blood,

231
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,958
every bone and every muscle
in his body belongs to me!

232
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,458
Now begone with you...!

233
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,000
I've business to attend to!

234
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,500
I'm of no use...? I just
can't figure her out.

235
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,041
Leave us alone!

236
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,833
-We didn't do anything!
-Shut the hell up!

237
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,958
Akira's here.

238
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,375
Hey! What are you guys doing? !

239
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,833
Damn... It's Ryohei!

240
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,541
Are you okay?

241
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,291
Why were they
messing with you?

242
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,750
Stay away!

243
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,458
If those thugs see
us talking to you

244
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,375
they'll come back and
kick our asses again!

245
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,916
Shut up, loser!
We need him!

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,250
Akira can help us!

247
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,333
Yeah...

248
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,500
He can protect
us from those guys

249
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,250
so we don't end
up like Nanami!

250
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,291
Hold on...

251
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,541
What do you mean...?

252
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,750
I thought she was just
skipping school, lately?

253
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,625
You mean, you don't know? !

254
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,583
Look.

255
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,958
That's Nanami!

256
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,500
Yeah, all this time we've
been accusing her

257
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,791
of skipping class, but that's
what really happened to her.

258
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,000
Pretty messed up, huh?

259
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,500
If you look closely you
can see it happened

260
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,250
in the student
council office.

261
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,166
That place must've been
completely torn up,

262
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,875
but when we came in the next
morning, it was perfect.

263
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,250
Who could possibly have
done such a thing...?

264
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,791
Someone who has the power
to control vampires.

265
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,875
Now that you
know the truth,

266
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,208
do you still
trust that vampire?

267
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,666
Whose side are
you on, Akira?

268
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,166
Is something
bothering you?

269
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,916
It's nothing...

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,291
Do you really think
Mizoguchi has the audacity

271
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,625
to dissolve the assembly?

272
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,750
I do, indeed...

273
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,000
The Prime Minister
feels threatened.

274
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,916
He knows that if the Special
Zone Establishment bill

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,208
was voted on today, we
would win by a landslide.

276
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,875
If his plan is successful
what would be the outcome?

277
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,166
There would be
a general election,

278
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,625
but securing the
same number of seats

279
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,375
would prove
difficult for us.

280
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,708
Do we have anything?

281
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,083
Yes, ma'am...

282
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,750
This is the Prime Minister's
5-year-old grandson.

283
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,000
Despite his gruff exterior,

284
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,791
Mizoguchi is a loving
grandfather

285
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,250
who dotes on the boy.

286
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,458
Okay, Alphonse...

287
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,666
Prepare yourself...

288
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,208
We may be needing your
services very soon.

289
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,458
Right...

290
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,250
All you have to do is say
the word, Princess

291
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,916
There has to be a force
backing Mizoguchi...

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,291
Someone who is out to ruin
our chances of success...

293
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,083
Doesn't it piss you off
when your classmates

294
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,750
treat you like crap?

295
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,958
I can help you get back
at all of them, Hiko.

296
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,916
The city almost looks
like an illusion, huh?

297
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,166
Unfortunately, it's a
reality that neither I

298
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,750
nor the human race can
avoid any longer.

299
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,458
What do you
mean, Akira...?

300
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,750
The way you said that

301
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,666
makes it seem like
you're not a human being.

302
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,166
So, did you like the
food we gave you?

303
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,666
Oh yeah...

304
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,083
Thankfully it tasted a
lot better than it looked.

305
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,416
Good, I'm glad...

306
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,583
The princess worked
really hard on it.

307
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,583
Hey, Yuki... Thanks.

308
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,250
I could tell you
seasoned it for her.

309
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,500
It tasted like
your cooking...

310
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,541
And vampires don't have
the same sense of taste

311
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,458
that humans do.

312
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,791
So there's no way she
could possibly cook.

313
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,000
But knowing her, she
probably refused to admit

314
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,333
that she couldn't do it

315
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,375
and insisted on
cooking anyway...

316
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,375
I bet she didn't even
thank you, did she?

317
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,666
No, she didn't...

318
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,416
I'm sure she will
eventually...

319
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,291
Seem like you
know her pretty well.

320
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,583
Not really...

321
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,541
These guys again...

322
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,833
They're vampires!

323
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,791
No way... They're wearing
our school uniforms.

324
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,250
There's nothing I
can do to convince you

325
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,416
to pass the bill?

326
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,791
'Fraid not.

327
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,833
I mean c'mon, nobody
leases land anymore;

328
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,666
not in this day and age.

329
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,333
Especially not to
a group of lunatics

330
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,208
who claim to be vampires.

331
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,291
It just sounds ridiculous.

332
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,166
I'm doing what's best for
the citizens of Japan.

333
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,125
You do realize that
we have the support

334
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,875
of numerous officials
within your assembly,

335
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,041
don't you, sir?

336
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,125
Of course I do...

337
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,208
And that's why...

338
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,583
I have to dissolve it...

339
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,666
Otherwise there's no
real way of knowing...

340
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,125
whether they're voting for
the greater good or not...

341
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,541
I'd rather ask the citizens
their opinion on the subject.

342
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,791
Ask the public... huh...?

343
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,416
You are truly inept...

344
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,625
You're a policymaker who refuses
to make any real decisions.

345
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,083
Oh?

346
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,208
You see, if we were to
back out, financially...

347
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,375
Japan would plummet
into a depression unlike

348
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,375
any the world
has seen before...

349
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,208
I doubt that this nation
would ever be able

350
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,583
to recover from it.

351
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,083
Then we'll have
to make due...

352
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,291
If the public refuses
your request...

353
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,291
who am I to question
their decision?

354
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,500
Remind me...

355
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,333
Your elected term is up at
the end of the year, is it not?

356
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,708
That's correct.

357
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,291
Then why do you
care what happens?

358
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,500
I understand...

359
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,750
So the real reason...

360
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,375
you're standing
up against us...

361
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,500
and are attempting
to protect

362
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,041
the poor Japanese
people's integrity...

363
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,166
Is because you want your
name to be celebrated

364
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,291
long after you're dead.

365
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:43,125
Well, aren't you an
imaginative little girl?

366
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,000
I realize that
dissolving the assembly

367
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,000
to keep the Special
Zone bill from passing

368
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,333
is an unprecedented and
aggressive political move.

369
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,500
Hypothetically I suppose
it could solidify

370
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,333
the Mizoguchi family's
place in Japanese history.

371
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,791
Filthy scum.

372
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,291
What did you say?

373
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,583
Keep in mind...

374
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,291
We could easily use our
power to instill fear

375
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,375
and get our way...

376
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,625
I think that
you've forgotten

377
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,875
who you're dealing
with here, Prime Minister.

378
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,833
However... I've
taken the high road...

379
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,083
I've chosen to sit here

380
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,666
and try to talk things
over with you instead.

381
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,625
In dealing with
this situation...

382
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,708
I have been very
careful to follow

383
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,958
the rules of human society.

384
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,708
We have gone out of our
way to show respect

385
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,333
to both you and
your people...

386
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,333
But allow me to take this
opportunity to inform you...

387
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,791
if you choose to
make light of us,

388
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:29,875
then we would be
more than happy

389
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,416
to go back to doing
things our way.

390
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,083
Now... you're out of line...!

391
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,833
I will not be
threatened by you!

392
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,208
I haven't
threatened you yet.

393
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,875
We're just talking.

394
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,125
What do you mean by
that...? You brat...!

395
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,750
I refuse to be bullied into
a decision by a child.

396
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,833
Sit back down, old man.

397
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,125
Watch it, little girl...

398
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,375
Don't push your luck!

399
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,583
You've left me no choice.

400
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:53,916
Do it.

401
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,833
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:56,958
Okay, Nella.

403
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,833
Well, I guess
that's about it...

404
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,291
Thank you, Prime Minister...

405
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,958
I appreciate you taking
the time to meet with me...

406
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,833
I'm truly sorry things
had to end this way.

407
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,541
Akira!

408
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,833
I can't believe
it really worked!

409
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,208
How's that silver powder
taste to ya, flea bag?

410
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,041
We're tired of looking
at your ugly face...

411
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,166
It's time for you to stop
clinging to the princess!

412
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,458
Die!

413
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,625
Not you again...

414
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,041
You just leave these
guys to me, okay?

415
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,666
Akira!

416
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,083
Get out of here while
you have the chance...

417
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,541
I don't need your help.

418
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,583
Those bastards were wearing
our school uniform...

419
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,750
I don't know what
the hell is going on.

420
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,541
How could vampires have
snuck into our school?

421
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,875
I have to call the princess
and tell her about this!

422
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,791
I don't understand why
you're more worried

423
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,041
about her safety than
you are your own.

424
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,750
Do you remember the day I
suddenly collapsed

425
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,625
in the schoolyard?

426
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,583
Now that was the first
time we came face to face.

427
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,875
She'd come
searching for me,

428
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,833
even though she knew
I had lost my memory

429
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,458
and I wouldn't
remember her.

430
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,833
Because of some silly
promise I made as a kid...

431
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,083
She risked her own life
to come and find me.

432
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,708
I feel like she's the-

433
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,458
I saw you... later that day.

434
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,416
I saw the two of you running
from someone or something.

435
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,666
I couldn't believe it.

436
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,625
There were all
of these guards

437
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,958
who were secretly
following you.

438
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,375
Almost as if they were
protecting you

439
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,750
from the shadows.

440
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,666
Wait, you saw us?

441
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,166
Princess Mina...

442
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,583
Sorry, Vera...

443
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,708
But could I please
be alone right now?

444
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,708
Do... you-

445
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,250
Hello, Akira.

446
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,791
What're you up to?

447
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,791
Nothing much. What about you?

448
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,083
Nothing, I just wanted
to hear your voice...

449
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,666
I hope that's okay...

450
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,250
I don't want you to think
of me as a nuisance.

451
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,333
No, not at all...

452
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,541
Hey princess, let me
ask you something...

453
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,583
I can trust you, right?

454
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,791
Of course.

455
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,833
You can trust me.

456
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:31,458
[Music]

457
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:54,833
Dance with the
Vampire Maids Part 5!

458
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:57,291
The princess just gave us her
homemade meat and potatoes!

459
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:58,625
We're gonna play rock,
paper, scissors

460
00:24:58,708 --> 00:24:59,666
to see who gets to eat it!

461
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,875
But what about Nella?

462
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,000
She's not here; her loss!

463
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,500
Rock, paper, scissors!

464
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,500
Yay! I win!

465
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:05,625
That's not fair;
you went after me!

466
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,125
I can't help that
I am a little slow.

467
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,416
What are you guys doing?

468
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,875
The princess made
meat and potatoes!

469
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,666
Shh! And just where
were you, Nella?

470
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,791
Kidnapping a child.

471
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,500
For you, compliments
of the princess!

472
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,000
-Thank you!
-Is it yummy?

473
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,375
Actually it has no flavor.

474
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,833
Well, we are vampires.
