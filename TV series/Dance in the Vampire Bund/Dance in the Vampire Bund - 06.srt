1
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,833
Hello, Akira.

2
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,208
What're you up to?

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,208
Nothing much. What about you?

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,583
Nothing, I just wanted
to hear your voice...

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,250
I hope that's okay...

6
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,708
I don't want you to think
of me as a nuisance.

7
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,000
No, not at all...

8
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,958
Hey princess,
let me ask you something...

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,291
I can trust you, right?

10
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,458
Of course.

11
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,083
You can trust me.

12
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,708
I'm gonna go.

13
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay...

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,250
When I was a little girl,

15
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,583
I always thought that falling in
love would be a happy thing...

16
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,916
I honestly believed

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
the love you felt
for one another

18
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,833
was all that mattered....

19
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,208
But as I've gotten older,

20
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:12,333
I've realized that's
not always the case...

21
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:15,916
Even now, Akira and I felt
lost in the twilight...

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,291
wondering if the clarity of
the morning would ever come...

23
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,333
My innocent childhood
but a memory...

24
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,750
What happened...?

25
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:25,833
At the Prime Minister's home?

26
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,625
Are you positive?

27
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,958
Princess, we should go.

28
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,458
It's time to finish this.

29
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:38,250
[Music]

30
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,375
Mei Ren...

31
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,000
Happy to see me?

32
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,333
Not really.

33
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,458
Why're you here?

34
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,833
Tell me something,

35
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,291
why didn't you put
the moves on her?

36
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,500
'Cause the princess
wouldn't have liked it?

37
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,583
I don't get what
the big deal is.

38
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,708
If you had your
way with her,

39
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,083
maybe you'd forget
about your troubles.

40
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,625
Don't talk about
her that way!

41
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,666
You don't even know her...

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,208
Yuki isn't like that!

43
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,250
Gee whiz, you're such
a nice guy, Akira...

44
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,875
But you know,

45
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,541
that's only gonna make things
harder for you in the long run.

46
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,166
What the hell are
you up to...?!

47
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,250
Who are you?

48
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,666
I'm a servant of
the royal family

49
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,958
who's been sworn to protect

50
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,083
the "true blood'
lineage of vampires.

51
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,500
The princess has never
said anything about you...

52
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,875
Sorry, I'm not buying it.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh yeah?

54
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,458
And what do you
know, Akira?

55
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,250
She's got you fooled.

56
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,333
Remember that first day
you two were together?

57
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,375
All of that chaos was
actually part of her plan.

58
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,708
She was attempting to
lure out the people

59
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,208
who're trying to kill her.

60
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,916
She mobilized an entire
battalion of troops

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,333
just to make sure that the
two of you were protected...

62
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,458
Crazy, huh...?

63
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,750
I thought it was sweet

64
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,666
how you fought so desperately
to keep her safe,

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,375
thinking that you were
the only one there

66
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,083
who could protect
her from harm.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,333
Sorry, kiddo but you
don't know anything...

68
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,375
not about the
vampire bund...

69
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,208
or about your
beloved princess.

70
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,125
She isn't the sweet,
innocent girl

71
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,875
that you think
she is, Akira...

72
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,791
What do you mean by that?

73
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,791
I've already
said too much...

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,875
Why don't you ask the
princess yourself?

75
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,333
Wait! Hey! Wait!

76
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,708
My grandson was
attacked by vampires!

77
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,666
He was bitten
by one of them!

78
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,958
Oh my, how horrible.

79
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,791
That's unfortunate
for you.

80
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,416
How dare you act so
flippant with me!

81
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,166
It's obvious you're
the one who sent them!

82
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,416
I'm sorry...

83
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,291
It would appear that this
regrettable incident

84
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,041
was the result of a lack
of supervision on my part.

85
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,541
I suppose this will
ruin my plans

86
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,791
for the vampire bund...

87
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,500
I'll just have to
contact the assembly...

88
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,208
and withdraw my
approval request.

89
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,708
Goodbye.

90
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,666
And just where the hell
do you think you're going?!

91
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,541
To go get your
grandson, of course.

92
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,583
This is quite a conundrum.

93
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,958
As you've said before,

94
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:39,916
you want the
approval decision

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,083
to be based on
public opinion.

96
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,250
The humans would never
approve this bill,

97
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,041
which means we'll be forced
to leave the country.

98
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,791
I'm truly sorry to hear

99
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,083
that your grandson was
bitten by a vampire...

100
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,375
You do realize that
makes him one of us now.

101
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,791
There goes your spot
in Japanese history...

102
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,958
I almost pity you.

103
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,083
Shinya...

104
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,416
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you see her...

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,875
She's refusing visitors.

106
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,916
The princess is very tired
and needs her rest...

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,875
I can't allow
anyone inside ...

108
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,250
not even you, Akira.

109
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,833
I have to talk to her!

110
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,375
Please, it's
really important!

111
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,291
I'm sorry, but you
have to leave now.

112
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,166
She isn't the sweet,
innocent girl

113
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,125
that you think
she is, Akira...

114
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,458
How's the little boy
in the guest suite?

115
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,333
Well, he's been
crying non-stop.

116
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,791
So sad...

117
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,791
Little boy?

118
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,166
I don't understand,

119
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,208
what would the princess
want with a child?

120
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,416
She must have
some kind of plan.

121
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,583
Exactly...

122
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,458
And I think we're better
off not knowing...

123
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,041
Why don't you ask the
princess yourself?

124
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,250
What's the matter?

125
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,041
A strange lady took me
and brought me here.

126
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,666
Can you tell me
what your name is?

127
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,583
Shinya Mizoguchi.

128
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,833
Mizoguchi?

129
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,083
My dad is Koichi Mizoguchi...

130
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:49,208
and my grandpa is
Katsuichi Mizoguchi.

131
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,625
The prime minister?!

132
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,166
My neck hurts bad...

133
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,000
Would it be okay if
I took a look at it?

134
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,583
I wanna go home...

135
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,208
After he made his promise

136
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,750
to the ruler of
the monsters...

137
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,833
the boy remained
by her side...

138
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,583
even when he worried
that she might be wrong.

139
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,666
The people
began to gossip.

140
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,583
They claimed that he
had been possessed

141
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,583
and surely he would
be eaten next.

142
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,083
The boy refused to let
the gossip affect him.

143
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,375
He didn't want to
believe any of it.

144
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,375
But he was bothered
by the time she spent

145
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,166
alone in the tower.

146
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,583
Sometimes the ruler
would hole up there...

147
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,166
refusing to see the boy.

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,416
One day, the boy
mustered up the courage

149
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,791
to open the door to the
ruler's room in the tower...

150
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,000
He was shocked by
what he saw inside...

151
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,583
I have made the
arrangements.

152
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,958
Tomorrow morning, your grandson
will wake up in his own bed

153
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,708
without any recollection
of what happened.

154
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,916
I can't thank
you enough...

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,416
However, before I
let your grandson go,

156
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,291
there's something that
I need you to tell me...

157
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,541
Yes?

158
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,208
It's simple really...

159
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,291
I need the name of
the mastermind...

160
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,291
whoever it is that's been
funding your operation...

161
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,583
I want to know
who ordered you

162
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,583
to crush the
Special Zone bill.

163
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,291
Yuki!

164
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,000
Hey, is it true that you
were attacked by vampires?!

165
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,166
How did you know?

166
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,291
So it's true?!

167
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,541
How scary!

168
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,625
We heard that a
bunch of vampires

169
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,125
have snuck into the school!

170
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,208
Um... Who told you that?!

171
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,666
Who?

172
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,041
Cut it out, Hiko!

173
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,791
You can't just go around
spreading lies like that!

174
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,166
I'm not lying; I'm
being completely honest.

175
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,458
It's only a matter of time

176
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,166
before they take over
the whole school.

177
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,666
But you never know, huh...?

178
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,625
There could be a vampire
standing right next to you.

179
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,000
You better cut the crap or
I'm gonna kick your ass.

180
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,541
You don't wanna get
beat again, do ya?!

181
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,416
What's so funny, huh?

182
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,916
You better let go...

183
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,375
Or I'll have to hurt you!

184
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,125
Whoa...! Just
calm down, Hiko!

185
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,750
Please don't hurt us;
we're friends of yours!

186
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,625
No... I am not friends
with you anymore.

187
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,291
I've had enough...

188
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,208
I won't be bullied by you
pathetic little humans!

189
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,916
Oh, no!

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,166
This is more fun than I
thought it would be...!

191
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,791
I finally get
to be the bully

192
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,416
instead of always
being the victim...

193
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,958
Sorry, but you guys don't
have any power over me now.

194
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,625
I've chosen to
become a vampire;

195
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,500
I'm a child of the darkness...

196
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,750
now I'm more powerful
than all of you!

197
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,666
-Hiko!
-A vampire...

198
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,375
Wow, Yuki...

199
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,291
You've got some guts,
don't you...?

200
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:53,291
My brethren told you not
to come back here......

201
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,416
but you... didn't
heed their warning!

202
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,291
Yuki!

203
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,583
No... Hiko!

204
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,000
You should let
go, Akira...

205
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,208
I really don't wanna
have to hurt you...

206
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,833
You've always been
so nice to me...

207
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,958
Damn...! Why did
you do this, Hiko?!

208
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't you realize what it
means to become a vampire?!

209
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,458
It means I'm more
powerful than you!

210
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,625
My fang...
I lost my fang!

211
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,875
Why, Hiko?

212
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,875
Why did you
become a vampire?!

213
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,000
Akira...

214
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,541
I know you've had a hard
time with bullies,

215
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,458
so I can understand why
you wanted power...

216
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,541
But still...

217
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,208
this wasn't the
way to go about it!

218
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,916
Who turned you into
a vampire, Hiko?

219
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,708
It's very important
that you tell me.

220
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,333
Who is your master?!

221
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,875
Master...? Uh...

222
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,333
Sorry!

223
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,458
Hiko!

224
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,583
You sure seem happy.

225
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,166
Akira!

226
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,500
Good news...!

227
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,666
We finally struck a deal
with the Prime Minister...

228
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,875
We're going to be making the
announcement later tonight!

229
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,916
Well, good for you.

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,500
Is there something wrong...?

231
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,958
You seem awfully
cranky today.

232
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,958
There are vampires
at the school!

233
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,750
They were able to
sneak in somehow

234
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,666
and now they're feeding
on the human students!

235
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,333
Did you know about this?!

236
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,708
Of course you did...

237
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,083
So...

238
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,666
then you know what
happened to Nanami, too?

239
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,875
Well, I received a
report about it...

240
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,833
I suppose I should have
been on top of the matter,

241
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,291
but I had pressing
business matters

242
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,125
that needed to
be attended to.

243
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,166
You had pressing business
matters, huh...?

244
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,958
You mean like using a kid to
blackmail the entire country?!

245
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,791
How do you know
about that?

246
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,416
Because I met him.

247
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,333
The future of the
bund is in jeopardy

248
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,791
because of Mizoguchi.

249
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,041
I have to use any
means necessary.

250
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,541
But he's just a kid...!

251
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,750
Don't you think you're taking
this too far, Princess?!

252
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,625
How dare you
question my motives?!

253
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,416
You wouldn't
understand, Akira!

254
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,083
The fate of the vampire
kingdom rests on my shoulders...

255
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,500
I will use whatever
tactics I see fit

256
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,750
to achieve my goal...

257
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,416
That is the duty
of a policymaker.

258
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,666
You're a child

259
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,333
unable to understand the
intricacies of politics.

260
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,875
So stay out of it!

261
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,208
Princess.

262
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,750
At least tell
me one thing...

263
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,291
That day...

264
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,041
The day you came to the
school to find me...

265
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,625
It wasn't because you
wanted to see me, was it?

266
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,916
Why should I answer?

267
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,416
You won't believe
me anyway.

268
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,041
You are a kid...

269
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,708
You're an entitled brat.

270
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:14,875
I'll bet that
promise we made

271
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,541
doesn't mean a
thing to you...

272
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,500
I should have known.

273
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,458
I'm finished talking
to you, Akira...

274
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,625
Would you please leave?

275
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,583
I can't trust her...

276
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,000
I wanted to believe
you, Princess!

277
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,166
Prime Minister Mizoguchi,

278
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,708
the leading opponent of the
Special Zone Establishment bill,

279
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,791
surprised the nation as he
announced his retirement today.

280
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,666
The Prime Minister
had threatened

281
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,000
to dissolve the assembly

282
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,416
to keep the Special Zone
bill from passing.

283
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,583
Now that Mizoguchi has
announced his early retirement,

284
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,416
the bill is expected to pass.

285
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,250
Following his startling
announcement,

286
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,958
an emergency meeting was called
requesting the attendance

287
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,541
of all assembly members.

288
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:07,958
It seems that today's
announcement

289
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,708
has affected the stock
market in a positive way.

290
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,791
Overseas investors are
seizing the opportunity-

291
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,125
I saw this guy...

292
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,458
and her...

293
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,208
There's so many...

294
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,791
And this kid had a freak
out like Hiko earlier today.

295
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,708
Man, this is
unbelievable...

296
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,000
Everything's changed

297
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,416
since the "vampire princess"
first showed up...

298
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,625
All of a sudden...

299
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,791
we have to worry about
vampire attacks...

300
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,375
even in our own school.

301
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,708
Damn it...

302
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,000
We have to stop them.

303
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,083
Akira...

304
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,500
What do you want?!

305
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,333
I need you to help me.

306
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,833
Help you do what?

307
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,041
Find and get rid
of every vampire

308
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,583
who's hiding out
in our school!

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,375
Before she went missing,

310
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,958
Nanami wanted to make sure

311
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,083
that the students
of our school

312
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,958
were able to
protect themselves.

313
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,291
That's why we've gathered
here this afternoon.

314
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,958
We'd like to thank you
for your help with this...

315
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,375
Sister Laura.

316
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,166
It's my duty to
protect you...

317
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,000
Not only as your
instructor,

318
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,833
but also... as a
servant of our Lord.

319
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,041
Okay, so here's the plan.

320
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,625
Our first step
is figuring out

321
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,291
which students at the school
have become vampires.

322
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,125
We can't fight until we
know who we're up against.

323
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,708
But how are we going to be
able to tell who's a vampire?

324
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:31,291
Yeah, it's not like you can
just tell by looking at them.

325
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,208
There is one
way to find out.

326
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,083
Tomorrow we're gonna hold
a school-wide assembly

327
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,583
outside on the lawn...

328
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,916
As most of you know,

329
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,375
vampires and
sunlight don't mix.

330
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,750
So anyone who's a vampire

331
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,166
won't be able to come
to the assembly.

332
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,500
But isn't there some kinda
lotion they can put on?

333
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,166
We've already got
that covered... Akira.

334
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,625
The Shade Gel they use to
protect themselves from the sun

335
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,625
loses its effect after 15
minutes of direct sunlight.

336
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,375
So in this case,
it won't help them.

337
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,500
He hangs out with
Princess Mina!

338
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,000
Can we trust him?

339
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,291
Akira came to us asking for
help to fight the vampires.

340
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,416
He's on our side...

341
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,791
Don't worry.

342
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,000
Vampire's blood has
a distinct scent

343
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,666
and I have a fierce
sense of smell.

344
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,833
I can pick them
out easily.

345
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,416
And there you have it...

346
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,750
While we're on
the subject,

347
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,000
you don't smell any
vampires in here, do ya?

348
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,333
No, we're all clear...

349
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,541
I think...

350
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,333
we should stay
here tonight.

351
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,666
But why?

352
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,250
The vampires are smart...

353
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,833
I'm sure they've caught
on to what we're doing.

354
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,041
If we split up, I'm afraid
we'll be attacked one by one.

355
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,541
Sister... We should
be safe here, right?

356
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,541
Well, the church
windows have shutters...

357
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,875
and there's an
emergency generator...

358
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,208
Yes, I think so.

359
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,041
So anyone who doesn't show
up tomorrow is a vampire...

360
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,333
Once we've identified them,
we'll take action.

361
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,875
We won't let these vampires
take over our school!

362
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,541
-You with me!
-Yeah!

363
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,291
I hate to bug
you, Akira...

364
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,583
But I have a favor to ask.

365
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,166
Sure, what is it?

366
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,500
We're gonna need weapons
to fight off the vampires.

367
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,291
It's dangerous
enough tonight,

368
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,708
but we really don't know
what to expect tomorrow.

369
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,375
Right now we're helpless
if they come after us.

370
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,541
Do you know where we
could find anything?

371
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,958
I might be able to find some
stuff in the Special Zone...

372
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,541
Could you go check it out?

373
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,333
Do it for us.

374
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,625
I guess...

375
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,208
We've decided to
trust you, Akira...

376
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,416
Show us that we've
made the right choice.

377
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,458
Alright.

378
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,458
Akira...

379
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,541
Yuki...

380
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,416
Are you sure about this?

381
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,541
I have to confront
my feelings...

382
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,875
I don't have any choice.

383
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,875
So I...

384
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,916
I have to fight
the princess.

385
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,625
Can I ask you about
something...?

386
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,458
What happened to the
ring I gave you?

387
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,333
I'm sorry...

388
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,791
I should've told
you I lost it.

389
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,375
Did you give it
to someone else?

390
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,250
I would never do that...!

391
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,208
That ring is special to me...

392
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,583
It represents the promise
we made to each other.

393
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,500
I finally remember
the truth...

394
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,333
You gave this to me...
right, Yuki...?

395
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,625
So then... does that mean...
that we're...?

396
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,208
No, it's not like that.

397
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,000
It's just a symbol of
the promise we made...

398
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,875
That we would always be
friends no matter what.

399
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,750
I'm sorry I lied to you.

400
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,791
I should've told
you the truth,

401
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,833
that we were boyfriend
and girlfriend.

402
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,125
You only lied because you
were trying to protect me

403
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,958
and you stayed by
my side anyway.

404
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,250
I don't know what I would've
done without your help.

405
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,416
After losing my memory,
I didn't have anyone.

406
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,083
I would've been completely
lost without you there.

407
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,833
Akira... that means...
so much to me...

408
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,625
thank you...
for telling me...

409
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,958
No, thank you... Yuki...

410
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,875
I promise, I will
keep you safe!

411
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:55,833
Okay.

412
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,791
As soon as I leave,

413
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,416
I want you to shut all
of the doors and windows

414
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,916
and keep them locked!

415
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,583
Do not open them,
no matter what!

416
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,125
Vampires can be clever...!

417
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,708
They'll play tricks
with your mind!

418
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,750
Let your guard
down and it's over!

419
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,000
Goodbye...

420
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,541
So, what's up?

421
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,833
Junior high let out
about an hour ago.

422
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:24,958
And the high school
should let out...

423
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,125
Are you sure that it's
gonna be sunny tomorrow?

424
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,500
Well, that's what the
forecast predicted.

425
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,666
It seems like...

426
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,500
We're doing this
the slow way...

427
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,666
Wouldn't you say?

428
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,166
From what I understand,

429
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,208
vampire society
is like a pyramid

430
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,250
with the ruler
sitting at the top...

431
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,500
If we could do something
about Princess Mina...

432
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,041
Then everything else would
probably just fix itself.

433
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,333
But... That's out
of the question.

434
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,541
What happened?!

435
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,583
A blackout?!

436
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,000
Please... try to stay
calm, everyone...

437
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,250
I'll go and turn
on the generator...

438
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,666
You don't think...

439
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,125
it could be them?

440
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,291
You guys...

441
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,041
Let me in...

442
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,333
Uh... Who's there?!

443
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,666
It's me...

444
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,000
Please let me in...!
I need help.

445
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,458
Is that...?
It sounds like Nanami!

446
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,458
No way...!

447
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,375
I... I thought
she was dead!

448
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,458
I escaped from the vampires,
but I'm injured.

449
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,791
Please, let me in.

450
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,083
I need to see a doctor.

451
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,083
What should we do?!

452
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,333
We have no choice.

453
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,583
Hold on! We're
opening the doors!

454
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,833
No, don't do it...!

455
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,458
Akira told us not
to open them!

456
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,791
But it's Nanami out there,

457
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,083
and she could be in danger!

458
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,125
Yeah, if she's hurt,
then we have to help her!

459
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,916
No...! Please don't!

460
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,791
No!

461
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,375
It's... you...

462
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,625
Hello there, Yuki...

463
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,125
I'm so sorry...

464
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:21,125
[Music]

465
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,708
Dance with the
Three Stupid Maids!

466
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,333
Who're you calling stupid?!

467
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,916
Geez, that kid
won't stop crying.

468
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,625
Look, Shinya, I'm Dracula!

469
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,000
Aren't my fangs
cool lookin'?!

470
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,541
What the hell
are you doing?!

471
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,708
I thought that all children
loved scary monsters!

472
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,583
You are such an
idiot, Nero...!

473
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,833
Kids like giant
robots like this!

474
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,750
I don't know,
I think that's scarier.

475
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,791
How so? Robots don't
even suck blood!

476
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,250
What are you doing, Nella?!

477
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,833
I thought kids liked
stuff like this.

478
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,250
-No, no, no!
-No, no, no!

479
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,500
You're gonna piss
off all the parents!

480
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,791
This is such a
pain in the ass.
