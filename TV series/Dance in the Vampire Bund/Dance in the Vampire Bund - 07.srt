1
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,041
Someone...

2
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,375
Please...

3
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,666
Help us fight...

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,583
Save my friends...

5
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,958
Hang in there, everyone.

6
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,041
I'm coming!

7
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,291
What are you up to, kid?

8
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,625
It's not safe for you to be
wandering around out here alone.

9
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,375
Who the hell are you?

10
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,833
We've met once before;

11
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,625
it was last year, right after
you lost your memory...

12
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,166
But I guess you don't
remember that, huh?

13
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,750
You were one of
the investigators

14
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,208
looking into my accident...

15
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,041
Yeah, that was a lie.

16
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:03,291
My name is
Alphonse Medici Borgiani.

17
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,916
I'm a marquis, a protector
of the royal family...

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
When you get right down to it,
kind of like Dermaille,

19
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,083
only not quite
so old-fashioned.

20
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,583
I specialize in odd
jobs for the Princess.

21
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,958
Basically, anything that
needs to be kept under wraps.

22
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,791
So you're the one!

23
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,625
You kidnapped
that little boy!

24
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,833
That's right...

25
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,333
Though I take it
from your expression,

26
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,250
you're not a fan
of that mission.

27
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,416
Just so you know,

28
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,833
I was the one who
suggested the plan...

29
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,208
So don't blame
the Princess.

30
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,458
But she agreed to it,
though, didn't she...?

31
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,958
She's just as guilty!

32
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,958
The princess is simply
following her duties

33
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,458
as a policymaker.

34
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,958
And besides, it's not
like you're without fault.

35
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,500
First you ditch
the princess

36
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,083
even though it's your
duty to serve her...

37
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,541
And then you go and
abandon your friends

38
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,166
who you should
be protecting.

39
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,500
What do you mean?

40
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,166
Lord Alphonse,
elevator 13 is ready.

41
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,625
We had a team that was
monitoring the church,

42
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,250
but they've been attacked...

43
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,541
The enemy has since
infiltrated the building

44
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,083
and we're uncertain of what's
happened to the students inside.

45
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,791
Come with me and
I'll fill you in.

46
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,208
I know you're a
man of your word,

47
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,958
but you're not gonna make
it back to the church in time

48
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,000
to save them.

49
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,125
Watch me!

50
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,750
Well... Judging by
his stubbornness

51
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,458
I'd say it's obvious
that he's your son, Wolf.

52
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,750
Father?

53
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,041
Listen, Akira.

54
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,916
When you failed your
mission a year ago,

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,958
and subsequently
lost your memory,

56
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,916
you became completely
useless to us.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,083
As a result, I was then faced
with a difficult decision;

58
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,000
whether or not I
should kill you.

59
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,916
And just to set the
record straight,

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,500
I was all for killing you...

61
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,958
It seemed like the most
humane option considering

62
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,416
what you must've
seen that day...

63
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
But in the end,
I decided to let you live.

64
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,166
To protect the princess
we had to lie to her.

65
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,583
We told her that
you had gone missing

66
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,083
during the operation.

67
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,958
Don't make me regret
my decision, Akira!

68
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,791
When we told her
you were gone...

69
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,166
She was a mess;

70
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,875
that's how important
you are to the princess.

71
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,583
I'm not really sure she's
that important to you, though...

72
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,333
If you go, there will
be no turning back...

73
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,583
You will have to face the
enemy as well as the princess.

74
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,041
Are you prepared
to do that?

75
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,250
Yes!

76
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,083
Just know... I'm not doing this
to prove anything to you two...

77
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,125
This is between me
and the princess.

78
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,000
No!

79
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,291
Yeah!

80
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,541
No! Don't touch me!

81
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,041
There's no use
praying, Sister.

82
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,833
You see, real vampires
aren't bothered by prayers

83
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,291
or silly crucifixes...

84
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,500
They don't have any
effect on us whatsoever...

85
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,750
There's no need
to be afraid.

86
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,916
It may be painful at first,

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,250
but you'll feel euphoric

88
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,250
once you awaken
as a vampire.

89
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,333
You monster...

90
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,083
You have to understand,
it may seem violent,

91
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,583
but the act of blood- sucking

92
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,875
is actually a source of
extreme pleasure for a vampire.

93
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,541
Even sex pales
in comparison.

94
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,583
Sister Laura...

95
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,000
It's such a shame

96
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,041
that you've chosen to
live a life of abstinence,

97
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,375
your body hidden
under religious garb.

98
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,958
I can't wait for you to
experience this pleasure!

99
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,041
No!

100
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,333
Here you go, boys!

101
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,958
I know you've been dying to
get your hands on Sister Laura.

102
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,666
No!

103
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,583
Sorry... you guys...

104
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,958
This is my fault.

105
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,208
Now how shall
I handle you?

106
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,916
Poor Nanami here hasn't
had a single drop of blood

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
since she became
a vampire.

108
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,166
You'll be the one to
quench her thirst.

109
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,416
I'm sorry, Yuki...

110
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,208
But I can't
take it anymore.

111
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,708
No... don't!

112
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,916
I can't control myself...

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,458
Once you've
become one of us,

114
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,208
I'll give you your
first mission.

115
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,541
You will take on
that dog, Akira...

116
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,500
And kill him with
this silver sword.

117
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,875
I can't wait!

118
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,083
No...

119
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,625
No!

120
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,291
Akira!

121
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,458
You have no right to call
for my servant like that,

122
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,916
you foolish girl!

123
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,916
It all started
going downhill

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,791
when our numbers
started growing.

125
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,458
Unfortunately,
so did the attacks.

126
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,375
Some vampires started
attacking humans

127
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,750
without leaving
behind any clues...

128
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,083
It was almost as if they were
trying to flaunt their power.

129
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,500
We tried to stay
hidden in the shadows,

130
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,250
but eventually we were
forced to come out...

131
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,583
We realized that we didn't
have much of a choice...

132
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,583
Whether or not we chose
to reveal ourselves,

133
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,125
the truth was going
to be exposed.

134
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,000
Mankind would have deemed
us their archenemy.

135
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,750
You saw the reaction
your classmates had

136
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,750
when confronted
with vampires...

137
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,625
Now imagine the chaos we
would have caused

138
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,333
had that same reaction happened
throughout the world.

139
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,500
So in order to avoid that
worst-case scenario...

140
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,208
We chose to reveal
ourselves in a way

141
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,791
that would show the humans
that we are a regulated society.

142
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,833
And that we would stay...

143
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,500
On the vampire bund.

144
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,833
Whoever was manipulating
Mizoguchi...

145
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,500
The vampire infiltration
at the school...

146
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,166
The terrorist attack at
the press conference...

147
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,250
The attack on the princess

148
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,083
when she went
looking for you...

149
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,458
Even that idiot

150
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,750
who went berserk on the
"Scales of Astrea" show...

151
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,958
It all stems
from one thing.

152
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,250
We were made
aware of a plot

153
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,083
attempting to destroy
the millennia- old order

154
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,083
between humans and vampires.

155
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,791
If this plan was
ever carried out,

156
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,458
then the entire world would
be plunged into chaos.

157
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,458
The princess was
determined to fight back,

158
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,000
so she came up with a plan
to lure out our enemies

159
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,833
in the hopes of destroying
the conspirators.

160
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,000
She was prepared to do
whatever it took to stop them

161
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,083
and keep her
people protected...

162
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,041
Even if it meant
deceiving her allies

163
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,916
or sacrificing her life...

164
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,541
Princess...

165
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,791
Her plan was successful;

166
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,458
it wasn't long before
we had lured them out

167
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,416
and their identity
became clear.

168
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,458
Who are they?!

169
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,750
Tell me!

170
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,458
They go by the name...

171
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,625
Telomere.

172
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,916
I'm surprised.

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,250
I never would
have suspected

174
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,625
that you were the head
of this organization...

175
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,291
Monseiur Jean Marais Dermaille.

176
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,041
I am honored that you not
only know my humble name,

177
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,000
but that of my
organization's, as well...

178
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,333
Please understand...

179
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,625
this truly is nothing
personal, my Princess.

180
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,000
Tell me, Jean...

181
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,458
Is your father,
the marquis,

182
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,541
in any way involved
with Telomere?

183
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,541
No, my father is an
old-fashioned fogey.

184
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,041
He is merely
another obstacle

185
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,041
that will someday
need to be destroyed.

186
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,000
You're just an
impudent boy

187
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,875
from a distinguished family
who's playing with fire...

188
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,333
So, you tried to
manipulate Mizoguchi

189
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,416
and flooded the school
with vampires...

190
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,083
Just what are you up to...?

191
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,625
And what, exactly,
do you want?

192
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,458
I want everything.

193
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,083
Oh?

194
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,625
Vampires and humans
cannot coexist...

195
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,791
It's only a
matter of time...

196
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,666
before everything
implodes in on itself

197
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,416
and we have to
start from scratch.

198
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,041
Your power as the ruler of
the vampires is limited...

199
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,375
Everything has
to be approved

200
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,500
by those three
detestable clans...

201
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,291
And in the human world it
means absolutely nothing.

202
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,166
But we can give
you power...

203
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,250
Our organization
needs to be rebuilt

204
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,250
with a new perspective
and a new ruler...!

205
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,000
And that ruler that
will lead Telomere

206
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,833
into the glorious, new
world order should be you!

207
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,250
I ask that you please
join us, Princess.

208
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,458
Let's show this world

209
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,916
what the vampire race
is truly capable of!

210
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,333
What we're
capable of, huh?

211
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,416
Interesting.

212
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,750
Princess?!

213
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,750
You can't fathom the
damage you've caused.

214
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,666
Did you really think this would
persuade me to join you...?

215
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,041
You're such a fool.

216
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,625
How could you...?

217
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,208
I never wanted harm to
come to any of them...

218
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,833
Because of you, they will no
longer be able to trust me!

219
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,458
Princess...

220
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,583
I was only trying
to please you...

221
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,875
I thought you were building
the bund to gain more power!

222
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,000
Silence, you imbecile!

223
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,958
You have no right to say
a word about my kingdom,

224
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,500
am I understood?

225
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,875
You're pathetic, Jean;

226
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,833
your ignorance will
be your downfall.

227
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,166
You should know that

228
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,833
we can never be the
rulers of this world!

229
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,500
But why not?

230
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,208
We cannot survive
without humans...

231
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,333
In fact, our very existence
is dependent upon them.

232
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,000
We are merely travelers
in this world.

233
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,125
The purpose of the bund

234
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,750
is solely to give
those travelers

235
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,375
a place to rest their
wings for a short while.

236
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,833
That is also why I
created the school.

237
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,750
I never wanted to
conquer the world.

238
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:23,958
It was quite
the opposite...

239
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,833
I wanted to be
like the humans

240
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,833
I had watched for so long...

241
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,541
I wanted to see
what it was like...

242
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,708
to be just a normal
girl for once...

243
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,208
Oh... Princess...

244
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,833
However...

245
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,958
we all know how
that's turned out...

246
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,750
I neglected my duties and
as a result this happened.

247
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,958
I will make you pay
for what you have done!

248
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,333
Wait, Princess!

249
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,916
If you refuse to join us,

250
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,458
then at least give us
the chance to join you!

251
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,666
-Please, let...
-Silence!

252
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,125
You insolent boy!

253
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,958
I would never allow an
insect like yourself

254
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,458
to join my ranks?

255
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,916
So you decided
to transform?

256
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,916
Your true form is foul...

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,333
Fitting for a despicable
creature like you.

258
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,333
Stop now!

259
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,791
Good...

260
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,250
You are a child
of Dermaille

261
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,833
and as such you are forbidden
to disobey my orders...

262
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,000
Go ahead and try.

263
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,458
That a vile
creature like you

264
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,166
has a blood line even close
to mine makes me sick.

265
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,375
Please forgive me,
Princess... Please!

266
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,500
It's too late.

267
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,583
Prin... cess!

268
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,791
Let go of me!

269
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,250
Well, it looks as though
this fight is settled.

270
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,291
We will change the world,

271
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,458
and we will use your
power to do so, Princess.

272
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,416
I'm sorry...

273
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,291
but you must die, vampire!

274
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,000
No!

275
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,416
Yuki!

276
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:11,958
Damn you!

277
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,375
I've been beaten
by a lowly dog...

278
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,125
I had heard that Telomere
had a human sympathizer...

279
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,625
But I never imagined
it would be you...

280
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,291
How could you, Saijo?

281
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,500
The master's dead!

282
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,125
Hurry! Give everyone who's
been bitten the vaccine!

283
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,291
There's still time
to prevent them

284
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,958
from turning into vampires.

285
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,125
Princess...

286
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,083
Hi, Akira...

287
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,833
Princess, no...

288
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,958
Come on, let's go...

289
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,083
It's over, right?

290
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,625
I'm afraid it isn't
over just yet.

291
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,833
No, it's not.

292
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,791
What do you mean...? Why?!

293
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,416
I'm sorry, you wouldn't
understand, Yuki...

294
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Let's just say that
I have my intentions

295
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,083
and he has his...

296
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,125
Once a sword is drawn

297
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,041
it cannot be put away without
first crossing blades...

298
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,208
Isn't that right...

299
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,958
Akira?

300
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,208
Yes.

301
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,875
One day, a young
boy asked a question

302
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,708
to the great ruler
of monsters...

303
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:06,541
He asked, "Why do you
always look so unhappy?

304
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,083
You aren't always going to
be sad like this, are you?"

305
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,875
I'm sorry, I can't help
but question you...

306
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,291
And myself,
for that matter...

307
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,166
I feel bad for you...

308
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,291
You've had to fight on
your own for so long...

309
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,916
I don't need sympathy!

310
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,041
The ruler replied,

311
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,541
"If you will promise
to grant my wish,

312
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,625
then I promise to you that
I will stop being sad.

313
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,458
But I should warn you,

314
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,333
if you ever break the
promise you've made to me..."

315
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,458
You don't understand, Akira.

316
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,375
I want things to be
the way they were...

317
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,916
I want you by my
side again,...

318
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,208
But I know that
will never happen...

319
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,041
So I have to stop
living in the past!"...

320
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,875
Then I may devour you."

321
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,375
Deep down I knew...

322
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,750
I knew that everything
had changed...

323
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,208
We could never be together
the way we were...

324
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,333
all those years ago...

325
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,958
And if we can never
go back to that...

326
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,166
But he was bothered...

327
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,958
Then I might as
well kill you!

328
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,041
She's transforming?!

329
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,125
One day, the boy
mustered up the courage

330
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,541
to open the door to the
ruler's room in the tower...

331
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,000
He was shocked by
what he saw inside...

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,375
It's her!

333
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,833
So beautiful...

334
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,083
Akira...! Your hand...

335
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,291
I never wanted you to find
out about my secret, Yuki...

336
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,416
But...

337
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,875
Now you know why I've
been so distant...

338
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,083
I didn't wanna put you
in any kind of danger.

339
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,041
Thank you for everything
you've done for me...

340
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,208
But I have to go back
to where I belong.

341
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,750
Akira...

342
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,375
No, you don't have to!

343
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,125
You've grown so
much stronger...

344
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,583
I can hardly
see any traces

345
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:58,958
of the boy you once were.

346
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,291
Everyone changes...

347
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,666
They evolve...

348
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,625
That is, everyone but me...

349
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,916
I remain constant...

350
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,708
I thought I could
handle that fact, but...

351
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,916
Princess...

352
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,416
I am the ruler of
the vampire race.

353
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,083
I control the
world of darkness;

354
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,833
even death itself fears
crossing my path.

355
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,333
But all of that means
nothing to me...

356
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,875
I didn't ask for
any of this...

357
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,041
All I wanted was
something simpler...

358
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,000
I would forgo this life of
blood, scheming and violence

359
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,458
if only I could
be with you...

360
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,333
The promise that we
made to one another

361
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,166
was all that ever
mattered to me...

362
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,625
The words you said to me
that day gave me strength...

363
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,833
Suddenly I had a reason
to continue fighting...

364
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,541
Without you, I never would
have made it this far.

365
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,625
Soon I will have
my own kingdom,

366
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,375
a place that my people
can finally call home.

367
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,708
And so what?

368
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,125
What does it matter?

369
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,083
What I wanted more than
anything has been lost...

370
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,000
I've watched it slip
through my hands...

371
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,000
I know it's
sentimental nonsense;

372
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,083
go ahead and laugh...

373
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,125
I feel so utterly alone...

374
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,541
Be careful, Akira...

375
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,166
"But I should warn you,

376
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,000
if you ever break the
promise you've made to me...

377
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,833
then I may devour you."

378
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,625
"Will you still promise,
despite that?"

379
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,708
No!

380
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,208
"Yes, I promise"...

381
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,833
said the boy with a nod.

382
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,625
"In that case...

383
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:34,958
my wish is..."

384
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,291
Everything's back to
the way it should be...

385
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,833
Why'd you do
something so stupid?!

386
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,291
I'll be fine...

387
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,125
My body will
heal itself...

388
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,416
Shush...! Don't
waste your energy.

389
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,750
Don't worry about me...

390
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,833
Because I've already died

391
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,791
and come back to
life, Princess.

392
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,666
And now we've
been reunited.

393
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:23,916
Do you wanna
know what it was

394
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,708
that brought me
back to you...?

395
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,708
It was the sight
of you crying...

396
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,166
and the promise we made...

397
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,250
Akira...

398
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,625
I promise to you now ...

399
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,666
I will never
forget again...

400
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,833
I'll always be
by your side...

401
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,166
I promise.

402
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,083
Akira...

403
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,583
The Special Zone
Establishment bill

404
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,083
is hereby passed
by majority vote!

405
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,125
Akira Kaburagi Regendorf...

406
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,666
I bestow upon thee the
honor of knighthood.

407
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,333
You are now ranked amongst
my greatest warriors.

408
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:26,375
[Music]

409
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,666
Vera told me

410
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,750
you returned the
Prime Minister's grandson to him

411
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,041
and that you gave
him a vaccine

412
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,916
to prevent him from
becoming a vampire...

413
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,541
you also gave it to the
students who were attacked...

414
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,833
I appreciate it.

415
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,291
That may be true, but it
doesn't change the fact

416
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,291
that I used that poor
child to get my way

417
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,458
or that I caused your
classmates mental anguish.

418
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,708
Be honest with me...

419
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,625
Do you have any
regrets, Akira?

420
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:03,791
Not a one...

421
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,958
As I've told you before.

422
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,791
I will always
be by your side.

423
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,500
Children of darkness,

424
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,500
we have been liberated...!

425
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,333
We've been given
our own nation

426
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,000
to do with as we please!

427
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,166
I hereby declare
the establishment

428
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,583
of the vampire bund!

429
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,500
Theirs was the story
of a promise...

430
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,625
It was a tale of the
great ruler of monsters

431
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,250
and the boy who gave
his all to her...

432
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,500
This was the story
of their love.

433
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,500
Dance with the Vampire Maids!

434
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,541
Why do you refuse to recognize
Akira as one of my knights?

435
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:04,666
I'm sorry, Princess,

436
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,166
but I just don't think
that he's worthy.

437
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,250
How can you say that?!

438
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,916
He was impaled
trying to protect me!

439
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,083
I would impale myself,

440
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,791
if it meant I could
save you, Princess.

441
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,958
But if you did that,
then you'd turn to ash!

442
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,833
I would do anything to keep
you safe, my beloved Mina!

443
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,875
Oh, my, Nelly;
I had no idea.

444
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,750
Excuse me! Would
one of you ladies

445
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,250
do something about the
giant hole in my chest?

446
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,083
Here ya go!

447
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,583
Don't pass it through me!
