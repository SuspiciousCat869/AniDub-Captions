1
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,458
Tango Team is locked
in combat on B3!

2
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,583
I can't see! What the hell?!

3
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,625
Retreat! Retreat!

4
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,833
Come in, Tango Team!

5
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,666
Are you there?!

6
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,833
What happened...?
Is it just me now?!

7
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,375
Your mission is to seize
control of the facility

8
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,583
below the castle without
causing any damage whatsoever.

9
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,208
As per the ancient pact
made with the Tepes family,

10
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,416
you will become Princess
Mina's devoted servant

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,416
and protector when you
turn 17 next year.

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,333
You will never
leave her side.

13
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,750
This mission will act as
a litmus test to determine

14
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,375
whether or not
you're ready...

15
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,916
Do your best, my son.

16
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,291
What is this place?

17
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,958
Princess...?!

18
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,583
Don't tell me...

19
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,958
these are all...

20
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,416
I'm so sorry you had to
see this, you poor boy.

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,458
I'm going to kill you...

22
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,916
I'm going to kill you!

23
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,291
They've been destroyed.

24
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,458
Now that just
leaves me and her...

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,125
It sounds like he's
hurtin' pretty bad.

26
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,041
Does he have an ouchie?

27
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,250
Don't worry,
he'll be fine.

28
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,875
He must be having
a nightmare.

29
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going after him...

30
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,500
Princess.

31
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:32,833
[Music]

32
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,375
Thanks for saving me...

33
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,750
They were so excited...

34
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,166
Kept saying that I
had to fix you

35
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,541
because you're the
princess' knight.

36
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:08,166
My mommy's a nurse...! She'll
make your ouchies go away!

37
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,208
I work at a Special Zone
government healthcare clinic

38
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,916
here on the bund.

39
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,750
We have some
werewolves who come in

40
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,750
so I knew how to
treat your wounds.

41
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,875
Hey... could you promise...?

42
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,291
Please save her...
You have to...!

43
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,708
She's counting on
you, mister!

44
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,458
I've only got
three hours...

45
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,333
until it's dawn...

46
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,708
Princess...

47
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,958
What does it all mean?

48
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,416
I don't suppose you
remember what you saw

49
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,833
on that mission a year ago?

50
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,000
You discovered a
grave secret

51
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,791
about the legacy of
the true-bloods...

52
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,791
You okay, mister?

53
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,500
I'd better go...

54
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,791
It's almost dawn.

55
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:51,958
This way!

56
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,625
What's going on?

57
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,166
Everyone here... is a
fangless vampire...

58
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,708
We live together in this
geofront beneath the bund.

59
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,208
Take this with you...

60
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,958
Don't want ya gettin'
hungry out there.

61
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,625
Please be careful, okay?

62
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,166
Whatever you do,
don't die on us!

63
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,333
The princess is
very special to us;

64
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,333
she's the only leader
who's ever given us hope.

65
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,916
Go get those bastards!

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,541
You gotta get
through this, okay?

67
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,125
For the princess' sake!

68
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,125
By removing our fangs and
refusing to feed off

69
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,000
of humans we have chosen
a life of isolation.

70
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,916
We had resigned
ourselves to believe...

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,958
that was simply
our lot in life

72
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,833
and we would never belong to
human or vampire society.

73
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,833
But when the princess
built the bund

74
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,416
she created a place
especially for us.

75
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,916
She gathered fangless
vampires living in isolation

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,958
all over the world
and we formed a family.

77
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,708
She has brought so
much joy to our lives.

78
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,083
We would be lost...

79
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,083
if it wasn't for
our Princess Mina.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,291
You okay, mister?

81
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,958
I promise you...

82
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,791
I will not be defeated...

83
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,916
I will make it back alive!

84
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,916
This is the utopia
the princess

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,916
has created for
the fangless...

86
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,958
This is what she was
fighting to protect...

87
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,875
I'm ready... I can do this!

88
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,458
You won't be able
to transform

89
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,250
because the cellular
transformation blockers

90
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,541
haven't worn off yet.

91
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,083
So please be careful.

92
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,833
So tell me...

93
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,416
What is this
"true-blood legacy"

94
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,125
that Ivanovic is talking about?

95
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,250
Don't play dumb with me!

96
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,625
Please do not
take offense.

97
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,791
We have refrained from
telling you about it...

98
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,416
because we do not
fully know the details

99
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
ourselves, Princess.

100
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,000
Wolf, stop!

101
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,166
I'm sorry but I
don't see the point

102
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,875
in being secretive
any longer.

103
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,000
So... You wanna tell me why?

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,250
Cellular transformation
blockers...

105
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,416
They're drugs used to
temporarily suppress

106
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,416
cellular activity when
a beast-person

107
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,041
is undergoing surgery.

108
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,541
They take about 3
hours to take effect.

109
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,000
How do I know this?

110
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,208
Because the only thing I
ate before this game of tag...

111
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,291
was one of your
pieces of hard candy!

112
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,333
Why Mei Ren?
Why did you do it?

113
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,416
Why did you set me
up like that?!

114
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,458
I've been waiting for this
moment for a very long time...

115
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,625
Three clans
and Mina Tepes,

116
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,375
the leaders of
the vampire world,

117
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,791
are finally together
in the same room.

118
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,250
Now I can turn them all
into ash at one time.

119
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,375
That's what I must do for the
person who is dear to me...

120
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,625
And just so you know,
I'm not talking about Rozenmann.

121
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,458
Let me guess, it's the
girl I saw in that castle

122
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,500
who looks like
the princess.

123
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,375
Well, it seems like you've
finally remembered everything.

124
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,500
During the mission we
conducted one year ago,

125
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,791
Akira stumbled upon the
"true-blood legacy"...

126
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,041
Although he was badly
injured when we found him,

127
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,625
I suspect his memory
loss was self-induced.

128
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,541
We still have no idea
what he saw down there...

129
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,583
It was that
traumatic for him...?

130
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,500
What is this "legacy"?!

131
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,750
I'm afraid only Akira
would know the answer to that.

132
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,666
All we know is
whatever it is,

133
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,791
it was left behind by
the true-blood lineage.

134
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,208
I highly doubt Rozenmann

135
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,458
and the others know
any more than we do.

136
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,208
It is said that the
legacy involves the blood

137
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,625
of the true-bloods, Princess.

138
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,541
But what does that mean?

139
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,416
Time is essentially at a
standstill for the vampire race

140
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,000
We have been cut off from
the evolutionary cycle

141
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,000
and eventually we'll all
be turned to ash.

142
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Supposedly, with the
"true-blood legacy",

143
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,458
we are able to move forward.

144
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,583
Thus providing
for us a future.

145
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,750
So it was you...

146
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,000
You're the one I saw with
her at the castle that day.

147
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,583
Tell me... Who
the hell is she?

148
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,791
She's the one who's given
me a reason to live...

149
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,166
She's been treated cruelly

150
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,125
and has had her existence
erased just like me.

151
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,000
Even so, she
continues to fight.

152
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,375
She is my princess...

153
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,916
Mei Ren... Come with me.

154
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,458
That's the name I
have given you...

155
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,791
Don't you think it's cute?

156
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,791
She gave me
everything-- my name,

157
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,291
my freedom, a
reason for being...

158
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,208
My people, the Forest
Clan, were endangered

159
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,958
and I was being kept as a
pet when she rescued me.

160
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,750
She has done
so much for me

161
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,000
that I long to
return the favor.

162
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,500
I will do whatever it
takes to make sure

163
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,958
the door to the new
world order is opened!

164
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,041
Then we will crown my princess
as our rightful queen.

165
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,333
Vampires and humans alike
will have no choice

166
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,125
but to bow before her.

167
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,250
What...?!

168
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,791
Mei Ren...! You're with...

169
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,750
Telomere?!

170
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,000
So you were involved
from the very beginning?

171
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,291
Well, come on,
think about it...

172
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,583
We can't let you find the
"true-blood legacy."

173
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,333
This "legacy" you
keep mentioning...

174
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,791
does it have anything to do
with all those clones I saw?

175
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,041
Or is it that blood
looking stuff

176
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,791
she poured on top of them?

177
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,750
I guess you could say
it's a little of both.

178
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,500
The vampire race would not
have a future without them...

179
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,875
We could not survive...

180
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,000
without both...

181
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,666
The blood of
true-bloods...

182
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,250
and either your
princess...

183
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,500
or mine.

184
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,083
Aren't you the least
bit worried...?

185
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,583
I mean, after seeing
all of those clones...

186
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,958
What if your princess...

187
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,875
isn't the real Mina Tepes?!

188
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,625
That's a joke!

189
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,083
You must be kidding me.

190
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,750
Countess Elizabeth
Bathory, Gilgamesh,

191
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,583
Emperor Qin Shi Huang...

192
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,875
That those with power ultimately
end up on a treasure hunt

193
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,208
hoping to find an elixir

194
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,000
that might extend
their lifespan...

195
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,750
I guess the Tepes
aren't exempt.

196
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,041
Princess?

197
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,958
I don't care to
discuss this anymore...

198
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,541
Forgive me but I have much
more important things

199
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,666
to worry about.

200
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,583
I have faith in Akira...

201
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,791
Whatever this "true-blood
legacy" may be...

202
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,541
The promise he made
to me means that

203
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,541
it will never fall
into the wrong hands.

204
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,125
Remember what
you told me...?

205
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,791
You said that we
were the only ones

206
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,083
who can truly
understand each other.

207
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,708
So I'm sure you
know what I mean...

208
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,625
when I say that
in my book...

209
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,708
the princess I made
a promise to...

210
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,416
is the only
princess there is!

211
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,125
Yeah, I know...

212
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,208
And I also feel the
same way about mine...

213
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,458
She's the only one
who matters to me.

214
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,750
We've let them take
over our lives...

215
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,083
We're both crazy.

216
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,416
We're butterflies in
love with flowers...

217
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,375
willing to sacrifice mind,
body, and every drop of blood

218
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,875
without any regret!

219
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,125
This is "Agni's Blood"

220
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,333
that's been modified
for beast-people...

221
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,958
Wanna try to take it out?

222
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,500
Mei Ren...!

223
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,708
Don't worry, I'm
not gonna die alone.

224
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,458
Because your
beloved princess

225
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,875
will be right beside
me when I detonate it!

226
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,833
Now... How about one
last dance, Akira?

227
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,125
Only one can be
the true ruler.

228
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,333
The question is...

229
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,958
will it be your
princess...

230
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:42,791
Or mine.

231
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,500
It's a shame that things
have to end this way...

232
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,750
I actually liked you.

233
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,250
It's almost daybreak...

234
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,958
Akira?!

235
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,958
Akira!

236
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,875
So those two are the
only ones still alive?!

237
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:41,833
My word!

238
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,875
This show is incredibly
entertaining...

239
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,250
Wouldn't you agree...

240
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,291
Princess?

241
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,000
No!

242
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,500
It's all over...

243
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,416
Akira.

244
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,666
Damn it, she got him.

245
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,375
Akira...

246
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,500
No...

247
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,333
Princess... Please!

248
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,875
Don't look away!

249
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,041
Akira said...

250
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,291
he would live...!

251
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,041
He made a promise that
he would return to me!

252
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,333
And I know that he
keeps his promises...

253
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,708
even to the death!

254
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,708
Don't give up! You have to
keep fighting, Akira...!

255
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,625
Your Mina is
waiting for you!

256
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,666
I'm coming, Princess...

257
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,333
I'm so sorry...

258
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,291
I made you...

259
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,291
cry again...

260
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,541
Just hang on...

261
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,125
I will come back to you...

262
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,041
I was thinking, Akira...

263
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,166
I know why our princesses
loved us so much.

264
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,958
Because we kept them
from being all alone.

265
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,125
You...

266
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,166
win...

267
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,000
But I must admit
I'm happy...

268
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,500
I never thought
that I would die...

269
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,041
with someone...

270
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,458
holding me...

271
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,791
Oh, Akira...

272
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,125
My word!

273
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,541
The show's over,
gentlemen.

274
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,708
That's ridiculous...!

275
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,791
He must've cheated;
I want a rematch!

276
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,041
A bet is a bet...!

277
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,041
The three of you
are true-blood nobles

278
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,625
and as such I suggest that you
proceed with honor and decorum.

279
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,166
You dare to scold us...

280
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,250
lowly vermin?!

281
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,625
Wolf...! Show yourself.

282
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,750
I told them we shouldn't
have trusted you...

283
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,500
You deceived us,
you little brat!

284
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,041
Dear Princess...

285
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,166
Did you really think
such a small army...

286
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,000
would frighten the noble
leaders of the Three Clans?

287
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,916
She was hit with sunlight!

288
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,083
Where did it come from?!

289
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,500
The interior
of this castle

290
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,708
is fitted with a special
optical fiber...

291
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,958
It captures sunlight
from the exterior...

292
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,541
which we can then emit
inside the building.

293
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,000
Just the touch
of a button...

294
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,208
And we can flood this
entire room with sunlight

295
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,541
if we so choose.

296
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,958
I know that you're
bluffing...!

297
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,333
Because if you
were to do that

298
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,291
you'd kill your own
master as well!

299
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,083
I rule half the world...

300
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,833
that of the darkness...

301
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,333
Which means you should
live by my word.

302
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,416
I was raised to
rule over you...

303
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,166
I have fought to
keep my title...

304
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,416
I will not let
it go so easily.

305
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,791
If you refuse
to honor me

306
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,083
and continue to insist
that I kneel before you...

307
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,916
I shall turn us all
into ash here and now!

308
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,583
So choose!

309
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,916
Either die with me and
our race is wiped out...

310
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,125
or honor your ruler
and bow before me.

311
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,541
You have served as my
guardians for so very long...

312
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,083
You have my gratitude.

313
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,500
Now I would like for you
to return to your domains

314
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,750
and focus on your
domestic affairs.

315
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,958
[Music]

316
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,750
You came back!

317
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,625
Akira...!

318
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,000
Akira...!

319
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,166
Akira!

320
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,708
Akira!

321
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,666
Please smile...

322
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,458
Do it for me...

323
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,791
Princess.

324
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,416
There ya go...

325
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,166
beautiful... smile...

326
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,416
That's why I...

327
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,000
It's why... I...

328
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,833
Men...

329
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,916
Three howls for
the warrior!

330
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,500
Thank you...

331
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,958
You've done so
much for me.

332
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,291
I hope you have
pleasant dreams...

333
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,208
Mei Ren...

334
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,375
So your friend served
someone who looked just like me

335
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,958
but she never told you
any more than that?

336
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,541
I wonder who she is...

337
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,000
Why? Does it worry you?

338
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,791
Only because it
means that someday

339
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,708
she and I will be forced
to come face-to-face...

340
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,875
And nothing good
can come of that...

341
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,208
I'm sure there will be
much blood shed on that day.

342
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,916
Akira... Is your
arm feeling better?

343
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,791
Yeah, I'm just really glad
they were able to reattach it.

344
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,250
There's almost
no pain now.

345
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,458
That's good.
I'm glad...

346
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,916
I have to tell
you Princess,

347
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,291
it's pretty shocking
to find out

348
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,583
that there's something like
this beneath the bund.

349
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,000
I call it the Cradle...

350
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,000
I think of it as a place
for eternal napping;

351
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,291
far away from the hustle
and bustle of everyone

352
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,250
and everything living
life up above.

353
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,166
A butterfly.

354
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,500
Akira...

355
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,500
So... on that day
seven years ago...

356
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,208
You gave me my wish...

357
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,000
a promise that
remains unbroken.

358
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,916
I think that it's my turn
to hear your wish now.

359
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,375
I want you to be by
my side, Princess.

360
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,458
All I want is for you
to be with me until...

361
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,291
my final moments.

362
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,541
Are you sure...?

363
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,833
I may not be the only
Mina Tepes, out there...

364
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,375
What if I'm not
the real one?

365
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:35,041
Well, you're the only
princess that matters to me.

366
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,125
In that case...

367
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,833
I swear to you
here and now...

368
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,833
I promise I will
always be with you...

369
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,666
until either you or I
move on from this life...

370
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,875
We are bound together...
by the promise we've made.

371
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,791
Though it may seem
like a fleeting moment

372
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,291
in the finality
of eternity...

373
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,583
our promise will
endure forever.

374
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,291
The boy promised
the ruler of monsters

375
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,666
that they would be
together forever.

376
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,708
And she in turn,
swore to him

377
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,916
that she would always
be by his side.

378
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,541
Would you care to
dance with me... Akira?

379
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,916
Of course.

380
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,750
And the promise
that the boy made

381
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,250
to the ruler of monsters...

382
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,083
Would remain unbroken...

383
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,791
for the rest of
their story...

384
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,750
Theirs was the story
of a promise...

385
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,458
A tale of the great
ruler of monsters

386
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,041
and the boy who gave
his all to her...

387
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,750
and the eternal bond
that they shared.

388
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,125
I can't find it anywhere.

389
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,583
Where could that dumb
werewolf have dropped it?

390
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,625
Lighten up on him...

391
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,291
he saved our
beloved Princess.

392
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,708
Okay fine, but
only a little bit.

393
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:01,875
Look! I found it!

394
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,125
Where was it?

395
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,958
Yeah, it looks like
it's been through hell.

396
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,583
I took it from a rat
that was gnawing on it.

397
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,375
Gross, it's all nasty now.

398
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:11,291
Don't worry! We can just blow
it off and it'll be fine!

399
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,333
It's not like it's a
piece of candy we dropped!

400
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,750
I'm so glad

401
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,916
the doctors were able to
reattach your arm, Akira.

402
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,083
Yeah, it seems
to be A-OK now.

403
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,666
Well, you have the
maids to thank for that.

404
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,833
When they heard
what happened

405
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:22,791
they went looking
for your arm.

406
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh really...?

407
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,708
I guess they're not
so bad after all.

408
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,583
Are you guys ready?!

409
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,000
Hurry Nero! It's time!

410
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,791
Hold on, I'm coming!

411
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:33,875
Okay, okay, okay!

412
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,833
Ready... go!

413
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,708
Dance with the
Vampire Maids!

414
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,833
Is now over!

415
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,625
So bye-bye everybody!

416
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:42,875
Okay, ready?!

417
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,166
Rock... paper... scis...

418
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,916
Would you two knock
that off, already?!
