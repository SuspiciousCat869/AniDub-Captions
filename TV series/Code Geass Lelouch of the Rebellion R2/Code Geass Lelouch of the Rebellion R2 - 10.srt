1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:03,400
Three great powers control the world.

2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:07,381
Two of them, the Holy Britannian
Empire and the Chinese Federation

3
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:10,287
are trying to become one through a political marriage.

4
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:14,038
This would be the ultimate threat
to the United States of Japan.

5
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:18,898
That is why Zero has acted by kidnapping
the Chinese Federation's young empress,

6
00:00:18,923 --> 00:00:20,715
the symbol of her nation.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,233
Can dreams cut a path through destiny?

8
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:25,591
Can passion triumph over fate?

9
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:27,598
Or are such things ephemeral,

10
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:30,611
like flower petals fluttering in the breeze.

11
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,735
Lady Xiang-Lin, the guests are fleeing
the reception hall just as we predicted,

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,094
but we have reports that Zero has shown up as well.

13
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,334
Zero! Section 3,

14
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:19,094
report your break-in status.

15
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,869
Master Xing-ke needs back up at once.

16
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,060
Could it be?

17
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:26,094
Is Zero using our plan for his own purposes?

18
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,938
Xing-ke!

19
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:31,659
Zero! Will you release Her Majesty or not?!

20
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:35,557
Xing-ke, do you think you're
able to free the empress alone?

21
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:37,126
You're mistaken.

22
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,861
You even had a Knightmare prepared for this?

23
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:46,413
Hmph. I never thought the Zangetsu's first mission

24
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:48,332
would be to steal a bride from a wedding.

25
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:49,899
Tohdoh! Get Schneizel!

26
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:50,882
Right.

27
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,310
I'm on it.

28
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:54,158
He's already here.

29
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:56,933
Hands off the prince!

30
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,250
Suzaku.

31
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,400
It can't be! Master Tohdoh?!

32
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:02,134
Flee while you can, Your Highness!

33
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,409
I guess it can't be helped, brother?

34
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,909
Yes, I think we should.

35
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:07,628
Schneizel!

36
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,063
We should go too; leave it to the soldiers.

37
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:10,805
Yes.

38
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,854
Zero! The operation's on schedule.

39
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,032
Good! Enter phase three!

40
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:16,684
We're on our way.

41
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:21,104
Xing-ke!

42
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:22,324
Dammit!

43
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,929
Yes! Now!

44
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,285
The same system as the Guren?

45
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,060
So, it does work.

46
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,426
With this Zangetsu, I can take on
a class one warrior like Suzaku.

47
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:43,815
So be it. I'll blow you aw...

48
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,924
Think!

49
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,715
Will you shoot at me in this position?

50
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,271
The Forbidden City!

51
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:52,879
Are they?

52
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,046
Suzaku Kururugi, taste defeat!

53
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:58,033
Kyoshiro Tohdoh! Not yet!

54
00:03:58,058 --> 00:03:59,902
Shadow Longsword!

55
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:01,911
He got my float unit!

56
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:06,089
You can still launch a direct attack?

57
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,038
Tohdoh! Return to your unit.

58
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:10,047
You destroyed the Lancelot's float unit,

59
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:12,918
so he can't pursue us. That's enough for now.

60
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:13,818
We need you here.

61
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,140
Understood.

62
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,158
Your Majesty, you'll soon be outside the Forbidden City.

63
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:19,191
Huh?

64
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,532
Deploy the Dragon Cavalry to pursue them.

65
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:24,281
That is now our task;

66
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,063
you are relieved of duty!

67
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:33,391
Are they trying to escape through a gap
in our radar surveillance network?

68
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,916
Absurd. How could they know that?

69
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:38,316
It's barely ten days since they arived here,

70
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:40,799
there's no way for them to find that out.

71
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:45,579
General Tohdoh, we'll begin resupplying
Knightmares from Chiba's Akatsuki.

72
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:49,838
Good. Then resupply the Zangetsu
and Guren after we return to the Ikaruga.

73
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:53,021
Okay, take the next left turn.

74
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:54,168
Is that correct?

75
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,086
Whops, my mistake!

76
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,176
Idiot!

77
00:04:57,452 --> 00:04:59,327
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

78
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,526
Are we outside the palace?

79
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,394
Yes.

80
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,997
I'm sorry, I didn't expect that your dream would come true

81
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:07,218
in such a violent way like this, but...

82
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:09,897
You remembered about my dream, too!

83
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:11,414
You both did!

84
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,117
They don't know when to quit!

85
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:18,441
Get lost!

86
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,751
Now, take the next right.

87
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:24,090
No, we go straight here.

88
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,998
What? You know how to get there?

89
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,905
Long ago, there's something I...

90
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:32,730
Our nation, the United States of Japan, should be

91
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:36,563
thought of as just a part of
a giant union of united states.

92
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:37,453
Um.

93
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:39,783
Including the United States of China.

94
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:41,474
And for that, we need you.

95
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:44,829
The Indian Southern Province has already promised support.

96
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:47,318
Mongolia and Burma will probably move with them.

97
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:51,832
This Union of United States will
form an axis to oppose Britannia.

98
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:55,384
But, our nation's already a federated system...

99
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,284
All systems are limited!

100
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,803
That's why the high eunuchs sold you to Britannia,

101
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:03,301
for their own ambition! That is unforgivable!

102
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:07,472
Um, It's hard to understand this but...

103
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:09,098
Your Majesty?

104
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:09,764
Huh?

105
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:13,455
Is Li Xing-ke the one you'd really like to be married to?

106
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,505
Oh, no. He just made a promise.

107
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,133
As your fiance?

108
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:23,288
Well, I-I told him I wanted to go outside six years ago.

109
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:26,954
It was that long ago? He must be destined for you!

110
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,479
You, you think so?

111
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:29,908
That's great!

112
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,006
Are you sure you want to leave her to Kaguya?

113
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:36,330
Since the empress doesn't
respond to theoretical arguments.

114
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,522
You don't like that.

115
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:39,197
It's hard to deal with.

116
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:43,176
Say, Zero, have you come up with
some kind of position for me, yet?

117
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:43,842
Hnm

118
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:44,996
I'm wide open, man.

119
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,789
Maybe you can post me as
finance minister or head of banking.

120
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,905
How 'bout Grand Minister of Partying.

121
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,446
I told you to quit making fun of me like that!

122
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:54,681
Come on, we're old buddies, right?

123
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,941
We'll discuss it after we finish the mission.

124
00:06:57,178 --> 00:06:58,136
Huh?

125
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:02,413
What?! The bridge is gone?!

126
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:05,723
This is Forbidden City Strike Force, unit four.

127
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:07,910
Target is currently stopped at Shen Chun.

128
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:09,696
They are such fools.

129
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,924
They fell for it, just as I thought they would.

130
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:13,991
Asahina!

131
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:14,993
I'm on it!

132
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,018
All units, ready for attack.

133
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:20,876
An ambush?!

134
00:07:20,902 --> 00:07:22,834
Enemy troops! We're surrounded!

135
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,673
What? Shoot them! Hurry!

136
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:26,323
No, wait! The empress!

137
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:29,342
Okay, let's try out these new weapons.

138
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:37,168
They've taken out our strike force, haven't they?

139
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:38,890
How did you know that?

140
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:40,366
If I were in their place.

141
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:43,509
I'd hang back and stage an ambush at the Shen Chun ravine.

142
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:44,700
And then?

143
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,566
Then I'd join up with my main force in Shao Pei.

144
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:48,620
Hmm.

145
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:51,686
Xing-ke, we're willing to overlook your crimes

146
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:54,003
if you can bring back our empress.

147
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:56,259
We'll even give you a new weapon.

148
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:01,242
How is Prince Odysseus?

149
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,812
He seems to have calmed down at last. He's resting.

150
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,939
Then once we've replaced my float unit,

151
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:07,297
I can go after the empress.

152
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:11,001
No, we can't go there unless
requested by the Chinese Federation.

153
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:13,420
I understand, but we're missing our chance.

154
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:17,220
That went more smoothly than I'd hoped.

155
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:20,802
Perhaps I should thank Xing-ke
for setting his own plan in motion.

156
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,686
He's a talented strategist.

157
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:27,171
So, how did you find out he was
planning a coup d'etat at the ceremony?

158
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,465
Hm?

159
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:31,142
I was working on the same thing.

160
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,819
Including the E.C.M. and the ambush?

161
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:36,098
Yes. While we were setting our traps,

162
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:39,735
we found some of Xing-ke's men
setting theirs, on the same escape route.

163
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,727
I see. Then you got them to tell you their plan.

164
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:44,908
Did you have to use a truth serum?

165
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:47,344
Yes. It's called "Geass."

166
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,335
Is there news from Horai Island?

167
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,594
Reinforcements from India have already arrived there.

168
00:08:54,729 --> 00:08:57,079
We just have to return and rendezvous with them.

169
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,529
How are things with the empress?

170
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:00,571
An attack?!

171
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:03,008
Our forward Knightmare unit is being wiped out!

172
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:05,242
Stop! All units, come to a halt!

173
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,596
Strange. We should have had at least
an hour before we encountered enemy forces.

174
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:14,602
Unless someone is guessing our moves in advance.

175
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,369
A Knightmare?

176
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:18,891
Zoom in! Hurry!

177
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:22,397
Hm?

178
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,818
What is it?

179
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:28,646
Why's it equipped with the same flight system we use?

180
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:34,323
Knightmare Frame Shen Hu.

181
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:37,179
And it's only running at forty percent of full output.

182
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,678
How could the high eunuchs have built it?!

183
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,989
Flight Enabled or not,

184
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,783
it's only one unit! Surround it!

185
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:44,762
No, hold on!

186
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:48,533
You underestimate the Shen Hu at your peril.

187
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:50,774
I'm caught!

188
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:59,330
How dare you!

189
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:00,174
Hmph.

190
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,006
Silence! You people have no say here!

191
00:10:06,935 --> 00:10:08,602
Can you hear me, Zero?

192
00:10:08,878 --> 00:10:10,878
It can't be! Xing-ke?!

193
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,278
Zero! You shall not pass!

194
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:22,478
That's exactly why I'm calling:
I want to know why we've stopped here.

195
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,126
Oh, I see.

196
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,738
Yes it's completely soundproof in here. But...

197
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:33,699
Now, return the empress!

198
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,832
Do it and I spare your lives.

199
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:38,372
Xing-ke!

200
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:40,280
A flight-enabled Guren!

201
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:42,072
Kallen Kozuki!

202
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,962
Even so, the Shen Hu will crush you!

203
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:46,362
Can we deploy the Zangetsu?

204
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:49,301
Well, we just detached the float unit, so, uh...

205
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:52,230
Get him, Kallen!

206
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,453
But... It isn't recharged.

207
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:59,422
Relax, buddy! She fought off the Knights of
the Round before with the guren just like this!

208
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,632
Scatter shot!

209
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:05,634
Not bad.

210
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:08,475
But I'm... a Black Knight Ace!

211
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:12,497
Show me, Shen Hu! Show me your power!

212
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:13,927
Oh, no! That's...!

213
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:15,202
You know what it is?

214
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:16,811
Well, you see...

215
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:19,097
He knows because our team built it.

216
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,341
What are you saying?

217
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:22,548
We developed it at the same time as the Guren,

218
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,823
but it was too high-spec to handle.

219
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:29,687
A one-of-a-kind Knightmare
that no pilot could master. Until now.

220
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:32,303
Eat this!

221
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:33,800
Try this!

222
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:41,793
It's all right! We're going to be all right!

223
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:44,493
The Heavenly Particle Shocking Cannon.

224
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:46,089
It's just as powerful...

225
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:48,526
As powerful as the radiant wave surger!

226
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,863
But how did our enemies obtain it?

227
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:53,881
The Solidarity of Indian forces might be split against us.

228
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,440
That old man, Maharaja!

229
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,007
Does it have a weakness?

230
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:01,099
It's based on a different design concept than the Guren.

231
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,865
There's no radiant wave system.

232
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,181
And piloting it takes skills that are almost beyond human.

233
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,651
Well there's a human piloting it now, isn't there!

234
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:09,843
Quite so.

235
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:12,403
I have you! Your fate is sealed!

236
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:14,999
That's right, and so is yours.

237
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:17,325
What?!

238
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,551
You can't get away from me now.

239
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:22,326
And this is when I take you apart!

240
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:24,714
Really? Then I have no choice.

241
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,703
I'm going to have to crush you.

242
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:28,846
Let's see you try!

243
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,049
My power supply!

244
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:32,083
Kallen!

245
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,715
I said that she should of recharged first!

246
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,550
The cockpit block's wrapped up!

247
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,093
She can't eject!

248
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:41,979
We can cut the cables with a pincer move!

249
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,124
Roger!

250
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,426
I didn't choose this course, you did.

251
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,284
I have only one objective...

252
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:52,196
To release the empress! Release her at once!

253
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:54,025
Dammit!

254
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,542
Now of all times?!

255
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,935
Can I fight like this? Huh?

256
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:00,695
What?!

257
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,854
Chinese Federation behind us! A huge force!

258
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:09,453
Anti-aircraft barrage! Cover Master Xing-ke!

259
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:10,853
Thank you Xiang-Lin!

260
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,670
No! Hold on a minute!

261
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,790
K-Kallen, no!

262
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,150
The Chinese Federation?

263
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:24,390
She's their prisoner?! Impossible!

264
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:26,590
Kallen! Is your radio working?!

265
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:28,521
S-Sorry I failed you.

266
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:29,838
Forget about that!

267
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:31,749
Don't give up!

268
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:35,288
I promise, I'll save you! Am I clear?! No hasty moves!

269
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:36,398
Uh, right!

270
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:39,700
I understand. I won't give up! I'll do what you...

271
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:45,423
Hurry, bring the Ikaruga around immediately!

272
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:47,719
I respectfully suggest we withdraw.

273
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:50,054
What?! We have to get Kallen back!

274
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,752
Kallen Kozuki is a single combat loss.

275
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:54,650
So, just leave her?!

276
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:57,156
Mr. Minami, consider our choice.

277
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:59,556
You don't take on an enemy like the Chinese Federation

278
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:02,273
over a single life, no matter who it is.

279
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:04,240
We must preserve our military strength

280
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:07,325
and hold out until we rendezvous with the Indian forces.

281
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,055
Zero, it's your decision!

282
00:14:10,162 --> 00:14:12,952
You gave special comfort to Captain Kozuki before.

283
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,758
If you show her favoritism now,

284
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,192
it could put our entire operation at risk.

285
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:18,681
It could ruin us.

286
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:20,946
But...

287
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:23,513
You must put aside your personal feelings.

288
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:26,473
Grand plans require sacrifice.

289
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:32,146
I'm waiting, Lelouch.

290
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,217
Uh, Knight of the Round.

291
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:41,581
I've made my decision!

292
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:42,773
We're going in now!

293
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,788
But why?! If we lose, we'll be crushed!

294
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:47,335
If the Indians betray us, we'll also be crushed.

295
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,294
Yes, but...

296
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:51,902
Chiba and Asahina, use a crane wing formation!

297
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:55,719
We'll teach Xing-ke the difference
between strategy and tactics!

298
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:56,621
Right! Yes sir.

299
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,142
Thank you, Zero!

300
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:01,346
We've been told to stand-by here and wait for orders.

301
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:05,088
Oh. Say, Suzaku, did you see these?

302
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:07,571
Show him those photos, Lady Alstreim.

303
00:15:08,146 --> 00:15:09,708
Uh, what are they?

304
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:10,873
Here.

305
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:13,092
Oh, from my welcome home party.

306
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:16,065
Ah. That one's an invasion of privacy.

307
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:17,865
Oh, Lelouch.

308
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:19,171
Huh? Lelouch?

309
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:21,579
If Shirley saw that, she'd be really mad.

310
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:22,479
Uh huh.

311
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,535
Oh, that's right.

312
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,735
We have to contact Ashford, but I need permission first.

313
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,073
I see. Well, it can't be helped.

314
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:32,158
Lelouch and the others must be so worried about us.

315
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:34,629
Is this also Lelouch?

316
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:38,271
Black Knights! Prepare for battle!

317
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:40,079
The terrain offers little cover

318
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:42,063
and there's no geographic advantage.

319
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:44,275
The enemy forces is an improvised one.

320
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,160
Their chain of command is all focused on Zero.

321
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:50,590
However, their Knightmare Frames give them an advantage...

322
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:53,198
So the Chinese Federation battle plan will be...

323
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:55,650
To put the Shen Hu on the front line and break through...

324
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:57,175
Our center!

325
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,125
I'll stop the Shen Hu... with my Zangetsu!

326
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,888
Dragon Cavalry 3!

327
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:09,205
Our range is superior, so keep firing as you advance!

328
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:13,992
We've blocked Xing-ke! Akatsuki team, fire!

329
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,450
It's true that Xing-ke's pinned down, but so is Tohdoh!

330
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:24,048
Therefore... The battle will be
decided by the skill of the warriors!

331
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:26,865
Hit the enemy force head on
and hammer their advance units!

332
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,908
Ignore their left and right flanks!

333
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:31,910
Without Kozuki, we're one move behind in this game!

334
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:33,529
They've broken through our center!

335
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:34,637
Where's their main force?

336
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:35,787
On our forward line!

337
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:38,187
Right! All tasks at hand are cleared!

338
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:39,563
Begin counterattack!

339
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:40,838
Chiba, right flank!

340
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:42,533
Asahina, left flank!

341
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:45,481
Use attack pattern sigma! Prepare for rearward fire!

342
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,921
Focus barrage on main enemy force! Hit the forward units!

343
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:53,054
Once the Shen Hu's power's used up
and Xing-ke's neutralized, the battle is ours.

344
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,067
Advance!

345
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:56,283
If we get bogged down here, we'll be wiped out!

346
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,440
We're taking Kallen back!

347
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:01,050
Hit 'em hard!

348
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:04,048
Perpare fo hand-to-hand combat! Draw swords!

349
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,254
There's more?!

350
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,000
You've deployed all your forces
to try and finish us, Zero?

351
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:09,071
Such wild risks!

352
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,654
His whole battle plan hinges on the Shen Hu?

353
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,769
What a reckless daredevil!

354
00:17:13,794 --> 00:17:14,710
No.

355
00:17:14,804 --> 00:17:17,117
He's drawing Zero into his net.

356
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,206
The true purpose of this formation is...

357
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:29,538
Xing-ke, your plan was to
rip down the bank of the waterway.

358
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:32,123
But I lowered the water levels before the battle!

359
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:34,398
You think there isn't enough to trap you.

360
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:37,494
That, Zero, is why you've lost.

361
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,992
Agh! What the...?!

362
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:42,019
I can't pull out!

363
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:43,594
Wait, isn't this...?

364
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,552
Correct. It's all reclaimed irrigation land.

365
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:49,931
Even Zero didn't know about the
corruption and shoddy construction.

366
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:53,864
The inferior materials that would
melt and give way beneath their feet.

367
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:55,681
Xing-ke lead the way alone,

368
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:58,581
and then drew them back into the position he wanted.

369
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:00,445
He anticipated my moves!

370
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,927
He knew I'd challenge him directly,

371
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:04,577
then deploy my forces in this exact formation?!

372
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:10,949
It is the very land of our nation
that is giving us this victory!

373
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:13,685
Zero You've lost!

374
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,912
Xing-ke!

375
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:18,887
This battle is far from over!

376
00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:21,849
Tohdoh the Miracle Maker!

377
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:24,833
Well done. But the enemy main force is stopped!

378
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,525
All forces, advance!

379
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:28,029
Acknowledged!

380
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,033
We'll take care of their Knightmares later.

381
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:34,656
Concentrate fire on the enemy ship's engine room!

382
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,006
Their barrier-shields won't hold out forever!

383
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:38,643
Victory is at hand!

384
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:41,261
I've never been out-maneuvered like this!

385
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,391
What a disgrace!

386
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,658
Zero! I gave you my opinion. I told you to withdraw!

387
00:18:46,683 --> 00:18:47,754
Then do it!

388
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:50,437
Protect the engine room and pull back all forces!

389
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:52,989
Even if we return to Horai Island...

390
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:54,014
I know!

391
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,772
Ohgi, what about the other place?

392
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:56,922
Uh! Right.

393
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:59,937
We finished a preliminary recon and survey, but...

394
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:03,210
You've earned your victory Xing-ke.

395
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:05,089
I should have killed you first.

396
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:09,266
You're as good a tactician as I am
and as strong a warrior as Suzaku.

397
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:12,268
One could say the heavens blessed you twice.

398
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:15,834
Yes, but the heavens didn't give him enough time to live.

399
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:19,705
I have to hold on! Just a little longer!

400
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:22,374
Bow-mounted hadron scatter cannon, set!

401
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,320
Gefjun control synch, locked in!

402
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:26,428
Target lined up. Ready to fire!

403
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:30,226
Right! Aim at both enemy flanks!

404
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:31,485
Fire!

405
00:19:35,862 --> 00:19:39,487
Impressive, Zero. So you still had a hand to play.

406
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:43,014
Dragon Cavalry, spread out!
They're targeting battle groups!

407
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:43,724
Tohdoh,

408
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,514
get the troops out of that trap and back on solid ground.

409
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:48,289
The Ikaruga will lead the enemy away!

410
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:50,731
Meet up with us at rendezvous point 4!

411
00:19:54,437 --> 00:19:57,954
I can't find any news reports on the Chinese Federation.

412
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:08,127
Recovery of all remaining Knightmares is now confirmed.

413
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:12,481
I see. We're going to be holing up in
the Mausoleum of Eighty-Eight Emperors?

414
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:14,464
The enemy will think twice about attacking us.

415
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:17,487
The greatest emperors from
Chinese history are buried here.

416
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:19,960
And they can only approach us from straight on...

417
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,485
That way, we can fire the bow-mounted hadron cannon.

418
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,895
Remember, it's a single fire blast.

419
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:27,610
Now we just wait for the Indian forces.

420
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:28,968
I doubt they're coming.

421
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:31,159
Besieged with no reinforcements.

422
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:34,218
In that case, there could have
still been room for negotiations.

423
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:36,934
I never believed the high eunuchs would take that option.

424
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,989
I thought we told you not to move.

425
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:44,768
Did you really think we'd forgive
you after you plotted against us!

426
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,497
This is not the time for revenge.

427
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:50,439
Or perhaps you don't really
care about rescuing the empress.

428
00:20:50,464 --> 00:20:52,173
You've become obsolete.

429
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,506
We have more powerful forces to serve us now.

430
00:20:57,412 --> 00:21:00,895
We never anticipated the Knights
of the Round getting into this fight.

431
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:02,379
You fools!

432
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:06,026
Bringing the forces of a
foreign empire into our territory?

433
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,447
Aid from Britannia?

434
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:08,847
From the Avalon?!

435
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:11,497
Don't the high eunuchs know who they're dealing with?!

436
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:14,179
Who do they think conquered half of the E.U.!

437
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:17,449
It's Schneizel! Second imperial prince.

438
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:22,276
Well, it seems that the high eunuchs are
intent on wiping out Xing-ke along with us.

439
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,502
Diethard, get our little trick ready.

440
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:26,351
What?! You mean here?

441
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:27,876
Everything is in place.

442
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:30,401
And this will make a most excellent stage.

443
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:32,187
I have to strive for victory!

444
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:34,633
Even in this hopeless situation!

445
00:21:35,354 --> 00:21:38,393
And we have a new report from the Chinese Federation.

446
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:40,368
Taking advantage of an attempted coup,

447
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:43,018
Zero appeared and kidnapped the young Chinese empress.

448
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:45,791
Oh, really?! You're okay then, madam Prez?!

449
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:48,049
I'm with Suzaku and the others.

450
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,329
What's the news saying there?

451
00:21:49,354 --> 00:21:51,822
The TV and radio's just talking about Zero now.

452
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:55,170
Thank God! Madam Prez is alright!

453
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:59,568
And so it seems that Zero, the empire's greatest enemy,

454
00:21:59,593 --> 00:22:03,287
is about to meet his end across
the sea in the Chinese Federation.

455
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:39,821
They've done it. They've really done it.

456
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:44,392
Now, even if I use my Geass on the empress
and make her my servant, it'll be pointless!

457
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:48,419
The high eunuchs are in complete control
and they're poised to eliminate Xing-ke next.

458
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:50,677
In the end, we've been cornered with no way out.

459
00:23:50,702 --> 00:23:52,452
Even with Tohdoh and the others here,

460
00:23:52,487 --> 00:23:54,779
Suzaku is bound to join the battle eventually.

461
00:23:54,804 --> 00:23:56,696
There's almost no chance for victory...

462
00:23:56,721 --> 00:23:58,762
No, we're not finished yet!

463
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:01,088
I'll turn this tactical battle upside down.

464
00:24:01,113 --> 00:24:02,863
It's not going to end here!

465
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,471
I won't let it!
