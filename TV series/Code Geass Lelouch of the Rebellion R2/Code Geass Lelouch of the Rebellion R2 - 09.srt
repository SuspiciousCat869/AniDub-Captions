1
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,001
The Chinese Federation:

2
00:00:03,118 --> 00:00:07,129
An alliance of nations boasting
the largest population on the planet.

3
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:10,362
But the truth is, it can be called a doddering old man.

4
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:12,866
The symbol of this alliance is the empress.

5
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:18,429
The ruling class, which controls society from
within her shadow, has grown exceedingly tyrannical,

6
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:22,597
awhile poverty nd stagnation
have sapped the life from the nation's people.

7
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:24,610
When the Black Knights fled Japan,

8
00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:27,385
they sought refuge in this neighboring federation.

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,447
The high eunuchs, the most powerful men at the time,

10
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:33,764
lent the Japanese people the man-made island of Horai,

11
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:38,895
built for tidal power generation off
the Jiangsu Province on the coast of the Yellow Sea.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Even though this arrangement
was worked out well in advance,

13
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:46,810
all the political implications of the deal
will not become apparent until a later time.

14
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:30,294
Man, the Federation's laying a lot of recognition on us!

15
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,350
There was that whole bit with Sawasaki, too.

16
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,958
Think they're pro-Japanese?

17
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,881
The High Eunuchs, you mean?

18
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:39,806
Asahina! Don't you know? The High Eunuchs may be guys,

19
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,569
but they've got no jewels down below!

20
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,641
That's enough!

21
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,685
You'll get us in trouble for saying stuff like that!

22
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,877
Aw, chill out!

23
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:46,612
Hey!

24
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:48,710
I need a hand off-loading the Knightmares.

25
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,289
What? They're here already?

26
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:55,029
Something's gotta be going on behind the scenes
for India to be giving us this much cooperation,

27
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:56,970
No, I think it's that they're serious.

28
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:00,006
They want their independence
from the Chinese Federation, as well.

29
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:01,697
Rakshata mentioned that, too.

30
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:04,454
Considering the place is nowhere's ville.

31
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,493
C'mon! Hurry!

32
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:10,631
We've finished picking out staff leader candidates.

33
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:13,052
Should we assign them to the Ikaruga for now?

34
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:16,129
Yes. That leaves us with the municipal leaders.

35
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:19,996
Correct. Let's work with the
intelligence section and get that set up.

36
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,123
Now then, if you'll excuse me.

37
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,708
Are you sure that we can depend on Diethard?

38
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,983
He acts on his own, like what he did with Sayoko.

39
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:32,341
On the contrary, he's easy to read.

40
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,316
Huh?

41
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:38,271
In that man's mind, he's trying to
turn Zero into a symbol for God.

42
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:41,175
Going from there, you can guess what actions he'll take.

43
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,337
Besides, he has a useful talent
for manipulating information.

44
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,777
All right. That just about does it.

45
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:50,083
That only leaves the combat carrier.

46
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,482
You're installing the Gawain's system
onto the Ikaruga, aren't you?

47
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:56,017
I used the same on Shinkirou, too.

48
00:03:56,125 --> 00:04:00,633
The Gawain's main body was so damaged
when we salvaged it from the sea.

49
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:02,669
And what about the unit that sank with it?

50
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:05,154
The one being called the Knight Gigafortress?

51
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:07,734
I tried to find that myself, however...

52
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:12,310
You seriously want to take down
the Chinese Federation's capital?

53
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,834
In such a way that we won't be viewed as invaders.

54
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,455
If we overthrow Luoyang,

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,189
we clear a lot of conditions for defeating Britannia.

56
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,282
He seems to be okay now.

57
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,079
I don't know what was happening with him at that time.

58
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,362
What is it?

59
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:28,288
Wha...?!

60
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:41,227
Tell me something, Lelouch. Why'd you come back to us?

61
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:44,099
Kallen, when this is over,

62
00:04:44,438 --> 00:04:46,617
will you then return with me to Ashford?

63
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:47,439
Uh?

64
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,245
Cuz I'm...

65
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,353
Tabasco?

66
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,654
Uh! Huh?

67
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:52,428
How long have you been there?

68
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:55,574
It needs Tabasco, but all we have is hot sesame oil.

69
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,876
What should I do?

70
00:04:57,757 --> 00:04:58,697
I wouldn't know.

71
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:00,087
I wouldn't neither.

72
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:01,921
Master Zero,

73
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:03,781
please come to the Ikaruga, hurry!

74
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:04,637
We've got trouble!

75
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:05,444
Huh?

76
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,701
What?! A political marriage?

77
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:16,125
Yes. I received an invitation to the
wedding through the Sumeragi Conglomerate.

78
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,650
The bride-to-be is the empress,
icon of the Chinese Federation.

79
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,900
I'm her good friend, and she wants me to attend.

80
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:24,469
And the groom is to be the first prince of Britannia.

81
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:26,400
That one they call Odysseus.

82
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:29,008
It's too soon to activate the plan we've set up.

83
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,783
I didn't expect that the High Eunuchs would...

84
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:33,121
No. This is a Britannian plot.

85
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:34,881
What do we do under the circumstance?

86
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,924
The worst possible situation.

87
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,811
Tsk! And I was going to move in and
grab the empress before they had a chance to!

88
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:45,624
I never imagined that mediocre man could act so quickly!

89
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,175
Aw, why worry about it?

90
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,950
It's not as if we're involved with Britannia any more!

91
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:50,567
What?!

92
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:53,030
We've been kicked out. Have you forgotten?

93
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:53,867
Um...

94
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:56,626
But they haven't exonerated us of our crimes, have they?

95
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:58,656
However, a political marriage...

96
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:02,391
There's always the possibility that
the Chinese Federation might attack us.

97
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,555
And what then?!

98
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,246
The Black Knights are wrapped up
and given as a wedding present?!

99
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:08,257
Actually, that's an apt way to put it.

100
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:10,738
You're sure developing a useless ability there.

101
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:12,161
We're in big trouble here!

102
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,543
We're in no position to sit around and make jokes!

103
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:15,580
Which is why...

104
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:18,022
We're discussing the matter at this moment!

105
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,282
Zero, the one behind this...

106
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:22,618
Yes. There's another person.

107
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:25,057
The one who, overnight, made this fiendish move

108
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:29,447
in order to reverse their embittered
relationship with the Chinese Federation.

109
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:40,794
They would dare barter away
the empress to the Britannians?

110
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:02,506
Tell me, did the empress willingly
consent to this marriage?

111
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:05,531
That's what they said,
so we can only take their word for it.

112
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:08,317
Besides, this arrangement may be the path to peace.

113
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:09,283
True enough.

114
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:11,868
Today, let's just be good guests and enjoy ourselves.

115
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:14,185
Suzaku! Look, I found it!

116
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,856
This is that charred newt stuff
you told me about, isn't it?

117
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,364
So, how do I eat it?

118
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,274
That's a decoration made out of food.

119
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:22,464
Decoration?

120
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:25,676
But didn't I see you eat a bird
like this earlier in the reception?

121
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:27,159
Do you mean the Chinese phoenix?

122
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:28,747
Oh, that's what it was, hm?

123
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,119
I thought it was meat, but it was really carrot...

124
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:32,074
Huh?

125
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:35,618
Is this made out of potato? I mean, I can eat it...

126
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:36,953
Excuse me, Lord Alstreim,

127
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:39,445
are you accessing your e-mails here in the reception hall?

128
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,595
No. I'm memorizing something.

129
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,051
Oh. That's a diary?

130
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,622
Well then, you're recording, not memorizing.

131
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,912
Uh, Lloyd, I have a serious question to ask you:

132
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:49,687
Am I still your fiancée or not?

133
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:51,962
You're, um... We didn't call it off, did we?

134
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:53,495
This is a rare picture.

135
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,674
I figured you'd skip the celebration party
and just attend the ceremony tomorrow.

136
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,143
Occasionally, Suzaku gets angry with me

137
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:02,501
and says that I ought to behave like a betrothed man.

138
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:04,741
And this young woman right here is the issue.

139
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:07,424
It's a pleasure to meet you. My name's Milly Ashford.

140
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,618
Pleasure's mine.

141
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:12,126
I am dumbfounded to find Lloyd
showing interest in anything human.

142
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:14,192
Yeah, I must be growing up!

143
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:16,843
Allow me to introduce Earl Kanon Maldini,

144
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:18,566
Prince Schneizel's aide-de-camp.

145
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:19,928
Public and private.

146
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,299
Huh? Uh...

147
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:23,485
I'm kidding.

148
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,635
It so happens the prince has a preference
for unusual things. Which includes myself.

149
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,306
Announcing the arrival of the
prime minister of the Holy Britannian Empire!

150
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:35,487
Second prince Schneizel!

151
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,058
It can't be... Nina!

152
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,251
My, I never thought my younger brother would
keep the company of just one particular woman.

153
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,249
Uh-huh.

154
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,625
Who is that girl?

155
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:49,346
Isn't she the chief of Invogue?

156
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,550
Yes, the prince's research team.

157
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:52,867
She's awfully young.

158
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,975
A girl like that should know her place.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,083
Be strong.

160
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:58,750
Euphy always presented herself grandly.

161
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:00,773
Right.

162
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:02,362
It's been a while, Your Highness.

163
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:06,173
The Emperor has commanded that
we accept orders from you while in this land.

164
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:10,766
Three of the Rounds at court? How splendid. Although...

165
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:11,646
Hm?

166
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,992
What, sir?

167
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:14,644
This is a celebration!

168
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,652
Relax a bit and have some fun.

169
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:17,969
Understood, sir!

170
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,737
Suzaku, I trust everyone at school is doing well?

171
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:22,344
Yup. You see?

172
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:23,767
Hi, there!

173
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:26,483
Huh? Milly, it's you!

174
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:32,050
A secret agreement has already been set up
between Prince Schneizel and the High Eunuchs.

175
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:34,764
When she's married, they'll cede our territory to them.

176
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:38,006
He'll then grant the High Eunuchs
titles of Britannian nobility.

177
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:41,262
Nobility? They would sell off their country for that?

178
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:42,681
And our people?

179
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:43,873
Death to the High Eunuchs.

180
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:45,190
We've got to stop this wedding,

181
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,035
even if it means putting our plan into action early.

182
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,952
But if we stage a coup, Britannia's going to declare war.

183
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:53,987
Either we ensure peace, or we do not.

184
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,571
But, Your Majesty,

185
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:01,958
this man broke the law by trying
to save the life of an inmate.

186
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:02,983
Yes, but...

187
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:04,721
I get brought medicine when I'm sick,

188
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:06,500
and the person who brings it isn't punished.

189
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:09,144
There's no comparing that prisoner with you, Your Majesty.

190
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:11,617
Don't argue! The banquet will be starting soon!

191
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:13,135
Do as Her Majesty commands!

192
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,094
If he's taken to face the law, he'll be executed!

193
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:18,185
But that's wrong!

194
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,603
Uh?

195
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:19,500
That's wrong!

196
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,050
He was doing something good,

197
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:22,775
so he shouldn't die because of it!

198
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,389
Uh! Well...you see...

199
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,877
Officer's school?

200
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:28,652
Yes.

201
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,982
That's how I'll use the life that you spared.

202
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:33,501
I wish to protect you in any way I can.

203
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:36,631
I would like to go too. To the outside.

204
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:37,673
Outside?

205
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:39,648
Outside of the Forbidden City.

206
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,571
To school or maybe to the sea.

207
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:45,496
Where you can find all kinds of hot,
yummy food and lots of friends to make.

208
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:46,858
Yes, very well.

209
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:47,723
Huh?

210
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,708
One day, if you still wish, I will
take you away from here, Your Majesty.

211
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,958
Really?!

212
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,496
It's my way of thanking you for sparing my life.

213
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:57,462
Hm?

214
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,583
This is how we make promises outside the city.

215
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:01,724
Hm.

216
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:04,823
Mm-hm.

217
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,525
An everlasting promise.

218
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:12,214
For all time.

219
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:14,904
Either I protect her Majesty

220
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:17,751
or I allow an alliance to ensure peace.

221
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,998
At any rate, I'm certainly glad
this arrangement all worked out!

222
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:22,568
I'm no good at fighting.

223
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,418
Your Highness, will the Emperor be attending the wedding?

224
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:28,838
He informed me at the banquet
back in the homeland that he would attend.

225
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:31,303
Miss Kaguya Sumeragi!

226
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:34,361
The representative of the Sumeragi Conglomerate!

227
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:36,805
Kaguya? What?!

228
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:41,544
It's Zero! How dare he!

229
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:44,027
That redhead with him, isn't she the Guren pilot?

230
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,232
Who invited him here?!

231
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,628
To a place like this?!

232
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:48,032
He's a terrorist!

233
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,703
Well, well, well!

234
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:51,265
Schneizel!

235
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:54,657
So you are the puppet master behind all this!

236
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:02,487
You're nearly ready to graduate, aren't you?

237
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,040
I suppose I should finish, huh?

238
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:06,312
But I'm happy for you.

239
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:08,134
You seem to be doing well for yourself.

240
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,727
Frankly, I'm relieved.

241
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:10,771
You're relieved?

242
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,657
Uh-huh.

243
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:14,272
If anything happens, you can come to me for advice.

244
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:15,422
Just stop that.

245
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:16,025
Huh?

246
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:18,515
Milly, I like you, I really do.

247
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:22,079
However, I hate women who have no depth to them.

248
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:25,542
Princess Euphemia didn't abandon me.

249
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,571
Instead of running away,

250
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:30,151
she risked her own life to save mine.

251
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:32,278
She was the only one who helped me.

252
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:33,714
And I'll help you, too.

253
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:36,686
Will you stop spouting pity for me!

254
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:39,191
You're always playing around as the campus queen,

255
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,633
and you hide behind Ashford as if it's a shield!

256
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:44,034
It's the same with your engagement to Professor Lloyd!

257
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:45,194
You always look down on me,

258
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:48,880
acting like some self-appointed guardian
while you swim in your own hypocrisy!

259
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:51,782
I've changed! It's time you acknowledge that!

260
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,558
Kaguya!

261
00:12:57,456 --> 00:13:00,563
Well, our wedding present has arrived of it's own accord.

262
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,301
My, this worked out wonderfully!

263
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:04,087
You're giving them Kaguya, too?

264
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:07,475
Put that girl out of your mind.
Her crimes warrant the death penalty.

265
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,165
No, you can't! That's wrong!

266
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,440
This isn't Britannia!

267
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:11,581
Your Majesty,

268
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:14,094
the Black Knights are the ones who killed Gao Hai.

269
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,121
Please, don't get involved and
just leave the politics to us.

270
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:20,476
Isn't that what you've always done,
let us handle things our way?

271
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,168
But, she's a friend.

272
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:24,068
Can we please stop quarrelling now?

273
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:26,502
Today is a day of celebration, is it not?

274
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:27,420
Eh! But, sir...

275
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:32,150
Miss Sumeragi, will you refrain from having
Zero accompany you to the wedding tomorrow?

276
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:33,627
I suppose.

277
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:35,751
I don't have much of a choice, do I?

278
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:39,925
If that is the wish of the
Prime Minister of Britannia, then withdraw!

279
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:44,719
So, Schneizel...

280
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:46,821
you appear right before me?

281
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,168
Hmph. As watchful as ever, I see.

282
00:13:50,193 --> 00:13:51,446
Suzaku Kururugi?

283
00:13:51,471 --> 00:13:51,846
Uh!

284
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:53,245
Do you remember me?

285
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:55,121
We're cousins, you and I.

286
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:56,450
Of course I do.

287
00:13:56,475 --> 00:14:00,373
We're the last remaining survivors
of the six houses of Kyoto, aren't we?

288
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:03,140
Taizou Kirihara and the others supported terrorists.

289
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:04,986
Nothing could have stayed their executions.

290
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,093
But this is different.

291
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:09,349
Cousin, did you forget that
Master Zero once saved your life?

292
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:12,435
Do you plan to execute someone you owe your life to?

293
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,937
There's no comparison!

294
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:14,967
Oh, how sad.

295
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:18,533
It's a good thing we're not able to
kill anybody merely with the words we say.

296
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,891
Prince Schneizel.

297
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:20,348
Hm?

298
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,592
Would you care for a game of chess?

299
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:23,917
Chess?

300
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:26,820
If I win, I'd like to have Sir Kururugi.

301
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:27,846
Huh?!

302
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,401
What?!

303
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:30,457
I want give him to you, Lady Kaguya.

304
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,146
Oh, that would be an absolutely marvelous present!

305
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:35,254
Enjoy your anticipation of it.

306
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:36,961
If I can get Suzaku out of here,

307
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:38,926
I can use my Geass on all the others.

308
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:41,448
A checkmate that would turn everything around.

309
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:44,040
I'll agree to your terms, however, if you lose,

310
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:47,023
I want you to remove your mask and show your face.

311
00:14:47,122 --> 00:14:48,340
Agreed.

312
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:52,333
What a fine evening of entertainment this has turned into!

313
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:02,203
Surely we don't have to watch from
a separate room away from the show?

314
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:05,144
He's playing a terrorist. Something could happen, sir.

315
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:08,187
That's ridiculous. It's my husband who's going to win.

316
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,206
I understand how you feel, Miss Sumeragi,

317
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:16,193
but I can't imagine anyone but
my brother, Schneizel, winning this game.

318
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:23,664
This is the ace of the Black Knights.

319
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:24,957
Pilot of the Guren.

320
00:15:24,982 --> 00:15:26,663
Yeah, the one from before?

321
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,890
She's a lot prettier than her wanted poster.

322
00:15:28,915 --> 00:15:30,518
That's my kind of woman.

323
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:37,216
He is good. His Highness is losing.

324
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:39,747
Hm...

325
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,423
Oh, I didn't expect you to
turn the tables on me so quickly.

326
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:46,330
My brother was, and still is, a master of this game.

327
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:48,305
He's the only person I could never beat.

328
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,240
However, that was eight years ago.

329
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:52,671
It's your king!

330
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:56,630
If the king doesn't lead, how can he
expect his subordinates to follow?

331
00:15:56,685 --> 00:15:58,030
Impressive strategy.

332
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,636
In fact... I'll do the same.

333
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:05,623
Huh?

334
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:10,646
I'm on the edge of my seat
wondering who will win this now.

335
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,275
Well, they're evenly matched.

336
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:16,429
Stubborn competition. Practically a fight!

337
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:17,891
So...

338
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,405
You can't advance any further, can you?

339
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,696
Hmm...

340
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:24,661
We'll get into a threefold repetition at this rate.

341
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:28,226
It wasn't my intention, but shall we declare this a draw?

342
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,409
I think not.

343
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:30,200
Hm?

344
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:33,567
You would do well not to
underestimate the white king, my friend.

345
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,057
You wouldn't!

346
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,760
Checkmate.

347
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:39,257
But that means if Zero moves his king forward...

348
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:40,532
Then he'll capture...

349
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:42,157
Prince Schneizel's king!

350
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:44,127
Oh, that's too big of a joke!

351
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,349
He's deliberately losing the game?

352
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,501
What is this?

353
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:52,324
You're simply handing me a victory?

354
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,909
If I accept this invitation,
I'll be giving in to his intent!

355
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:01,661
I can't allow this! This humiliation!

356
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:07,943
With no hesitation whatsoever,
the emperor would have grabbed it.

357
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:12,019
I've now learned just a bit about
what kind of man you really are, Zero.

358
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:13,419
Schneizel.

359
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:16,120
You dare look down on me like that?!

360
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,115
Uh?!

361
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,744
Zero! Princess Euphemia will be avenged!

362
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,198
Stop it, Nina! Drop the knife!

363
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,783
Why are you stopping me?!

364
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:30,691
You of all people should understand
since you were Princess Euphemia's knight!

365
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:32,755
That's right. Then why...?

366
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,950
You're just an Eleven after all, aren't you?!

367
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,011
Nina!

368
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:38,679
Why, Kallen?! You're half Britannian,

369
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:41,217
and yet you choose to protect that monster!

370
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:44,732
No. That's incorrect. I'm Japanese, Nina.

371
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,859
No you're not. You're an Eleven.

372
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:51,257
You're an Eleven, and you pretended to be my friend?!

373
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:54,618
Give her back to me! Give back Princess Euphemia!

374
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:57,376
I needed her! She was a goddess to me!

375
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:58,360
Nina...

376
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,466
Zero... killed her... but you...

377
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:05,125
This is just another tragedy that Zero has caused.

378
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:08,234
Oh, Nina...

379
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,175
I'm sorry. About everything.

380
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,385
However...

381
00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:23,776
Kallen. You haven't changed at all.

382
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:27,943
Even during the Black Rebellion,
you were worried about us.

383
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:30,489
Meanwhile... I...

384
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,276
I... will never turn back!

385
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,445
My profound apologies, Zero.

386
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,803
Let's put an end to our little game here.

387
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:40,798
Now that I've confirmed my suspicions,

388
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:44,161
I'd like to remind you to not
attend the ceremony tomorrow.

389
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,861
Otherwise, a game of chess won't save you next time.

390
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,043
Have no fear.

391
00:18:50,622 --> 00:18:53,787
That's right. I'm marrying this man tomorrow.

392
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,991
And once we're married,

393
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,270
I'll be leaving the Forbidden City with him.

394
00:18:57,295 --> 00:19:00,114
I will go to Britannia as a hostage.

395
00:19:00,712 --> 00:19:04,206
Never dreamed this was how
I would finally reach the outside.

396
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,440
It will be my first and last time.

397
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:11,022
I won't be able to return here again, will I?

398
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:13,789
I... I...

399
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:17,030
We ask this question!

400
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,102
By the voice of heaven, the roar of the land,

401
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:20,728
and the hearts of the people!

402
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:24,052
How does this marriage represent
the will of the Chinese Federation?!

403
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:24,673
Terrorists?!

404
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,979
No, I think they've got a coup d'etat going on!

405
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:28,588
Xing-ke, have you lost your mind?!

406
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:30,047
Be silent, Zhao Hao!

407
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:33,770
In the name of my fellow countrymen,
I challenge the legality of this wedding!

408
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:35,212
Hold him back!

409
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:38,072
It's strange...

410
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:42,055
As much as I pray to save my starving people,

411
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,856
I can only think about Her Majesty's welfare.

412
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:47,169
Right now... I must...!

413
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:48,986
Cut off the broadcast!

414
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,935
This is a terrible situation...

415
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:51,562
Aah!

416
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,256
Oh, no! What about Milly?!

417
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:53,875
Meow?

418
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,022
Lady Kaguya, let's get out of here.

419
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:56,797
What the...?

420
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:57,397
Let's go!

421
00:19:57,422 --> 00:19:58,359
All right!

422
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:00,553
Seize him!

423
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:03,488
We can't let anything happen
to the Britannians, otherwise...

424
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:05,216
it'll be disastrous!

425
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:09,388
Traitor! You think the empress
belongs to you and no other?!

426
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:11,089
That's right.

427
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:15,359
I have no idea whether my action is
in accordance with Her Majesty's wishes.

428
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:19,242
She may not even have the faintest
memory of what occurred six years ago.

429
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:20,710
But no matter.

430
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:23,157
I made an everlasting promise to Her Majesty

431
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:27,022
in return for sparing my life! A vow I swore in my heart!

432
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:30,172
I must... I must save the empress!

433
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:33,421
I will take her... to the outside world!

434
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:34,372
Xing-ke!

435
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,505
Huh?

436
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:38,865
Xing-ke...!

437
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,682
Xing-ke! Xing-ke! Xing-ke!

438
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,592
She does... She remembers!

439
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:48,444
In my heart...

440
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:50,135
...there is no more doubt!

441
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,634
Xing-ke!

442
00:20:57,151 --> 00:20:59,276
I appreciate this, Xing-ke!

443
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:02,752
You've made it so much easier for me to make my move.

444
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,669
Oh! T-That man, too?!

445
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:07,727
Zero, what's the meaning of this?

446
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:09,017
Don't move!

447
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:11,675
What a wretched coward!

448
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,873
Zero. My warning fell on deaf ears.

449
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,714
I thought the Black Knights owed us
for what we did for them in Area 11.

450
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:21,153
Which his why I'm ruining this wedding.

451
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:23,344
Exactly as you people wanted.

452
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:26,350
The only thing is, I'm taking the bride with me!

453
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,750
Xing-ke!

454
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:29,147
Your Majesty!

455
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:32,099
You filthy scum!

456
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,832
Oh, am I?

457
00:21:40,892 --> 00:21:44,100
Yes. If Zero's true objective...

458
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,830
...turns out to be here, we're in trouble.

459
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:47,690
Yes.

460
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:50,276
Is that why you've made preparations for me?

461
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:51,327
It is.

462
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,646
Thank you very much.

463
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:54,433
Once I'm properly adjusted,

464
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,331
C.C. and Lelouch will be no match for me.

465
00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:59,856
Your expectations of Jeremiah Gottwald

466
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:03,179
will be more than satisfied, I promise you!

467
00:23:36,908 --> 00:23:39,367
Even if they try to move now, it's too late.

468
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:43,289
The empress, the symbol of the
Chinese Federation, has fallen into my hands.

469
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:46,590
Xing-ke, the High Eunuchs, Schneizel, too...

470
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:48,615
Let them all dance to my plan!

471
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,725
I'm through positioning my pieces.

472
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,417
This is no game of chess.

473
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:55,517
I intend to checkmate the nation
known as the Chinese Federation!

474
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:58,040
And once I have, I'm coming for him!

475
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:01,135
I'll possess the power to
confront the emperor of Britannia!

476
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,660
And for that, I swear I'll...!
