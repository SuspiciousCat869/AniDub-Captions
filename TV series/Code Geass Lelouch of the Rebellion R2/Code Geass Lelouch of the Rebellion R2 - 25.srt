1
00:00:17,122 --> 00:00:20,262
This is the first time in eight years I've seen your face.

2
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:23,049
The face of a brother and a murderer.

3
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:27,564
And I wear the same face, as well, don't I, Lelouch?

4
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:28,454
Then...

5
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:30,858
It's been you firing the F.L.E.I.J.A.s up until now.

6
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:34,508
Yes. I wanted to stop it all. To stop you.

7
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:36,472
I would have done whatever I had to,

8
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:39,330
even if it meant killing my big brother.

9
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:42,610
That's why I can't allow you
to have control of the F.L.E.I.J.A.s...

10
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:45,283
Why I can't hand this key to you.

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,505
And I wouldn't even if you...

12
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,262
Even if you used your Geass on me!

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,143
Use Geass on Nunnally?

14
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:54,646
It's true.

15
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,276
Time after time, I've wanted to use it on her.

16
00:00:57,314 --> 00:01:00,689
At the very least, I wanted
to use it to cure her blindness.

17
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:02,096
The power of the king...

18
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:05,012
But Nunnally was the reason for everything I've done,

19
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:08,896
so I could never use Geass' power
of absolute submission on her.

20
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:11,671
But now... No, I can't!

21
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:14,416
If I resort to twisting my own sister's will...

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,864
...then I'm...!

23
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:00,664
Kallen... Are you determined to defy me?

24
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:03,564
It's clear to me now that I misjudged you, Suzaku.

25
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:04,224
Hm?

26
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:07,186
Even though we're on opposite sides
and our methods differ from one another,

27
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,338
I always thought you cared about Japan in your way.

28
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:11,403
But now...!

29
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:12,886
There's something that I...

30
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,093
...that Lelouch and I have to do.

31
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:16,347
I see...

32
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,645
You really crave power that much?

33
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:19,784
In that case...

34
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,293
In that case, what?

35
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,436
You mustn't be allowed to live, Suzaku.

36
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:26,005
I'm going to defeat you and stop Lelouch!

37
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,368
No, that won't happen!

38
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:40,963
You having any second thoughts about not running away?

39
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,113
Just where exactly would I be running to?

40
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:45,346
You have a point, Rivalz.

41
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,705
What I wish for...

42
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:49,955
...is to enjoy fun-filled days with the old gang again,

43
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,967
the way we used to.

44
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:52,899
Mm. I do miss them.

45
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,966
You, power without a master!

46
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:00,241
You, who has to have something to depend on.

47
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:01,647
A weak man!

48
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:10,007
Stop, please! You're too badly wounded!

49
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,986
No, I have to take responsibility for starting this!

50
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,732
Because that's what allows me the right to lead others!

51
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:18,691
Lelouch, you have no right to seize control of the world.

52
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,991
You, of all people, who took the name Zero

53
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:24,032
then bent the will of so many in order to serve your own!

54
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:27,068
Are you saying we would have
been better off to remain in hiding?

55
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:30,672
Did you want a future of living
in constant fear of assassination?

56
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,022
This was for your future, too, Nunnally.

57
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,076
My future?! When did I ever say that I wanted this?!

58
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:36,984
Lelouch...

59
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,995
I would have been perfectly satisfied

60
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,461
by just living with you!

61
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:41,518
Don't you see?

62
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:44,355
Our reality is restricted by all sorts of things!

63
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:46,378
Our whole history is struggle!

64
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:49,801
That's the reason I've been
fighting on the side of the resistance!

65
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:53,355
You could have used the system to achieve your ideals!

66
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:56,286
But what about the others?!

67
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:59,111
Those people who aren't allowed into the system?

68
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:03,393
How will they ever be able to
voice their objections to anything?!

69
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:04,844
You...!

70
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,591
Don't you dare look down on others, you elitist!

71
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:10,176
What about those who've no choice

72
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:11,957
but to join the system?!

73
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:13,316
What's fair?!

74
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:15,751
When you follow the methods of an aggressor,

75
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:18,068
then you're only serving to legitimize them.

76
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:21,141
But, if you go into battle now, you'll die!

77
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,124
Why you...! And you call yourself a...!

78
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,962
I apologize.

79
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:30,026
Huh?

80
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:34,161
This is the only way I know how to live.

81
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:36,838
Kyoshiro!

82
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:39,634
Why do people always have to fight?!

83
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:42,872
I fight because there is something that I must protect!

84
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:57,916
It may be that we can no longer find

85
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,361
morality or a sense of dignity in our warfare.

86
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:04,661
Regardless, I still needed to belong somewhere.

87
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:07,239
For that reason alone, we fought.

88
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,443
Naoto... This is really the best thing for us?

89
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:14,316
You know what they say,

90
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,133
war is the mother of invention.

91
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,786
Nonsense, Earl of Pudding.

92
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,493
You don't care one bit whether or not
your invention benefits mankind.

93
00:06:21,518 --> 00:06:24,128
Nina, was it? What about you, huh?

94
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:27,463
I was just... doing whatever I could.

95
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,930
You see, we simply didn't want it to happen again.

96
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:31,038
Oh?

97
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:33,297
However, people are subject to weakness.

98
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:36,336
That's right! Even I have dreams, don't I?!

99
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:38,976
But now they're telling me I don't have any right to them!

100
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,822
They don't think I'm able to fight, but I can!

101
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:44,626
Why does everyone treat me like a fool?!

102
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:45,989
Poor guy.

103
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:48,620
I've seen it before.

104
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:50,312
I've seen it over and over.

105
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:53,920
Human history is one of struggle. Even so...

106
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:55,932
The world and the people in it...

107
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,986
They'll never be what we want them to be!

108
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,219
So now you'll force them?!

109
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:00,744
That's your solution?!

110
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:01,666
That's plain...

111
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:02,941
Despicable!

112
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:05,468
Using Geass, a power that manipulates the minds

113
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,909
of people and violates their human dignity.

114
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,926
Then what about the Damocles?

115
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:12,330
So would you agree that's a despicable method

116
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:14,328
that forces people to obey?!

117
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:15,768
The Damocles...

118
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:18,247
...will become the symbol of their hatred.

119
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:21,026
All their hatred will be focused here.

120
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:24,089
That way, people can move toward the future.

121
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:28,191
I see. You have the same idea, Nunnally.

122
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:29,821
In that case...

123
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:32,751
Lelouch vi Britannia commands you!

124
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:35,972
Hand over the Damocles key to me now!

125
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,256
No!

126
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:52,164
No, I mustn't give it to you! I mustn't do it!

127
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:53,591
All the sins...

128
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:56,020
...you've... committed!

129
00:08:00,638 --> 00:08:03,179
Take this. It's yours now.

130
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:08,099
Why you impudent...!

131
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:10,416
Memorized recording complete.

132
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:13,455
Not quite!

133
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:17,749
Fire!

134
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:25,289
Memorize this! Memorize Jeremiah Gottwald!

135
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:29,978
Commit it to memory, because that's the
memorable name of the man who has defeated you!

136
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:32,253
Memory? What memory?

137
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,366
I remember nothing, I have no memories.

138
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:38,553
No memories? Could it be...?

139
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:45,172
C'mon, Tristan, move it! Just let me fly, will ya?

140
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:50,239
The radiant wave surger's out of ammo.

141
00:08:51,372 --> 00:08:53,703
Now my shield energy is exhausted, too?

142
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:55,257
Big deal!

143
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:05,147
I can't beat her!

144
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:07,380
Even using the Geass I'm cursed with!

145
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:09,722
Your strength is unimaginable, Kallen!

146
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:12,049
My machine has better specs than yours, yet...

147
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:14,207
Why...? While you're this strong...

148
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:15,982
Do the right thing!

149
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:23,245
Let's end this once and for all!

150
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:27,555
If only you had justice on your side!

151
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,772
What happened?

152
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:41,405
You mean I didn't get him, then?

153
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,097
You're wrong. You got me, all right... Kallen.

154
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:01,689
You won. You beat him, Kallen.

155
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:09,855
Nunnally...

156
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:13,746
...you've grown up following your
own thoughts, without help from others.

157
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:16,028
Which means, I am now free to follow the path

158
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:18,151
I must take to my destiny.

159
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:25,857
I thank you.

160
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:28,664
I love you, little sister.

161
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:31,089
Huh?

162
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:38,291
You used your Geass on me, didn't you?!

163
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:42,457
Come back!

164
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:51,191
Stop, Lelouch! Wait...

165
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,505
You've become a demon, Lelouch!

166
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,307
Despicable!

167
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:02,113
Cowardly!

168
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:06,284
How can you? How can you be so cruel?

169
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:10,014
The traitorous knight, Suzaku Kururugi,

170
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,901
has reportedly been killed.

171
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:14,314
Aren't you going to beg for your life to be spared?

172
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,047
Even for his sake, at least?

173
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:17,014
Kaguya...

174
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,534
You never knew Lelouch's
true face until recently, isn't that right?

175
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,706
What of it?

176
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:25,305
Well, in spite of that, you still
understood a bit of his true nature.

177
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,788
So you're obviously a very kind young woman.

178
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,764
Huh?

179
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:35,207
Attention, entire world!

180
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:38,814
Hear my proclamation! I am Lelouch vi Britannia,

181
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,922
emperor of the Holy Britannian Empire and your only ruler!

182
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:46,136
It's not possible!

183
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:48,984
If Lelouch used a F.L.E.I.J.A., then that means...!

184
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:49,905
It can't be!

185
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,222
There's no way!

186
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:53,205
Schneizel has surrendered to me!

187
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,246
As a result of this, I am now in control of both

188
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:58,395
the Damocles and the F.L.E.I.J.A. weapons!

189
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,740
And even the Black Knights no longer
possess the strength to oppose me now!

190
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,807
If anyone dares to resist my supreme authority,

191
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:08,980
they shall know the devastating power of the F.L.E.I.A.s!

192
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:12,850
Those who could challenge
my military rule no longer exist!

193
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,198
Yes! From this day, from this moment forward,

194
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:18,757
the world belongs to me!

195
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:27,026
Lelouch vi Britannia commands you!

196
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:30,616
Obey me, subjects! Obey me, world!

197
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:32,686
All hail Lelouch!

198
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,922
All hail Lelouch!

199
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:39,528
All hail Lelouch! All hail Lelouch!

200
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:50,563
And now, just coming into view,

201
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:54,238
is the 99th and sole emperor
of the Holy Britannian Empire,

202
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:56,721
His Majesty Lelouch vi Britannia.

203
00:12:56,746 --> 00:13:00,772
Our emperor also carries the
distinction of being CEO of the Black Knights,

204
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:04,178
as well as the current chairman
of the U.F.N. Supreme Council.

205
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:05,634
And look at this, too.

206
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,805
Those who foolishly opposed Emperor Lelouch

207
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,492
are being transported to the execution grounds.

208
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:13,451
During the latest great war, the capital, Pendragon,

209
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:16,632
was destroyed and countless
soldiers sacrificed their lives,

210
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:20,819
among them, Sir Suzaku Kururugi, the Knight of Zero.

211
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:24,709
Now that the E.U. has ratified the
United Federation of Nations charter,

212
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:29,524
the emperor has allowed us to
complete the grand task of unifying the world!

213
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,792
Glory to His Majesty Lelouch!

214
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:35,942
All hail Britannia! All Hail Lelouch!

215
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,644
Glory, my ass.

216
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:39,526
This is just a dictatorship.

217
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,338
Anyone who disobeys him gets killed!

218
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:45,106
Shh! If the wrong people hear you,
they'll kill your entire family!

219
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:48,594
I can't believe we have to
broadcast this and call it justice!

220
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,661
Lelouch... is this what you wanted?

221
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:52,290
What you set out to do?

222
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:56,067
To control the world? To control every person in it?!

223
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:58,180
None of you were very bright.

224
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:01,226
If you hadn't disobeyed Lelouch at that time...

225
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,001
We had to move into the future.

226
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:07,253
Hm? It's through repeated successes
and failures that we advance.

227
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:10,572
That not only goes for science, but people, as well.

228
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,155
But that's evolution.

229
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,596
You mean progress, don't you, Earl of Pudding?

230
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,476
About that name you call me...

231
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:17,167
Hm?

232
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:19,005
Are you still bitter?

233
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,905
I could be. I could be not.

234
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:23,749
What's up with them, Professor Lloyd and Miss Rakshata?

235
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:24,482
Hm?

236
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:26,574
Did something once happen between them?

237
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:28,593
It's hardly worth mentioning.

238
00:14:28,663 --> 00:14:32,067
And when I think back on
it now, it wasn't anything at all.

239
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:34,217
It was just a starting point.

240
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:44,734
Ohgi!

241
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:48,984
Do that, and you'll play right into their hands!

242
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:50,092
But he's...!

243
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:54,121
What is that?

244
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,386
Zero?!

245
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:05,109
Huh? Zero?

246
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:06,432
Zero?!

247
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:09,328
That's him?! But Lelouch is over there!

248
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:16,542
Was that it?!

249
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:19,446
Was that what Lelouch and Suzaku had to do?!

250
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,359
Cease fire!

251
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:30,559
I'll take care of this interloper!

252
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:33,182
Hm?!

253
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,984
Onward, masked knight.

254
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,644
Impudent fool!

255
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,390
Heh.

256
00:15:48,855 --> 00:15:51,605
Suzaku... You have to kill me.

257
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:52,994
You must promise.

258
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,603
You're going through with this?

259
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:55,632
No matter what?

260
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:56,857
As planned...

261
00:15:56,882 --> 00:16:00,122
The hatred of the whole world
is now focused directly upon me.

262
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:02,184
And now, the only thing that remains

263
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:05,686
is to get rid of me and finally break the cycle of hatred.

264
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:08,698
The legend of Zero isn't dead.

265
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:10,973
It lives within the hearts of the Black Knights.

266
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:13,226
Schneizel will serve Zero, also.

267
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:16,251
With this, the world will gather,
not for an exchange of force,

268
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:19,422
but for an exchange of open dialog around one table.

269
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,899
Mankind will be able to move forward into the future.

270
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:28,692
And that...

271
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,180
Yes.

272
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:33,960
...is the Zero... Requiem.

273
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:37,588
We both realized it back in Cs' world.

274
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,794
We knew how humanity was longing for the future.

275
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:46,073
Hey, Suzaku, Geass power is
similar to a wish, don't you think?

276
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:47,162
Huh?

277
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:53,748
It's a request to someone to give you
the power to achieve what you can't on your own.

278
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:55,434
A wish? No.

279
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:00,285
Yes. And I'm going to grant a wish
called Geass to all the people everywhere.

280
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:03,106
For the future of the entire world.

281
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:09,104
Lelouch...

282
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:13,762
The price you're going to pay for
using your Geass on them is a dear one.

283
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:19,583
The only ones who should kill
are those prepared to be killed.

284
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,627
Suzaku... You're going to be a hero, now.

285
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:32,303
The messiah who saved the world
from Emperor Lelouch vi Britannia,

286
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:34,623
the enemy of the world.

287
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,587
As Zero.

288
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:49,883
L... Lelouch...!

289
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:53,650
The punishment for what you've done shall be this, then...

290
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:58,710
You will live on... always wearing that mask,

291
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:01,954
serving as a knight for justice and truth.

292
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:06,814
ou will no longer live your life as Suzaku Kururugi.

293
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:13,582
You shall sacrifice the ordinary pleasures
of your life for the benefit of the world...

294
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,281
For eternity...

295
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:19,396
This Geass... I do solemnly accept.

296
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,625
Lelouch? Are you...?

297
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,821
You mean...

298
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:56,985
...everything you've done until now...

299
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:02,152
Oh, big brother, I love you!

300
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,333
Yes... I...

301
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:12,400
I destroy... the world...

302
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:15,950
...and create it...

303
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:20,940
...anew...

304
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:25,494
You can't leave me!

305
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,254
You can't!

306
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,983
Please open your eyes, big brother! Please...!

307
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:31,171
Big brother...!

308
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:34,010
Lelouch the demon is dead!

309
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:35,852
Free his prisoners!

310
00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:44,219
This isn't good! Everyone, retreat!

311
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:47,567
Is that... who I think it is?

312
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:48,442
It's Zero!

313
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:49,157
Uh?!

314
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:50,585
It's him!

315
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,681
It's Zero!

316
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,096
It's unfair!

317
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:56,706
All I wanted and needed to be happy was to be with you!

318
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:01,389
How can I ever look forward the future without you?

319
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:26,414
Zero! Zero! Zero!

320
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,999
Well, Lelouch...

321
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:55,539
The world's gotten a lot better since that eventful day.

322
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:58,685
All the energy that was once expended on war

323
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,320
has now been directed toward solving hunger and poverty.

324
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:08,627
As expected, all sorts of hateful and
evil deeds have been blamed on you. Hm...

325
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:12,852
Maybe that's because people find it
a lot easier to accuse a person with a name,

326
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:15,824
rather than a piece of technology called Damocles.

327
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,199
Perhaps that's putting it too simply.

328
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:20,602
But... whatever the reason...

329
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:22,635
...the world is free of the past

330
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,077
and it's finally able to move forward into the future now.

331
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:28,716
I wonder if you're laughing right now about how everything

332
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:31,262
went according to your elaborate strategy.

333
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:34,397
Nevertheless, there are still plenty of problems

334
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:36,347
we have to work out for ourselves.

335
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:37,997
But even so...

336
00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:13,595
I said that Geass was the power of the king

337
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,393
which would condemn you to a life of solitude.

338
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:19,811
I think maybe that's not quite correct.

339
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,897
Right... Lelouch?
