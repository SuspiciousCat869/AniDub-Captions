1
00:00:00,785 --> 00:00:04,109
The Knights of the Round have become
members of the student council.

2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,609
And while I still haven't cleared that problem,

3
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:07,334
what...

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,683
What were you saying?!

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,755
That Shirley and I were...

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,047
Yes. It's true, Shirley and you were kissing.

7
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:15,118
Mm! Uh?!

8
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:17,597
Um, I wasn't wrong in doing that, was I?

9
00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:19,999
I was afraid she might discover this control room,

10
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:22,340
so I thought that's what I should do in your character.

11
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:23,643
Bad call.

12
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:24,901
You were mistaken there.

13
00:00:24,926 --> 00:00:27,274
Sayoko! I've told you already!

14
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:29,353
You were acting too nice as his stand-in!

15
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:30,628
No, hold on.

16
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:32,278
Aside from this, she did a good job.

17
00:00:32,303 --> 00:00:34,969
Lelouch! I know Sayoko used to be in your service but...!

18
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,836
Actually, to be precise,
I was working for the Ashford family.

19
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:38,772
I know that!

20
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:41,138
You were in charge of caring for Nunnally, right?

21
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:45,193
I guess the problems of the
Knights of Round will have to wait.

22
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:48,053
Master Lelouch, I have your schedule for tomorrow.

23
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:48,836
Tomorrow?

24
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:52,724
Sayoko made promises to other people
without considering all the consequences.

25
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:55,961
I was instructed to maintain
his interpersonal relationships.

26
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:57,240
It can't be helped.

27
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,182
Quite careless for a female ninja.

28
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:00,988
I am a secret service agent.

29
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:02,951
A 37th master of the Shinozaki school...

30
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,101
Sayoko!

31
00:01:04,136 --> 00:01:06,090
Wha... What's with this schedule?!

32
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:07,906
Allowing for three hours of sleep,

33
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,501
you have dates scheduled with 108 girls.

34
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,789
Fourteen of them are waiting for cancellations,

35
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:15,359
and they've been on the wait list for six months.

36
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:17,723
Lulu just did it so suddenly!

37
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:20,707
I wonder if I can say we're going steady...

38
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,420
But I wasn't able to talk to him today.

39
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:27,932
Prez! Can I have a minute with you
when we go back to our room?

40
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:30,459
There's something I'd really like to talk to you about.

41
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:32,974
Prez?

42
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:36,049
Huh?! Oh, sorry, Shirley. I didn't hear you.

43
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:37,378
No, it's okay. I just...

44
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:39,476
I've got a date with Lelouch tomorrow!

45
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:40,114
Huh?!

46
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:44,407
Oh? I heard that Giselle in class B said
that she'd go to the art gallery with him.

47
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:47,128
Yup! He's taking me out, too, to a movie.

48
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:47,955
Me, too!

49
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,772
Me, too!

50
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:53,255
Lu... Lu...!

51
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,050
And that confirms your schedule for today.

52
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:35,616
Since you have no classes pending,

53
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:37,807
I was able to fill all 24 hours.

54
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:40,839
At 0700 hours, you'll enjoy a homemade box lunch.

55
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:43,320
At 09:00 hours, you'll visit the art gallery.

56
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:45,187
At 10:30 hours, shopping.

57
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:47,091
At 12 noon, a trip to the aquarium,

58
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:49,400
and from there travel abroad Shinkiro.

59
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:52,972
Please go underwater until
you are 400 kilometers from shore.

60
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:56,666
You'll change clothes inside the cockpit
and proceed to the Chinese Federation,

61
00:03:56,691 --> 00:04:00,151
where you'll conclude a trade treaty
in Shang Hai at 15:00 hours

62
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:02,843
You are allotted 47 minutes to
complete your business there,

63
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,015
then you'll return here to
see a late movie at 21:00 hours.

64
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:09,312
At midnight 02, you'll meet
your next date for a live show,

65
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:09,820
and then...

66
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:11,187
He's late!

67
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:14,843
Sorry, Shirley.

68
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:17,529
I promise I'll make time later to explain all this to you.

69
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:20,062
You can start by explaining it to me.

70
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,329
Lady Anya!

71
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,227
There's something I want to ask.

72
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:26,712
Don't tell me I have a date with a Knight of the Round!

73
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:28,018
Same Lelouch?

74
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:28,820
Uh?

75
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:33,350
That's a picture of me when
I was still a prince back in the homeland!

76
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,454
O-Of course not. Remarkable likeness.

77
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:37,689
But you know I'm only a commoner.

78
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:38,885
Lelouch, old man!

79
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,685
Ah! What?!

80
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,023
May I please go to your chess games with you?

81
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,965
Only the underground ones where you bet!

82
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,900
When I told him h you gambled on your games,

83
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:48,314
he begged me to take him along.

84
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:50,923
Rivalz... I swear, you're...!

85
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:55,350
Oh, brother, they never quit! Just gimme a break, already!

86
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,220
He's running away!

87
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:58,200
Don't go ruining my reputation!

88
00:04:58,225 --> 00:04:59,725
I've got tickets for the late show in my room!

89
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,498
If I break my commitment, then my next date will... Ah...!

90
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:04,939
Darn it, Sayoko!

91
00:05:04,964 --> 00:05:07,685
Lelouch is too frail for such a heavy schedule.

92
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,669
And what's up with all these women?

93
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,856
It's sorta like a mental problem

94
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:15,848
Who did that?! I said I wasn't running away!

95
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:16,629
Uh?!

96
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:19,160
Shirley...!

97
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:21,856
So, what lucky girl do you have a date with this time?

98
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:23,120
Um, I uh...

99
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:27,443
You not only gamble, but you run around
with other girls, too?! Ah! You're pathetic!

100
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:29,027
Wait a minute! It's just...

101
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,843
Uh. I forgot. Here.

102
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:33,368
This is for not explaining to you about it.

103
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:37,927
Oh, it's an apology? What, you think you can
fix what you did by giving me some silly thing?!

104
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:40,470
You've got it all wrong! I just wanted to apologize!

105
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,208
An apology?!

106
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:47,006
This is not good. I'm clearly doing something
wrong and don't know how to make it right.

107
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:49,281
Dammit, if only C.C. was here to help me.

108
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,423
Attention everyone!

109
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:54,668
I have decided on my graduation event!

110
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:57,408
And I'm going to christen it Cupid Day!

111
00:05:57,433 --> 00:06:00,264
That's swell, but isn't it a bit early for graduation?

112
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:02,941
Well not for me. I'm repeating my senior year.

113
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:05,508
I can graduate as soon as I earn enough course credit.

114
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:08,543
Oh... so that's how the education system works here.

115
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,118
Prez, are you really planning to graduate soon?

116
00:06:11,143 --> 00:06:12,945
Why not wait and do it with the rest of us?

117
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,250
Milly, my dear...

118
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:15,279
Madam President!

119
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:18,068
This "Cupid Day" of yours, what exactly is it?

120
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:19,839
You wanna know?

121
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:20,735
Meow.

122
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,754
On the appointed day, I'll have every
student in school wearing one of these hats.

123
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,362
The boys will get this color.

124
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:29,887
Then, if you steal the hat of your target and put it on...

125
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:30,956
And then what?

126
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:33,339
By order of the student council president, me,

127
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:36,254
those two will be proclaimed boyfriend and girlfriend!

128
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,020
Huh?!

129
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:38,878
Wha...?!

130
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:42,565
Hm... It's a bit rash, isn't it?

131
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,958
Declaring war on the Chinese Federation?

132
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,832
Hm, is that what His Majesty said?

133
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:50,460
Yes. He told us to take all of it.

134
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:51,902
I agree!

135
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:54,302
I say take out the Chinese Federation for good!

136
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:58,379
Those savages humiliated Odysseus,
and we can never forgive them for that.

137
00:06:58,404 --> 00:07:02,643
Guinevere, I harbor no grudge for
the incident that occurred with the empress.

138
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:04,793
The war with the E.U. is ongoing,

139
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:07,316
and Area 11 is on the path to peace,

140
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:08,648
so I'd prefer to settle this without...

141
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:11,298
Oh, as if we care about what Nunnally does there!

142
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:13,785
Carine, Nunnally is around your age.

143
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,977
You should make an attempt to be friends with her.

144
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:19,610
This would be an easy matter
to solve if Cornelia was present.

145
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:21,858
Bismark, have you heard anything?

146
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,935
I haven't.

147
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:25,875
And she apparently hasn't contacted Lord Guilford, either.

148
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,035
Then who will lead our troops?

149
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,466
We can station two divisions along the Mongolian border.

150
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:34,670
Huh? Are you offering to take command, Prince Schneizel?

151
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:36,195
Battle is unnecessary.

152
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,636
The Chinese Federation has fallen apart.

153
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:43,110
We can gain half their territory
by rattling sabers and through negotiations.

154
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:45,690
Will that placate the emperor?

155
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,239
Oh? Is that what Schneizel said?

156
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:51,389
Yes, Your Majesty. Do you approve?

157
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:53,088
You, the Knight of One,

158
00:07:53,113 --> 00:07:56,280
the mightiest knight of the empire, asks me that?

159
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:59,773
Your Majesty, war is merely one method of diplomacy.

160
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:02,764
However, it's far and away the least efficient of them.

161
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:05,220
Heh. Perhaps you're right.

162
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:09,365
War has historically been an action favored by idiots.

163
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:21,614
I've finally grabbed it. The tail of Geass!

164
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,196
And now I'll drag it from the shadows.

165
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:28,261
I'll wipe away the stain from Euphy's name at last!

166
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,767
Princess... Where are you now?

167
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:35,290
C'mon, Suzaku. It's Milly's graduation event.

168
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:38,927
It's like I said before. I'd really wanna go.

169
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:42,359
But unlike you and Anya,
I'm an aide to a viceroy, so I just can't.

170
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:43,842
Meetings come first.

171
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:46,325
Jeez, you really need to loosen up, my friend.

172
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,757
Say hi to my fiancé for me, will you?

173
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:51,273
What? You're serious about that?

174
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,123
You should probably give her a call after we're done here.

175
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:54,815
Huh?!

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,184
"Now" has a funny habit of not waiting around forever.

177
00:08:58,306 --> 00:08:59,806
Wow, what a surprise.

178
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,627
I never thought I'd hear you
say something like that, Guilford.

179
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:04,439
Your rank may have changed,

180
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,281
but you did start out as Princess Euphemia's knight.

181
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:09,036
As the knight of Princess Cornelia,

182
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:12,625
I'd like you to see me as a source
of advice that you'll ask for when needed.

183
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,275
Well that's mature of you!

184
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,148
Anyway, can we get to the main question at hand now?

185
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:20,417
It's about the Guren, which I have taken into my care...

186
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:23,492
Took you long enough.

187
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:26,594
So, am I here for torture? Or maybe execution?

188
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:28,315
Do what you want with me.

189
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:31,425
I'll do nothing like that to you.

190
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:35,154
It's been a such a long time. Hello, Kallen.

191
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:41,023
At this rate, it'll be impossible for me
to smash the world and create a new one!

192
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:47,096
It's Cupid Day. I'm going to end my
relationship with all the girls at today's event.

193
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:49,173
Ah. That will leave you free and in the clear.

194
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:53,097
Fortunately, we were able to
get the teachers to participate in this, too.

195
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:53,713
Huh?

196
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:56,334
Villetta, you're going to steal my hat from me.

197
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,914
But won't that just invite weird misunderstandings?

198
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:01,406
I think Sayoko needs to take responsibility here...

199
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:02,847
Sorry, but I can't help.

200
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:05,895
I have to play stand-in
during the event for Master Lelouch.

201
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,914
And we've got to make sure
that some strange girl doesn't get it!

202
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:10,772
Have Shirley grab the hat!

203
00:10:10,797 --> 00:10:13,156
Yes, that's definitely an option to consider.

204
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:15,723
That girl is completely head-over-heels for you.

205
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,427
She did shoot me in order to protect you, after all.

206
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,137
That's why I don't want her mixed up in this any further.

207
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,120
Huh?

208
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:24,879
Yes, that's right, Suzaku.

209
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,196
The rooftop garden's finally finished.

210
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:30,331
Suppose I can't keep avoiding the real world forever.

211
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,339
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,652
I really hate missing your graduation event.

213
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:36,670
I understand. You have important work to do, right?

214
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,058
Um, y-yeah.

215
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,562
Then my final act for you is
to cast my special magic spell!

216
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:42,254
Huh?

217
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:47,968
Relax! Ha, ha. You need to unwind from time to time.

218
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,660
Thanks a lot Prez, I appreciate it.

219
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:51,900
See ya!

220
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:54,851
Now let's get this show on the road.

221
00:10:54,894 --> 00:11:00,416
Attention everyone! This is Milly Ashford
speaking for the last time as student council president!

222
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,958
My graduation event, Cupid Day, is about to begin!

223
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,871
Oh, and before you start,

224
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:09,238
make sure you're at least
two meters away from your target.

225
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:12,693
Lulu. I don't care how hopeless you are...

226
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:17,193
No! Since you are utterly hopeless,
it's up to me to salvage you!

227
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:20,406
Prez, you don't really want to be engaged, do you?

228
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:23,650
Deep down, you want me to steal you away. Right?

229
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:25,842
You should all be familiar with the rules.

230
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:28,159
If you capture your target's hat and put it on,

231
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:30,839
then you have to be boyfriend and girlfriend!

232
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:33,049
I won't question how you obtain the hat.

233
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:35,974
You're allowed to use teams or tools, as well.

234
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,758
Now, before we begin, I'll just say one thing.

235
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,990
Any club that brings me the hat of Lelouch Lamperouge
in class 3-D gets their budget increased ten-fold!

236
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:49,059
What?!

237
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:50,149
Lulu's hat?!

238
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:51,479
Prez, why?!

239
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,094
Tsk! This is all a horrible dream!

240
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:58,179
All right! Let's do it!

241
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:02,297
Lulu wait...

242
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:18,672
Stopping this many people at once is incredibly hard work!

243
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,098
Oops. Sorry 'bout that.

244
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:23,557
Now, move.

245
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,644
He's mine!

246
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:27,246
Huh?! ... Aagh!

247
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,515
He vanished! Where'd he go?!

248
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,426
Sorry about this.

249
00:12:33,174 --> 00:12:35,108
Forget it. We're good.

250
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,000
H-H-Hold on.

251
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:45,111
Should that theory be accurate,

252
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:47,469
then we're the worst criminals in all of history!

253
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:48,680
Let's get out of here!

254
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:50,476
We're through fine-tuning Jeremiah!

255
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:52,320
We'd be abandoning our nation!

256
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:55,249
Freeze! My dear Bartley...

257
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,149
That voice... Princess Cornelia?!

258
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,022
Why are you here, Bartley?

259
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,756
Thank heaven you've come! Please save us!

260
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:03,442
Hm?

261
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,998
We were ordered to be here. By the emperor.

262
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:06,981
My father?

263
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,845
The world is racing down the path towards destruction!

264
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,778
Uh?!

265
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:14,778
Follow me, ladies!

266
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:16,039
Lord Gino!

267
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:17,306
I see.

268
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:20,769
It appears that Gino did come
to this school just to play around.

269
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:23,389
Anya seems suspicious about my true identity,

270
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:25,437
but not enough to prove troublesome.

271
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:28,288
The matter of the Knights of the Round has been cleared.

272
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,741
Now, I've only to switch places with Sayoko

273
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:32,349
and have her play along with the Prez...

274
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:36,106
I did it! Now I get to be Lelouch's girlfriend!

275
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,396
Of course.

276
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:38,403
Miya, right?

277
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:39,928
What's up, honey bunch?

278
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:43,157
Would you mind very much... giving me that hat back?

279
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:50,336
Okay.

280
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,345
So where should we switch?

281
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,203
Here will do.

282
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,529
Very well, then.

283
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:59,049
Hm? Whoa, now I'm more confused than usual.

284
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:00,558
What am I doing here?

285
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,318
Huh? Lelouch is gone?

286
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,065
Yeah, according to the gardening club.

287
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,131
Rugy team here!

288
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:07,791
Lelouch has been spotted at point KT-01!

289
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:08,873
Yes...!

290
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:11,400
Alert all Ashford Academy club members!

291
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:14,801
Surround Lelouch between
the boy's dorms and the central courtyard!

292
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:15,993
Sir! Yes, sir!

293
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:17,382
Hm? Agh!

294
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:19,436
The rugby team's getting that budget bonus, pal!

295
00:14:19,461 --> 00:14:21,339
GO...!

296
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,500
Huh?!

297
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:25,893
Fair thee well!

298
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:26,621
Huh?

299
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:28,578
Sayoko! Watch what you have me say!

300
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:30,998
Or I'll come off as being kind of mental.

301
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:32,901
Sorry, it was involuntary.

302
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:35,191
Just be careful. And don't go to the rear gate.

303
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:36,533
Villetta's standing by there.

304
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:37,758
Understood.

305
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,240
Lelouch is more physical than normal.

306
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:43,539
I would like to let you catch me,
Miss Milly, but at the moment...

307
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:49,499
Archery and equestrian clubs,
from the side of hall, you can surround him!

308
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:52,051
Go on around the school buildings to gym number two.

309
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:55,194
The science club will probably be positioned dead ahead.

310
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,468
Fire!

311
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:01,284
No way!

312
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,576
Lelouch can't do stuff like that!

313
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:08,179
If this keeps up, he won't need my help after all.

314
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:10,984
Sayoko's overdoing it, but that's how she operates.

315
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,166
There's no point ordering her to stop.

316
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:16,358
Oh, well, she can take my place in Phys Ed from here on.

317
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,092
Glamour squad, move in!

318
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:22,034
After all, Lelouch is a warm-blooded male.

319
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:24,727
Yeah, we'll catch him off guard.

320
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,359
Using your bodies against me is useless!

321
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,692
Huh...?! Wow, I'm sort of in shock!

322
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:30,486
Where's Lelouch?!

323
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:31,232
Where'd he go?!

324
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:32,149
Nobody's caught him yet!

325
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:33,156
Attention, all students!

326
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:35,692
If Vice President Lelouch is spotted,
commence a simultaneous...

327
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,485
Oh boy, the Prez is in full-scale "play" mode.

328
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,184
Still... what's going on?

329
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,323
I thought Lulu was completely hopeless

330
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:45,926
but now I'm finding out he's a super athlete.

331
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,256
Hey look, it's Shirley!

332
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,024
We have to catch Lelouch!

333
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,031
Prez! If Lelouch is who you want,

334
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:56,875
then I, Rivalz Cardemonde, will give you what you want!

335
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,580
My best friend in the world!

336
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:02,740
Uh. Huh? Whoa, that can't be for real...!

337
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:04,140
It is.

338
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,622
The Mordred's just been launched?!

339
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:09,601
It's the Black Knights then?!

340
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,425
Emergency dispatch from the government bureau!

341
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,328
Defcon 2! Defcon 2!

342
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:15,327
A riot has erupted in the school district!

343
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:17,852
Knight police SWAT unit, prepare to move out!

344
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:22,318
Uh! I should have guessed that Anya doesn't
possess a grain of common sense, either!

345
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,729
Take the operation into
final phase! Sayoko, to the library!

346
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,367
Oh, there.

347
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:35,472
Hm... This is the spot where Lulu was acting strange.

348
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:36,910
I wonder...

349
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:39,915
Shirley... Why now all times?

350
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:45,638
Heat sources. Two places.

351
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:48,136
But which one is Lelouch?

352
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:50,745
Hm?

353
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,722
Watch out!

354
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,375
Twin Lelouches?

355
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,324
Knight of Six, my lady!

356
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:06,141
This is an operations area of the O.S.I.!

357
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:08,803
Please, withdraw your Knightmare at once!

358
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:10,473
This is wrong?

359
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,766
Yes, very wrong.

360
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,166
Wrong.

361
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,332
Say, Lulu...

362
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:19,265
Hm?

363
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:22,101
Why did you kiss me before?

364
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:24,037
Well, um, because...

365
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:25,373
...I like you.

366
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:27,966
That's a lie, I know you aren't serious.

367
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:28,766
Wrong!

368
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,570
Uh?

369
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:31,388
I mean... I just...

370
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,270
A good question.

371
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:37,292
So, you wanna do more than just kiss?

372
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,273
Huh?!

373
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:41,801
It's okay, even if you're not serious.

374
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:43,864
Uh! You shouldn't speak that way!

375
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:46,583
Welcome back, Lulu.

376
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,495
Huh?

377
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:50,443
You haven't been yourself lately, you know.

378
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:56,010
It's okay. I forgive you.

379
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:58,134
In return, close your eyes for me.

380
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,057
Huh?

381
00:17:59,085 --> 00:17:59,835
Hurry up.

382
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,228
O-Okay.

383
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,825
You thought I was gonna give you a smooch?

384
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,252
Um, well, ya know... I thought there was a possibility...

385
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:30,470
Oh, you dirty boy!

386
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:31,578
No, it's just...!

387
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:36,545
Even so, I wanna try and make you
fall in love with me for real, some day.

388
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:37,570
Uh...

389
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:40,864
I told you. I said love is power.

390
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:48,528
I can see you guys still have
a lot to learn around here, don't you?

391
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:50,296
This is a school for commoners.

392
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:52,696
Things like this take place all the time!

393
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:54,470
Look at that!

394
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:57,227
How disappointing, but I'm not surprised.

395
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:00,698
I guess that's the end of game.

396
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:03,092
Butit might have meant little more this time around.

397
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:04,117
Huh?

398
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:09,277
Yeah. Maybe It did...

399
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:10,864
...a bit.

400
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,297
What in the world was all that uproar about?

401
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,655
Sorry, sir.

402
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,518
It looks like it was the president's graduation event.

403
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:23,194
It's unusual to say the least that
he would change plans like that.

404
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:24,096
Changed plans?

405
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,616
Uh, I meant she.

406
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:28,741
Shirley's plan apparently worked out quite well.

407
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:31,394
Lelouch!

408
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,672
Looks like you finally understand.

409
00:19:33,697 --> 00:19:34,199
Hm?

410
00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:35,710
You mean you did this for us?

411
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:38,073
Cause you two really wear on my patience.

412
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:40,848
Don't ever hesitate, your student days coming to an end.

413
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:44,081
Uh! Prez, are... you really graduating?

414
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:45,220
Mm-hm!

415
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,659
Hey, Prez!

416
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:48,408
What is it?

417
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,693
Thank you for everything you've done here at school.

418
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:51,211
Uh.

419
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:53,309
The last three years were so much fun!

420
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:54,792
You were the best president ever!

421
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:55,485
Thank you!

422
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,968
Madame president!

423
00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:59,612
Congratulations on graduating from Ashford.

424
00:19:59,637 --> 00:20:05,192
Mm-hm. And with that, this girl
is no longer avoiding real world!

425
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,414
Hello, everyone! How are you?

426
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:10,193
My name's Milly Ashford!

427
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:15,471
Beginning today, I'll be your go-to-girl for
weather information here on the weather corner!

428
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:16,629
Let's start with an update...

429
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:19,397
From student council president to a weather reporter.

430
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:20,839
How'd she qualify?

431
00:20:20,864 --> 00:20:23,778
I heard she chose a talent agency while still in school.

432
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:24,902
Hmm...

433
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:26,364
She's from nobility.

434
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:29,174
She said she never likes to do anything halfway, so...

435
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:31,093
Then why'd she call off her engagement?

436
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:32,204
Did she have to?

437
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:34,636
Wow, Lloyd must be in a state of shock!

438
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:38,805
Just what I'd expect from my former fiance.

439
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,925
Lloyd doesn't seem upset about it.

440
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,284
It's all bravado.

441
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,668
No, the man never wanted
to get married in the first place.

442
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:48,012
You see, Nina?

443
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,382
I'm trying to face who I really am.

444
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:55,421
Yeah, I saw her on TV. Typical Prez, huh?

445
00:20:55,446 --> 00:20:58,467
So, what do you think we ought
to do with the rooftop garden?

446
00:20:59,081 --> 00:20:59,914
Right.

447
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:02,850
Well then, I'll bring back some
herb seedlings from the store.

448
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,930
Would you talk to the gardening club, Lulu?

449
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,779
Okay, see ya later!

450
00:21:09,975 --> 00:21:11,400
Huh?!

451
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:13,711
This is the eighth area, correct?

452
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:17,070
Yes. But the people who were affected by the Geass power

453
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:19,868
have been deployed as secret police, haven't they?

454
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,831
We don't know, so we're cleaning up the situation.

455
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:24,796
You've been given a Geass Canceller,

456
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:27,996
which can destroy all types of Geass power. Therefore...

457
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,603
Yes, I understand.

458
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:32,086
We don't know who's under the influence of Geass.

459
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:34,152
However, once I'm done with Ashford Academy,

460
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:37,014
I'll take care of old business with Lelouch.

461
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:55,173
I'm remembering now...

462
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:59,163
I remember Zero, and the one who killed my father...

463
00:22:01,173 --> 00:22:03,158
It's Lelouch!

464
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:41,353
I must give Japan its independence.

465
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:45,002
And at the same time, I have to
put together a dating itinerary with Shirley.

466
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:46,939
There are 18 hypothetical routes.

467
00:23:46,964 --> 00:23:50,395
I've set up a way for C.C. and Kaguya
to send me emergency messages.

468
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,781
I may even get the chance to work out
rescue preparations for Kallen.

469
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,098
But I have no idea what Shirley will like.

470
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,195
What should I do? Is there someone I can consult?

471
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:02,309
I get the feeling that I'm going to
make the wrong choices again.

472
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,555
That worries me to no end!
