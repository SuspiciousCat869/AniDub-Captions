1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,964
Madam President! Is she all right?

2
00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:05,330
I don't get this Chinese Federation thing!

3
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:06,962
We've just received an update...

4
00:00:06,987 --> 00:00:10,087
She said that she's sorry,
but she can't buy us any souvenirs.

5
00:00:10,112 --> 00:00:11,624
She's joking about it?

6
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:12,656
Thank goodness.

7
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:15,428
We should make an announcement
so everyone knows she's okay.

8
00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:17,199
Uh?

9
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:18,900
Thank you, Lulu.

10
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:21,726
You're welcome, Shirley.

11
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:22,269
Huh?

12
00:00:22,294 --> 00:00:24,023
Lelouch, got a minute?

13
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:26,259
Attention, all students.

14
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:27,792
This is an emergency update!

15
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:31,496
We have confirmation that Milly,
our student council president, is all right!

16
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:34,121
She's apparently escaped from the scene of the coup d'état

17
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:38,862
in the Chinese Federation under the
protection of Knight of Seven, Sir Suzaku Kururug.

18
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:41,379
Aren't you getting a little carried away with all this?

19
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:45,255
Oh, does it seem that way to you? I'm very sorry, Rolo.

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,641
You're acting way too nice to everyone.

21
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,955
But I'm supposed to keep his relationships harmonious.

22
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:53,430
Those were Zero's exact orders.

23
00:00:53,455 --> 00:00:55,788
Yes, and of course you're to follow his orders...

24
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:58,320
But you're not to exceed your role as a stand-in.

25
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:00,433
Remember, he's very self-absorbed.

26
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:02,620
Yes, I see your point.

27
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,718
After all...

28
00:01:03,743 --> 00:01:06,776
I'm a woman who serves both Lelouch and Zero.

29
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:09,703
Sayoko, Zero is in danger right now.

30
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:12,726
He's in a stalemate with the Chinese Federation, right?

31
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:15,561
Yes, and Prince Schneizel just joined the battle.

32
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:17,742
Uh! Britannian forces inside of China?!

33
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:18,419
That's right.

34
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:21,075
The Knights of the Round have entered the battle zone.

35
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,459
Our reinforcements aren't coming! What the...?

36
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:27,163
Calm down, Tamaki!

37
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,400
We still have the Chinese Empress as a captive!

38
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:31,431
They can't just start shooting at us!

39
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,801
What is it?!

40
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,451
Full scale bombardment.

41
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:36,525
But that means...

42
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,360
Yes. The Chinese Federation intends to obliterate

43
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:42,926
the Mausoleum of Eighty Eight
Emperors and us along with it!

44
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:46,851
As for the Empress, they want her to die.

45
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:24,317
The High eunuchs.

46
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:28,027
They'd violate this sacred
Masoleum for their petty ambitions?!

47
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:31,602
All forces, cease fire! Her Imperial Empress is inside!

48
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:34,212
You still don't understand, do you, Xing-ke?

49
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:37,526
Generation upon generation of emperors are buried there.

50
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,910
In short, it's a grave.

51
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:41,402
A good place to bury our current empress.

52
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,287
We've already arranged for a new empress to replace her.

53
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:48,455
A puppet bride who would nicely match
Prince Odysseus on their wedding photo.

54
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:51,241
You dare to say this?!

55
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:52,572
You're the one?

56
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:54,505
The guy who started the coup de etat.

57
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,987
Stand aside, Britannian!

58
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:58,012
This concerns my country alone!

59
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,692
But, those guys represent your country,

60
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:02,551
internationally speaking.

61
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:06,326
Besides...

62
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:08,836
You captured the Guren, isn't that right?

63
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:11,216
I happen to have a bit of unfinished business

64
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,658
with that Knightmare and its pilot.

65
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:20,063
Remember, our air power's limited!

66
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:22,036
Ride with honor, and strike like steel.

67
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,033
Roger!

68
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:24,474
I'll go out in the Akatsuki.

69
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:25,474
C.C.

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,748
In case we lose, have an escape route.

71
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,421
If you come up with a smart trick, I won't need one.

72
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:34,075
Second enemy air raid squadron, coming in fast!

73
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,412
We're not gonna hold out long against this!

74
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:45,516
Stand aside! I am Kyoshiro Tohdoh!

75
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,357
What do you know?

76
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:52,423
They actually brought in someone
good aside from that Guren girl.

77
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:54,031
Gino. Leave him to me!

78
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,826
Suzaku!

79
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,238
We really could go down this time.

80
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:01,758
They've got the Lancelot and
those next generation units...

81
00:05:02,643 --> 00:05:05,672
The Mordred is here! They're all closing in on us!

82
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:08,489
All rebel forces, annihilate them.

83
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,581
Split into three groups! Surround her and fire!

84
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,022
Your shells... Useless...

85
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,002
If I can get inside her shields...!

86
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:23,854
Oh, no! I'm leading the dance at this party!

87
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,889
What?!

88
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:32,373
A single shot from the Mordred's Stark Hadron cannon

89
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,241
would demolish the mausoleum, wouldn't it?

90
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,474
Well, yes, if you just want to crush them.

91
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:39,721
And the moment we did that,
they'd say we killed their empress.

92
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:43,538
We have to let the High Eunuchs
make that last, mortal blow.

93
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:45,377
Ah.

94
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:47,501
So you admit you're outmatched?

95
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:50,234
Well, we won't accept your surrender. It's too late now!

96
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:51,884
You insist on fighting?

97
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,944
Even though your own empress will die in the attack!

98
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:57,509
The empress is merely a system.

99
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:59,769
There are plenty of others to replace her.

100
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,046
So you can't use her as a bargaining chip.

101
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:05,431
But you used her to gain noble
titles in the Britannian court.

102
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:08,028
You have sharp ears, don't you?

103
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:10,205
A cheap price to pay for power.

104
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,018
Cheap? A phony treaty that
gives China's land to a foreign nation?

105
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:16,306
Land is nothing but dirt, after all.

106
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:16,897
Correct.

107
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:19,062
We're Britannian noblemen now, that's what counts.

108
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,784
And what about the common people you've sworn to protect?!

109
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:23,643
Zero, when you walk down the street,

110
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:26,000
do you worry about stepping on the ants?

111
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:29,884
You throw away the paper that clings to
your bottom, don't you? It's the same thing!

112
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:32,534
You sell out your country, abandon your empress,

113
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,748
betray your own people, and all for what?!

114
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:36,336
Ha, an idealist!

115
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:38,525
I never thought you were so naive, Zero.

116
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,425
Indeed, masters and commoners will always breed.

117
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,879
Like insects.

118
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:48,613
Radiant shield generators two and five are off-line!

119
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:49,888
That leaves the deck exposed!

120
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:51,172
Ah!

121
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:52,502
Stop it!

122
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,005
Your Majesty!

123
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,324
Noblemen? You're bureaucrats,

124
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,721
paper-pushers who know nothing about noblesse oblige!

125
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:03,893
Please, stop it. You have to stop all this fighting!

126
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:05,335
You can't go out there now!

127
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,776
I have to! Out of my way! I have to go after the Empress!

128
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,867
Your Majesty!

129
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,281
What?! My wing!

130
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,561
You let yourself get distracted.

131
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:22,442
This is wrong! All of it! All of it!

132
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,651
Do it now. Fire on the Empress!

133
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,551
We hear and obey!

134
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:29,910
Hang on, Shen Hu! My life is yours.

135
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:32,898
Take it if you must, but save the Empress!

136
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,100
Run away, Your Majesty! Go, now!

137
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:40,381
Xing-ke?

138
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:42,114
You finally made it outside of the city,

139
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:43,891
but you haven't seen any of the world yet!

140
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,678
I will defend you here!

141
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:48,820
But, without you it's no good, Xing-ke.

142
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:51,383
It has to be you and I together! It has to be!

143
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:52,631
Uh?

144
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:56,328
Your words are wasted on me, Your Majesty. However...

145
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,226
Intensify the attack!

146
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:01,209
Don't stop till you've crushed the Shen Hu!

147
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:04,264
Scum! It can't end like this!

148
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:07,046
I can't save you, after all.

149
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,628
Can't protect you. For six years,

150
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:12,915
everything I've done has been
to fulfill my promise to you.

151
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,315
Someone do it! I don't care who!

152
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,538
But, please, someone save her!

153
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:22,174
Very well. I understand.

154
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,837
Wish is granted.

155
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:48,641
Uh! What is that Knightmare?!

156
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,907
It's not only protecting the Empress, but Xing-ke as well!

157
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:55,537
I ask this of the Chinese Federation and the Britannians.

158
00:08:55,562 --> 00:08:59,380
If you want to keep fighting,
are you prepared for the consequences?

159
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,958
Zero? He's come to the front line himself?

160
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:02,900
Zero?

161
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:04,056
But why would he...?

162
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:07,148
Why are you stopping?! All units, wipe them out!

163
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:08,438
So be it!

164
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:11,926
I gave you your chance, let no one forget that!

165
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,228
Lloyd, you know what that is!

166
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:21,410
Yes. We may have lost this one.

167
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,351
Using the Gawain's Druid System to generate that shield?

168
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:27,524
I can't believe it. What kind of scientist worked it out?

169
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:29,574
Knightmare Frame Shinkiro!

170
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,498
Its Absolute Defense Field is the strongest
protective shield system in the world.

171
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:46,458
Ah!

172
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,155
This could be a problem.

173
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,990
What are your orders, Prince Schneizel?

174
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:59,168
If we fire, the Empress will...

175
00:09:59,193 --> 00:09:59,889
Hmm.

176
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:02,038
We could just hang back and wait them out.

177
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:03,822
There's something strange about this.

178
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:04,384
Uh?

179
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:07,401
Why did Zero choose this time to show up in front.

180
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:09,682
How pathetic, Xing-ke.

181
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,946
You were betrayed by your own countrymen,

182
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:14,185
and you couldn't even save one little girl.

183
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,668
Do you get it now? You need me.

184
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:18,871
I'm the only ally you can rely on.

185
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:21,198
I'll never be subordinate to you, Zero.

186
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:23,015
Subordinate? No.

187
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,209
You have the potential to lead your entire nation!

188
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:28,856
They need deliverance. Your empress.

189
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:31,381
And all the helpless people of the Chinese Federation!

190
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:32,993
They're crying out for it!

191
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:36,293
You think your Knightmare
can turn the tide of this battle?

192
00:10:36,318 --> 00:10:37,391
Not at all.

193
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,854
The tide of a war is determined by strategy, not tactics.

194
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,806
Emergency alert!

195
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:44,650
Riots have broken out in Shanghai!

196
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,059
Street riots?!

197
00:10:50,452 --> 00:10:52,450
Damn you! You'll pay for this

198
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:54,447
They're rioting in Shanghai?

199
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:55,647
It's not just Shanghai.

200
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:59,862
Shou Xian, Beijing, Burma, Jakarata, Islamabad...

201
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:02,428
And there are 14 other areas that we're still confirming.

202
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,161
People are rising up everywhere!

203
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:06,842
Rebellions breaking out simultaneously?

204
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:10,100
Yes, they're broadcasting a communication
between Zero and the High Eunuchs.

205
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,211
Communication?

206
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:13,684
So they were conspiring without informing us.

207
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:14,667
Can you run it?

208
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,034
Yes.

209
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:18,605
The empress is merely a system.

210
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,797
There are plenty of others to replace her.

211
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:23,504
And what about the common people you've sworn to protect?

212
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,341
Zero, when you walk down the street,

213
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,644
do you worry about stepping on the ants?

214
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:30,451
Indeed, masters and commoners will always breed.

215
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:31,675
Like insects.

216
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,533
Heh. Thanks to the Empress,

217
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:36,391
the High Eunuchs are now firmly cast as the villains.

218
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,558
You mean... you planned on their betrayal?

219
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,541
He couldn't have caused this; it's happening too fast.

220
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:45,556
Unless he made use of someone
else's plan already in place.

221
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,356
Correct!

222
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:49,302
I stole another strategy of yours as well.

223
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:51,743
We start a coup and the people rise up!

224
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:53,018
In other words...

225
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:55,585
We're not trapped here without reinforcements!

226
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,480
We do have reinforcements.

227
00:11:57,505 --> 00:12:00,963
The starving masses of this land are backup we needed.

228
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:02,400
Then we can take the offensive...

229
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:03,614
And strike!

230
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:06,819
The Black Knights are to be annihilated.

231
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:09,315
She's just as tough as I expected.

232
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,426
No!

233
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,788
What is this?!

234
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:21,438
So, that's what you did!

235
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:23,341
Mm? What's that?

236
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:27,120
Now's our chance!

237
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:31,219
Anya, no!

238
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,020
This is the Tristan! I'm moving in to cover Mordred!

239
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:38,435
Push 'em back now!

240
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,311
Fools!

241
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:42,099
Deploying their ground forces at this point in the battle?

242
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:44,523
If we bomb them from the air, we'll destroy them.

243
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:46,102
No, we're withdrawing.

244
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:46,912
Huh?

245
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:50,669
Nations aren't dirt and they're
not systems. They're people.

246
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:52,944
The High Eunuchs have lost the people's support,

247
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:57,205
they're no longer qualified to join us
as representatives of the Chinese Federation.

248
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,730
Yes, Your Highness.

249
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:04,008
The Avalon and the Knights of the Round are withdrawing!

250
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:08,200
Yes, I thought that's what you'd do, Brother.

251
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:09,237
However...

252
00:13:09,262 --> 00:13:12,107
What do you think the Emperor would have done Kanon?

253
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,694
Forget it. I was just musing a bit.

254
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:18,186
So, Prince Schneizel has abandoned you.

255
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:19,878
So much for your titles.

256
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:23,085
Don't hurt us! We'll give up our power. Whatever you want!

257
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,112
Still worried about your own skin?

258
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:33,938
Where is Kallen Kouzuki?!

259
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,329
That's the Guren's pilot.

260
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:39,130
She was classified as a P.O.W. and transferred out.

261
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,140
What?!

262
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,511
The High Eunuchs handed her over
as a favor to the Knight of Seven.

263
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:44,969
To Suzaku?!

264
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,444
So, you're trying to take everything away from me,

265
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:50,469
even Kallen. But that's not going to happen.

266
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:52,936
I promised that I'd come for her, and I will.

267
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:56,217
Nothing will stop me, not even you.

268
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,093
Where is this place?

269
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:03,094
I thought we were going to
meet in the Britannian homeland.

270
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:06,406
And besides, this was by direct order of the emperor.

271
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,851
Yes. As requested.

272
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:10,359
In your attempt to recreate C.C.'s power,

273
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,428
you enhanced Lord Jeremiah.

274
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,763
In light of your 'efforts' I felt we should call you in.

275
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,038
You see, I need some final adjustments.

276
00:14:18,063 --> 00:14:21,219
You're really the only logical
choice for this, and in any case...

277
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:23,995
You should be pleased; it's a great honor for you!

278
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:29,874
Is this all right for you?

279
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,642
Uh. Well...

280
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,299
Uh?

281
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:35,030
I was finally able to leave the Forbidden City,

282
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:38,475
uh, and now... I mean...

283
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,812
This doesn't mean it's "the end." It's just...

284
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,640
I shall protect you in the future, as well.

285
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:47,924
Until the very end of time.

286
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:52,439
It's so strange. I'm so happy!

287
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,842
I'm so happy, and yet...

288
00:14:58,428 --> 00:15:05,083
Zero, we need to let the world know that
the Empress's betrothal to the Britannian Prince is off.

289
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:06,275
That's true.

290
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,698
And the best way to do that is to
have her marry someone from our side.

291
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:12,267
A member of a Japanese family would be perfect.

292
00:15:12,368 --> 00:15:13,144
Uh?!

293
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:16,895
Hm. That's tastelessly obvious,
but a smart move all the same.

294
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,852
We can have her marry Tohdoh. Even Tamaki would do.

295
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:22,827
If you'd like, I can draw up
a list of suitable candidates...

296
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,332
But you mustn't!

297
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,572
Lady Kaguya, this is a political
maneuver, it isn't personal.

298
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:29,912
You're wrong, it is personal.

299
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:32,391
It's a simple question of love!

300
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:33,833
She has a point.

301
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:34,557
Mm?

302
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:36,611
We're at war; lives are at stake!

303
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,188
Hey, you're pushin' it, buddy.

304
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:40,778
Buddy?! I am a staff officer!

305
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:44,536
Zero, what's your decision?

306
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:46,880
You understand, Master Zero, don't you?!

307
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:47,864
Well...

308
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:51,095
Zero! Listen, about yesterday. Hm?

309
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,618
Are you guys still in conference?

310
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:53,685
No, let's go.

311
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,045
Zero! This is vital!

312
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,332
Tamaki's issue is also vital.

313
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:01,118
I never thought C.C. would object to this.

314
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:05,165
I could easily use my Geass to make
Xing-ke and the others go along with this.

315
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,690
So, what's the problem?

316
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,334
Of course, I'm worried about Kallen, too, y'know.

317
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:13,610
But, uh I still need you to
deal with my current position here...

318
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:17,430
If the Black Knights don't
pull together, we've got problems, right?

319
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:20,927
But if things stay like this, I won't
get any respect from the new guys.

320
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:21,623
Tamaki...

321
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:25,245
You get the picture, cause you're
like my best buddy, aren't ya?!

322
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,972
Uh, Lulu. Do you have a minute?

323
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:30,409
Yeah, sure, what's up?

324
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:33,362
Well, it's about Prez's graduation event, remember?

325
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:35,971
If I talk about it in class, Rivalz'll blab to her.

326
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,694
Maybe it's better just to let her
decide for herself what she wants to do.

327
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:40,969
I guess...

328
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:42,980
Uh, Shirley! Can I ask you something?

329
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:44,422
Mm-hm.

330
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:48,181
Dammit! Every time ya try to
talk to this guy, he disappears.

331
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:53,104
The thing is, there's this couple that just has
to split up, but I can't convince anyone else.

332
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:54,565
Hm. Do they wanna split up?

333
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,257
No, it's a political issue.

334
00:16:56,282 --> 00:17:01,199
Uh! I mean, family politics, y'know their parents and all.

335
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:02,707
Then don't!

336
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:03,574
Don't what?

337
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,721
Don't break them up! Love is power!

338
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:08,119
When you love someone, that has incredible power!

339
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:09,910
You think about them all day long.

340
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:12,387
You write poetry with bad rhymes, knit mufflers!

341
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:15,133
You feel like you can fly, and that's only the beginning!

342
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:17,755
And I've always felt like... Uh!

343
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:21,196
That is... What about you Lulu?

344
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:24,353
Haven't you ever felt that way
for someone important to you?

345
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:27,345
She's right. I have.

346
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:31,080
I was trying to recreate the
whole world for Nunnally's sake.

347
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:35,432
Passion has the power to change the whole entire world!

348
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:37,713
That's the truth, isn't it, Shirley?

349
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:40,584
Thanks, Shirley. I'm really glad I talked to you.

350
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,749
Really?! Cause passion's very...

351
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:46,924
Ah! He'll never change! Why do I waste my time?!

352
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:50,275
Your Majesty! Your future belongs to you.

353
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,621
You decide your own fate.

354
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,738
Zero...

355
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:55,180
Oh, I knew you'd understand!

356
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:57,711
But we need to establish a position of power!

357
00:17:57,736 --> 00:18:00,102
The human heart is the source of all our power!

358
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:02,419
That's why the people rose up against the High Eunuchs,

359
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:04,224
and why the Black Knights fight like titans!

360
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,550
We fight with the power of our hearts!

361
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,447
Ah, yes, you got that right!

362
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:11,861
Power of the heart, is that it?

363
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:16,461
Zero, I'm starting to see what
kind of man dwells behind that mask.

364
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:19,950
The path ahead of us is arduous.

365
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:23,814
That's precisely why tomorrow belongs to us alone!

366
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,465
Hm, Lulu has really been acting strange lately.

367
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,615
One minute he's his usual self,
the next he's weirdly nice.

368
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,807
Like a completely different p...

369
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:33,713
Uh!

370
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,300
Huh? Lulu?

371
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:37,242
Hi! You need something?

372
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:40,447
I told you earlier I was going to
bring back these gardening books.

373
00:18:40,472 --> 00:18:42,533
Ah, of course, that's right.

374
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:43,642
This isn't good.

375
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,757
If she sees the panel before it closes,

376
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:48,074
she'll know about the underground control center!

377
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,905
What's up? Are you hiding something there?

378
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,397
I can't let her see it! I've got to stop her!

379
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:54,064
Shirley!

380
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,089
Lulu?

381
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,486
We will find Kallen,

382
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,928
but I need to return to Area 11 first.

383
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:04,370
And the Chinese Federation?

384
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:06,603
There are still some opposing factions there...

385
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:11,024
but they'll be no match for Xing-ke
and Tohdoh now that the people are on our side.

386
00:19:12,182 --> 00:19:16,246
Besides you want to see it, too.
The power of the human heart.

387
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:18,179
The little devil grows up, huh?

388
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:20,228
And you're still a witch.

389
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,047
In any case, this gets us back on track
so we can hit them at their deepest level.

390
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:26,933
The religious order?

391
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,862
The ones that are trying to create
warriors with the Geass power.

392
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:35,374
If we can control the order, then I can
surpass the emperor in terms of Geass.

393
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:39,911
However, the very existence of the order
has been concealed from the human world.

394
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:42,353
They change locations when a new leader is named,

395
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:44,624
so it's almost impossible to track them.

396
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:49,641
But you're certain they're based in the
Chinese Federation right now, somewhere within reach?

397
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:51,789
Yes, according to V.V.,

398
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:54,237
the one that replaced me as their leader.

399
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,367
But this is a vast country.

400
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:59,810
Even that guy Rolo doesn't
know where their base is, right?

401
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:02,311
So, how are you going to find it?

402
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:05,043
That's why I took over the Chinese Federation.

403
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:05,470
Hm?

404
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,345
The flow of goods, power supplies, communications:

405
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,097
the order must leave traces of its existence.

406
00:20:11,206 --> 00:20:14,094
You're using the power of the whole nation to find them?

407
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,866
As you said, "it's a vast country."

408
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:18,924
You're to remain here C.C.

409
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:21,733
If you find any clues on the order, contact me.

410
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:24,102
Yes, I understand.

411
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:31,704
This place, are you sure it's safe?

412
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,568
It's an O.S.I. facility...

413
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,718
Just consider that it may as well belong to you and I.

414
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,959
Ah!

415
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,874
Welcome home, brother!

416
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:48,392
It's good to see you, Rolo.

417
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:51,259
Sayoko, did anything change
while I was away on this mission?

418
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,617
Nothing of immediate concern.

419
00:20:53,812 --> 00:20:56,396
I noted all the details in the designated file.

420
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,742
So, you'll be staying here for quite a while now,

421
00:20:58,767 --> 00:20:59,950
isn't that right, Lelouch?

422
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:03,759
Yes, I have to develop some effective
countermeasures for the Knights of the Round.

423
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:05,289
The Lancelot's bad enough,

424
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:09,006
and we certainly don't need the Tristan
and the Mordred getting in our way again.

425
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:11,525
It would be a pleasure to back you up in my Vincent.

426
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:14,576
I told you not to behave like that.

427
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:21,242
Shirley, are you okay?

428
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,047
Look, Lulu about what happened with us yesterday...

429
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:28,197
Yesterday?

430
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:34,062
Morning, Lelouch Lamperouge.

431
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:36,074
It's Anya, the Knight of Six!

432
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:38,300
Hey, we've been waiting for you!

433
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:41,033
You're the Vice-President, right? This is an honor...

434
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:42,263
Don't be so formal.

435
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:43,698
Oh, right.

436
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:47,578
Anyway, we've both just enrolled here at Ashford. And...

437
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:50,944
While we're here, we insist
that our social status be ignored.

438
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:53,513
They said they wanted the
experience of being ordinary students.

439
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:55,634
So I'm teaching them how to talk normal.

440
00:21:55,659 --> 00:22:00,450
I am really lookin' forward to this... Old Man.

441
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:02,058
Uh. Right.

442
00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:40,558
Gino Weinberg. Anya Alstreim.

443
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,338
What are they thinking?! What are they up to?!

444
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:47,356
The Knights of the Round have not only
come to Ashford, they've joined the student council?!

445
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:51,958
I thought no one but the OSI and Suzaku
would look at me as some kind of bait to capture C.C...

446
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:54,361
I doubt this is part of Suzaku's operation,

447
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:57,644
but the emperor of Britannia
might be feeding them the information.

448
00:23:57,724 --> 00:24:00,656
If they realize I'm Zero, then Nunnally is in danger!

449
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:04,170
Somehow, I have to find out
what these two are really up to!
