1
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:03,442
The world continues moving on,

2
00:00:03,467 --> 00:00:06,509
thanks to miracles which Zero has performed.

3
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:08,373
The world is being reborn,

4
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:11,606
thanks to actions which Zero has taken.

5
00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:16,329
Yes... the world is moving to
the next stage, as it should.

6
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:20,067
Against conflicting emotions, Zero must carry on,

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,452
for the hands which mark time cannot be stopped.

8
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:28,144
I came alone, as I promised.

9
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:30,127
Now, what's the meaning of this, Jeremiah?

10
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:33,006
If you have information on
Princess Cornelia's whereabouts,

11
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,879
then why do you need to tell it only to me in secret?

12
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:23,885
The Black Knights are approaching the Kagoshima coast.

13
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,057
But rest assured, there's no need to worry.

14
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:27,688
Under the command of Lord Waldstein,

15
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:30,442
the Knight of One, we Britannians shall...

16
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,946
This is already Britannian territory!

17
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:36,221
Don't let a single soldier land here!

18
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:41,509
The enemy has fallen for our plan!

19
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,300
They'll be shorthanded in the south,

20
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:45,430
so dispatch our landing forces ashore!

21
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:47,042
Enemy headed for Yamaguchi!

22
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,692
Garcia team wiped out!

23
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:49,996
Damn the Black Knights!

24
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:51,394
How did they amass this strength?!

25
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,973
We thought we could hold our territorial defense line,

26
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:57,055
but after what Xing-ke did to us
in the Battle of the East China Sea...

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,705
All right, don't panic!

28
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,186
As long as we're able to defend Area 11,

29
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:03,743
all the imperial armies led by Prince Odysseus

30
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:07,590
and the other royal family members
can rush into the U.F.N. territories.

31
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:11,255
The remaining Knights of the Round
are deployed on the front line, as well.

32
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,394
Or, to put it another way,

33
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:17,344
if Japan is liberated, the other colony areas of Britannia

34
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:19,519
will spring into action one after another,

35
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:21,359
which would redefine the map of the world!

36
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:22,713
In summation...

37
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:24,572
...it's the decisive battle.

38
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,127
Has it really been eight years?

39
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:38,330
Eight years since Nunnally and I
were left on our own at the Kururugi shrine.

40
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:40,277
And there...

41
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:43,218
How do you like that, you stupid Brit?!

42
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,640
That was where we first met Suzaku.

43
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:50,115
I don't need a reason to save who
I want to save or do what I want to do!

44
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,880
You always were stubborn.

45
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:55,185
But of course... that was the reason.

46
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,815
The reason you became the first
and only real friend I ever had.

47
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:01,313
And that's why...

48
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:04,511
Why I think I'll take a chance on you, Suzaku.

49
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,559
If you can accept me, then perhaps...

50
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:20,606
This will hardly do for me! Why such meager offerings?

51
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,627
The Vampire of Britannia!

52
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:24,227
Let's hit him at the same time!

53
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:24,824
Right!

54
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:26,083
Six-Way Charge attack!

55
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:27,323
Hah!

56
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:34,363
Wha...What the...?!

57
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:38,563
Question: "What do people value most?"

58
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:41,292
Stop it! Please!

59
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:43,217
That's right! Your own life!

60
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,729
Please, no...!

61
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:50,902
Our left wing is crumbling, Master Xing-ke!

62
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:53,740
It's one Knightmare with unique breakthrough power.

63
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:56,008
Dispatch Indira's team for support.

64
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:58,161
Have left-wing teams fall back at once.

65
00:04:58,186 --> 00:04:59,978
Decoy and isolate enemy unit!

66
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:00,754
Roger!

67
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,656
As far as I'm aware, Prince Schneizel
ought to be staying in Tokyo.

68
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:06,052
There's nothing to fear.

69
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:07,047
The Knight of One,

70
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:09,456
the strongest in the empire, is in Kyushu.

71
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:12,619
If we can just ride this out and remain anchored in Tokyo,

72
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:16,008
this will only look like
minor trouble to foreign countries.

73
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,838
Yes, Your Highness!

74
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:23,993
It'll be all right, Nunna.

75
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:26,500
I expect this war will be over soon.

76
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,650
I have a knack for reading these situations.

77
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:32,381
The Savage Valkyrie Squadron repelled
the ambush troops from Nagasaki.

78
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:34,765
Now dispatching reinforcements to Shimane。

79
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,675
Send Sir Morrey to the front as back-up.

80
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,991
Sir Karim, fall back,

81
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:39,141
rendezvous with Sir Lasceaux...

82
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,523
It looks as if the enemy offensive is losing steam,

83
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:45,392
and if you join the battle, you'll surely
finish this with one blow, Lord Waldstein!

84
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,531
You think so?

85
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:47,598
Huh?

86
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:52,818
This attack is far too weak for
one of Zero's trademark strategies.

87
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:53,840
Prepare to launch.

88
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:56,148
Special equipment unit one, provide support.

89
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,854
Galahad, launch!

90
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:03,461
You came alone?

91
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:05,044
I promised I would.

92
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:07,142
You have a lot of nerve coming here.

93
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,111
According to this particular situation,

94
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,992
there are 31 routes I can take.

95
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:14,833
Especially with Britannia being so loose
with the routes relating to the royal family...

96
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,931
That's not what I meant, Lelouch.

97
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,808
Showing your face in front of me, that's what took nerves.

98
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:23,036
Not your own daring.

99
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,153
But you promised?

100
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:28,444
I have no reason to believe
any of your promises at this point.

101
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:29,652
Then explain to me.

102
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,427
Why did you come here alone as well?

103
00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:32,817
After what you did?

104
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,456
You want to know?

105
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,600
I'm fed up with lying.

106
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:41,631
I've had to lie to Nunnally. Just the way you have.

107
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:43,767
That's the worst thing.

108
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,856
Some friend you were.

109
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:48,090
You've been betraying me all along!

110
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:51,269
Not just me, either, but everyone
on the student council, too.

111
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:52,815
And even Nunnally.

112
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,183
And don't forget Euphy!

113
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:58,931
Are you sure about this, Tohdoh?

114
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:00,206
We just wait here?

115
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:02,402
We still haven't received word from Zero.

116
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:04,827
But now that the Knights of
the Round have joined the battle,

117
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:07,256
even General Commander Xing-ke is no match.

118
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,538
Have faith in Zero.

119
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:11,829
How can we, after he brought Orange
and that Rolo person into our ranks

120
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:13,354
without conferring with us first?

121
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,242
Don't you feel that he's keeping too many secrets from us?

122
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,531
Like when he took Kinoshita on that secret mission!

123
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:21,088
We need Zero's abilities now more than ever.

124
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:24,896
Haven't we already discussed this
many times with Ohgi as well as the others?

125
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,171
So... what if Japan is liberated?

126
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,237
Right. What happens then?

127
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,104
Rakshata, where are Ohgi and Diethard?

128
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,260
Don't know.

129
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:40,738
All right, just what are you trying
to achieve by threatening me, Diethard?

130
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:42,263
Threaten you? Oh, no.

131
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:44,302
I'm simply asking you to continue working

132
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:46,952
as a member of the Black Knights as you have been.

133
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,519
What do you mean by that?

134
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:52,385
Look, I'm only saying that I don't want
you to be any trouble to Zero, that's all.

135
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,868
Why? There are plenty of people who can replace me.

136
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:58,588
You're valuable for the simple reason
that you're a man of ordinary character.

137
00:07:58,613 --> 00:07:59,238
Hm?

138
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:01,561
Organizations need more than brilliant leadership

139
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:04,211
and star players in order to succeed.

140
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,878
I need to know.

141
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:18,036
Did you use your Geass power on Euphy? Be honest.

142
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:20,167
Yes.

143
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:22,857
You caused her to massacre the Japanese?

144
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:25,828
I ordered her to do it.

145
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:28,055
Why would you use your Geass like that?!

146
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,703
Answer me!

147
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,957
To motivate the Japanese people.

148
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:35,315
If the Specially Administrated Zone
of Japan had been established,

149
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,532
the Black Knights would have collapsed.

150
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:39,671
And Shirley's death?

151
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,477
Also my fault.

152
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,717
You aren't even human, you know that?

153
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:47,321
Shirley and Euphy...

154
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:50,628
Were both of them nothing
more than pawns for your ambitions?

155
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:51,736
Yes, that's right.

156
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,927
So all the sin is mine alone to shoulder.

157
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:56,319
My little sister had nothing to do with it!

158
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:57,528
Why, you coward!

159
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:59,684
How could you use Nunnally like that?!

160
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:03,269
Suzaku... I'm sorry.

161
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,632
And he always played Santa Claus for me.

162
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:09,764
Big brother would dress up like him
and even stuff pillows under his shirt.

163
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:13,061
The face of the kind older brother and the mask of Zero...

164
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,878
Which is the real Lelouch?

165
00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:17,305
Huh? He isn't here, either?

166
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:20,086
By any chance, have you seen Suzaku?

167
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:21,992
No. I doubt he'd come here.

168
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:25,478
Send Hong's unit into the right wing,

169
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,509
and get ready for the second charge!

170
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:32,842
You are the commander, are you not, sir?

171
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:35,159
Came to crush the head of the snake, have you?!

172
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:37,138
It's a basic tactic.

173
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:40,469
Hmph.

174
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:55,061
Behold, Excalibur!

175
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:59,111
The holy sword bestowed upon me by His Majesty himself!

176
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:04,723
For the first time in my life,
I'm bowing down to another person.

177
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:06,965
Shame and honor mean nothing to me.

178
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:10,694
All I want is this, and my Geass be damned!

179
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:13,305
Just please! You have to save Nunnally!

180
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,692
I beg of you...

181
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:18,973
After everything you've done,
you really think this is sufficient?!

182
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:22,398
You believe that some bowing and begging
is enough to get me to forgive you?!

183
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:24,715
No, of course I don't, but it's all I've got!

184
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,573
I have nothing else left to offer!

185
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:29,373
And you're the only person in
the world who can save my sister now!

186
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:30,788
So you believe...

187
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:33,388
...that I'll just ignore the past and forgive you?

188
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:35,780
That everyone is going to forgive you?!

189
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,369
The people you've tricked?

190
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:39,519
The people who died thanks to you?

191
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:41,357
And what about Euphy?!

192
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,635
You want to apologize?!

193
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,630
Then bring Euphy back to life! Right now!

194
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,017
I want to see you save the world with all your malice!

195
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:51,747
Right now!

196
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,185
You're Zero, the miracle worker, aren't you?!

197
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:57,146
I've performed no miracles.

198
00:10:57,171 --> 00:10:59,665
It's all been calculation and stage production.

199
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,675
The mask they call Zero is a symbol!

200
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,711
Just a device that lets me tell lies!

201
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:04,967
A device?

202
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:07,826
You don't really expect me to buy that excuse, do you?!

203
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:09,986
If you're going to tell a lie,

204
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,788
then keep it up till the very end!

205
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:13,330
I can't go back to the past!

206
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:14,605
It's not a choice!

207
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,019
You know I can't undo what's already been done!

208
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:20,442
Lelouch, you will answer me!

209
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:24,119
Why did you use your Geass
on me to make me want to live?

210
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:25,970
Why?!

211
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:35,881
The Geass you used on me that drives me to live

212
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:38,071
has corrupted my convictions.

213
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,319
Why would you put such a curse me?!

214
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:43,011
I only did it because I wanted to survive.

215
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:46,858
And why did you save me when
I was accused of Prince Clovis' murder?

216
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,752
I wanted to make the Japanese trust me, that's all.

217
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:53,202
Why did you save the student council
members from the hotel jacking?!

218
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:57,590
Because I thought it presented an ideal
opportunity for the Black Knights' debut.

219
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,128
The look in his eyes...

220
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:03,903
I know that look.

221
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:07,568
The look of torment that comes from bottling up a lie.

222
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,502
That's why I joined the Britannian army.

223
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:12,056
For redemption.

224
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:14,999
So that the tragedy wouldn't repeat itself.

225
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:20,068
You're lying, aren't you?

226
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:21,327
Lelouch...

227
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:24,455
There's only one way to redeem yourself for those lies.

228
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,441
Turn your falsehoods into the truth.

229
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:27,341
Huh?

230
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,235
You told the world a lie when you
proclaimed that you were a knight for justice.

231
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,081
Why don't you live up to that lie by
trying to become a true knight for justice?

232
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:37,047
Then you'll have to keep the lie going.

233
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,772
To the very end.

234
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:41,987
But how... how could I do that?

235
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,262
By putting an end to this war.

236
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:45,961
You are Zero.

237
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:49,460
This job... only Zero can do it.

238
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:51,127
It's within your power.

239
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:53,443
Bring peace and happiness to the world.

240
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:56,247
If you do that, I'll save Nunnally.

241
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:58,811
You will? You'll save her?

242
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:00,766
But we'll work together.

243
00:13:00,986 --> 00:13:03,191
One more time, for her sake.

244
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,577
I'm grateful.

245
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:08,762
The two of us together...

246
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,610
We can accomplish anything.

247
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,169
Wh-What the...?!

248
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:14,654
Hold it right there, Zero!

249
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,285
We've already uncovered your true identity!

250
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,462
Are you all right, Sir Kururugi?!

251
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:21,612
Please step back!

252
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:22,966
Suzaku...!

253
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:25,297
You set me up from the start!

254
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:26,529
No, wait!

255
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:29,108
You've done a great deed here, Sir Kururugi.

256
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,356
Excellent work.

257
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,827
You've managed to bring this war to an end.

258
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:33,929
I see...

259
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:36,320
You planned to sell me out again!

260
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:39,160
You betrayed me, Suzaku...

261
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:43,272
You betrayed me!

262
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:46,056
It's because Suzaku's been acting so weird lately.

263
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:49,135
I thought this might help to
take his mind off things for a while.

264
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,318
This was in the student council room?

265
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:51,896
Yeah.

266
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:55,035
I found it hidden deep in a locker,
like it was something valuable.

267
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,866
There are a few photos missing here and there, though.

268
00:13:57,891 --> 00:13:59,141
Ones of you, too.

269
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:03,127
But I suppose he couldn't leave evidence
that shows him palling around with a terrorist!

270
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:06,241
Yet everyone appears... well...

271
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,131
That's right. He...

272
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:10,849
He can look like that too, huh?

273
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:11,423
Huh?

274
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:13,643
I've never seen Suzaku smile like that.

275
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:14,960
He's so happy.

276
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,460
Good for him.

277
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,174
Hey, look.

278
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:19,045
What?

279
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:22,869
I understand that you're a
Britannian-Eleven half-breed, right?

280
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:25,460
If you chose the name Stadtfelt instead of Kouzuki,

281
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:27,593
you could very well have a good life, couldn't you?

282
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:31,014
Even become one of the Knights
of the Round if you have such ambitions.

283
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,580
Is this going somewhere?

284
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,860
What I mean, is wouldn't you like to
come back over to our side, Kallen?

285
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:39,272
Sir Bradley, please stop!

286
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,131
Oh, buck up!

287
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:43,395
You've taken so many hits,
you're only going to crash anyway.

288
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,374
So, in light of that, I, Luciano,
will use your plight to our advantage!

289
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:49,478
And settle it in one blow!

290
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:52,177
He's using one of his own ships as a weapon?!

291
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:54,481
Fall back at full speed while firing!

292
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:56,631
It's no use! We'll never make it!

293
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:00,466
Where do you think you're going?

294
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,937
Ah... You show skill!

295
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:06,768
Good! From this position...!

296
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:10,527
Nicely done. Good form.

297
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:14,302
You parried my sword thrust then
swiftly attacked in the follow-through.

298
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,058
You, the one named Xing-ke.

299
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,833
The rumors of your prowess are evidently true.

300
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:21,568
General Commander Xing-ke appears to be wounded!

301
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:22,983
Da Long Dan, withdrawing!

302
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:26,158
Chief of staff Zhou Xiang-Lin
now assuming operational command.

303
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:28,433
Zero, what's taking so long?!

304
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:33,822
I can't believe Zero's identity is that of a student!

305
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,391
Guilford!

306
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:38,277
How sad.

307
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,627
Zero, killer of royalty.

308
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:42,970
It's tragic that it would turn out to be you.

309
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:45,066
My own younger brother.

310
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:47,077
Your brother...!

311
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:51,880
However, Lelouch, I'm willing to
intercede with His Majesty on your behalf.

312
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:55,708
You realize, of course, that you can't simply
be excused for the crimes you've committed,

313
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,708
but your life may yet be spared.

314
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:00,331
So you think you can take pity on me?!

315
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,460
Y-You mean...

316
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:03,233
Yes.

317
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:06,002
This was all done under orders from Prince Schneizel.

318
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:09,945
He figured that following you
would ultimately lead us to Zero.

319
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:15,897
You see, His Highness was well aware of the fact
that you and Zero shared an unusual relationship.

320
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:23,087
Lelouch, even now, I do still
consider myself your brother.

321
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:25,070
I carry no grudge.

322
00:16:25,095 --> 00:16:26,858
Can you believe me when I say this?

323
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:28,379
And why should I?

324
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,720
You should trust your brother.

325
00:16:29,745 --> 00:16:31,537
I would love to be able to, brother.

326
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:34,708
Unfortunately, I'm done with trusting anyone or anything.

327
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,549
Because friendship only leads to betrayal.

328
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:41,774
Lord Guilford.

329
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:44,410
Identify yourself! You're not Orange!

330
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:47,643
Wait. I just have a request to ask of you.

331
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:54,339
Yes, all right, then.

332
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:56,285
What is it you want me to do for you?

333
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,435
Oh, it's quite simple, really.

334
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:01,268
Whenever you see me assume this pose...

335
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:05,033
You will recognize and
acknowledge me as Princess Cornelia.

336
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:06,512
And then...

337
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,194
P-Princess Cornelia! Is that you?!

338
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:11,068
Guilford, my knight, it is I!

339
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:12,752
You must rescue me!

340
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:15,535
Yes... Your Highness!

341
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,586
Very good, Guilford. I'm pleased that you noticed it!

342
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:20,733
Stop it, Lord Guilford! What are you doing?!

343
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:21,929
Have you gone mad?!

344
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:24,545
How dare you hold her captive like that?!

345
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:27,374
Even Lord Guilford has been affected.

346
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:30,454
Now I suppose I have no choice
but to believe in this power.

347
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:32,706
Princess, we need to withdraw for now!

348
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:33,977
Lelouch, no!

349
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:37,562
I bid you farewell, my first and last friend.

350
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:39,756
Lelouch! Come back!

351
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:42,997
Lloyd! I can't believe it!

352
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:45,158
Lord Guilford has turned into a traitor!

353
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:46,774
Is it true?!

354
00:17:46,977 --> 00:17:48,270
We're just standing by?

355
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:48,937
Mm-hmm.

356
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:51,612
Prince Schneizel ordered us to, so we're complying.

357
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,804
I had heard that Zero made an appearance, but...

358
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:56,014
We haven't been told anything yet.

359
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:59,989
But something critical was disclosed is my suspicion.

360
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:01,710
I need to know.

361
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:05,079
Did you use your Geass power on Euphy? Be honest.

362
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,199
Sir Kururugi, would you happen to know

363
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:10,674
the reason why Lord Guilford
would suddenly betray us like this?

364
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:15,029
As well as why you behaved the way
you did on Kamine Island that time?

365
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:17,570
Shouldn't we be pursuing Zero right now, sir?

366
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,729
There's some important information
we need before we can pursue him.

367
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:23,595
Information that only you know, Sir Kururugi.

368
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,710
Wired C response, confirmed.

369
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:29,131
Synchronization, achieved.

370
00:18:29,156 --> 00:18:31,397
Ragnarok backup, reinitializing.

371
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,838
Guilford, we'll proceed on course to the Tokyo settlement.

372
00:18:40,863 --> 00:18:42,219
Yes, Your Highness.

373
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:46,438
Suzaku Kururugi!

374
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,267
Who are you? A Japanese?

375
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:51,708
An honorary Britannian? A Knight of Seven?

376
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:54,233
Or are you the son of a Prime Minister?

377
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,554
The son of Genbu Kururugi?

378
00:18:56,894 --> 00:18:58,656
Lelouch's friend?

379
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,571
Euphemia's knight?

380
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,952
Unless you tell us right now what we need to know,

381
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,543
there are going to be more unnecessary
casualties and destruction before it's over.

382
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:11,961
Just how long?

383
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:15,496
How long will you allow this
sad chain of events to continue?

384
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:16,913
Don't worry.

385
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:19,658
The modifications to the
settlement's structure are complete.

386
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:22,379
Zero won't be able to collapse it the way he did before.

387
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:24,094
We have word. It's Zero.

388
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,869
So, the fool has come.

389
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:27,227
Prepare to attack!

390
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:29,492
You're cleared to shoot down the Vincent as well!

391
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:36,353
Don't assume that I was portraying the role of
a student in the settlement without reason!

392
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:40,302
Tokyo settlement, I'll bring you to a halt right now!

393
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:44,795
Fire!

394
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:48,761
What?!

395
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:50,667
My... My energy filler!

396
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,342
A Gefijun Disturber?!

397
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:55,790
And so, that situation will lead us to...Hm?

398
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:57,721
Sorry, viewers,

399
00:19:57,746 --> 00:20:00,146
but it seems that the power's gone out here in the studio.

400
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:02,327
Um, are we still broadcasting?

401
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:06,581
All tasks at hand have been cleared.

402
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:07,644
Tohdoh!

403
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:10,221
Acknowledged! Now commencing Seventh Operation!

404
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:11,633
Raise the Ikaruga!

405
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:13,116
Ikaruga surfacing!

406
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:15,600
All fleet units, surface at will!

407
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:17,471
Ohgi, right now, you realize...

408
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:18,942
Yes, I'm aware!

409
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:24,388
The main fleet will stay on course through Tokyo Bay,

410
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:26,115
break through into the Tokyo settlement,

411
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,515
and rendezvous with Zero!

412
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,458
All hands, battle stations!

413
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:31,058
All right, let's do this!

414
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:31,938
This battle...

415
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:33,463
...will be ours!

416
00:20:33,488 --> 00:20:35,536
Now I shall prove my loyalty!

417
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:38,563
For Prince Lelouch and Princess Nunnally!

418
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:41,544
What? The Black Knights are in Tokyo Bay?!

419
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:45,969
Lord Waldstein, I request that you
dispatch me and my Savage Valkyrie Squadron!

420
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,036
You mean to the Tokyo settlement?

421
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:50,817
Do you really want to burnish your record that badly?

422
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:54,061
No. I merely take uncommon pleasure in destroying them.

423
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,217
Rolo, how are things on your end?

424
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:59,184
Fine. We're beginning the operation right now.

425
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:01,292
We'll make our way to Nunnally first thing.

426
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,698
Good. I'm counting on you, Rolo.

427
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:06,244
That's right.

428
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:08,088
I was grossly mistaken.

429
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:10,752
I was wrong to think that I could depend on sympathy.

430
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:13,036
Cold and callous, that's the prescription.

431
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:15,748
Unless I keep myself perfectly in this frame of mind,

432
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:18,019
I won't be able to take Nunnally back!

433
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:19,428
Lelouch...

434
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:23,667
I thought something strange had been
going on ever since our brother Clovis was killed.

435
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:25,615
But now I understand.

436
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:27,735
I understand everything.

437
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:28,827
But now...

438
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:31,623
I'm the one controlling the game.

439
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,819
That's right, Suzaku.

440
00:21:34,844 --> 00:21:37,488
If you had only informed Prince
Schneizel from the very start,

441
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,222
we could have avoided this battle.

442
00:21:39,252 --> 00:21:41,400
Being that you're one of the Knights of the Round,

443
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,091
you won't be subjected to disciplinary action.

444
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:47,719
However, you'll have to answer
to the sins of your own heart.

445
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:49,288
What should I do?

446
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:50,936
Be realistic.

447
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:54,083
The world won't become a kinder place only for you.

448
00:21:56,527 --> 00:21:58,193
Do I have to pilot it?

449
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:00,611
The Lancelot armed with the F.L.E.I.J.A. device?

450
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:03,386
Will I have to use it... on Lelouch?

451
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,092
How dare you have done this to me!

452
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:43,023
You who sneered at me, trampled me, looked down on me!

453
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:44,760
I swear to you, I'll win!

454
00:23:44,785 --> 00:23:47,410
I have to win against Schneizel and Suzaku!

455
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,581
I realize now that I'm the one you're after.

456
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:50,788
I'm the target.

457
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:52,730
Very well! Have at me, then!

458
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:53,990
Take your best shot!

459
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,392
I'll destroy you! I'll show you despair!

460
00:23:57,443 --> 00:23:59,809
And to top it off, I'll steal Nunnally back!

461
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,425
I'll rescue Kallen!

462
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:04,725
In the end, I'll have the last laugh!
