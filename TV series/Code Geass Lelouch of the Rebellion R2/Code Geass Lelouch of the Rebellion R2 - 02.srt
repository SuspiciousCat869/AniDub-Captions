1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:04,067
Imperial Calendar, 2018.

2
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:06,819
As the Holy Britannian Empire continues its drive

3
00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:09,928
to dominate the world, a lone rebel is resurrected.

4
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:11,373
His name is Zero.

5
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:15,251
A mysterious girl named C.C.
has given him the power of Geass,

6
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:18,189
the absolute power to compel anyone to obey him.

7
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:22,441
Now, Zero is again challenging
the Britannian conquerors of Japan,

8
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:26,358
the once proud nation now referred to only as Area 11.

9
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:28,954
As his actions spread like a ripple through the world,

10
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:31,322
how will they affect the people of this age?

11
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:33,666
For the moment, no one knows.

12
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:11,306
What about the O.S.I. forces that broke in first?

13
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,460
No contact with them yet.

14
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:14,583
The chaff density should be dropping now.

15
00:02:14,608 --> 00:02:16,092
Recon section four!

16
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:18,910
The terrorists remain embattled inside of Babel Tower.

17
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:20,823
They're believed to be members of the Black Knights

18
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:23,417
We've confirmed the presence of enemy Knightmare Frames.

19
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:27,287
All right, Special Weapons
Batallion Seven will break in from below.

20
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:28,927
Yes, my lord!

21
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,777
This is hopeless! Let's run for it!

22
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,511
Just hold out a little bit longer.

23
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:36,862
Wait until Zero can get the layout of the building!

24
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:39,098
We'll back you up, but you've gotta stand firm!

25
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:41,944
Lelouch...

26
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,617
It's true, I am Zero.

27
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,019
Zero!

28
00:02:58,189 --> 00:02:59,485
It's Lelouch!

29
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,892
It's the man who's used the Japanese people!

30
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:03,085
Who's used you!

31
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,592
You wanna defend a man like that?! You?!

32
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:15,254
Hm.

33
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:18,239
Zero, this is the end of you.

34
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:24,839
I was defeated by the old me. By Suzaku.

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,408
And by my biggest enemy.

36
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:32,069
He dragged me before the Britannian Emperor!

37
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:42,167
The former 17th heir to the
imperial throne, Lelouch vi Britannia.

38
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:45,609
It's been a long time, hasn't it, my errant son?

39
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,801
How dare you!

40
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:49,948
You won't use your Geass!

41
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:54,231
Your Majesty, I have a request.

42
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:58,229
Please, sire, allow me to join the Knights of the Round,

43
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:00,794
the 12 strongest knights of the Britannian empire!

44
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:04,915
As a reward for capturing Zero, is that it?

45
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,244
You!

46
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,160
I told you before, Lelouch,

47
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:11,310
that I was going to change this world from the inside.

48
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,614
Even if it means selling out your friends?!

49
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,646
That's right.

50
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,833
Tch!

51
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:17,217
Very well.

52
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:20,056
I like the answer you just gave him.

53
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:24,094
Now then, as a Knight of the Round, I order you:

54
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,677
Cover up Zero's left eye.

55
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:28,723
Yes, Your Majesty.

56
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:34,608
My unworthy son, who raised the banner
of rebellion although he was a prince.

57
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:38,689
Still, there's another way we can make use of him.

58
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:39,619
What?!

59
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:41,508
I will rewrite your memory:

60
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,867
about being Zero, about the death of your mother,

61
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:47,850
about the very existence of Nunnally...

62
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,580
No! Geass?!

63
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:51,271
You'll remember none of it.

64
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:53,523
You'll just be insignificant.

65
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:54,685
No, stop!

66
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,094
You're stealing what's most precious to me again!

67
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,640
First my mother, and now you're taking Nunnally?!

68
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,790
Charles zi Britannia engraves into you...

69
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:04,221
Stop it!

70
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:07,327
False memories of a false life.

71
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:18,015
C.C...

72
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:19,314
Don't even think it.

73
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,439
I'm not the one who gave him his Geass.

74
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:22,581
Hm.

75
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,429
Where is Nunnally now?

76
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,177
We tried to find your sister,

77
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,362
but with the Black Knights all but destroyed,

78
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:29,069
that's why...

79
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:30,367
What about Sayoko?

80
00:05:30,392 --> 00:05:33,662
She and Diethard escaped to the Chinese Federation.

81
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:37,223
She still doesn't know Zero's true identity.

82
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,951
And she didn't know Nunnally's
real importance, so she can't be blamed.

83
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:42,090
Hmph.

84
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,162
I'll find the one who gave the
emperor his Geass and then get Nunnally.

85
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:51,965
I had a younger sister,

86
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,023
but not a younger brother!

87
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,844
So, who is he?

88
00:05:57,647 --> 00:06:00,254
Thank goodness! You're Britannian soldiers, right?

89
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,008
I'm looking for my big brother.

90
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:07,198
This has the layout of the building
in detail, but the I.D. code I need isn't here.

91
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:09,639
So we can't commandeer this Knightmare, can we?

92
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:11,256
What are you doing there?

93
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,494
That's a student uniform, isn't it?

94
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:17,282
Oh, you're a soldier! Thank goodness!

95
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:19,358
We need to help this man at once!

96
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,631
Office of Secret Intelligence?

97
00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:26,479
What are the emperor's personal agents doing here?

98
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:28,860
Good. These reports are accurate.

99
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:31,093
Calares's forces don't know about me.

100
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:33,758
So I can use the data in this journal.

101
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:35,887
There's only one survivor?

102
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:38,004
Yes. Just you.

103
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,252
What?

104
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:40,727
That's right.

105
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:44,639
Now give me your Knightmare.

106
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:55,748
I understand.

107
00:06:55,773 --> 00:07:00,193
The I.D. code is QR5-YK1D6.

108
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:01,935
Thank you.

109
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,893
Even though you need direct eye contact,

110
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:07,048
are those theatrics necessary?

111
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:10,598
I don't need comments from an immortal witch.

112
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:15,268
The terrorists are staging a counterattack?

113
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:19,477
Yes. It seems that they've managed
to capture some of our Knightmares.

114
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:20,843
That's disgraceful!

115
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:22,826
Still, their numbers are small.

116
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:24,764
If I could possibly join the battle...

117
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:28,641
No. You're still a guest here, and under our protection.

118
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:32,029
As viceroy, it's my place to go out there.

119
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:33,060
But...

120
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:35,148
Hm...

121
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:38,029
I don't like the spices in Chinese food.

122
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:40,122
However, I might enjoy it.

123
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:41,154
Huh?

124
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:43,068
A manhunt.

125
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:53,035
Let me see you burst, Britannian!

126
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,128
Well done, Q1! Now, head up to level 21.

127
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,881
P4, block the stairway.

128
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,108
R5, left 30 degrees.

129
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:18,897
N1, fire a barrage 50 meters ahead,
angled toward the ceiling.

130
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,476
Contact lost with Lord Emilio!

131
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:28,751
Change I.F.F. codes!

132
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,474
We have! Five times already!

133
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:31,868
Ortiz unit, wiped out!

134
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:34,691
Outrageous! Who's directing these terrorists?!

135
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,383
What are you doing?

136
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:37,820
Viceroy!

137
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:43,006
So, Zero really is just a student, huh?

138
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,058
Well, he's something special!

139
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,410
Zero supplied more stolen Sutherlands for us to use.

140
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:50,810
Get on them, fast!

141
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,605
With Zero here, we can win!

142
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,587
He'll make a miracle for us! He will!

143
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,387
Damned terrorists!

144
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:04,285
Shouldn't Viceroy Calares be making his appearance, soon?

145
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,435
It's going well.

146
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,218
Hm?

147
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:09,035
Kallen I sent you to level 21.

148
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:11,574
I wanted to be here by your side.

149
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,955
We're finally alone, just you and me.

150
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:23,876
It would seem that somebody is
nibbling at the bait we left in Area 11.

151
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,484
Is it C.C., Majesty?

152
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,505
We do not know that.

153
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:30,755
Kururugi, even among Knights of the Round,

154
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,141
you're the first one ever allowed to enter this place.

155
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,799
Even Schneizel and the others aren't aware of it.

156
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:40,616
I'm honored, Your Majesty. But, why me?

157
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:45,537
Because you are the only one of
the Knights of the Round who knows...

158
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:49,793
About Zero's identity. And Geass.

159
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:54,512
This place... Is it a shrine?

160
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:56,121
No, it's not.

161
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:57,733
This is...

162
00:09:57,758 --> 00:10:01,008
This is a weapon for destroying God.

163
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,281
A weapon?!

164
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:05,726
It is called the Sword of Akasha.

165
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:13,262
You, who abandoned Zero at Kamine Island,

166
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,933
what do you wanna tell me?

167
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,791
Lelouch, you were deceiving me
right from the very beginning.

168
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:20,922
About Zero being your classmate?

169
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:24,672
Or about my Geass power? Which one has offended you?

170
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,555
Both of them.

171
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:28,535
Tell me this!

172
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,185
Did you use your Geass on me like you did the others?

173
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,335
Did you twist my mind and my heart

174
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,101
and make me follow you?

175
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:36,798
Lelouch!

176
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:39,245
Your mind and your heart are yours alone.

177
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,714
As was your loyalty and admiration for Zero.

178
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:42,680
Don't move!

179
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,668
Kallen, you should be proud of what you did.

180
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:48,951
You decided. You made the choice.

181
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,708
You chose...

182
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,501
...Zero.

183
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:55,808
You don't believe me?

184
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:01,814
I wanted to believe so much that I'd become a slave...

185
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:03,447
I see.

186
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:06,339
But the one that I believe in is Zero!

187
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,510
Just him! It's not you, Lelouch!

188
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,933
Well, fine with me. By the way...

189
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,656
Are you ever going to change out of those clothes?

190
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:18,155
Don't look at me, you pervert!

191
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,178
Oh? Is that the way you talk to Zero now?

192
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:22,370
I'm saying it to you, Lelouch!

193
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:23,910
Very well then.

194
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:25,355
Go ahead.

195
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:27,439
Britannian reinforcements are here.

196
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:29,985
There's zillions of 'em! What do we do?

197
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,487
We can't beat this many! There's no chance.

198
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:36,226
What's happening over there?

199
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:41,430
Special Weapons Batallion Four has begun to drop.

200
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:43,538
Show the Chinese Federation!

201
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:45,614
Show them our emperor's might!

202
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,028
The overwhelming power of our Holy Britannian Empire!

203
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,761
Yes, my lord!

204
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:02,630
They're coming in from above, too!

205
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,868
That's right.

206
00:12:05,372 --> 00:12:08,083
Viceroy Calares must have arrived.

207
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:11,055
Escape would be difficult. That's why...

208
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,718
...I'm going to win.

209
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:23,228
Assault team two now has control up to floor J!

210
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,591
That leaves only one escape route
the Black Knights can use.

211
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:30,220
And our main fighting force
is right there waiting for them.

212
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,767
Yes, sir. We just need to drive them out.

213
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,722
Set up a broadcast link quickly.

214
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:37,720
We'll make the extermination
of these terrorists a media event.

215
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:40,745
The Britannians must feel certain of their victory.

216
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,914
That clears all the tasks at hand.

217
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:44,814
All that's left is your level, right?

218
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:46,458
We'll be finished in ten minutes.

219
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:47,647
Understood.

220
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:50,078
We'll make a stand here to buy you time.

221
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:51,739
What about Diethard's setup?

222
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,570
The system's still running.

223
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,962
Everything is going according to plan.

224
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:57,028
This is B2!

225
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,258
A single enemy Knightmare is... Agh!

226
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:00,141
What's wrong?

227
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,235
But, that's... It was just there!

228
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,414
B2? What's going on?

229
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:08,716
An enemy deactivating his I.F.F.? Operating on his own?

230
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:13,520
Zero, this is P6! The enemy is...! It's... Agh!

231
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:14,383
P6!

232
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:17,347
This is R5! They destroyed R1!

233
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:18,960
This isn't good.

234
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:20,724
And he's headed right for me!

235
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,897
Zero! At the very least, you have to get outta here!

236
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:26,826
We can move in and act as decoys,

237
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,351
sacrificial pawns for the plan. So, please...

238
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,318
That's wrong.

239
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,163
Hm?

240
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:32,801
You're mistaken, Urabe.

241
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:34,825
If you consider yourselves disposable,

242
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,878
you'll never beat the Britannians.

243
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,530
Captain Urabe!

244
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:42,014
Can you get over there?

245
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,355
Yeah. The cargo loading dock, right?

246
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:45,320
Yes.

247
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:47,148
It's a shortcut to this level.

248
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:48,439
Confirmed.

249
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:01,545
Yes, I see it.

250
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:05,172
This looks like a mass-production
prototype based on the Lancelot.

251
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:06,297
I see.

252
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:08,514
Still, this is not the time to try capturing it.

253
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:09,366
Destroy it.

254
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,558
Understood.

255
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:11,624
Huh?

256
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:12,589
It vanished?!

257
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:13,480
Huh?

258
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:14,891
How'd it get over here?!

259
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,945
Hold on! Are you saying the Knightmare "disappeared?!"

260
00:14:41,056 --> 00:14:42,006
C.C.!

261
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:44,258
Aren't you finished preparing that level yet?

262
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:46,079
Why are you panicking?

263
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:48,633
You have Kallen and Urabe with you.

264
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,225
That's it! The aberration!

265
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:56,507
You're out of your league.

266
00:14:56,532 --> 00:15:00,479
You aren't Suzaku, and your
maneuvers are no match for real strategy.

267
00:15:02,823 --> 00:15:05,485
We've got the advantage in close-range combat!

268
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:11,068
Too slow!

269
00:15:13,223 --> 00:15:15,016
It vanished! Just like that!

270
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,458
Fast as a god!

271
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:19,962
That can't be...

272
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:23,685
It's not physically possible! It must be something else!

273
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:27,873
It's closing in!

274
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:31,512
Urabe!

275
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:32,633
Oh, no!

276
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,877
Zero, I don't care if you're really
a student, or what your background is.

277
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,568
And I know you meant it
when you said we're not expendable.

278
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:41,658
I know that every fighter we've got counts.

279
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:42,587
Kozuki!

280
00:15:42,612 --> 00:15:43,987
Ye-Yes?

281
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:45,108
Protect Zero.

282
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:48,383
He's our last hope, and hope is what our people need.

283
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,648
Forgive me, Rakshata.

284
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,156
Zero! Save Japan!

285
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:57,762
Help our people to lift their heads again and fight!

286
00:15:58,472 --> 00:16:00,114
"The Four Holy Swords"...

287
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:01,973
...have proven our worth.

288
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:05,181
Urabe...

289
00:16:10,181 --> 00:16:13,445
Damn. He used that teleportation again.

290
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,539
No, wait!

291
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,379
I have to make my move now.

292
00:16:16,404 --> 00:16:18,391
This one's for Zero.

293
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,012
I have more bad news for you. We're all finished here.

294
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:23,308
Then it's done.

295
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,858
Urabe, your sacrifice wasn't in vain.

296
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:27,508
Hope begins now!

297
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:37,504
Damned terrorists! A suicide attack!

298
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:39,189
Uncivilized monkeys!

299
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:41,693
All units, lost! Contact lost with all units!

300
00:16:41,718 --> 00:16:43,366
Wh-What the...?! ...

301
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:48,425
Ascending from intercept to 1,500 and circling!

302
00:16:57,423 --> 00:16:58,381
That's it!

303
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:01,862
The tower will smash the enemies
above us and crush them as it falls!

304
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,270
Not just that.

305
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:09,362
No! It can't be!

306
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:11,874
Your mistake was sealing off your escape route.

307
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:15,776
And signaling your location
like that made you so easy to target.

308
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:24,360
Goodbye, Viceroy Calares.

309
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:27,256
The viceroy has been killed?!

310
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:29,821
Where's Lord Cornwell? He was with the viceroy.

311
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:31,478
Then, who's next in the chain of command?

312
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:33,270
The Minister of Internal Affairs.

313
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:35,087
A civil servant in charge now?!

314
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:36,985
This is no time to panic!

315
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,135
Hm?

316
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,412
I am taking command!

317
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:42,689
This is not a grab for political power!

318
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:44,172
It's a temporary measure!

319
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,728
I swear it in the name of my princess!

320
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,806
I ask for your cooperation!

321
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:50,272
The Princess?

322
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:52,395
Does he mean Princess Cornelia?

323
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,740
In that case...

324
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:54,758
Right.

325
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:56,747
Yes, my lord!

326
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:58,966
Thank you. I am grateful to you.

327
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:03,033
Now then, I'll go to the scene to
direct emergency rescue operations.

328
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:06,270
Alfred, you contact the police. Bart, you remain here.

329
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,495
Hm?

330
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,364
But that's...!

331
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,818
What's wrong?

332
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:14,887
I am Zero!

333
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:16,097
What the hell?!

334
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:18,615
Whoa, whoa! What the...?!

335
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,260
Isn't that Zero?

336
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:20,289
No...

337
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:21,518
I thought he was dead!

338
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:22,372
How could this happen?

339
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:24,314
It can't be the real Zero, can it?

340
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:27,739
People of Japan, I have returned!

341
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:29,116
Kill the video!

342
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,772
I can't! It won't take my access code!

343
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:34,570
That's it! The Omega Line that I set up!

344
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:36,835
And the only one who knows about it...

345
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:39,006
...is Zero!

346
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:41,764
Yes! I knew you were still alive!

347
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:43,664
Hear me, Britannia!

348
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:47,814
All you who have power, heed my words carefully.

349
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:50,201
I am burdened by sorrow.

350
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:52,445
War and discrimination.

351
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:55,524
Malicious deeds carried out by the strong.

352
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:59,245
The same abhorrent interplay of tragedy and comedy.

353
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,339
The world has not changed! The people still suffer.

354
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:07,489
That is why the resurrection of Zero was necessary!

355
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,172
So long as the strong oppress the weak,

356
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:12,851
my rebellion will continue to grow!

357
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:15,320
It begins today with the divine punishment

358
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:19,137
I have wrought upon the inept and foolish Viceroy Calares!

359
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,449
Man, oh man.

360
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:25,597
The Elevens' rebel leader sure popped
back up with a vengeance. Right, Suzaku?

361
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:30,714
Got it! The signal's coming from
the Chinese Federation consulate!

362
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:31,976
Chinese Federation?

363
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:33,424
Has he defected?

364
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,735
They broke through our encirclement.

365
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:37,777
Of course!

366
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:40,116
They've stayed inside the fallen building!

367
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:42,724
They've made Babel Tower itself their pathway!

368
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,181
But, what about the Chinese Federation?

369
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:47,362
Did they plan this out with them beforehand?

370
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,864
Is that possible?!

371
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,835
C'mon, Zero's dead, isn't he?

372
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,777
Yes.

373
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:54,399
So, this guy's a fake.

374
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:57,491
And whoever he is, if we just
go over there and storm the consulate...

375
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:01,214
Then we'd be breaking our treaty
with them, risking an international incident.

376
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:04,464
He's saying that he's Zero, and Zero killed our royals.

377
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:07,364
That gives this equal status with the E.U. war.

378
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:10,645
It's a slippery slope, either way.

379
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:14,135
Killing the viceroy and securing our escape route.

380
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,822
He was able to do both at the same time!

381
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:20,253
Such cunning and audacity is impressive.

382
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:22,755
It's Zero! The real one!

383
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:27,210
I shall fight against all those who abuse their power!

384
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:33,360
Therefore, once again, here and now,

385
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:37,472
I declare the establishment of the United States of Japan!

386
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,889
Are you certain about this?

387
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:42,505
We still haven't received direct orders from the Empress.

388
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,345
Are you dissatisfied with my decision?

389
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,297
No. Never mind.

390
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,133
Zero, you've actually founded the United States of...

391
00:20:53,158 --> 00:20:54,410
...Japan.

392
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:56,560
Terrorists forming a nation?

393
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:58,440
Starting from this moment,

394
00:20:58,472 --> 00:21:01,831
this room shall be the first dominion of the U.S.J.!

395
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:06,063
A nation consisting of just one room!

396
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:08,254
That man's as amusing as ever.

397
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:11,281
Race, ideology, and religion will not matter!

398
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:13,814
Being a citizen will have but one requirement!

399
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,993
To do that which is just!

400
00:21:18,398 --> 00:21:22,512
I trust you understand the
consequences if you force your way in.

401
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:24,368
All right.

402
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:27,418
We'll settle this in diplomatic chambers later.

403
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:34,387
Zero... How useful will he prove to us in the end?

404
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:41,047
If you're Britannian, you have
already been asked to leave.

405
00:21:41,114 --> 00:21:43,864
Or, are you one of Zero's followers?

406
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:49,185
I'm not sure. Which am I?

407
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:52,020
I'm not terribly fond of riddles.

408
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:55,481
Yes, I'm exactly the same way, myself.

409
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,573
What I wanna know is the truth.

410
00:21:57,864 --> 00:22:02,656
That's why I came here to kill Zero.

411
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:41,604
I cannot move a world by waiting.

412
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:45,148
To find Nunnally and get her back,
I'm going to need real power.

413
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:47,772
Power stronger than the emperor and Suzaku.

414
00:23:47,831 --> 00:23:51,356
I must seize that power, and I'll use my Geass to do it!

415
00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:54,704
With the United States of Japan as my starting point,

416
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:57,758
I'll build a new world that's even greater than Britannia.

417
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:01,783
But before I can do it, I'll need to take care of him

418
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:05,086
My phony little brother, Rolo.
