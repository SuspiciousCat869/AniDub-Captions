1
00:00:01,473 --> 00:00:04,691
There was a giant explosion in the Tokyo Settlement.

2
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:07,563
It appears that a F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead caused it.

3
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:11,630
Your Majesty, should we remain here at Kamine Island?

4
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:15,405
Enough! Let Schneizel handle mundane affairs.

5
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:19,648
At least ten million inhabitants are
believed dead from the initial impact of the blast.

6
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:23,098
Secondary damages might have
caused 25 million more casualties.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:27,135
All rescue facilities were wiped out,
so we cannot care for any of the wounded.

8
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:29,924
The Tokyo settlement is now no more.

9
00:00:31,694 --> 00:00:34,894
No. How could this have happened?

10
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,100
They're all... They're all...!

11
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:44,285
I did it?! I did this?

12
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,014
The school was outside the blast radius. But...

13
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:50,101
This has gone beyond war.

14
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:52,420
If they use this weapon again,

15
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:55,164
the Black Knights will be completely wiped out!

16
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,458
Tohdoh, it's me.

17
00:00:57,813 --> 00:00:59,192
Zero, we can't remain...

18
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:01,724
Have all forces land in the Tokyo settlement.

19
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:02,988
Search for Nunnally.

20
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:05,096
Wait a minute! We've lost Asahina!

21
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:06,954
And we have massive casualties!

22
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,384
You think I care about that?!

23
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:08,832
Uh?!

24
00:01:08,857 --> 00:01:11,407
Find Nunnally now! That's an order!

25
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:14,314
All forces search for Nunnally!

26
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,282
What's happened to Zero?!

27
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:52,430
The fugitives on the portside runway, right?

28
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:55,000
Wait! We need to reorganize our forces first!

29
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:57,173
Understood! I'll be back there in a minute!

30
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:57,844
Ohgi!

31
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:58,744
Uh?

32
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:02,748
Chigusa.

33
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:06,910
That's far enough! Miss fugitive.

34
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,620
Cornelia?! I thought it was Villetta who'd escaped.

35
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:17,260
So it's you. Newsman and turncoat.

36
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:19,076
Is Zero behind this?

37
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:21,726
Secretly holding the princess as a captive?

38
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:24,040
He should have shown a little more trust in me.

39
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:26,586
Aim for her legs! I want her taken alive, men!

40
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:27,605
Yes, sir!

41
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:34,093
Attention! We are carrying a Britannian
special envoy on an urgent diplomatic mission!

42
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:36,325
We have no hostile intentions!

43
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:38,446
Diplomatic mission?

44
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:42,735
Minase, was that craft cleared
to land through official channels?

45
00:03:47,654 --> 00:03:48,520
Schneizel!

46
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:49,623
Impossible!

47
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:53,253
Why would he step right into
the midst of his mortal enemies?

48
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:56,094
Tohdoh! I told you to find Nunnally!

49
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,230
Now deploy the search teams!

50
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:02,620
Kallen, do you hear me? Rolo! Jeremiah!

51
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:06,446
Nunnally has to be alive! Find her! Find Nunnally!

52
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,371
Attention, all forces!

53
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:11,186
Fall back to Makuhari and reform our battle line!

54
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,242
All forces, fall back now!

55
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:16,225
Tohdoh! I told you to search for Nunnally!

56
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:20,395
As long as my brother is safe...

57
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,298
..then we will have another chance.

58
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:24,573
Why have they called a temporary cease fire?

59
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,343
What are the Britannians up to?!

60
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:28,493
Why did Bismarck withdraw?!

61
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:29,938
We're trying to find that out,

62
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:32,458
but they don't seem to be preparing a new attack.

63
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,897
And there's a cease fire in Tokyo, as well.

64
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,862
Did Zero order it?

65
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:39,373
Uh? Master, you're back! Uh!

66
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,805
Hang in there, big brother.

67
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:43,599
Nunnally...

68
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,684
Big brother, I'm here for you...

69
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,657
We've been doing fine with just the two of us, haven't we?

70
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,579
Jeremiah? Please give my brother some time right now.

71
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:57,369
You can talk to him later.

72
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:04,139
Right. It may not mean much of anything. Mm.

73
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:06,299
After all, I'm here with him.

74
00:05:07,365 --> 00:05:10,265
What are you doing with this?! It's Nunnally's!

75
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,081
I wanted to give this locket to Nunnally, not to you!

76
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:14,740
To Nunnally!

77
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:17,236
You think you could ever replace Nunnally in my heart?!

78
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:18,719
You're an imposter!

79
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:19,804
Uh!

80
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:26,774
Haven't you figured it out yet? I hate you.

81
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:29,167
I loathe you. I despise you!

82
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,778
I've been trying to kill you,
but I just keep missing the chance!

83
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:34,291
Big brother...?

84
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:35,756
Get out of here!

85
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:37,830
I never want to see your face again!

86
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,459
I said get out!

87
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,564
I didn't understand what this
kind of destruction really means.

88
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:48,070
It was all just numbers. But now...

89
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:50,220
You need to make a choice, Nina.

90
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:53,306
Do you abandon science to preserve your heart,

91
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:57,165
or abandon your heart and sacrifice yourself to science?

92
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,440
How can I do either?

93
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:02,167
Did you make such a choice, professor Lloyd?

94
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:04,754
I didn't have to, I'm a sociopath.

95
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,521
I was born with an abandoned heart.

96
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:10,991
But I'm the one who built the F.L.E.I.J.A warhead.

97
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:15,492
All those people's lives are gone. I killed them!

98
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:17,582
All of them!

99
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,604
It's no use. There's no answer.

100
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,212
We don't have any choice, then.

101
00:06:26,237 --> 00:06:28,432
We'll have to meet Prince Schneizel without Zero.

102
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,250
But, Zero's our leader, after all.

103
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:32,717
Should we be making decisions without him?

104
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:38,891
It was a massacre! They killed everyone, including
women and children! Kinoshita said it was Zero's orders!

105
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:39,920
Diethard!

106
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:41,786
Why didn't you take Schneizel captive?

107
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,539
We could've avenged Asahina.

108
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:45,730
He only has one Knightmare guarding him.

109
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:49,055
Because they came equipped
with a massive F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

110
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,101
F.L.E.I.J.A.?

111
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:54,173
Like the one that just destroyed
the Tokyo settlement. It's a new weapon.

112
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:57,823
If they unleash it, it will
kill us and Zero in a heartbeat.

113
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:00,776
We don't know what Schneizel's objective here is.

114
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,586
So our best option is to meet with him and find out.

115
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:04,945
I think, I'll pass.

116
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,595
I want to system-check my Guren now that it's back.

117
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,760
Then the negotiators will be myself,

118
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:11,511
Chiba, Diethard, as well as...

119
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:14,328
Forget it. I can't find Ohgi anywhere.

120
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:17,220
Dammit! Where'd that fool go, huh?

121
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:19,024
Kallen!

122
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:20,662
Thank goodness, you're back in one piece!

123
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:22,951
Sorry to worry you, I'm okay.

124
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:24,732
Uh, where's Zero?

125
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:26,307
I heard he's in his quarters.

126
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:28,556
There's a rumor that he was wounded.

127
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:37,048
Lady Nunnally, I pray you're still alive. Fervently.

128
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,959
That's all,

129
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:43,491
everything I saw and heard at the Order.

130
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,361
Thank you, Cornelia. With this information, I can...

131
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:47,930
Sorry to keep you waiting.

132
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:52,557
Yeah, Sorry. We've had our hands full with all
the ten million dead people you guys slaughtered.

133
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:54,572
Tamaki, we discussed this already.

134
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:55,805
You can't be here for this.

135
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,203
Why not? I'm the Black Knight's
Interior Custodian Minister

136
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,356
so I can sit in for my bud, Ohgi, and fill him in later!

137
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,499
You're the only one who has that impression.

138
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:05,306
No...

139
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:07,457
Please. I'd like for him to join us, as well.

140
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:08,415
Huh?

141
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:10,181
Shin'ichiro Tamaki.

142
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:11,873
As Zero's oldest comrade,

143
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:14,290
you are the brave veteran of many historic battles.

144
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:16,605
Ha! You all know about me, huh!

145
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,278
T-Tamaki! Please.

146
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:21,055
You rescued me a long time ago, didn't you?

147
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,622
Very courageous.

148
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:26,491
I came here to thank you for that honorable act. Indeed...

149
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:30,454
You and I share a rather odd connection, don't you think?

150
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,771
I suppose it's fate that we became enemies in the end.

151
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:38,360
I'll take my leave now, sir.
I must search for Lady Nunnally.

152
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:46,005
Nunnally's dead. She's gone.

153
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,954
Survivors are directed to register in order.

154
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:53,522
Along with your I.D. number, give your
name, age, address, and blood type.

155
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:55,454
If you require medical attention,

156
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:58,455
please go to the medical
information desk and take a number.

157
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,816
To minimize disorder, please...

158
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:04,414
Rivalz!

159
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:07,110
Oh, Prez, just tell me you're alive.

160
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:09,475
Yes. I am. I'm alive!

161
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,799
Thank goodness!

162
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:12,699
You can say that again!

163
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:18,041
Now that I think of it, I never
finished my match with Zero, did I?

164
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,816
Zero won't be attending.

165
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:22,508
Not until we have the details of the proposal.

166
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,116
Of course. I didn't expect him to show up.

167
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:26,304
Hm?

168
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,512
He's not the type who consults with others.

169
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:32,353
No, he keeps things to himself
and holds people at a distance.

170
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:33,544
That's strange,

171
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:35,827
you talk about him as if you know him intimately.

172
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:37,348
More than any of you do.

173
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,530
Zero is our younger brother. Cornelia's and my own.

174
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:42,506
Huh?

175
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:43,698
What are you saying?!

176
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:49,474
He is the former 11th royal prince of
the Holy Britannian Empire: Lelouch vi Britannia.

177
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:52,496
The man whom I both loved and feared more than any other.

178
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:53,274
Impossible!

179
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:56,081
You're telling us that Zero's a Britannian prince?!

180
00:09:56,106 --> 00:10:00,034
Diethard, please in all this time,
you never figured that out?

181
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,045
Even with all the information you
were getting from Jeremiah and Villetta?

182
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,561
You're wasting your time.

183
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:10,292
You can't cause chaos here by
spreading these irrelevant stories.

184
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:12,334
It's not Zero's lineage that matters,

185
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:15,637
but rather his efforts and the
miracles that he's performed for us.

186
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:19,274
But, what if all those miracles
he performed were actually tricks?

187
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:20,202
Tricks?

188
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:23,832
Zero possesses a special power. It is known as Geass.

189
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:24,604
Huh?

190
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,460
It's the absolute power to compel anyone to obey him.

191
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:30,368
You can think of it as extreme hypnosis.

192
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:32,707
You're saying his miracles come from that power?

193
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,237
Are you tryin' to dis my man Zero?

194
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:38,596
He's got brains and guts and he kicks Britannian butt!

195
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:40,673
A prince with Geass power!

196
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:43,698
Where's the proof of all this bull, huh?

197
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,549
I have the proof!

198
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:46,740
Ohgi.

199
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,013
And Villetta?

200
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:50,205
What he's saying is all true.

201
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:53,511
Zero is a former Britannian prince named Lelouch.

202
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:56,307
He controls people with his Geass power.

203
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,461
A con man!

204
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:15,499
Zero's been tricking us all along!

205
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:18,592
Using us like pawns, from the start!

206
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:20,526
You don't mean this, Ohgi.

207
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,584
But, if that's really true, then...

208
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:24,350
Then it doesn't matter!

209
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,010
It doesn't erase a single thing that he's done for us.

210
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:29,209
And if he really does have this Geass power,

211
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:31,370
then doesn't that just help us?

212
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:34,436
It's another weapon to use in our fight against Britannia.

213
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:38,191
Yes, that would make perfect sense
if he only used it against our enemies!

214
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:38,891
What?

215
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,525
Are you saying he used it on us?

216
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,853
Of course.

217
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:45,249
He used geass to control his own sister, Euphemia.

218
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:47,904
He made her slaughter the Elevens in the Special Zone!

219
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:50,395
You're lying. Zero's a knight for Justice!

220
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,656
He would never do something like...

221
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:53,795
We have evidence.

222
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,551
Did you use your Geass Power on Euphy? Be honest.

223
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:58,793
Yes.

224
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:01,346
You caused her massacre the Japanese?

225
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:03,326
I ordered her to do it.

226
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:05,458
Then, that whole bloodbath was...

227
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:08,649
Euphy was just a girl. Zero was in control.

228
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:11,715
So Zero slaughtered our people for his own ambitions?!

229
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,615
That recording is fake!

230
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,010
These are people and incidents that
we suspect he manipulated, with his Geass.

231
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:24,911
Kusakabe. Even Major General Katase.

232
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,258
I can't... believe it.

233
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:35,617
Clovis...

234
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:37,208
He used it on me, too.

235
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:37,913
Hm?

236
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:40,264
That explains why Gao-Hai changed.

237
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:43,938
And it explains why Jeremiah
and the others became traitors.

238
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,341
His Geass might be controlling even me now.

239
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,399
There's no way to be certain about that.

240
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:51,250
When you think about it, it's a terrifying prospect.

241
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:51,983
You mean...?!

242
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:53,210
We could be...?!

243
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:55,085
There's one more thing.

244
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:59,467
We notified Zero about the
F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead before the battle.

245
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,742
We wanted to avoid using it.

246
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:04,644
It's still in the Lancelot's communications record.

247
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,115
However...

248
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:08,542
He never told us anything about that.

249
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,718
We can't trust Commander Zero!

250
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:12,712
Asahina...

251
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:15,201
I wanted to put my trust in Zero!

252
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:17,198
I wanted to believe in him!

253
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:20,360
But we mean nothing to him, we're just pawns.

254
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:21,872
Treating us like chumps?!

255
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:24,976
Damn! How could he do this to us?!

256
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:29,298
Everyone, Zero is my brother.

257
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:32,302
Will you please hand him over to me for justice?

258
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:35,055
On one condition.

259
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,926
Ohgi!

260
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:39,095
You think you're in a position to bargain over this?!

261
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,941
Wait, let's hear it.

262
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:43,892
Our Japan. Return it.

263
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:47,144
We're betraying our comrade.

264
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,782
So at least we deserve to regain Japan.

265
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:53,324
Otherwise I could never forgive myself.

266
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:01,465
Master, please take off your clothes.

267
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:03,557
What?

268
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:05,457
Are you hurting somewhere?

269
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:08,132
If it's someplace you can't reach, I can help.

270
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,713
That's right. It's someplace I can't reach.

271
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:18,359
Zero, are you there? Can I come in?

272
00:14:18,384 --> 00:14:19,322
It's me.

273
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:21,172
Is that Kallen?

274
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,894
Ohgi asked me to bring you to Warehouse Four.

275
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,980
Why there?

276
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:29,502
Sorry, I didn't really get the details.

277
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:30,688
Master?

278
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:32,136
Uh?

279
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:34,169
Please take off your clothes.

280
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:36,232
I'll do the best I can, I promise.

281
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:39,409
Uh! What the hell have the two of you been doing here?!

282
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,209
While I've been rotting in a cell y...!

283
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:43,924
No, you've got it wrong. She was...

284
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:47,684
C.C. lost her memory.

285
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,203
It happened because of me.

286
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:54,426
So, the C.C. you knew is
gone now, erased, and it's my fault.

287
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:00,165
Her mind was erased?

288
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:05,053
C.C.'s gone. And Nunnally's been killed.

289
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,840
That means Lelouch is now...

290
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:07,574
Kallen.

291
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,336
Uh!

292
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:09,878
It's good you made it back.

293
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:12,311
I'm sorry it took so long to get you out.

294
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:16,838
Lelouch, listen when I was imprisoned,
I happened to talk to Nunnally.

295
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:19,238
She stood up for me and she saved me.

296
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,297
I see.

297
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:23,469
Look, I'm not sure what to say at a time like this...

298
00:15:23,494 --> 00:15:25,713
But when I lost my brother, I...

299
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,515
Surrender, Zero!

300
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,165
How dare you try to run a con game on us!

301
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,101
We know everything about your Geass power!

302
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:42,699
"Zero, the renowned hero,
died in battle before he could triumph.

303
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:47,732
But his gallant life and daring deeds
will continue to live on in myth and legend!"

304
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:50,670
Is that the script you've written for me, Diethard?

305
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:55,728
Actually, I wanted to film your brilliant
campaign and glorious victory over Britannia,

306
00:15:55,753 --> 00:15:58,867
but I'm afraid that show has been permanently cancelled.

307
00:15:58,892 --> 00:15:59,974
What do I do?

308
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,230
Knightmares are beyond my reach,

309
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:03,172
but Ohgi and the others are defenseless!

310
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:04,864
If I can use my Geass secretly...!

311
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:06,838
Everybody trusted you, Zero!

312
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:09,913
Inoue and Yoshida sacrificed their lives for you!

313
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:12,570
Wait a minute! This is all one-sided!

314
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:14,690
Look at how far we've come because of Zero!

315
00:16:14,715 --> 00:16:16,328
At least let him answer!

316
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:17,701
You're in the way, Kallen!

317
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,476
Do you want to die with Zero?!

318
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:22,255
Don't tell me he used his Geass on you, too!

319
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:28,388
I need an answer, Lelouch. What do I mean to you?

320
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:29,913
I have to know.

321
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:35,045
If I could stay with you, I would... Please.

322
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:40,378
Schneizel. You made your move
and now you're calling check.

323
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:43,536
There's no way out of this for me. It's over.

324
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:45,913
Please, answer me, Lelouch!

325
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,280
Uh!

326
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:51,295
Fools! You finally figured it out!

327
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:54,207
That I've been using you all.

328
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:57,986
That's right. You're all just pawns in my game!

329
00:16:58,011 --> 00:16:59,640
Zero! So, you really are...

330
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,380
Zero!

331
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,482
Lelouch, no.

332
00:17:03,745 --> 00:17:06,220
Kallen, you were my most useful piece;

333
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:08,104
much like a well-played, knight.

334
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:10,918
This whole world was the board for the game.

335
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:13,292
And all for my entertainment.

336
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:14,763
I see...

337
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:20,282
Goodbye then, Lelouch.

338
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:22,909
Get ready!

339
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,457
Kallen. You have to live.

340
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,615
Fire!

341
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:32,059
Are you okay, brother?!

342
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,255
Rolo!

343
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,490
Never mind! Open fire! Hit the Shinkiro!

344
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:36,270
Wait!

345
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:38,370
Big brother, I'll protect you!

346
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:44,063
Stop it, Rolo! You've done enough!

347
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,234
Uh!

348
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:46,826
Oh, my master...

349
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:48,435
Uh. They're gone!

350
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,738
The Shinkiro...!

351
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:51,846
Vanished. Just like in Babel Tower...

352
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,162
Anya, Zero has escaped.

353
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:56,501
Can you capture him with the Mordred?

354
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:59,197
I can only destroy it.

355
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:09,477
I never knew how hard it was to
calculate the Absolute Defense Field.

356
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:12,151
My big brother really is incredible, isn't he?

357
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:15,147
Rolo! I have no reason to live anymore!

358
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:18,453
Huh?

359
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:20,811
Uh?

360
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,862
How can it move like that?

361
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:25,701
I won't let them kill you! I swear it!

362
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:29,215
Using your Geass over such a large area...

363
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,263
Rolo! It's way too much,
your heart can't take that much strain!

364
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:36,424
Attention, all units! The Shinkiro has been stolen!

365
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:38,270
Search out and destroy the Shinkiro!

366
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:40,413
I Repeat, destroy the Shinkiro!

367
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:49,227
That's enough, Rolo! I don't want to live any more!

368
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:51,588
I won't stop, brother. Because of this...

369
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,217
Don't do...

370
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:04,230
All throughout my whole life,
people have used me like a tool.

371
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,399
...this, Rolo! Why are you still trying...

372
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,690
I was used by the Order...

373
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,061
...to save me?! You know that...

374
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:16,559
And then you used me, big brother.

375
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:19,536
Uh. Yeah, Maybe you've been using me

376
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:22,174
for your own ends right from the very start...

377
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:27,074
But only the time I spent with you seemed real.

378
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,815
...I was only usin...

379
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:35,065
It was those memories that finally made me...

380
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:36,828
human!

381
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,019
...using you! Uh! Rolo!

382
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:44,755
That's why I'm not...!

383
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:48,199
I'm not...

384
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:52,270
No, stop using your Geass like that! Do you want to die?!

385
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:59,088
I'm not... a tool. I do this... of my own... free will!

386
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:01,011
As a human being!

387
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:17,052
Rolo, why did you save me? After all I've done to you?

388
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:20,267
Because you're a liar, big brother.

389
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:21,248
Uh.

390
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:24,461
It was a lie, wasn't it?

391
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:26,538
What you said about trying to kill me.

392
00:20:26,563 --> 00:20:29,813
About hating me and all of that.

393
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,309
Of course. And you saw right through me, didn't you?

394
00:20:33,828 --> 00:20:36,363
Just what I'd expect of my little brother.

395
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,700
That's right. I thought so...

396
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:42,017
'Cause I know who you really are inside your heart...

397
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:45,767
I know everything about you, big brother...

398
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:48,936
Yes, you got it right.

399
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:53,305
Your big brother is just a liar.

400
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,176
We cannot locate the target.

401
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,855
Increasing the search area.

402
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,944
Request to send in ground units.

403
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:12,678
Nunnally. Rolo. Shirley.

404
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:16,027
The Black Knights. I've lost everything.

405
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:18,803
This is the result which I've been left with.

406
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,723
No. It's my just punishment.

407
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:27,028
But now, thanks to this... Thank you, Rolo.

408
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,382
You saved my life for a reason,

409
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:33,025
because there's still a task
that's waiting for me out there.

410
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:36,573
Yes. Something I have to finish...

411
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:38,534
Who would've imagined

412
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:42,425
that I would ever happen to use the system here.

413
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:45,338
The Ragnarok Connection.

414
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:49,336
So now, the old world shall be destroyed,

415
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:52,413
and a new world shall be created in its place!

416
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:55,521
My father, Charles zi Britannia!

417
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:58,682
If I am on the road to hell, then I'll take you with me.

418
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:02,488
This is my final mission! I swear it!

419
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:42,061
Rolo. What was our relationship, in the end?

420
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:46,132
It's strange to think that.

421
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:48,913
Even knowing the truth, you still...

422
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,995
You of all people stuck by me to the very last. Yeah...

423
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:57,123
I always realize these things when it's too late.

424
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,051
To you, I wasn't Lelouch vi Britannia, was I?

425
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:04,878
I was Lelouch Lamperouge, your big brother.
