1
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:07,559
The capital Pendragon's been obliterated?!

2
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:08,487
Is it true?!

3
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:10,403
They say it was a F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

4
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:12,396
The thing that wiped out the Tokyo Settlement?

5
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:13,328
An accident?

6
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:16,309
But I heard the F.L.E.I.J.A.s
they built are all missing now.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,549
Stop spreading wild rumors!

8
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:22,949
It's imprudent to talk as if the
capital's been destroyed, even as rumors!

9
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:25,793
No, I'm afraid it's all true.

10
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:28,564
What?! You!

11
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:31,651
Please take me to Lelouch. It's urgent.

12
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:14,345
N-Nunnally...

13
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:17,086
It's you... You're alive!

14
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:19,930
Yes, thanks to our brother, Schneizel.

15
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,163
Schneizel...

16
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,649
Nunnally...

17
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:25,715
Do you understand what Schneizel has done?

18
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,713
Yes. He attacked the capitol, Pendragon

19
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:30,363
with a F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

20
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,228
If you know about that, then why?!

21
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:35,207
Do you think that using Geass on people is better?!

22
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:41,548
Both you and big brother have been
lying to me from the very beginning, haven't you?

23
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:44,323
You've kept the truth from me all this time.

24
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:47,005
But now I know everything.

25
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:50,730
Lelouch, you were Zero all along, weren't you?

26
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:53,606
Why?!

27
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,868
Tell me. Were you doing it for my sake?

28
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:59,507
Because, if you were that means...

29
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:01,848
For your sake?

30
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:04,897
I see my little sister is presumptuous as ever!

31
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:10,045
You think it's just natural for people to
help you all the time out of sympathy and pity?

32
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,049
It's so easy to criticize others

33
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:14,470
while you keep your own hands unsullied.

34
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:18,738
You are the quintessence of the
privileged aristocrat that I've rejected.

35
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:21,130
You... No...

36
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:22,880
I act for no one's sake!

37
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:24,696
It is for me, my sake,

38
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:26,609
that I take the world into my hands!

39
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:29,532
If you choose to stand in my way
by allying yourself with Schneizel,

40
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,932
I won't hesitate to crush you without mercy!

41
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:33,388
And without regret.

42
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,655
Lelouch!

43
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:41,548
Are you all right, Nunnally?

44
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:43,668
That must have been very hard for you, Nunnally.

45
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:47,705
I thought showing him the power of
the F.L.E.I.J.A. might convince him to surrender.

46
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:51,560
Schneizel. Are the people of Pendragon really all right?

47
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:53,316
 Are you sure they're safe?

48
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,588
You needn't worry.

49
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:57,978
We gave warning for them to evacuate well in advance.

50
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,595
Of course, the damage to the city was significant,

51
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,994
but we did everything we could to minimize it.

52
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,901
But, now we'll have to use the weapon on people,

53
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:08,522
on Lelouch and his followers...

54
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:10,413
If they stand in the way of world peace,

55
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:11,897
we'll have no choice.

56
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:14,053
Schneizel, please...

57
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:18,314
Will you let me have the
F.L.E.I.J.A. firing switch to hold onto?

58
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,157
I can't fight battles or defend my country or my people.

59
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:23,903
 So, at the very least,

60
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:26,807
I want this sin to be on my shoulders.

61
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:32,091
Schneizel, may I please have a word with you?

62
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:33,032
Tch!

63
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:36,324
C.C., why didn't you find out about Nunnally?!

64
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:38,224
I'm certainly not a god.

65
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:41,561
I can only read people if they're
connected to the power of Geass.

66
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:43,168
Tch! Schneizel!

67
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:46,068
You knew but you kept the truth from me all this time!

68
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:49,366
Just so you could play this card at the right moment!

69
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:52,809
Still, the way that you shuffled
the deck was more than artful.

70
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,387
It was remarkable and effective.

71
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,147
Lelouch.

72
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:02,318
Our strategic objective's unchanged.

73
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:06,247
We can't stop this just because
we found out that Nunnally is still alive...

74
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,274
Or the Zero Requiem will have no meaning.

75
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,073
Remember your promise!

76
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:14,181
Suzaku!

77
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,384
I am his sword.

78
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:20,932
It's my job to rid him of his
enemies and his own weakness.

79
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:24,040
And you, C.C., you must be his shield.

80
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:24,699
Huh?

81
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,016
Your job is to protect him.

82
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,011
We do things as you like.

83
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,807
Lelouch is your accomplice, isn't he?

84
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:36,028
My accomplice? Huh.

85
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,066
The F.L.E.I.J.A. they used on Pendragon

86
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:42,991
had ten times the effective range of
the one used on the Tokyo Settlement.

87
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:48,020
If they haven't developed a new model, then...

88
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,243
They've removed the limiter?

89
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:51,743
Bingo.

90
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,793
By removing both the effect range
and the detonation time limiter...

91
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:58,091
Prince Schneizel, how could you?

92
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,918
Yes, what about it?

93
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:02,788
You mean the people of Pendragon were...!

94
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:04,572
I made them vanish.

95
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:08,168
It was better for them than a life,
swearing loyalty to Lelouch, wouldn't you say?

96
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,576
They're our own people. And you told Nunnally...

97
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:11,999
Lies are expedient.

98
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:16,762
There's no need to tell Nunnally things that would
get in the way of her opposition to Lelouch, is there?

99
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:18,874
She'll never know the difference.

100
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,672
You use everyone?

101
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:22,324
Even your own sister?

102
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,986
Cornelia, what is it that people truly want?

103
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:27,918
Starvation and poverty?

104
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:31,682
Discrimination and corruption? War and terrorism?

105
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:35,751
They want the problems that are
flooding the world to go away forever.

106
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:39,374
People can't understand each other
under these situations at all.

107
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,988
Your theories don't justify butchering civilians.

108
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:47,876
Even civilians who have rejected war
depend on the police, don't they?

109
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,488
Everyone knows, don't they?

110
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:52,179
That people are driven by their own desires.

111
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,451
The lust that dwells within the soul of man

112
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:55,743
cannot be denied.

113
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:59,488
So why win hearts and minds or tout some shining ideology?

114
00:06:59,513 --> 00:07:03,030
Why not bring peace to the world with a system and power?

115
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:09,222
In ten days, Damocles will enter
the airspace of the United States of China,

116
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:12,068
and then switch over to a secondary acceleration.

117
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:15,920
After that, we're scheduled to
ascend 300 kilometers above the surface.

118
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:19,286
From there, we will hit every
enemy nation with F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

119
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,769
Are you insane?!

120
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:23,174
We only agreed to use them against Lelouch!

121
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,032
This will destroy the world!

122
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:27,463
You're trying to control people through fear!

123
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,571
Mankind's history is war.

124
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:31,263
Peace is an illusion.

125
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:34,866
To turn illusion into reality is an arduous task.

126
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:36,182
It requires discipline.

127
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:39,778
And you plan to discipline the
entire human race all by yourself?!

128
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:41,813
Only a god could pull that off!

129
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,788
Then I shall become a god.

130
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:47,584
If that is what it takes to bring peace to the world.

131
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,870
You're deranged.

132
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:50,228
Magnificent!

133
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:53,236
I knew I was right to change sides and support you!

134
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:58,409
Surpassing Zero's chaos with a state of perfect
nothingness, and a kaleidoscopic transformation!

135
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:01,422
Prince Schneizel, we've made
contact with the Black Knights.

136
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,163
They say if you plan to kill Lelouch,

137
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:04,855
they're willing to join you immediately.

138
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,224
Thank you, Kanon.

139
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:10,124
Those who've experienced Lelouch's
tyranny first hand will have no alternative

140
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:12,066
but to choose the lesser of evils.

141
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:15,622
Is that why you stayed back and
let Lelouch get away with this until now?!

142
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:18,439
It was a way to minimize the damage.

143
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,784
But in the end, if we have to
sacrifice one or two billion lives

144
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,886
to achieve a state of permanent peace...

145
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:25,028
You're wrong!

146
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:27,722
Peace attained by force is not peace!

147
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,594
This is so sad, Cornelia.

148
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:43,750
Schneizel outmaneuvered us.

149
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,992
He had another escape plane
as a decoy during the battle of Tokyo.

150
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:49,609
And so...

151
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,534
The plane destroyed by the F.L.E.I.J.A. was the decoy.

152
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,115
That's right, and now he's trying to use

153
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,974
Miss Nunnally to control Master Lelouch.

154
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,832
You're Japanese, aren't you?

155
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:03,061
Why come to Master Lelouch instead of the Black Knights?

156
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:04,238
Uh...

157
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:08,790
You're devoted to chivalry as well, aren't you?

158
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:12,007
Ah. Perhaps there's some truth to that.

159
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:24,015
I'm impressed.

160
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,582
You didn't drop your mask in front of Nunnally.

161
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:31,123
No matter what angle I use to attack
the problem, the answer is always the same:

162
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:34,048
The conclusion I came to then wasn't wrong.

163
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:37,581
Lelouch, haven't you done enough?

164
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,623
You've handled this well.

165
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:42,875
You understand why I'm doing this evil, don't you?

166
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:45,081
Besides, under the rule of Democles,

167
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:47,439
people would become lifeless puppets.

168
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:50,850
That's true, but Nunnally is aboard Damocles.

169
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:55,300
Everything you've done from the beginning was for her.

170
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,848
I can't treat her differently any longer.

171
00:09:57,873 --> 00:10:00,290
So many people have died since this began.

172
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:03,257
For their sakes, we have to see it through to the end.

173
00:10:03,423 --> 00:10:05,463
Don't we, C.C.?

174
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,073
Yes. You are right, Lelouch.

175
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:32,896
Are you sure you want to join with us?

176
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:35,746
It means you'd be fighting against Britannia.

177
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:38,157
Y'know, right now...

178
00:11:38,182 --> 00:11:39,290
Huh?

179
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,217
Right now, I think I understand your feelings just a bit.

180
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:44,145
Uh...

181
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:47,907
Uh, well, thanks, I guess.

182
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:49,703
I beg your pardon?

183
00:11:56,673 --> 00:12:00,071
Pendragon was the capital of the Holy Britannian Empire.

184
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:03,280
With its destruction, their
internal government is paralyzed.

185
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,396
They're confronting our
Black Knight forces in every part of the world

186
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:08,601
so they're pinned down everywhere.

187
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:12,174
In short, the only force Lelouch can deploy against us

188
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,882
is the division he brought to reoccupy Japan.

189
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:18,466
But the balance of power
can be tipped for him at any time.

190
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:21,163
To minimize damage, we cannot hesitate.

191
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:23,188
The time to confront him is now!

192
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,424
Since Schneizel has now agreed to join us,

193
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:28,196
our forces are evenly matched with the enemy.

194
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:31,653
Our intention is not the approval
of the Damocles use of F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

195
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:34,642
It's bringing unity to the world is our first priority.

196
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,457
This battle...

197
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:37,584
This battle is the ultimate test.

198
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:40,025
Control of the entire world at stake!

199
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:42,584
If we defeat Schneizel and the Black Knights,

200
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:45,443
then there will be no one left to stand in our way!

201
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:48,328
This world shall be destroyed and then recreated

202
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:51,767
by Lelouch, the one, true emperor of Britannia!

203
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:52,980
Crush them!

204
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,463
Destroy Schneizel and the sky fortress Damocles!

205
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:57,871
Crush them all!

206
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,771
We have nothing to fear!

207
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:02,915
My name is the future of this world!

208
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,161
All hail Lelouch!

209
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:10,321
Lelouch has spread malice
and turmoil all across the globe.

210
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:13,515
As the enemy of peace, he must be wiped out.

211
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,528
It is time for the Black Knights,

212
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:20,079
and for us, to cast aside the
grudges of the past and join forces!

213
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:22,434
The people of the world are waiting

214
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,611
for our song of victory!

215
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:27,249
I pray that, for all time, this shall be

216
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:32,174
the last battle in the last war
that mankind will ever need to fight!

217
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,036
Oh, Lelouch...

218
00:13:37,073 --> 00:13:41,113
I'll make both of you into records on my hard drive.

219
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:43,649
Are you sure Anya will be all right in the battle?

220
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:46,221
I know you promised to restore
her memory, Your Highness, but...

221
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:49,736
We need every bit of battle strength we have. So...

222
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,944
Oh? An open channel?

223
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,323
Official greetings, Schneizel.

224
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:01,586
Lelouch, if you're going to surrender, now is the time.

225
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,823
We have an arsenal of F.L.E.I.J.A.s, ready to launch.

226
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:08,417
F.L.E.I.J.A.s? I wonder if you dare to use them.

227
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:12,690
Considering that I have all the U.F.N.
representatives aboard the Avalon with me.

228
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:15,394
He's hiding behind the hostages he took!

229
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,425
I can't believe he'd go this far!

230
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,180
So, Schneizel, these people are from
all over the world. They're not related to you.

231
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:24,319
You're right, they're not.

232
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:26,405
Their lives are a small price to pay...

233
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,188
Schneizel, you can't attack!

234
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:30,200
I understand that the U.F.N. members

235
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:32,757
have elected acting representatives to speak for them.

236
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:35,584
We're prepared for the worst,
and we know how dire this is.

237
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:39,238
But that doesn't mean we're going
to throw their lives away on a gamble!

238
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:43,346
Li Xing-ke, aside from the Damocles,

239
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:46,000
our strike force consists only of the Mordred.

240
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:48,990
If you're going to tie our hands
so we can't use the F.L.E.I.J.A.s,

241
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:52,675
then I request that you put me
in charge of all our united forces.

242
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,123
We're facing Lelouch!

243
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:57,261
Exactly. I've never lost to Lelouch. Ever.

244
00:14:57,286 --> 00:15:00,202
And I know him far better than anyone on this battlefield.

245
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,721
Understood.

246
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:05,057
Deploy the Shen Hu.

247
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:07,288
Transmit the command structure to all forces!

248
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:08,040
Yes, sir!

249
00:15:08,065 --> 00:15:10,432
Then, shall we let the game play out, brother?

250
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:11,855
Indeed.

251
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:14,500
Kanon, it's just as you predicted.

252
00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:18,369
Yes. The Black Knights are now
yours to command, your highness.

253
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:22,000
Heh. Transmit pattern Sigma to all forces.

254
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:24,965
Enemy fleets are in motion,

255
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,605
deploying into a wide-field aerial formation.

256
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,546
He's using conventional forces. Good.

257
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:31,684
Stretch our left wing!

258
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,667
Assume Half-Moon Spirit formation!

259
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:35,559
Yes, Your Majesty!

260
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,063
Their main wings are undermanned.

261
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:41,921
Have Gino's unit advance.

262
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:44,321
Keep the enemy's left wing from extending!

263
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:45,873
Yes, Your Highness!

264
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,057
Checking my move.

265
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,475
Reverse the direction of our left wing!

266
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,291
That'll break up our formation!

267
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:54,274
Do it!

268
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:58,015
Gino, halt your advance, now!

269
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,938
But why?

270
00:15:58,963 --> 00:16:00,611
We should strike while they're in disarray.

271
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:01,942
It's a false opening.

272
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,584
I'm not buying it.

273
00:16:03,623 --> 00:16:05,665
Not falling for it, huh?

274
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:08,748
Switch our battle plan to Ursa Major formation!

275
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:15,846
Sixth Unit, follow Anya and move
to the northeast, elevate 40 degrees!

276
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:18,730
Bombardiers, prep for anti-air combat!

277
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:22,297
Anya, stop there, climb 200 meters and stabilize!

278
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:25,723
What the hell?! Nobody's fighting!

279
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:26,946
You're wrong.

280
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:30,088
Contests fought between two masters are decided instantly.

281
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:33,584
An invisible battle is now raging between the two of them.

282
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:39,757
We have to hurry.

283
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,653
They're going to attack each other any moment now.

284
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,080
They're surrounding us!

285
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:47,630
Counter move!

286
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:50,182
Reinforce the front line with Suzaku's Lancelot!

287
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,632
Hold at combat speed four! And send out Ward's unit!

288
00:16:53,657 --> 00:16:55,888
Ah-ha, you haven't changed, Lelouch.

289
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:59,215
You'd rather attack my front line
than defend your own flanks.

290
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,073
I now have a small window.

291
00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:02,434
Xing-ke?

292
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,884
Heh. He's already incorporated our skill levels.

293
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:08,346
The enemy's left wing is breaking away!

294
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:10,617
Stand fast!

295
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:12,996
Live up to His Majesty's trust in us!

296
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:19,948
If we can defeat Lelouch, this will be over!

297
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:28,144
If we smash their line, it'll be a free-for-all...!

298
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,436
They're punching through!

299
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,019
They're cutting us to pieces.

300
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:39,730
Should I have Suzaku fall back?

301
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:42,255
No, that's what Schneizel wants us to do.

302
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:45,021
Draw in the battle line! Fall back and regroup!

303
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:47,492
Their fleet is damaged and falling back.

304
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:50,423
Don't lose the momentum!

305
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:51,821
Push forward!

306
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:58,563
Guren, you're too far out!

307
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:00,338
Match pace with us and we can surround them!

308
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:02,107
I understand, but...!

309
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:04,478
Don't rush!

310
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:07,369
If we beat their vanguard, we'll isolate the Avalon!

311
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,553
The Dreadnought is destroyed! They're breaking through!

312
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:13,134
So that's how it stands.

313
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,588
I don't wish to engage the
Black Knights as formidable enemies.

314
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:18,480
However, my side has motive.

315
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:20,671
For His Majesty!

316
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:25,721
It's heartrending.

317
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:28,740
Seeing soldiers controlled by the false power of Geass.

318
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:30,036
And so!

319
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,878
This is the moment. Smash both wings.

320
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:37,248
Bow-mounted hadron scatter cannon, now set!

321
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:39,642
Move the Seventh Squad out of the firing angle!

322
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,082
Gefjun control synched.

323
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:42,123
Ready to fire!

324
00:18:42,148 --> 00:18:45,223
Target both enemy wings. And fire!

325
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:50,513
Zero, with all of us working together,

326
00:18:50,538 --> 00:18:52,217
we can defeat you!

327
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:57,603
It seems that Lelouch badly underestimated
the fighting skills of the Black Knights.

328
00:18:57,628 --> 00:18:58,717
Well, Lelouch?

329
00:18:58,742 --> 00:18:59,492
Right.

330
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:02,703
They've shown great skill, forcing me to use this plan!

331
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:09,382
Dammit!

332
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:11,163
Energy chain reaction, below us!

333
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:11,830
What?!

334
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:14,048
Impossible! He timed this to...?!

335
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:18,786
All forces! Deploy radiant shields!

336
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:22,380
Zero!

337
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:28,505
I was the one who first acknowledged

338
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,273
his leadership and encouraged the others to follow him.

339
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:34,157
So I'm responsible for all of this.

340
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:37,455
But I don't want a new life caught up in it.

341
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:39,991
I know this is a selfish request,

342
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:42,716
but I want you stay here on Horai Island.

343
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,057
Please.

344
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:47,694
Ohgi, please respond!

345
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,094
Minami! Rakshata!

346
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:55,007
It can't be...!

347
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:57,990
He used the Sakuradite in the Fuji mines.

348
00:19:58,241 --> 00:19:59,623
Yes, he has.

349
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:02,117
Destroying his own ground forces as well.

350
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:03,903
I was careless!

351
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:07,169
So, that was Lelouch's tactical plan.

352
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:10,450
But how could he sacrifice his own forces?!

353
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,619
This has drastically depleted the enemy's strength.

354
00:20:14,644 --> 00:20:16,137
Which leaves Damocles...

355
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:17,632
...wide open.

356
00:20:18,507 --> 00:20:21,334
In reality, it's you who's been checked.

357
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,193
And you brought it on yourself.

358
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:25,600
Nunnally, targeting is complete.

359
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,505
Now that the Black Knights have been smashed,

360
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,009
we must use the F.L.E.I.J.A.'s power.

361
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,217
Yes.

362
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:38,019
With this act, I will wipe away my brother's sins!

363
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,196
Incoming! It's a F.L.E.I.J.A.!

364
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:44,887
So, he's finally launched. Special division three!

365
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,782
Yes, Your Majesty!

366
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:48,900
It's useless.

367
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:49,890
It can't be stopped;

368
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,659
the F.L.E.I.J.A. went critical the
moment it was fired from the Damocles.

369
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,742
Avalon continue to fall back.

370
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,559
All units, charge at the Damocles.

371
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:03,678
Force them to keep launching the
F.L.E.I.J.A. warheads until their arsenal is empty.

372
00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:12,555
Ohgi! Ohgi!

373
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,219
Ohgi, please!

374
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:16,286
This is no time to play dead!

375
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:19,913
I-I don't believe it. You two shielded us?

376
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:23,290
We were only able to protect the bridge though, eh?

377
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,890
You're on your own now.

378
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:27,765
Hang in there. Let's go...! Kallen!

379
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,715
Oh, great... Who's the guy giving orders?

380
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,998
Tch. Now that I've used the Fuji plan,

381
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:35,573
and considering the number of
the remaining F.L.E.I.J.A. warheads,

382
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,953
I'm at a disadvantage of one move.

383
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,398
Meaning, I have to depend on Nina now.

384
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:43,275
Can she do it? I know she hates me.

385
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,509
Detests me for being Zero, Euphy's murderer.

386
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:49,707
The enemy of her precious Britannia which I now rule.

387
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:52,585
And yet, to defeat Schneizel...

388
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:56,159
I wonder... Do you really think
you can defeat me, Lelouch?

389
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:59,028
Because if you do, you're at the end of your path.

390
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:03,228
A man who has not mastered
the use of the mask can never prevail.

391
00:23:37,474 --> 00:23:38,657
Suzaku and I...

392
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:40,596
Together, there was nothing we couldn't do.

393
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:41,871
That's what I thought.

394
00:23:41,896 --> 00:23:45,187
But now, Schneizel has proven an unrelenting foe.

395
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:48,696
The truth is, it's his detachment, his lack of desire.

396
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:50,303
A man coldly focused,

397
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,949
who understands Geass and possesses the F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

398
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,851
What strategy does he pursue?

399
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:58,953
Is there any tactic that can work on a battlefield
where F.L.E.I.J.A.s rain down from the sky?

400
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:01,865
I have one last gamble, one final card to play.

401
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,542
And it lies within Schneizel's own heart.
