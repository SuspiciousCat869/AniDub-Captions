1
00:00:02,323 --> 00:00:05,793
Long live the Black Knights! Hip, hip, hooray!

2
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:10,550
What happened to that Knightmare?

3
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:11,808
The one that saved Zero?

4
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,210
It escaped using a route Xing-ke gave us.

5
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:15,075
Xing-ke?

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,481
The Chinese Federation guy I mentioned.

7
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:18,512
I see.

8
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:20,712
Then I'll be sure to make use of that route, as well.

9
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:23,481
So, was that pilot the same one from Babel Tower?

10
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:25,129
Because of what happened to Urabe,

11
00:00:25,154 --> 00:00:26,487
I won't tell you his name.

12
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:29,222
Simply think of him as a person who supports our cause.

13
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:31,431
You didn't use your Geass on him, did you?

14
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:33,422
As it turned out, I didn't need to.

15
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:35,391
Anyway, C.C., about the Emperor and...

16
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,624
Now wait a minute!

17
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,891
You'll keep the pilot a secret from me?!

18
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:39,975
So what?

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,345
There are times when I like to keep secrets, too.

20
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,579
Are you speaking as Zero, or Lelouch right now?

21
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:48,622
It's not as if everyone knows
about our relationship, do they?

22
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:50,897
Stop saying weird stuff like that, all right?!

23
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:52,713
And your true identity?

24
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,320
Kallen and I are the only ones
among the group who know who you really are.

25
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:57,547
That's secret, too.

26
00:00:57,572 --> 00:01:02,614
Lelouch, do you still want me to be the
captain of Zero's personal force, as I have been?

27
00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:03,604
I do.

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,547
Understood. I'll consider that roger and out!

29
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,391
I'm counting on you, now.

30
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,160
We'll talk about Geass later.
There are more pressing matters.

31
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:16,691
Very well. I catch your drift.

32
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,714
Here it is! Man, I've missed my old uniform!

33
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:21,859
Rock n' roll...!

34
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:24,159
I can't believe they had all this ready for us!

35
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,666
They say Captain Kouzuki and Urabe arranged it.

36
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:27,622
Oh man...

37
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:30,834
Oh, I see. And you say Urabe died well?

38
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:31,951
Yes.

39
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:34,976
You should just confess already.

40
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,109
W-What do you mean by "confess?"

41
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,449
It's Zero!

42
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,845
Hold it! Hold it!

43
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:46,539
While we appreciate your rescuing us, Zero,

44
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,397
we wouldn't have been captured in the first place

45
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:50,091
if you hadn't betrayed us the way you did!

46
00:01:50,116 --> 00:01:52,357
Don't you owe us an explanation?

47
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:55,653
What happened? We deserve to know!

48
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:58,220
Everything is for victory over Britannia.

49
00:01:58,274 --> 00:02:00,518
Okay... Go on.

50
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:01,316
That's all.

51
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,355
Huh?!

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,647
Nothing more to say?

53
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:05,668
No apologies? No excuses?

54
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:06,899
Stop it!

55
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:08,030
Zero.

56
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:11,039
Were your actions intended to give us a chance of winning?

57
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,653
I'm always focused on getting results.

58
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:15,818
I understand.

59
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:19,393
At times, our operations must be kept secret.

60
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:21,707
Right now, we need to rely on his power!

61
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:25,089
I can think of no one more
capable than Zero to be our leader!

62
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:27,597
I agree! We should all trust Zero!

63
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:30,466
But Zero treated you as if
you were nothing more than a pawn.

64
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:33,039
Who other than Zero could have pulled this off?!

65
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,334
Even the Chinese Federation isn't
strong enough to wage war on Britannia!

66
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:40,841
And the E.U. continues to lose
to Prince Schneizel, doesn't it?

67
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:44,641
We're the last hope out of all
the Areas that Britannia has colonized.

68
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,807
Zero is the only one who can lead us
to victory in our war of independence!

69
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:49,718
Ohgi's right!

70
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:52,451
Zero! Zero! Zero! Zero!

71
00:02:52,476 --> 00:03:00,399
Zerp! Zero! Zero! Zero...

72
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:38,305
Hello, everyone.

73
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:40,045
My name is Suzaku Kururugi,

74
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,570
and I'll be returning to classes here
at Ashford Academy starting today.

75
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:45,461
I look forward to studying here.

76
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,049
Suzaku Kururugi?!

77
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:48,657
The guy who caught Zero?!

78
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:51,078
The White Death is coming to school here?!

79
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:52,687
He's the Knight of Seven.

80
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:53,879
But, he's an Eleven.

81
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:54,904
Doesn't matter.

82
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,291
He's the emperor's immediate subord...

83
00:04:56,316 --> 00:04:57,834
Okay, quiet down!

84
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:00,692
Sir Kururugi has been reassigned to Area 11,

85
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,932
and that's why he's coming back to school here.

86
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:05,324
Why don't you take the desk next to Lelouch for now.

87
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:06,515
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,303
Suzaku... You...

89
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,857
You were my first real friend.

90
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:17,461
But... the war tore us apart.

91
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:21,067
The Second Pacific War.

92
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:24,640
The conflict in which Britannia took control of Japan.

93
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:26,041
After it's defeat,

94
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,899
Japan became an Area colony of Britannian.

95
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:31,407
I, who was abandoned by my homeland...

96
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,984
I, who was forced to abandon my homeland...

97
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,550
When reunited, we were at once enemies and allies.

98
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:39,349
Although I was Japanese,

99
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:41,534
I was also a Britannian soldier.

100
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:43,484
I was Zero.

101
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:46,147
We both hid our true identities.

102
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:47,589
We fought each other.

103
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:51,330
However, those are memories of what really happened.

104
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:54,517
The emperor rewrote three things in Lelouch's memory.

105
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:55,791
Nunnally...

106
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,063
Anything about Zero...

107
00:05:58,088 --> 00:05:59,243
And that I...

108
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:02,457
...was a prince of the royal family of Britannia.

109
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:05,745
And so, the two of us now...

110
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:09,134
Hey, welcome back. It's been some time.

111
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,757
I missed everyone a lot.

112
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:12,365
Suzaku, it feels like forever!

113
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,478
You've really come up in the world, haven't you!

114
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:16,337
Suzaku's back?! Where is he?!

115
00:06:16,362 --> 00:06:17,501
Madame President!

116
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,276
Class is in progress. You mind?

117
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:20,974
Oh, what's with you, Lelouch?

118
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:23,082
You screwed up, Suzaku.

119
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:24,611
When you heard the name Lelouch,

120
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,901
you just walked right to my side.

121
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:29,968
In other words, you acted as if you knew me.

122
00:06:29,993 --> 00:06:33,905
Now, to make sure Rolo doesn't do anything stupid.

123
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,624
Hm?

124
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,155
And so everybody up and left, except us.

125
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,568
They all went back home. Even the teachers!

126
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:43,760
Back to the homeland?

127
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:44,474
Yeah.

128
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:48,820
And that's the reason why we're the only
ones here at the school who know you. Right, Rolo?

129
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,182
R-Right.

130
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,036
That explains why I don't recognize any one here.

131
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,144
Hey, you saw Zero's face, didn't you?

132
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,418
So what did he look like?

133
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:57,816
Is he really a girl?

134
00:06:57,841 --> 00:06:59,478
It's really Prince Clovis, right?

135
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,545
Or a prince from another country?

136
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,447
Uhh...well, um...

137
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:05,097
Can't you share that with us?

138
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:07,241
No, it's a military secret.

139
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,832
I'm sorry... Ah!

140
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,411
Arthur!

141
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:13,061
Ah! You brought him with you?

142
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:14,669
Well, Suzaku,

143
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:17,420
you really have a thing for cats, don't you?

144
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,947
Did anything leap out at you during your contact with him?

145
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:23,628
No, not especially.

146
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,845
Then we can conclude that the
subject's memories haven't returned?

147
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,141
Wait just a minute.

148
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:30,636
Please, I feel we have to investigate this further.

149
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:33,036
Do you mean you don't trust our surveillance?

150
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,051
There's also the matter of C.C.

151
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:38,303
Continue playing his little brother
just the way you have been.

152
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:40,558
All right, my lord.

153
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,457
It seems the student council is
planning to throw you a welcoming party.

154
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:46,424
Please reconfirm his state then.

155
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:48,032
Yes, understood.

156
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:49,955
What should I do?

157
00:07:49,997 --> 00:07:52,176
Do I dare trust Lelouch?

158
00:07:54,099 --> 00:08:00,130
Teacher, could you please overlook all the
campus infractions that Rolo and I are involved in?

159
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,455
Very well. I can do that.

160
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,711
Just don't wander off school grounds so often, you two.

161
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:14,243
Yes, sir.

162
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,974
The only member left now is Ms. Villetta, right?

163
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:20,066
Correct. But Suzaku Kururugi is here now.

164
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:21,038
Shall I kill him?

165
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:23,128
You shouldn't behave like that.

166
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,618
Oh, and something else...

167
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:25,369
Yes?

168
00:08:25,394 --> 00:08:28,101
Can you quit speaking to me in such a formal manner?

169
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:30,307
After all, we are supposed to be brothers.

170
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:31,124
Uh!

171
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:32,186
Don't worry.

172
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:34,949
I'll hurry up with my plan for your sake, as well.

173
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:38,841
I am going to do it. Independence for Japan,

174
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,918
will begin with this school.

175
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:43,718
Iwate.

176
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,507
Wakayama.

177
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,291
Tokushima.

178
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:49,713
There are reports from Yamaguchi, too.

179
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:53,728
Zero makes an appearance again, and now we get this!

180
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:56,503
It may be an effect of Lord Guilford's absence, too.

181
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:59,995
If this keeps up, our Sakuradite supply will also be...

182
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,868
Emergency! Unknown M.R.F. within the perimeter!

183
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:03,576
What is it?!

184
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:07,505
No way! This government bureau controls all of Area 11!

185
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:09,965
Getting in here couldn't have been easier!

186
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,324
These guys are almost annoyingly sloppy!

187
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:16,320
Is this the best line of defense
that Area 11's got to offer?

188
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,386
Uh-huh. Perhaps I was being a bit hasty.

189
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:32,297
Oh?

190
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,197
I don't know who you are, but this ends right here!

191
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:41,539
Pitiful. That armament shows you
care more about protecting the building.

192
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:43,270
Oh well, too bad.

193
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,359
What?!

194
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:49,699
That Knightmare! Could it be the one?!

195
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:59,840
I see, that's what we're dealing with.

196
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:03,191
The variable Knightmare Frame, Tristan.

197
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:05,366
Which makes you Lord Gino Weinberg,

198
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:07,813
the Knight of Three. Am I correct?

199
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:10,678
You are. I'm putting you guys to the test.

200
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:13,230
Alright! Try and stop me!

201
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:15,643
Very well. We accept your challenge!!

202
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:18,080
We can't allow this insult to us go unanswered!

203
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,409
Don't hold back. Gimme your best shot.

204
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:21,772
As you wish!

205
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:23,084
Thank you!

206
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:27,253
Why, you...!

207
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:28,361
Stop it!

208
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:32,874
That's enough! The battle's been decided!

209
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:36,524
Then, Sir Kururugi, is that the
final decision of the Knight of Seven?

210
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:37,447
It is.

211
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:40,393
Hey, Suzaku!

212
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:43,815
Gino, I thought I asked you to bring Lancelot here for me.

213
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,215
Yeah, but Earl Asplund is coming with it next week.

214
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,593
And not to change the subject,
but what's with that outfit?

215
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:51,326
I came straight here from school. It's required.

216
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,120
Very fashionable!

217
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:55,339
Gino, I know you're from a great, noble family,

218
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,114
but can't you act more normal?

219
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,222
By the way, you're amazingly heavy.

220
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:00,841
Is it over?

221
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:04,999
The Mordred? Anya came along, too?

222
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:06,080
Is it over?

223
00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:08,509
Yup. Suzaku made me end it.

224
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,068
Ohh...

225
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:13,330
How dull.

226
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:17,043
We should have more than
enough firepower assembled by now.

227
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:20,482
Lelouch, three days from now, at the welcome party,

228
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:22,397
everything will be made clear.

229
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,597
Apologies for the delay!

230
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:34,284
We are now officially kicking off
the welcome party for the Knight of Seven!

231
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,892
Give the word, guest of honor.

232
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:38,651
Yeah, um... I don't suppose I can refuse?

233
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:41,426
Sorry, nope! It's a presidential order!

234
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,676
Just accept it. She sets the rules in this school.

235
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:46,243
Hmph. All right, guys.

236
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:47,766
I'll get ready, then.

237
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,907
Meow!

238
00:11:57,575 --> 00:11:59,951
This way to the horseback riding course!

239
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:02,980
Lelouch, are these things appropriate for the occasion?

240
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,880
That's Milly for ya. The Prez loves events like this.

241
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,116
She's also overcompensating for last year.

242
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,141
Oh?

243
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:13,930
What should I do now? I ought to just...

244
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:14,621
Rolo.

245
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:15,586
Huh?

246
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,468
I've told you, that's dangerous.

247
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:19,907
Here, hold your knife like this. Got it?

248
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:21,718
L-Like this?

249
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,533
Careful of your fingers.

250
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:24,517
Mm.

251
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,695
Lelouch...

252
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,491
Hm?

253
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:37,682
The truth is... my Geass does have an Achilles heel.

254
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:42,620
Wow, would you look at that! Hey Anya, check it out!

255
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,609
Recorded.

256
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:48,334
You sure love that stuff, huh? All right, so now what?

257
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,378
There's nothing in particular to do here.

258
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,030
Shall we take a tour of where the commoners go to school?

259
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:54,255
I'm here now.

260
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,239
In the storehouse under the school.

261
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:58,816
Okay, so where are those spare energy fillers?

262
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:02,228
Hm? Hey, didn't these belong to Nina?

263
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:04,347
All right. Understood.

264
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:07,586
Go through cell F in Kyushu
and make contact with Diethard.

265
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:10,782
Yes, that's right. Have Rakshata come here and...

266
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:12,874
She wouldn't!

267
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,526
Come and watch us make the world's biggest pizza pie!

268
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:17,159
Do you have information about it?

269
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:19,018
Of course! Here's a flyer for you!

270
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:20,949
Come see the world's biggest pizza!

271
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:23,934
Hey! What do you think... you're doing?

272
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,130
I'm looking for something I left behind.

273
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:28,614
Why are you so obsessed with this stuff anyway?

274
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,974
Come on!

275
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:33,447
Acting a little devilish aren't you?

276
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:34,668
Shut up, witch!

277
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:36,651
Don't you understand your situation?

278
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:38,763
The emperor is trying to capture me.

279
00:13:38,788 --> 00:13:40,330
And he's using you as bait.

280
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:42,726
That's right. Suzaku's here.

281
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:46,634
As well as another. A woman I can't use my Geass on.

282
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:49,915
From pretty girls...

283
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,949
To sexy grownup women!

284
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:54,009
Welcome to the Swim Club Café,

285
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,409
where you get exactly what you want!

286
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:02,045
Oh, I'm so glad the coach agreed to do this for us!

287
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,493
So help me, Shirley,

288
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:05,657
you'll die a thousand deaths for this!

289
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:08,336
If I didn't have to play teacher for my mission, I'd...!

290
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,840
I used to be a schoolteacher,

291
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:11,988
so I was feeling a little nostalgic.

292
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:14,580
They've confirmed that the Guren Mark-2 is there.

293
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,818
I assume Kallen is in the consulate building.

294
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:19,259
I see. It's hard to judge her.

295
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,351
They call themselves "resistance fighters," but still...

296
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,661
Nina's doing quite well.

297
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:27,061
She just presented a thesis at the Science Academy.

298
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:29,403
I wonder if she's planning to perfect the Ganymede.

299
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:30,293
Don't know.

300
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:33,086
Unlike Lloyd and Cecile, Nina's specialty is...

301
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:34,032
Uh?

302
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,016
Um, has Earl Asplund happened to mention me?

303
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:40,308
Afraid not.

304
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,065
Maybe he was overwhelmed?

305
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,625
The wedding was put off because I had to repeat school.

306
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,843
The thing with him is...

307
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:48,491
So many things are wrong with him as a human being,

308
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,445
so...Uh! What the...?

309
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,328
Arthur! That was Euphie's!

310
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:55,409
Suzaku!

311
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,549
You're the guest of honor! You have to wait here!

312
00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:58,830
You can't run off like that!

313
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,176
What have we here?

314
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:03,076
They're using a Knightmare to create a giant pizza?!

315
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:07,330
So, the person who gave the emperor his Geass

316
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:09,882
is the same person who told Suzaku?

317
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,399
That's right.

318
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,818
But you shouldn't delve into it any further.

319
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:15,907
I'm already involved in this.

320
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,322
V.V.

321
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,953
V.V.?

322
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,033
Did he give Suzaku a Geass power?

323
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:26,517
No, it doesn't appear that he did.

324
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,151
Aanyway, about Villetta...

325
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:29,145
Lulu!

326
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:29,961
Uh?

327
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:31,690
What's up, Shirley?

328
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,380
Hm? Oh, there you are.

329
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:36,736
Do you need something?

330
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,878
Well, I have a little problem
that I hope you can help me with.

331
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:41,688
Ms. Villetta seems to be avoiding me,

332
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:44,340
so I was thinking you should... Huh? You're alone?

333
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:45,374
Yeah.

334
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:47,809
I could've sworn you were talking to someone just now.

335
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:51,138
Nope. We're the only ones here, just the two of us.

336
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:52,918
Hm?

337
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:55,524
Just the two of us? What awful timing,

338
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:58,178
but this might be my best chance to tell him how I feel.

339
00:15:58,203 --> 00:16:00,857
Listen, um, Lulu. Would you go out...

340
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,449
Sorry, but I couldn't quite catch that.

341
00:16:06,474 --> 00:16:08,503
Hey! What's the big idea?!

342
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,711
What are you doing?!

343
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,170
If someone spots you, as well...

344
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:13,862
Don't worry! I'm came here to take Pizza Girl back!

345
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:16,197
Fine. She's in with the tomatoes.

346
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:17,264
Take the whole container,

347
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:19,118
then have Tohdoh or Ohgi command the...

348
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:23,082
Who's in there being so rude!

349
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,076
How undignified!

350
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,018
Will you quit standing there and say something!

351
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:30,774
If I say something, she'll find out who I am!

352
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,965
Ugh! Hey, wait!

353
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:35,636
Shirley! Be careful with that!

354
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,891
Hey, Lelouch!

355
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,528
Say, have you seen Arthur?!

356
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:41,193
He grabbed a valuable quill pen from me, and...

357
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:42,195
Uh!

358
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:45,359
Oh no, is he inside this thing?!

359
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:48,036
No! Cats and tomatoes don't mix!

360
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,805
You're supposed to start with this, right?

361
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,747
It can't be... Gino?!

362
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:58,411
Yeah! This commoner school is really a blast!

363
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:00,616
Hey! Wait!

364
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:02,707
Hey!

365
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:04,140
Hm?

366
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,784
Was that Arthur?

367
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:12,509
Now we'll have to change the schedule.

368
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,963
It looks like it's coming out onto the parade route now!

369
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:18,568
They'll be marched around the school
building first, then make their way down here!

370
00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:21,699
Even though it's a vintage Knightmare, it's handling well.

371
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:24,066
Okay, the route's all set, so...

372
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:25,813
Shake time!

373
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:28,776
What a mess!

374
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,370
He's taking her straight to the stage!

375
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:32,576
Let me at least see who you are!

376
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:35,216
Huh?

377
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,095
I'm not cut out for this sort of thing.

378
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:44,136
Release the hounds!

379
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,816
Over there!

380
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:51,001
The Knight of Seven, Suzaku Kururugi!

381
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:54,526
He's arrived, along with our
Andes-grown Ultimate Tomatoes!

382
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:56,063
Suzaku, come on over!

383
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:58,707
You're the one we've been waiting for!

384
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:00,578
Uh. Except that...

385
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:02,924
There's a different person piloting!

386
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,151
Ah! Whoa!

387
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,955
Team Leader 1! Turn around, and look up at me!

388
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:11,032
Yes, what is it, Vice President?

389
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,732
Employ system pattern rouge!

390
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:20,774
Now going to system pattern rouge.

391
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,599
Release fire-extinguishing gas.

392
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:23,957
Initiating.

393
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,301
What's the matter?

394
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:35,470
Is it really that much of a surprise?

395
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:37,959
What the hell's going on here?! Ugh!

396
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,661
Sorry. Are you okay?

397
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,911
Uh, oh no, it was my fault.

398
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:44,007
Ah!

399
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,378
That was...

400
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:46,236
Huh?

401
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:49,307
Recorded. Thank you, Miss.

402
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:51,403
No problem. You're welcome.

403
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,103
Oh, Arthur.

404
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,701
Well, sometimes you just get
these little filler incidents in life.

405
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:58,634
And that's fine!

406
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,591
So then?

407
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,699
The person who saw you was from the Swim Club?

408
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,520
I think it may have been the teacher.

409
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:05,316
Villetta?!

410
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:06,841
I didn't get her name.

411
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:09,993
But the weird thing is that I think I remember seeing her

412
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:11,895
at the festival last year with Ohgi.

413
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,462
Ohgi and Villetta?

414
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,830
Minami said that Ohgi might have had a collaborator

415
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,709
who reported directly to him.

416
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:20,651
Ohgi kept... a secret from me?

417
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:22,480
When it comes to these sorts of things,

418
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:24,149
you're really very thick.

419
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,709
The truth is...

420
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:30,426
That's it, Rolo? You've turned traitor?

421
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:31,724
Villetta Nu.

422
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:36,265
The woman who was awarded the
rank of baron for ascertaining Zero's real identity.

423
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:39,059
But unknown to most,
you're connected to the Black Knights.

424
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:40,693
Not true! I never betrayed...

425
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:42,307
Kaname Ohgi.

426
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,374
If word of your relationship with him ever got out,

427
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:48,691
you'd have to relinquish that
title you worked so hard to earn.

428
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:51,034
Why not be reborn as someone new?

429
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,759
Oh, yes. Shirley gave me this to give to you,

430
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:55,993
so the timing works out nicely.

431
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:01,180
Happy birthday, Coach Villetta.

432
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:07,325
It seems I owe you another debt.

433
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,970
I simply used my diplomatic immunity.

434
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:13,638
Besides, I'd like to repay
my debt to you as quick as I can.

435
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:16,288
Then, may I ask another favor of you?

436
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,524
I don't like to be in collusion with you.

437
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:21,682
I'd like to get in contact with the High Eunuchs.

438
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,916
The only one left to defeat is Suzaku.

439
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:27,866
Lelouch?

440
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:28,720
Mm?

441
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,576
Shouldn't the guest of honor be at the main stage?

442
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:33,018
Hm? No.

443
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:35,845
Everyone seems to be having a fine time without me.

444
00:20:47,124 --> 00:20:49,624
Besides, I want to discuss something with you.

445
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:50,812
What is it?

446
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:53,145
Well you see...

447
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,336
I'm aspiring to become the Knight of One.

448
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,758
Whoa! That's the greatest knight in the entire empire...

449
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:02,280
The Knight of One is bestowed the privilege
of choosing one of the Britannian Areas for his own.

450
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:06,558
I intend to have Japan. I'll take this area for myself.

451
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:13,274
Lelouch, I've lost too much;

452
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:16,805
Precious friends and a woman who no one can ever replace.

453
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:18,555
By acquiring power,

454
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:21,566
I will never again lose anyone else I care about.

455
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:25,228
And then, the Japanese people won't need Zero any more.

456
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:27,378
Hm? Indirect rule, huh?

457
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:28,964
You wanna make it a protectorate?

458
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:31,579
You can ask this person. They'll know.

459
00:21:31,612 --> 00:21:32,051
Huh?

460
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:35,762
The new viceroy who's coming
to take charge of Area 11 next week.

461
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,160
You think a student should speak to the viceroy?

462
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:39,508
It's Kururugi.

463
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,332
Yes. He's standing right here in front of me.

464
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:43,530
Yes.

465
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:46,408
What do I say? How awkward.

466
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,225
This is such an important person.

467
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:50,380
Hello? Big Brother?

468
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,108
Lelouch, is that you?!

469
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:55,278
It's me! Nunnally! Can you hear me?

470
00:21:55,303 --> 00:21:57,543
I'm coming there to be the viceroy!

471
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:00,133
Um, is there something wrong?

472
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:02,791
Lelouch, it's Nunnally. Your sister.

473
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:40,932
At this very moment, Nunnally is
on the other end of the phone.

474
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:44,749
Does she know that I'm Zero? No, I doubt it.

475
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:48,116
Then this must be a trick
Suzaku is perpetrating against me.

476
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:50,307
Because if I respond to my little sister,

477
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:52,513
he'll know that my memories have returned.

478
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:54,733
He's using Nunnally to trap me!

479
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,220
Nunnally! Suzaku!

480
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,204
No matter how he wears the face of a friend,

481
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,095
his true face is that of the fiend
who sold me to the emperor!

482
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:05,204
There mere thought that he's been at my sister's side!
