1
00:00:06,418 --> 00:00:08,084
You woke up too soon.

2
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,026
Uh... Huh?

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,464
C.C.!

4
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,540
What exactly are you doing here?

5
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:17,125
Somehow, I get the feeling that
you didn't come to help out Charles.

6
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:19,142
Anya... What are you...?

7
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,901
Well, at the moment, I'm the
mother of Lelouch and Nunnally.

8
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:23,362
I am Marianne.

9
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:02,295
Yeah.

10
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:06,764
I'm about to apprise Lady Kaguya and
General Commander Xing-ke of the situation.

11
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:09,170
I don't know if they're going to understand or not.

12
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,266
But clearly, there's one thing to do.

13
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,458
Yeah, I know.

14
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:16,218
Which is... we gotta make sure that Zero is dead.

15
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:18,782
I need to find out for sure.

16
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,119
From Lelouch.

17
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:24,936
Otherwise... I'll never... I'll never be able to move on.

18
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:26,039
So...

19
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,998
...since we have plenty of time now...

20
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:29,735
Will you answer me?

21
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,885
Who was it that killed my mother?

22
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,556
And what's your excuse for not protecting her?

23
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:37,787
How ironic. Here you are, seeking the truth.

24
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:41,670
You, who made it this far only
by your deception and your lies.

25
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,861
That's true.

26
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:44,976
I've lied every step of the way.

27
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:47,268
And not just about my name and past.

28
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,418
I've hidden my true intentions, too.

29
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:51,360
But that's pragmatism, isn't it?

30
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:53,553
People need to play along with each other.

31
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:55,496
We melt into a place.

32
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:58,086
If we didn't, then nations and people...

33
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,027
...these things called "communities" wouldn't exist.

34
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:03,093
Everyone uses lies.

35
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:07,187
On family. On friends. In society.

36
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:10,171
And everyone wears a different face.

37
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,033
But... is that a sin?

38
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,560
What is one's true face?

39
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,434
Even you wear a mask... That of an emperor.

40
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,685
None of us can make a move now
without our respective personas.

41
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,043
You're wrong.

42
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,025
Hm?

43
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,704
When we realize that lies have no
meaning in the endlessness of eternity,

44
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:32,891
those personas will vanish.

45
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:36,879
When we understand each other, conflict will disappear.

46
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:39,715
That all sounds like metaphysical nonsense to me.

47
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,901
It will soon be reality.

48
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,433
You see, this is my Ragnarock Connection.

49
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:51,501
Soon, these masks known as deceit
will be discarded by the world, revealing the truth.

50
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,552
Cs' world?

51
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:56,778
In current terminology, it's the collective unconscious.

52
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,455
A collective of peoples' minds with memories.

53
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,482
The sea of transmigration. The great consciousness.

54
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:04,190
Some refer to it as "God."

55
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:06,715
Was that what I saw when we met at Narita?

56
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,615
There, it was mixed with your personal consciousness.

57
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,356
I'm merely guessing, as I don't know what it was you saw.

58
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:13,840
How irresponsible.

59
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,881
Do you like having others peep into your mind?

60
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:17,819
It's people.

61
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:20,254
They're masks are the collective unconsciousness.

62
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,276
Windows that open into their minds and memories.

63
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:24,491
And the minds of people are...

64
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:27,318
Oh, forget it. It's too messed up for me to do.

65
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:28,718
C.C., could you please?

66
00:04:28,743 --> 00:04:30,650
Do you really plan to go in?

67
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:31,967
Yes, of course!

68
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:34,451
Charles has been waiting for us, after all.

69
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:38,363
This would have been so easy
if you'd only given him your Code.

70
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:42,775
Oh... I'll go first, all right?

71
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:51,225
What are you doing?!

72
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:57,074
You know, Suzaku...

73
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:59,898
You and I... we're very similar.

74
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:01,090
Similar?

75
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:04,630
In the way that we both wish
to die and yet are unable to.

76
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,755
Hm? Prince Schneizel...

77
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,587
...and the Black Knights?!

78
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:11,807
Stay alive, Lelouch!

79
00:05:11,832 --> 00:05:15,398
I've got an important question
that I still want to ask you!

80
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:18,407
Wha...?! It can't be!

81
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:20,763
My, Lelouch! How you've grown!

82
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,940
M-Mother?!

83
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:24,946
Marianne, I see you've come.

84
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:27,565
Is this an illusion?! You'd do this?!

85
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,522
No.

86
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:30,338
It really is me, Lelouch.

87
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,893
However, I can only take on my original appearance

88
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:34,728
while I'm present within this system.

89
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:36,087
It really is...?

90
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:39,556
Lelouch, I will now answer your previous question.

91
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,850
Tch!

92
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:45,654
Half a century ago, my elder
brother and I existed in a hell on Earth.

93
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,096
Our family was just rivals competing for the throne.

94
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:51,712
Assassinations occurred with regularity.

95
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:54,819
Daily betrayals spawned by lies.

96
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:56,519
Killing each other off.

97
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:59,294
My own mother fell victim to it.

98
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:02,577
My brother and I were sickened and angered by the world.

99
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:04,772
We therefore both swore an oath.

100
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:07,447
To create a world without lies.

101
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:10,252
Both C.C. and I agreed to this as well.

102
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,337
V.V., however...

103
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,225
What did you call me for today?

104
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:17,081
I've cleared everyone out of here.

105
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:19,148
I even had Cornelia withdraw.

106
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,705
Sorry to do this.

107
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,668
Especially without Charles around.

108
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:24,785
Is this about the sword of Akasha?

109
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,794
Hm? Oh, no. This is only about Charles.

110
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:31,644
Ever since he met you, Charles
has been acting like a different man.

111
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:35,703
It seems to me that you and he have
come to enjoy learning more about one another.

112
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,797
You realize that, if this continues,

113
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:40,155
the contract we made will never be fulfilled.

114
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,582
I'll be left alone.

115
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:42,201
Hm?

116
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:44,074
From the beginning of time,

117
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:47,188
it's always been the woman who's lead the man astray.

118
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:49,145
Lady Marianne.

119
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,838
I told you to stay out of here!

120
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:57,981
The job is done.

121
00:06:58,065 --> 00:07:00,065
Right. Begin the cover-up.

122
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,825
Maybe we can make Nunnally out to be the witness.

123
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,622
It's imperative that this looks
like it was the work of terrorists.

124
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:08,544
Anya Alstreim...

125
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:12,899
The young girl who had arrived
a week earlier to be schooled in etiquette.

126
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:22,986
My Geass power was to cross
over into another person's mind.

127
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,552
The power that had been dormant for so long,

128
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:32,541
activated for the first time as I was dying.

129
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:36,677
I hid inside Anya to save myself from being killed by V.V.

130
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:38,118
And then, I realized.

131
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:40,560
Realized that when my consciousness surfaced,

132
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,626
I could communicate mind-to-mind with C.C...

133
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:45,261
When she discovered the truth,

134
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:47,786
C.C. left the directorship to V.V.,

135
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:49,475
and then disappeared.

136
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,957
I spoke with my brother about it, however...

137
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:57,186
I heard. What a tragedy. I shall miss Marianne.

138
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,504
My brother lied to me!

139
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:03,652
After we had sworn to create a world without deceit!

140
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,302
Agh! How dare you!

141
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:08,036
Don't try to pass off blame for everything on the dead!

142
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:09,410
Nunnally and I!

143
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:11,329
You sent us to Japan as hostages!

144
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:12,621
It was necessary!

145
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:14,187
Necessary for what?!

146
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:16,087
What kind of parent does that?!

147
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:20,454
If you have someone you don't want
to lose, you should keep them at a distance.

148
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:26,294
Milly! Uh, when the sun rises, I wanna
get a shot with ground zero in the background.

149
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,725
Okay, gotcha.

150
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,797
Sorry about this. Relief will be here from
Niigata and Nagoya by afternoon, so hang tight.

151
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:34,343
I'm okay.

152
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:44,822
Right now, we're suppressing the
rebel forces with the aid of the Black Knights.

153
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:45,931
However...

154
00:08:45,956 --> 00:08:48,003
Hm? Is there something else?

155
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,865
Prince Schneizel... Just how much do you know?

156
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:54,046
How frightening! What are you referring to?

157
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,653
I used Lelouch.

158
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:01,008
I was fully aware of the truth the entire time.

159
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,480
In order to bring about my own death,

160
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:06,214
I had to make his survival a priority.

161
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,781
Any regrets?

162
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:08,791
Not really.

163
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:12,144
My sensibilities are quite different as an immortal witch.

164
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:15,085
I abandoned my humanity long ago.

165
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,393
We aren't all alike, you know.

166
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:18,253
Huh?

167
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:21,765
C.C., I want you to send me to the other world.

168
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,926
Regardless that you may think I'm foolish,

169
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:25,743
I can't wait here and do nothing!

170
00:09:25,768 --> 00:09:26,922
That's right.

171
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:31,184
I sent both you and your sister
to Japan to escape my brother's sight.

172
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:35,280
That's also why I had Marianne's body secretly taken away.

173
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:37,443
As long as my body still exists,

174
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:40,410
there's the possibility that I'll be able to return to it.

175
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:42,976
Anya and Nunnally became witnesses.

176
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:45,764
Therefore, it was necessary to rewrite their memories

177
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,628
in order to protect everything.

178
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,762
Nunnally?!

179
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:52,247
You mean her blindness
isn't psychosomatic after all, but...!

180
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,897
Even though she was a false witness,

181
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:56,745
there remained a very real danger she would be killed.

182
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,782
To ensure Nunnally's safety,

183
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,057
proof was needed that would lead far away from the truth.

184
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:05,120
The original plan called for only one immortal Code.

185
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:06,953
However, for research to progress,

186
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:08,895
we had to have an additional Code.

187
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:10,635
In other words, without C.C.,

188
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,869
we didn't have a 100% guarantee that it would succeed.

189
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:17,151
When Marianne was unable to persuade C.C. to help us,

190
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:19,053
we were left with no choice.

191
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,241
We were forced to use you, Lelouch.

192
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:24,237
Then... What was the point of me doing this?

193
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:26,845
These tragedies will no longer be necessary

194
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,454
once the Ragnarock Connection is established.

195
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,187
Masks will vanish.

196
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:33,920
Then everyone can be exactly who they're supposed to be.

197
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:35,272
I see...

198
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:39,241
All the battle and bloodshed
between Britannia and the Black Knights

199
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,314
was done just to lure out C.C...

200
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,916
Well then, it seems that from the
very beginning, I was merely a nuisance.

201
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:48,151
Just a ruckus in the world.

202
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,396
And, what do you two think of all this?

203
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:55,216
Did you already know that
I was going to come here, Lelouch?

204
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,572
And that you regained your memories, too.

205
00:10:57,692 --> 00:11:00,067
It was necessary for this plan, wasn't it?

206
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:01,300
Precisely.

207
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:05,532
Therefore, I cannot see any sense
in your coming here as well, Kururugi.

208
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,251
I'm sure you can't.

209
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,468
I heard you were already immortal.

210
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:12,368
That's why there's something I want to know for certain.

211
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:15,149
Why did you make this thing? For what reason?

212
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:16,212
Why?

213
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:19,832
Because it's what Nunnally and Euphy both desired.

214
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:21,995
They wanted a gentle world.

215
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:24,576
Now I see. It's obvious.

216
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,926
The time is here.

217
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,185
C.C., since we are all assembled,

218
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,101
the plan can commence now.

219
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:34,289
I will grant your wish after
everything has been completed.

220
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,997
What the...?

221
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:00,843
Where am I?

222
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:02,301
All over the world?

223
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:02,861
Yes.

224
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:03,993
Bismarck?

225
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:06,903
It must be His Majesty's plan coming to fruition.

226
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:09,680
If His Majesty succeeds in carrying out his vision,

227
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:14,231
then whatever is left of the world
will be yours to govern, per his royal decree.

228
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,609
Although...

229
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,876
The sense of politics will have changed greatly.

230
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,176
Behold! It's begun!

231
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:37,426
The Sword of Akasha is slaying God!

232
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:41,959
Now... Once our marks of Geass become one,

233
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:45,784
the old world will cease and
the new world will spring forth!

234
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:46,813
Lelouch.

235
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,250
What was your motivation for wanting to control the world?

236
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:53,270
Don't waste my time, Suzaku. You know it was Nunnally.

237
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:56,097
Or are you just using her as your excuse?

238
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:58,417
Yes, you're right.

239
00:12:58,442 --> 00:12:59,343
I am.

240
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:02,799
I have fought to protect everything
I thought I wanted to protect.

241
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:04,661
If you're going to achieve that end,

242
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,349
you need to take action.

243
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:07,207
Yes.

244
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:10,324
The means to that end requires me to reject something.

245
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:11,480
Which is...?

246
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:13,130
That... I...

247
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:13,905
Hm?

248
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,471
I reject you!

249
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,974
And I reject everything you believe!

250
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:19,522
Why do people lie?

251
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:22,203
It isn't only because they struggle against each other.

252
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:24,890
It's also because there's something that they're seeking!

253
00:13:24,915 --> 00:13:25,536
Ah...

254
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:29,220
You now want a world without change. How stagnant!

255
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,082
You could hardly call it life!

256
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,209
The same as a world of memories!

257
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:35,809
Just a world that's closed and completed!

258
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,874
That's a place I wouldn't wanna live in!

259
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,188
But, Lelouch...

260
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:41,540
Are you saying you're rejecting me, as well?

261
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:42,418
That depends.

262
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:45,251
Is your desire the same as His Majesty's, Mother?

263
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:49,565
It will be so good to rejoin all the people
from whom we've been separated.

264
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:51,903
You can be reunited with those who have died.

265
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:53,661
Even Euphemia.

266
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,613
As I expected.

267
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:01,493
You both believe that this new world
you envision will be best for all.

268
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:05,272
But forcing your good intentions
on others is no different from an evil act!

269
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:07,778
In time, the people will come to accept it.

270
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,670
That time will never come!

271
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,476
Only one thing is undeniably certain.

272
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:15,038
I understand now that what you did to Nunnally and me

273
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,984
may have been done out of good intentions. But...

274
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,251
The hard fact remains that
you abandoned us in a foreign land!

275
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:22,582
But we did that to protect you!

276
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:25,730
Then why didn't you stop the war
between Japan and Britannia?!

277
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,709
The plan was such a priority for you both,

278
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:34,203
that it didn't matter to either of you
if Nunnally and I were alive or dead.

279
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,820
That's why you abandoned us!

280
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:37,853
All you have left are self-serving excuses!

281
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,243
Lelouch, you're wrong!

282
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:40,685
You just told me!

283
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,805
You said that the dead will rejoin the living!

284
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,786
You don't give a damn about the future!

285
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:47,436
The future is the Ragnarok Connection!

286
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:50,040
Once it's finally done, the gentler existence

287
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:51,440
that Nunnally spoke of will...!

288
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:52,397
Stop it!

289
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:55,858
The world you're speaking of will
be kinder and gentler only for you!

290
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:57,841
The world that my sister wished for

291
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:00,184
is one in which kindness is extended to everyone,

292
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,667
even strangers.

293
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,003
He may be right.

294
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:07,663
At the very least, Euphy never said
that Lelouch was Zero, even to the very end.

295
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:10,257
Shirley didn't either! That's why I...!

296
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:12,390
Let's say it was true. What of it?

297
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:13,932
There's nothing to be done about it.

298
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:15,938
The Ragnarok Connection has begun!

299
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:17,463
You think so?

300
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:19,238
I am Zero!

301
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,119
The man who works miracles!

302
00:15:21,144 --> 00:15:23,742
Your Geass power will have no effect on me!

303
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,421
Nor will it on anyone else here!

304
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,221
No.

305
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:28,080
There's someone else here, isn't there?

306
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:29,444
Huh?

307
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:30,461
That's right!

308
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:32,910
Cs' World is the will of mankind itself!

309
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:35,643
And all men are not equal! Remember those words?

310
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,315
They're your own! And because of that,

311
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,967
I'm sure you realize that my power will work!

312
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:42,913
You're a fool, Lelouch!

313
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:45,682
God cannot be defeated by the power of the king!

314
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:47,499
I don't intend to defeat God!

315
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:52,108
This is a request! Yes! Now I know who I really am!

316
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,217
God!

317
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:55,103
Collective unconscious!

318
00:15:57,842 --> 00:16:00,426
Please, don't stop the march of time!

319
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:02,973
Lelouch, you ungrateful child...Agh!

320
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:04,628
Nobody would have wanted this!

321
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:06,638
No one! And especially not Euphy!

322
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:09,209
And I saved you so that you could talk to Euphy again!

323
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,069
Meaning you were going to force me to, right?!

324
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:12,886
You can't do this, boy!

325
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:15,761
Not against God, nor all of humanity itself!

326
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:17,898
Regardless, what I want...

327
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,390
...is tomorrow!

328
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,625
It can't be!

329
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:31,180
The Thought Elevator is falling!

330
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:33,600
The dream that I... and Marianne...

331
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,573
...and my brother all shared...

332
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,931
Charles, just stop already.

333
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:40,675
It was presumptuous of us to even attempt this.

334
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,859
C.C.! We still bear the marks of Geass!

335
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:44,759
No matter what occurs, we...

336
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:48,255
This isn't a falsehood, Father.

337
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,371
It's reality's response.

338
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:51,946
Darling?! You...!

339
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,192
No! It's not possible!

340
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:56,092
I'm supposed to be immortal!

341
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:59,533
We're being absorbed? Consumed by Cs' World?!

342
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:01,141
But what about C.C.?!

343
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:03,417
Why isn't she disappearing, as well?!

344
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,609
You supported this plan as much as we did!

345
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:08,259
Sorry. But I finally realized.

346
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:11,134
The love you have is only for yourselves.

347
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:14,009
No, that's not true at all!
We love our children very much!

348
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,765
You have any idea what the meaning is

349
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,790
behind Nunnally's beautiful smile?

350
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,471
Ah... The meaning?

351
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,661
Why don't you understand?!

352
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:25,353
Nunnally was blinded! My own sister was crippled!

353
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:27,001
She knew!

354
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:28,561
She knew that there were things in this world

355
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:30,944
that she would never be able to do by herself!

356
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:32,910
So her smile...

357
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,742
Nunnally's smile...

358
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,867
...was her way of expressing gratitude!

359
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:38,809
You're laboring under a delusion!

360
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:41,263
I will not let you call that a lie!

361
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,403
Over my dead body!

362
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:45,686
Your refusal to face reality!

363
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:48,075
Content to watch us from afar!

364
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:49,951
Don't make me laugh!

365
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:51,710
There's only one truth here!

366
00:17:51,818 --> 00:17:55,110
You, my own parents... You abandoned us!

367
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:59,721
You clever little fool...!

368
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:01,430
Suzaku!

369
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:02,678
Stay out of this!

370
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:05,555
Can't you understand that
If you refuse me and what I offer,

371
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,057
you will inherit his world!

372
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:08,363
Schneizel's world!

373
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,453
Do not judge me!

374
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:12,500
Good and evil intentions are
on each side of the same card!

375
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:14,067
Even then, you still have...

376
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:18,149
No matter what, I'll always reject the world you envision.

377
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,825
Be gone now!

378
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,263
It can't be!

379
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:29,967
Can I assume that...?

380
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,051
Yes. His Majesty has now been...!

381
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:38,613
C.C... are you going, as well?

382
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,151
When death comes, you want to at least be smiling, right?

383
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:44,512
And, you two?

384
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:46,363
What are you planning to do now?

385
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:47,192
Huh?

386
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:49,614
You rejected Charles' plan.

387
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:53,809
Instead, you chose reality and the forward march of time.

388
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:54,907
However...

389
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,103
I know.

390
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:58,309
Lelouch is the person who murdered Euphy.

391
00:18:58,334 --> 00:18:59,834
What of it?

392
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:08,953
It has been one month since the
destruction caused by the F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

393
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,959
Today, His Majesty Emperor Charles

394
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,378
will make an important announcement to the entire nation.

395
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:17,932
We will be bringing you live international
coverage of this from Pendragon imperial palace.

396
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:22,274
Even though His Majesty has not made
any public appearances in the past month...

397
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:24,871
Didn't somebody say that the emperor was missing?

398
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:28,032
Bismarck was the one who reported that, and now he's gone.

399
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:30,350
As for Schneizel and the others, where are they?

400
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,321
Don't know.

401
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:33,086
There's been no word from Cambodia yet.

402
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:35,788
Presenting his Imperial Majesty!

403
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:42,740
Hm?!

404
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,015
But that's not...

405
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,665
Where's His Majesty?

406
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:48,117
What the hell?!

407
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:50,738
Wha...?! It can't be!

408
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,311
But how?

409
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,217
There's no way!

410
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:57,038
Greetings.

411
00:19:57,151 --> 00:20:00,044
I am Lelouch vi Britannia of the royal family.

412
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,919
99th emperor of the realm.

413
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:03,138
Good lord.

414
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:04,913
How can this be?!

415
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,592
I-It's really you?!

416
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:07,534
You're alive?

417
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,048
Yes, sister, I am.

418
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:11,531
I've returned from the depths of hell intact.

419
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:13,348
Lelouch, how good to see you!

420
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:17,175
When Nunnally was located, I figured
that you would be found alive, too.

421
00:20:17,268 --> 00:20:20,501
But now, aren't you carrying this joke a bit too far?

422
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,140
That's the throne of our father...

423
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:25,392
Charles zi Britannia, the 98th emperor, no longer lives.

424
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,174
And I'm the one who took his life.

425
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,863
Huh?!

426
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:32,698
Therefore... that makes me the next emperor!

427
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:34,598
What are you saying?! Are you nuts?!

428
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:37,184
Guards, take that fool and execute him!

429
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:39,792
He's guilty of murdering our emperor!

430
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:49,209
Suzaku! But why?!

431
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:52,303
May I introduce... Suzaku Kururugi.

432
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:53,419
My knight.

433
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:56,092
A Knight of the Round above all others.

434
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,015
I grant him the title "Knight of Zero."

435
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:01,948
Suzaku?! They're working together?!

436
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:04,571
Lelouch, Sir Kururugi, this just won't do.

437
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,790
Pulling a bad stunt like this
on an international broadcast!

438
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:09,107
Do you think so?

439
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:12,017
Let me make this easy for you all to understand.

440
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:13,688
Acknowledge me as emperor!

441
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:17,261
Lelouch, I insist that you stop joking around like...

442
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,873
We hear and obey, Your Majesty!

443
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:24,165
All hail Emperor Lelouch!

444
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:37,365
All hail Lelouch! All hail Lelouch!

445
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,182
I need to thank you, Lelouch.

446
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:40,957
Now that you've reappeared on the scene,

447
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:43,399
we no longer have a problem to contend with.

448
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:46,090
But why is Kururugi helping him? What's his reason?

449
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:49,578
He succeeds in furthering himself
by continually betraying others.

450
00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:50,905
Don't be concerned.

451
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,769
Let Lelouch have all of it, because it doesn't matter.

452
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:56,377
He can have Britannia, the whole nation.

453
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:58,565
The question is, what comes next?

454
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,053
Which will control the world?

455
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:03,230
Will it be Lelouch's Geass power? Or will it be...?

456
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,484
There is nothing that is unforgivable.

457
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:42,998
It's only the willingness not to forgive.

458
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:45,742
That was something Shirley once told Suzaku.

459
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,203
And that was the starting point in
the conversation I had with him.

460
00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:51,646
The starting point to face reality.

461
00:23:51,718 --> 00:23:55,519
There is nothing that Suzaku
and I can't accomplish together.

462
00:23:57,344 --> 00:23:59,066
How ironic.

463
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:03,616
I, the one who has perpetually
rejected and denounced Britannia...
