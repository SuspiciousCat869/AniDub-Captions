1
00:00:03,946 --> 00:00:05,594
99th emperor Lelouch,

2
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:07,952
who ascended the throne only a few days ago,

3
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:10,772
has ordered the destruction of the imperial mausoleum

4
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:13,391
which held the remains of past Britannian emperors.

5
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,912
Following his abolition of the aristocracy,

6
00:00:15,937 --> 00:00:17,687
breaking up of plutocratic cliques,

7
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:19,171
and liberation of the Numbers...

8
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:21,685
Odysseus and other royals expressed support

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,876
for the new emperor despite these actions.

10
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:24,338
However...

11
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:26,103
He's just amazing!

12
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:29,128
Does he really intend to completely remake Britannia?

13
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:31,554
Don't you mean "destroy" it?

14
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:35,240
Are we to believe Lelouch really
did hate Britannia, as he claimed?

15
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:38,107
He's eliminating any faction
which could possibly oppose him.

16
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:40,758
Even in the U.F.N., most people are expressing

17
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:42,450
their support for Emperor Lelouch.

18
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,239
I knew he was really on our side;

19
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:45,643
I always said that!

20
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:47,223
Some media people are calling him

21
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:49,822
the knight for justice and hero of the masses.

22
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:52,347
Speaking of media, where's Diethard at?

23
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:53,871
I doubt he's coming back here.

24
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:57,705
You're right. As long as he's with
Cornelia and Schneizel, he'll stay hidden.

25
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,480
So, what's our next move? What do we do now?

26
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:02,038
What do you mean, from now?

27
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,146
Well, but I mean, everything's different;

28
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:05,956
the new emperor is doing good things.

29
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:06,939
He is?

30
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:08,315
No, he isn't.

31
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:10,080
Huh?

32
00:01:10,247 --> 00:01:11,241
It's the truth.

33
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:15,529
Emperor Lelouch has one... no, Zero, has one goal.

34
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:18,652
Lelouch vi Britannia commands each one of you!

35
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:22,135
Be my slaves! Now!

36
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:32,280
Yes, Your Majesty!

37
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:35,966
All hail Lelouch!

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,388
Your Majesty, won't you let me analyze
that power, just a little bit? For science, of course.

39
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:44,608
Do you want to die, Lloyd?

40
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:47,144
You mean, in the traditional sense?

41
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:48,929
Ridiculous.

42
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,055
Jeremiah Gottwald returns from battle,

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,671
to announce that he has vanquished former Earl Rosenkreuz.

44
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:57,876
Well done.

45
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:58,644
Hum.

46
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:01,460
Still, I'm not very popular out there, am I?

47
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:04,191
The nobles are rising up and rebelling everywhere,

48
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:05,385
isn't that true?

49
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,026
People resist when you take away their vested intrests.

50
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:08,931
They fight back.

51
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:11,735
That's why we need to make them fully understand

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,412
how foolish and pathetic it is to
cling to vain pedigrees and past glories.

53
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:53,952
Is this a good thing?

54
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:55,852
Is what a good thing?

55
00:03:58,048 --> 00:03:59,482
Well, you know...

56
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:02,042
The way Prince Schneizel and Princess Cornelia

57
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,768
have disappeared without a trace.

58
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:06,974
This is the legitimate Holy Britannian Empire, isn't it?

59
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,568
Yes, you have a point.

60
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:12,535
And if they know what Suzaku and
the others are actually trying to do here...

61
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,438
I wonder if we've become cogs in a machine,

62
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,272
without even realizing it.

63
00:04:17,297 --> 00:04:18,976
By the way, did you know?

64
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:20,106
What?

65
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,619
Suzaku used to attend school with his Majesty;

66
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,166
they had classes together.

67
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,592
Oh... Milly and Nina's school?

68
00:04:29,797 --> 00:04:31,459
I won't be back until night.

69
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:32,932
Covering something?

70
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:34,599
A conference.

71
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:38,471
To decide if we support His Majesty or Lelouch?

72
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,621
That's part of it.

73
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,675
Area 11... sorry, I mean Japan...

74
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,413
It's about whether or not we
should go back to the homeland now

75
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:47,768
that it's no longer a part of Britannia.

76
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:48,740
And...?

77
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:51,991
Uh, well, even my family isn't nobility any more.

78
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,121
Lelouch is the one who...

79
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:54,187
Stop!

80
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:55,001
Uh?

81
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:58,747
Can we just drop this whole subject
now and talk about something else?

82
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:01,581
Man, I'm hungry. Here, Nina.

83
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:02,751
Sorry, Rivalz.

84
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:04,471
Forget it, forget it.

85
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,654
You shouldn't go out. You're safe here in the school.

86
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:10,245
Thanks a lot.

87
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,909
When I built the F.L.E.I.J.A.,

88
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:15,875
I never in my wildest dreams thought
all those countries would target me.

89
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,139
They're relentless.

90
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:18,224
Mm...

91
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:22,217
So, soon after ascending the throne,

92
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:25,492
the name Emperor Lelouch has become part of history.

93
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:27,922
All because you dismantled Britannian culture.

94
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:29,989
The real work is yet to come.

95
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:32,774
At this moment, I'm about to spill a sea of blood.

96
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,057
Enough blood to wipe away all memory of
princess massacre forever from peoples' minds.

97
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,896
Lelouch, are you saying...?

98
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:43,428
Euphy wasn't the only one. It was Nunnally, too.

99
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:47,213
We've both lost so much. Far, far too much.

100
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:49,407
But, to move forward into the future,

101
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,112
we need to take over the entire world.

102
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,819
Just saying those words makes me laugh.

103
00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:59,265
Yet you're both absolutely
determined to do it, Isn't that right?

104
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,177
Yes. It's for the sake of the Zero Requiem.

105
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:05,927
Yes, Your Majesty.

106
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:10,210
Well then, what will you do about
the problem at hand, Your Majesty?

107
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:13,790
Hm... I took over Britannia to address that, but...

108
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,538
Is it true? About what Schneizel is planning?

109
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,616
Yes. According to the intelligence reports.

110
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:24,490
And, given that the Toromo Agency
in Cambodia has seceded from Britannia.

111
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:25,810
When you add it all up...

112
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:28,954
It leads to one conclusion. There's no choice...

113
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,946
We have to move the plan to the next phase

114
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:34,265
before Schneizel has a chance
to put his plan into action...

115
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,592
Hm?

116
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:38,795
Yes, what is it?

117
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,731
Majesty! It's the Knights of the Round!

118
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:41,802
Huh?

119
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,579
They're approaching, with the Knight of One in the lead!

120
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,230
We can only confirm four of the Rounds among them.

121
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:49,798
They're accompanied by their personal forces!

122
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:53,452
We swore absolute loyalty to Charles zi Britannia!

123
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:56,447
We will never recognize this damned usurper!

124
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,159
An interceptor? But there's only one...

125
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,523
One is enough with Lancelot Albion.

126
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:13,825
I can't track it!

127
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,607
He got me already?!

128
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:20,690
Huh? The Albion?!

129
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:27,731
A 9th generation Knightmare Frame!

130
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,915
It's Suzaku Kururu...

131
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:32,556
Will you wake up, Suzaku?!

132
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:36,607
You can still come back to us!

133
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,067
Come back? You've got it all wrong.

134
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:43,201
If you've sworn true loyalty to Britannia,

135
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:45,495
then it's you who should join our side, Gino.

136
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:48,337
Or... will you stand against Britannia?

137
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:50,372
Huh? Stand against it...?

138
00:07:56,522 --> 00:07:58,646
Suzaku Kururugi!

139
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:02,863
I heard that your goal was to become the Knight of One!

140
00:08:02,888 --> 00:08:05,706
But I am the only Knight of One!

141
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:09,851
And I'll never lose that title to a traitor like you!

142
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:14,102
My title is the Knight of Zero,
and that trumps you, Bismark.

143
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:17,008
An empty title with no honor!

144
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:24,913
We interrupt our programming for this
live broadcast from the Holy Britannian Empire.

145
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,261
That's... the Lancelot!

146
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,025
With energy wings?

147
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:32,225
And it's challenging Bismarck.

148
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,742
How can he know Lancelot's flight path?!

149
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:43,584
My Geass gives me the power to see the future!

150
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:46,855
And again?!

151
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,255
Only once before I used this power

152
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,870
when I battled Lady Marianne!

153
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:57,103
He can predict my moves. But still...

154
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:58,027
Suzaku.

155
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,952
As we planned, this battle
is being broadcast to the world.

156
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:01,655
Right.

157
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,948
For the sake of the Zero Requiem, I must be victorious!

158
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:07,280
And that's why I'm ordering you, to live!

159
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:09,521
Yes, Your Majesty!

160
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:15,089
My name will always be linked with
the title of mightiest knight of the empire!

161
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,132
Wh-What?!

162
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:18,671
What is this?

163
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:21,352
Is it the machine's special functions...

164
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:23,460
...or is it Kururugi's skill?

165
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:26,777
Suzaku, your will power is extraordinary.

166
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,860
Turning my Geass command "to live"

167
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:30,678
into an unexpected weapon.

168
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,316
You've become a warrior like no other.

169
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:37,201
Even though you can predict my moves...

170
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:39,185
If I do this...!

171
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:42,163
Head on?! You insult me!

172
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,229
I failed you, Lady Marianne!

173
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:58,229
The Knight of One has fallen!

174
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:07,849
What have I become? Am I a knight of Britannia?

175
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:12,685
And If I'm not then what am I fighting these battles for?!

176
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,885
To the people of the world!

177
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,937
Lelouch!

178
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:18,122
The video that you've just seen is final proof

179
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:20,415
that I am the true ruler of Britannia

180
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,273
in name and in deed.

181
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:23,632
Now that that is clear,

182
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,733
the Holy Britannian Empire is ready

183
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,491
to join the United Federation of Nations!

184
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:30,525
Does that mean...

185
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,398
Britannia will be on our side?

186
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,357
There, ya see?

187
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,283
I told you he was one of us. He's my buddy!

188
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:36,568
For the negotiations,

189
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:40,064
I will not be with Suzaku Kururugi nor any of my generals.

190
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,596
I shall follow all rules of the U.F.N.

191
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:47,108
However, the site of the negotiations
shall be the one nation which is neutral,

192
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,889
standing between Britannia and the U.F.N.

193
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:51,209
Japan.

194
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:53,158
The Ashford Academy will be

195
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:54,709
the site of the conference.

196
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:56,068
Wha...?

197
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:05,155
This is 144. North wing, clear.

198
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,407
Is there something going on, Schneizel?

199
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,698
A certain person decided she didn't approve of us,

200
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:12,659
so she's chosen to flee.

201
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:16,539
We need to deploy Damocles now. There's no more time.

202
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:18,936
Is that the only option we have?

203
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:21,538
That will be up to the world to decide.

204
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:28,555
Lelouch, are you really certain about this?

205
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,664
Just me and a few security police?

206
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,176
We're going there to ask them for a favor.

207
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:36,156
To participate in an enlightened democratic system.

208
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:37,185
Uh-huh.

209
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,201
And we know how everyone loves their democracy.

210
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,618
We're coming to you from Ashford Academy,

211
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:46,311
the site chosen by His Majesty
Lelouch, Emperor of Britannia.

212
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:51,873
It is here that the U.F.N. will debate whether
to allow the Britannian Empire to become a member.

213
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,060
It's the emperor's personal transport.

214
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:57,199
Ooh!

215
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,463
Lelouch, is it really you?

216
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:10,929
I'm sorry. Emperor Lelouch has
just landed inside the school grounds.

217
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:12,931
It's Lelouch, the emperor for justice!

218
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:13,760
He's just a kid!

219
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:14,785
Your Majesty!

220
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:18,902
Lelouch! I need to know the truth, Lelouch!

221
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:21,078
Why didn't you ever tell me who you were?!

222
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:22,711
Hey!

223
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:23,813
How dare you!

224
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:24,259
Lemme go!

225
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,466
Disrespecting the emperor!

226
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:26,319
We're friends!

227
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:29,523
He was my best friend at school here. He was...

228
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,465
Lelouch!

229
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:33,603
Hey!

230
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,279
Right...

231
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:37,185
He's sorry! Let him go! We'll leave right now!

232
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,112
Huh?

233
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:40,273
Let's go. Come on.

234
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:48,565
Lelouch, tell me wh...

235
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,314
Nice to meet you.

236
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:52,151
You're Capt. Kallen Kouzuki,

237
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:54,635
a leader of the Black Knights, are you not?

238
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,658
That's right.

239
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:59,173
I'm here to escort you safely to the conference.

240
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,489
Fine. Do you mind if we take the long way around?

241
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,267
I am feeling a bit anxious about this.

242
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:07,459
A little walk might be helpful.

243
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,377
I understand.

244
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:14,161
Is Zero, uh, Lelouch...
did he come here to pull something?

245
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:15,142
He can't.

246
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,728
The O.S.I.'s systems are completely down now.

247
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:19,962
We've also supplied the guards with goggles

248
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:21,928
that have special lenses.

249
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:23,718
Advanced Geass countermeasures.

250
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:25,743
Kouzuki wants us to watch her closely;

251
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:27,726
if we think he used his geass on her,

252
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,788
she wants us to shoot her. She said to use the snipers.

253
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:32,563
You're all just paranoid.

254
00:13:32,588 --> 00:13:35,036
He came here to make friends; get over it.

255
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:40,460
Nostalgic, isn't it?

256
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:45,466
I'm... I'm grateful for what you did.

257
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:48,354
I know if it weren't for you,

258
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,411
I'd have ended my life back in the Shinjuku ghetto.

259
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,723
The Black Knights would never have existed at all.

260
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:56,250
I was glad,

261
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:00,346
proud and honored to be needed by our masked leader, Zero.

262
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:03,787
But, when I learned you were Zero,

263
00:14:03,895 --> 00:14:05,944
I didn't understand anymore.

264
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,386
Even so, the man I saw fighting against Britannia...

265
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:13,265
Now you've joined forces with Suzaku.

266
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:15,910
What are you really trying to do?

267
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:19,557
Do you want personal power?

268
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:21,749
To be above everyone else?

269
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:24,319
Or is this just a game to you?

270
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:26,472
During the Black Rebellion,

271
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:29,122
Ohgi told me to guard you with my life.

272
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:33,340
He told me that you could make
my brother's dream come true.

273
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:39,183
Lelouch, after everything we've
been through, what do I mean to you?!

274
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:41,476
On the day that you left the Ikaruga, you told me

275
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,782
"Kallen, you have to live."

276
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,123
This is it then. Bye, Lelouch.

277
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:07,263
The supreme council will be meeting in the gymnasium.

278
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:15,737
So then, it is goodbye, Kallen.

279
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:22,953
Chairman Kaguya Sumeragi of the U.F.N. supreme council.

280
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:29,098
I desire that the Holy Britannian Empire
participates in the United Federation of Nations.

281
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,603
Master Zero.

282
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:36,008
Do you understand that participation is dependent upon

283
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,881
a two third majority vote of U.F.N. members?

284
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:40,021
Of course.

285
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:43,079
That's the democratic way of doing things, right?

286
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:44,927
Yes, that's right.

287
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:54,622
This is rather uncourteous, don't you agree?

288
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:56,556
It was former emperor, Charles,

289
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,407
who carried out all those crimes, wasn't it?

290
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:02,061
Geass countermeasures, huh?

291
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:04,755
Well, now it's clear that only Kaguya

292
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,021
and the core members of
the Black Knights know about Geass.

293
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:10,069
Hm?

294
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,608
Now, what are you really trying to do here,

295
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:14,383
treacherous Emperor Lelouch?

296
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,033
I'm surprised at you.

297
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:19,927
Isn't the new Britannia a better
country for the entire world?

298
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:21,740
That remains to be seen.

299
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:25,825
U.F.N. resolutions are always determined by majority vote.

300
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:30,052
Voting rights are apportioned
according to each member nation's population.

301
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,588
The Chinese Federation has been broken up,

302
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:35,562
so the nation with the
largest population in the world now...

303
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:36,962
...is Britannia.

304
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:40,343
If we allow Britannia to join the U.F.N. today...

305
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:43,644
You will have more than half the votes, Emperor Lelouch.

306
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,983
In short, if we vote in your favor,

307
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:49,889
you would usurp our power and take control of the U.F.N.

308
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:54,713
So that's it! I always knew he was a bad guy!

309
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:57,416
He really is exceptionally dim, isn't he?

310
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,421
I heard that!

311
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:00,674
What's your response, Emperor Lelouch?!

312
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,190
Break up your empire.

313
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:04,832
Let your territories secede from Britannia...

314
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,544
...or limit your total votes to 20%.

315
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,330
Those are your options.

316
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:13,180
Chairman Kaguya, I have one
question that I would like to ask you.

317
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:14,375
You may do so.

318
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,301
What trait is most important for governing the world?

319
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:20,352
It's pride. The pride of self-governance.

320
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:21,700
Good answer.

321
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,628
You speak with wisdom, Lady Kaguya.

322
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:27,641
However, I would submit a different answer.

323
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:29,908
Oh, and what would that answer be?

324
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,498
The will to destroy.

325
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:32,340
Destroy?

326
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:35,124
Destroy the world and even one's self!

327
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:37,504
Careful, he's trying to pull something!

328
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,168
Dammit!

329
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:49,184
I will not allow this affront to His Majesty!

330
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:51,505
Where the hell were our perimeter guards?!

331
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,169
Sorry, sir! He launched suddenly from underwater!

332
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:59,178
Is he gonna make the leaders of
the entire world obey him at gunpoint?

333
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,625
Deploy to Ashford Academy!

334
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,441
We need to save Lady Kaguya!

335
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:04,722
The Britannian forces have started to move!

336
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:05,560
What's that?!

337
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,428
They're crossing from international
waters into Japanese territory!

338
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,574
He's caught us off guard.

339
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,078
Meeting with the U.F.N.

340
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:16,519
and then choosing the school as the site...

341
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:18,699
All of this was nothing but a decoy!

342
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:22,124
If that's true, then he's betrayed
the trust of the entire world.

343
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:22,870
You heard him.

344
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,659
He was never interested in joinging the U.F.N.

345
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:28,434
In other words, his goal is a pure dictatorship.

346
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:30,529
He abolished the old aristocracy,

347
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:33,192
yet he still continues to call himself emperor.

348
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:34,110
You're right.

349
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:38,217
Zero is... Lelouch is now the enemy of the world!

350
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,682
Retreat! Get out of there, Kozuki!

351
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:43,100
Negative, I'm taking Lelouch down!

352
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,067
This Guren's the only unit that
can go up against the Lancelot!

353
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:49,394
If you fight here, you'll be
putting everyone's lives at risk.

354
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,733
There are leaders from every nation on Earth!

355
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:53,841
But the Empress is also in grave danger!

356
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,157
I know that, Kallen, but the enemy is Lelouch!

357
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,783
He won't hesitate to kill everyone around him!

358
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:01,084
You can't act on your own.

359
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:03,894
We have to let the representatives decide how to respond.

360
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,346
Otherwise, the U.F.N. itself will collapse!

361
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,746
And that would leave Britannia victorious!

362
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:10,099
Suzaku...

363
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:12,203
Now, Chairman Sumeragi...

364
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,558
I request that you take the vote.

365
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,739
Will you allow Britannia to join the U.F.N.?

366
00:19:18,764 --> 00:19:20,421
We'd be voting under duress.

367
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:23,655
Will you stop them from casting their decision?

368
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:27,877
No. Then let's start the democratic process.

369
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:32,982
Lelouch and Suzaku! What are they thinking?!

370
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,895
They've declared war on the whole world.

371
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,434
A roadblock?

372
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:40,576
Don't try to protect me, it's not worth it.

373
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,434
You'll get tangled up in this whole thing.

374
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,459
I'm not gonna let them get their hands on you!

375
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:47,067
Why, just as a favor to Milly?! If that's it...

376
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:49,592
Idiot! It's because I'm your friend!

377
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:53,304
Ah?!

378
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,185
Congratulations!

379
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,010
Huh?

380
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:08,247
Priority target one has been captured.

381
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:10,716
It all went as you predicted, Your Majesty.

382
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:14,079
Good. Treat her with courtesy as I instructed.

383
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:15,951
Oh, one more thing.

384
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:17,667
I'm sure there was a student with her.

385
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:18,926
Let him go free.

386
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,737
Yes, Your Majesty!

387
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:21,421
Majesty!

388
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:21,983
Hm?

389
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:23,858
Emergency dispatch from the Avalon!

390
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:25,049
What is it?

391
00:20:25,262 --> 00:20:28,389
Pendragon, the capitol city... It's been...!

392
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:30,539
Dammit! He struck first!

393
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:35,062
The radius of destruction is approximately 100 kilometers.

394
00:20:35,145 --> 00:20:37,820
We have to assume it was caused by a F.L.E.I.J.A.

395
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:39,429
And that's not all...

396
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,270
There's a fortress in the sky above it.

397
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,154
It's three kilometers long.

398
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,949
What's he doing now?

399
00:20:52,974 --> 00:20:55,516
Lelouch! It's just as you guessed!

400
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:59,004
Yes, I had no doubt that all
the F.L.I.E.J.A. warheads were there.

401
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:03,537
The sky fortress Democles was developed
by the Toromo Agency in Cambodia.

402
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,995
It is a perfect base for the F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

403
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,149
Hm?

404
00:21:07,553 --> 00:21:10,944
The only one who would know
the imperial private channel is...

405
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:17,224
Do you enjoy forcing others
to submit to your will, Lelouch?

406
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:18,546
What do you want?

407
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:20,738
I've gathered all the F.L.E.I.J.A. warheads.

408
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:22,699
They're deployed to the Damocles.

409
00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:25,596
You're prepared to attack the Britannian emperor?

410
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:29,813
I'm afraid that's a moot point since
I don't recognize you as the emperor, Lelouch.

411
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:30,832
I see.

412
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,784
I suppose you think that you're best suited to rule.

413
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,134
No. You're mistaken.

414
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,244
There's another who's destined for the throne.

415
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:37,944
Hm?

416
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:42,574
The one who's truly best suited
to rule Britannia is right here.

417
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:52,955
Nunnally!

418
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:58,015
Listen well, Lelouch and Suzaku, I declare...

419
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:01,228
You're my enemies from now on.

420
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:41,182
Nunnally, ever since that day eight years ago

421
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:42,915
when we were abandoned,

422
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:45,497
I've needed a reason to go on living.

423
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:49,055
Instinctively, I made you my guiding star.

424
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,574
You became the foundation of my life.

425
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,391
Perhaps, it is about those issues

426
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:57,478
that Suzaku and Kallen feel are so important.

427
00:23:57,704 --> 00:24:01,329
Am I to once again lose the very basis for my existence?

428
00:24:01,504 --> 00:24:04,845
If not, do I now have to...!
