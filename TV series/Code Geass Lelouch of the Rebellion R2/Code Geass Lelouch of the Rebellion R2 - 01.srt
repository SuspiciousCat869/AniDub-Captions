1
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:18,636
This is 2-D-4.

2
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:22,152
We are now entering Tokyo Settlement-controlled airspace.

3
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:22,798
Roger.

4
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,778
Your flight objective here is
commercial advertising, correct?

5
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:27,028
No change in that.

6
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:30,362
As filed, the duration of our flight will be 14 hours.

7
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:32,914
That is confirmed. You are cleared for fly-over.

8
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,424
Acknowledged. I appreciate it.

9
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:39,992
We're the only ones left now.

10
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,249
This is all that remains of the Black Knights

11
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:45,928
who, along with Zero, once struck
terror in the heart of Britannia.

12
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:48,706
Still, it's too soon to give in to despair!

13
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:52,053
If Operation Flying Swallow Four is successful, then...!

14
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:52,616
Yes.

15
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:55,158
Forgive me. Here's to you.

16
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,086
To victory! Long live Japan!

17
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,881
Long live Japan!

18
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:09,410
Lelouch.

19
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,396
Uh? Oh, not again. You are persistent.

20
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:14,773
You're not going to get away this time!

21
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:18,206
Hey, Lelouch, about what you said

22
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:19,709
Sorry! Catch ya later!

23
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:21,276
Lelouch, you come back here!

24
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,275
Vice Prez!

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,669
Hope you get lucky.

26
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:25,263
Yeah, whatever!

27
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:33,044
You lost the moment you turned this
into a contest of strength and speed.

28
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:34,319
Aren't you overreacting?

29
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,525
I mean, this is just about making up a P.E. class.

30
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,467
No! Quit cutting class, Lelouch!

31
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:41,393
I have more than enough school credits to pass, don't I?

32
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,809
Don't worry, it's only colored smoke!

33
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:47,109
Wait!

34
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:49,405
Hey, Vice Prez, hang in there!

35
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,337
Uh! Thanks a lot!

36
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:53,706
What kind of student president are you?!

37
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:56,462
Oh, I'm so sorry. Lost my head.

38
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,772
Lelouch...!

39
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:01,190
Heh!

40
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:04,631
Ow, are you trying to kill me, coach?

41
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:06,545
Rivalz?! But how did you...?

42
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:09,785
I need to borrow your bike, Rivalz! See ya!

43
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,959
What're you up to now, Lulu?

44
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,485
For crying out loud!

45
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,056
Can't they give me a break
and leave me alone after school?

46
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:01,925
But... they only do that because
you're always skipping class, big brother.

47
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,250
Because I find them insufferably boring.

48
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:06,514
Here, have some. It's from Milly.

49
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,469
Uh...

50
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:10,271
Whoa!

51
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:12,435
I can't eat and steer!

52
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:14,775
You're right. I'm sorry.

53
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:19,999
It's been a year since Britannian forces

54
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:23,752
crushed the Black Rebellion the revolt instigated by Zero.

55
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,748
Things have finally quieted down,

56
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:27,701
even here in Area 11.

57
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,631
When the insurrection began,

58
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:31,572
all sorts of rumors were flying.

59
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:35,039
At one point, I considered returning
to the homeland with my brother.

60
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:37,342
Did you hand in your career guidance report yet?

61
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,031
Huh?

62
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:40,342
That's the reason Ms. Villetta was so upset.

63
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,150
Oh...

64
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,797
So, what about college?

65
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:44,572
Well, I haven't decided yet.

66
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:46,862
I am sick and tired of being a student.

67
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:50,053
But I'm not ready to get a job
and join the system, either.

68
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,116
A typical answer.

69
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:56,870
Besides, what could I ever hope to
attain by entering the workforce?

70
00:04:56,895 --> 00:05:00,186
Big corporations and the nobility
would still be above me.

71
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:02,127
A structured, mature world.

72
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:05,713
I would simply be absorbed into the hierarchy of adults.

73
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:11,345
We all need to understand that this is not discrimination!

74
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,741
But rather, it's differentiation!

75
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:16,637
The Elevens revealed themselves to be a dangerous,

76
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:17,870
belligerent race!

77
00:05:17,895 --> 00:05:19,778
They followed the scoundrel, Zero,

78
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,857
and took up the name "Japanese"!

79
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:25,826
It's our duty as Britannians to control and educate them!

80
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:28,972
The Elevens lost. They didn't have the strength.

81
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:31,249
If they'd only kept quiet and behaved,

82
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:34,594
this place wouldn't have been
downgraded to a re-education zone.

83
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:38,235
Zero... He was a fool.

84
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:42,037
No matter what you try, the world is just a...

85
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,421
Viceroy Calares, please hurry,

86
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,780
the delegation from the Chinese Federation is waiting.

87
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,180
I understand.

88
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:50,669
Are those O.S.I. people going to carry it out?

89
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,732
Yes, at Babel Tower, my lord.

90
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,397
On today, of all days...

91
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,339
What could His Majesty be thinking?

92
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:02,741
I seriously doubt that the scattered remnants
of the Black Knights can do anything to us at this point.

93
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:05,004
Besides... Zero is long dead.

94
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:08,917
Quit slackin' off, lazy Eleven monkey!

95
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:10,442
Y-Yes, sir!

96
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,088
Target arriving, as predicted.

97
00:06:14,113 --> 00:06:15,276
Ground foot patrol to main.

98
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:17,915
Sending I.D. numbers of peripheral vehicles.

99
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:19,197
Main to ground...

100
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:22,218
Target now entering fifth gate from B-3.

101
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,891
Do you think she'll show this time?

102
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,146
I just know we can't afford to fail.

103
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,225
We're taking a huge risk by letting Lelouch

104
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,172
go to the settlement's outer edge.

105
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,181
Oh, all right then.

106
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,155
You can come with me, but I warn you,

107
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,442
you'll have to watch out.

108
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,991
Because today, I'm going to be breaking the law.

109
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,109
Don't get caught!

110
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,727
Heh. Cops don't scare me.

111
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:43,293
Why do this?

112
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:46,190
'Cause I mean, you're not even
doing this for the money, are you?

113
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:47,478
Need you ask?

114
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:50,372
It's because I wanna battle more challenging opponents!

115
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:57,897
That's a lie. I do this out of sheer boredom.

116
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,759
In short... I'm...

117
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:15,956
Today's main event is a brutal match between brothers!

118
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:19,840
Which sibling will win? The older one or the younger?!

119
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,090
We don't belong here. Let's go.

120
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:24,615
It's simple to figure out. Just relax.

121
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,278
Uh?

122
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:26,464
Look there.

123
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:29,842
The Britannians, like ourselves,
are laughing and having fun.

124
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,245
The ones who are being laughed at are the Elevens.

125
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,662
You pretend not to notice, but in the end...

126
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:35,907
But then, why...?

127
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:39,524
I know, but it's the truth. The Elevens lost twice.

128
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:42,811
First, with Prime Minister Kururugi, and again, with Zero.

129
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:45,584
How could they rebel when they don't have the strength?

130
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:47,890
I'm terribly sorry!

131
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,390
No, it's fine, don't worry.

132
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:51,830
But I'm an Eleven, and you're a Britannian student!

133
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:52,896
This is inexcusable!

134
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:54,986
All the more reason to excuse you.

135
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,844
I hate having our social class held over you like a sword.

136
00:07:57,872 --> 00:07:59,284
It doesn't matter.

137
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:02,059
The powerless have no choice,
but to bear their lot in life.

138
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:02,837
Huh?

139
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,089
Regardless if their oppressor is wrong.

140
00:08:05,114 --> 00:08:08,846
I'd appreciate it if you didn't push
your values on me. I'm not interested.

141
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:10,699
I beg your pardon.

142
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:17,344
C'mere, lemme take a look at ya. Hm?

143
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:19,667
Hm, nice goods you've got here.

144
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:23,205
Yes, Mr. King, we have a large,
quality catch of bunnies today.

145
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,843
You're wrong, sir, I'm not for sale!

146
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:27,490
But you are for sale.

147
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,916
You should know by now, losers don't have any rights!

148
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:33,392
Alert. Unforeseen trouble occurring.

149
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:34,132
Tsk!

150
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:37,523
Curse your own wretched birth
for not having been born with power.

151
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:39,854
That's what His Majesty always says, isn't it?

152
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,956
His Majesty...

153
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:43,480
The strong feed upon and devour the weak.

154
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:45,005
That's the rule, kid!

155
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,887
The guy's Mafia, Lelouch!

156
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:48,445
What an arrogant display.

157
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,927
Hm?

158
00:08:48,952 --> 00:08:50,820
Feeding upon the weak, are you?

159
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:56,542
This is the grownup world in here, schoolboy, so get lost.

160
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,921
Then will the adult world devour the student,

161
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:00,794
or is it the other way around?

162
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:03,402
Why don't we find out the answer with this?

163
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,310
With chess?

164
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,501
Big brother, don't!

165
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:08,253
Too late, fellas. Right, boys?

166
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:12,581
Students really don't know much of anything, do they?

167
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:15,106
That's not true, Mr. Black King.

168
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:16,061
Hm?!

169
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,691
You're a famous chess player
in the gambling arena, aren't you?

170
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:22,829
So, you know who I am, huh?

171
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:33,524
If Zero was here, you wouldn't be acting so tough!

172
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:34,691
Do me a favor.

173
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:36,239
Don't say that traitor's name again.

174
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:38,014
Hey, Zero didn't betray us!

175
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,361
Shut up, you stinkin' Eleven!

176
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:44,941
There has to be a reason for what he did.

177
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,319
What reason? Why'd the commander vanish

178
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:49,303
during the final decisive battle like that?!

179
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:49,866
Huh?

180
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,227
Stop it!

181
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,589
It serves no purpose. Zero's dead, after all.

182
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:57,414
He's dead?

183
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:01,518
And that's checkmate.

184
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:03,815
Impossible!

185
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,267
The student beat him!

186
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,512
Black King lost!

187
00:10:06,537 --> 00:10:08,244
How could he lose so easily?

188
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:11,073
Looks like you're the one who's been devoured here.

189
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:13,761
Damn. That's inconvenient.

190
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:16,191
How will I ever be able to show my face in public

191
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,674
if word of this gets around?

192
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,373
I would never spread rumors.

193
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:21,251
No, schoolboy, not that.

194
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:24,668
What I'm saying is that others will
hear how you cunningly cheated me.

195
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:25,549
I what?!

196
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,211
Such a naughty little man...

197
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:28,656
Uh! Now wait a minute!

198
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,465
Cheat? But in chess, how could you?

199
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,967
There's no way to do it!

200
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,519
Get him and hold him.

201
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:36,112
Now to whip up a little evidence against the kid.

202
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,805
You filthy, lying adult!

203
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,663
Fair play doesn't win the game. Learn that, schoolboy!

204
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:41,897
Let him go!

205
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:46,609
Terrorists?!

206
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:04,616
Move out!

207
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:10,908
Come on! This way!

208
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:11,912
What?! Hey!

209
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,252
Lelouch!

210
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:20,222
An airship, huh? Their final gasp.

211
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:23,127
Office of Secret Intelligence,

212
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:25,277
initiate Operation Valhalla Seven.

213
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:26,981
Yes, my lord!

214
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,536
What is this?! What's happening?!

215
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:31,721
What?!

216
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:42,153
We welcome you here to Area 11.

217
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:44,553
We didn't expect an armed reception.

218
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,598
Especially after hearing that Zero was dead.

219
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,123
Zero? You have the wrong idea.

220
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:52,838
I hoped it would offer you and the other
representatives of the Chinese Federation

221
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:55,024
a better understanding of us Britannians.

222
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:59,214
My... An uncommonly straightforward approach. Hm...?

223
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:01,732
May we have what you're carrying, sir?

224
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:04,595
Our security is perfect.

225
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:07,323
You don't need to carry that antique weapon here.

226
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,944
Xing-ke! That was rude of you!

227
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,330
Please forgive me.

228
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:18,997
But I hoped it would offer you and the other Britannians

229
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:21,253
a better understanding of the Chinese Federation.

230
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:22,653
Why you...

231
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:24,407
Huh?

232
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:33,480
Huh? What?

233
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:34,797
Big brother, this way!

234
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:35,752
Hey!

235
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:37,672
No! Wait a minute!

236
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:42,002
We what?! Lost sight of the target?!

237
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,495
Yes, that is correct. We will be going in now.

238
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,728
Understood.

239
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:59,259
The terrorists attacking Babel Tower appear well equipped.

240
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:01,281
They're armed with several Knightmares.

241
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:02,813
At commencement of the operation,

242
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:04,577
perimeter cleaning complete.

243
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:07,288
Good. Now enter the seventh sequence.

244
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:08,876
Commander, Viceroy Calares is...

245
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:11,526
Pay no attention to that low-level bureaucrat.

246
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,285
Our orders come directly from the emperor himself!

247
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,314
Yes, my lord.

248
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:17,164
Elevens can take the stairs!

249
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:18,415
Get out, we're overloaded!

250
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,565
Stop pushing!

251
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,759
Terrorists?

252
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:23,682
What are leftover fragments
of the Black Knights doing here?

253
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:32,722
Huh?!

254
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:38,871
Britannian military!

255
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:51,173
Filthy Britannians!

256
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,126
Sorry, I wasn't able to bring him here like we planned!

257
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:54,938
Don't sweat it.

258
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:56,966
Urabe and the others are looking for him right now.

259
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:58,366
Understood!

260
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:21,667
Rolo, this way!

261
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:29,816
What the hell's going on?

262
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:33,873
That Knightmare earlier... Was it trying to...

263
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:36,240
Lelouch, what'll we do now?

264
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:39,075
Don't worry. We'll be all right, I promise you.

265
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:40,679
I'll get us out of here.

266
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:45,117
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. We'll be fine.

267
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,065
Rolo!

268
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:03,510
Lelouch!

269
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:07,411
And now, Lulu's giving all of his same bad habits to Rolo!

270
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:08,770
Admit it, Shirley.

271
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:10,407
You're worried about your darling Lulu.

272
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:11,439
No, I am not!

273
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:12,638
There she goes again!

274
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:13,542
Uh!

275
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:16,031
Whatever...

276
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:19,544
R-Rolo...

277
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:23,824
Rolo!

278
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:28,118
I'm out of range. What do I do now?

279
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,717
At this rate, we'll both be...!

280
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:32,049
No! I have to try and save him!

281
00:15:32,074 --> 00:15:34,549
The least I should be able to do is save my only brother!

282
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,882
Even I ought to have enough strength in me to do that.

283
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:39,519
I have to!

284
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,240
Terrorists are responsible for this?

285
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:51,532
But... Elevens were killed, too!

286
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:04,956
Are these people still counting
on Zero to rescue them?! Uh?!

287
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:09,345
The Black Knights!

288
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:14,426
What do I do? Will they kill me?

289
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:15,512
Even if I run...

290
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:16,741
Lelouch.

291
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,863
I came to get you out of here, Lelouch.

292
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:28,115
I'm on your side, an ally.

293
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,523
And your sworn enemy is Britannia.

294
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:31,471
Huh?

295
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,392
We have a contract.

296
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:35,762
You and I are both accomplices.

297
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:38,926
Contract? Accomplices?

298
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:42,954
I'm the only one who knows you. The real you.

299
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:47,006
What does she mean, the real me?

300
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:04,339
Le-Lelouch...

301
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:10,212
Hey, are you all right?!

302
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:17,645
Why are soldiers...

303
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,290
No, hold on! What are you...

304
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,472
Stop it, that woman's still alive!

305
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:31,004
You've served your function well.

306
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:32,491
Good Lelouch Lamperouge.

307
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:34,891
Function?! What're you talking about?!

308
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,480
We've had our eye on you
for a very long time now, young man.

309
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:40,671
Wakes up at 6:59 AM.

310
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:44,918
From 7:12 AM, watches the news with
his little brother while eating breakfast.

311
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:48,249
No ideological deviations with the program he watches.

312
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:50,485
8:45 AM, goes to class.

313
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,767
Doesn't attend his morning homeroom or first period class.

314
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,756
Instead, he reads on the roof.

315
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:56,940
During his second period...

316
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:59,123
Those are things... I've done today...

317
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:02,700
I prefer to think of it as
a pet diary, or... bait journal.

318
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:03,595
Bait journal?

319
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,275
Or call it a trap, if you wish.

320
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,843
For that witch. All to lure C.C. out of hiding!

321
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:11,118
No, wait, please! What's going on?!

322
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:13,476
Boy, I'll have you know that I am a Baron.

323
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:16,031
I'm through wasting words on bait like you!

324
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:17,830
Now, time to dispose of you.

325
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:20,491
And there won't be any witnesses left.

326
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,150
Dispose...?

327
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,102
Is this... the end for me?

328
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:30,568
Without even knowing why? So matter-of-factly?

329
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:40,018
To hell with that! Power! If I only had power!

330
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:42,436
Power to escape this place!

331
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:44,954
Power not to lose the world!

332
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:58,028
What... What is this?

333
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:01,717
You desire power?

334
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:04,929
That voice... The girl who was shot?

335
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,876
You already possess the power you seek.

336
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:11,157
It's merely imprisoned within a cage of amnesia.

337
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:12,630
Remember...

338
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:15,178
Remember who you really are!

339
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,636
The power of the king!

340
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:21,432
Now... let the seal...

341
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:23,082
...be broken!

342
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,651
I see now.

343
00:19:26,188 --> 00:19:30,303
Persistent irritation that pricked me
like thorns in my everyday life.

344
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:32,370
Yes... Heh!

345
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:35,437
It was all the phony memories implanted in me!

346
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:41,779
But I remember now... I am...!

347
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:44,117
I am...!

348
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,244
I am... Zero!

349
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,746
Lelouch. I'm not asking for forgiveness.

350
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:58,198
After all, we're friends, aren't we?

351
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:03,703
Yes... That's your answer, isn't it, Suzaku?!

352
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,918
Before you dispose of me,

353
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,058
I'd like you to answer a question.

354
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:12,452
That girl's still alive!

355
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,918
Impossible! She was shot through the heart!

356
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:17,614
If being powerless is so terribly wrong,

357
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:20,098
then does having power make you right?

358
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:22,444
Do you find vengeance evil?

359
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,525
What's your value of friendship? Is it justice?

360
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,608
Heh, there is no justice or evil.

361
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:31,341
The only truth that's left for you,
bait, is the simple reality of death.

362
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:32,589
I see.

363
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,893
Then that reality is all that remains for you, as well.

364
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:38,872
I, Lelouch vi Britannia, command you!

365
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:40,475
All of you...

366
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,890
DIE!

367
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:43,871
It-It can't be!

368
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,325
Yes, Your Highness!

369
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,486
Ever since that day, my heart simply couldn't accept it.

370
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:08,219
This fake life I was never able to fit into.

371
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:10,300
All the time that was lost.

372
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,726
These false memories planted in me,

373
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,988
giving me a life as one of the herd.

374
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:16,074
And yet...

375
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:18,951
The truth continues to guide me toward itself.

376
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,135
That's right!

377
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,695
It wasn't me who was wrong! It was the world!

378
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:30,375
The world has to change. So I will change it.

379
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:33,295
We've been waiting for you, Master Zero!

380
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,537
Please, give us your orders!

381
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:37,082
Very well...

382
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:39,711
Because, after all, I am Zero!

383
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,769
The one who will crush the world...!

384
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,841
...and the one who will re-create the world anew!

385
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,594
Yes... Your Majesty.

386
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,889
I have no intention of assigning this task to anyone else.

387
00:21:59,293 --> 00:22:01,251
The one who will kill Zero...

388
00:22:01,343 --> 00:22:03,125
...shall be me.

389
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,706
I can't forgive them! I mustn't forgive them!

390
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:44,876
My memories are my own personal and individual reality!

391
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:47,531
They are the truth, and that truth defines me!

392
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:49,092
Someone trampled them.

393
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:52,974
I was tamed like a domestic animal
then looked down upon as mere bait.

394
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:55,514
The time for payback has come!

395
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:58,198
Now, I'll give Britannia something to remember.

396
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,220
The true meaning of Zero's return to this world!

397
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:04,864
Because I no longer have need for their deceptive rule!
