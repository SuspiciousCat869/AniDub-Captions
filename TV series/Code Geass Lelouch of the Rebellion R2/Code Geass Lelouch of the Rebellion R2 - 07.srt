1
00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:02,695
The world lies!

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,714
Thou shalt not commit murder!

3
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:06,497
Thou shalt not bear false witness!

4
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:08,828
Thou shall not cheat! Thou shall not steal!

5
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:10,795
Thou shalt not covet they neighbor's wife!

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,420
All of these are lies! Mere illusion, nothing more!

7
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:17,866
They don't want to be killed!
They don't want to be robbed!

8
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:20,641
Using the twin lies of "justice" and "morality,"

9
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:23,261
the weak are endeavoring to protect themselves!

10
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:26,322
But the first truth is that the strong devour the weak!

11
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:29,580
So let us feed Upon people! Upon wealth!

12
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:31,649
Upon riches and power!

13
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:35,255
We of Britannia shall feast upon
the raw flesh of the world itself!

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,613
We must crush this deception and bring forth the truth!

15
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,457
ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!

16
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:45,057
All hail Britiannia! All hail Britiannia!

17
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:50,082
All hail Britiannia! All hail Britiannia!

18
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:33,624
You looked like you were having a nightmare.

19
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,822
A nightmare...

20
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,245
Did something happen yesterday?

21
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,229
No, not really. Uh, Rolo.

22
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:43,126
Did I happen to say anything?

23
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:43,972
Huh?

24
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:46,801
Nunnally...

25
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:49,991
No, Lelouch.

26
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:52,410
You didn't say one thing.

27
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:53,919
Nothing at all.

28
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:55,278
I see.

29
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:58,697
The world Nunnally desires.

30
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,862
The future Nunnally has chosen.

31
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:04,081
But that leaves me, leaves Zero,

32
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:05,886
standing in the way.

33
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:08,908
My sister's safety has been guaranteed.

34
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:13,676
She has the Britannian military forces
to protect her, and Suzaku, too.

35
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:15,670
He may be my worst enemy,

36
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:17,928
but I trust him to do at least that.

37
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:20,960
Yes. As I had once hoped he would.

38
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:23,862
And even after I can no longer safeguard Nunnally.

39
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:24,931
Look at this!

40
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,491
It says this temple was built a thousand years ago!

41
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:29,787
That's great. Have you seen the water pistols?

42
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:31,812
I got one for everyone, but I can't find 'em.

43
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,626
Hey, what's all this stuff, Prez?

44
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:35,412
Some nets, candles, wigs,

45
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:37,351
fireworks, and a tambourine.

46
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:40,122
Uh... So are those for our class trip?

47
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:41,355
Just leave it to me!

48
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,922
'This'll be my second time, y'know!

49
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:45,156
Right...Uh?

50
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:47,303
Hm? Uh...

51
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:48,614
What's wrong, Lulu?

52
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,589
Huh?

53
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:51,560
You just seem sort of down.

54
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:52,956
No, I'm fine.

55
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:56,074
Can't sleep 'cuz you're thinking
about how much fun the trip'll be?

56
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,651
You're correct. Yeah, I'm excited about it.

57
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:01,467
Lulu, you're just like a little boy.

58
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:04,128
Heh... Huh?

59
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:05,968
Attention all students.

60
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:10,439
The inauguration speech of the
new viceroy of Area 11 is about to begin.

61
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:13,343
Please assemble in the auditorium.

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,329
How do you do, everyone?

63
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,658
I am Nunnally vi Britannia of the royal family,

64
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:21,679
87th in line to the imperial throne.

65
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:23,203
Due to the unfortunate,

66
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:25,894
untimely loss of Duke Calares recently,

67
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,424
I shall be assuming the
viceroyship of Area 11 in his place.

68
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:34,974
I am physically challenged in that
I am unable to either see or walk. Therefore...

69
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:37,499
But she's so young. How could that girl be a viceroy?

70
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:39,056
She's a royal princess!

71
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:41,664
...Please, help me to help you.

72
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,706
She wants some help, hm?

73
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:45,358
This'll screw up things.

74
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:46,949
I realize this is unexpected,

75
00:04:46,974 --> 00:04:49,890
but I'd like each one of you to cooperate with me on this.

76
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:50,666
Huh?

77
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:56,008
As your new Viceroy, I wish to again
create the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan.

78
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:57,229
That's absurd!

79
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:59,831
I can't believe she would even mention the name!

80
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:05,601
In the Special Zone, Britannians and
Numbers would have equal status.

81
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:09,887
Elevens will be allowed to safely
call themselves Japanese once again.

82
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:11,910
She just said Japanese!

83
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:13,395
Are they trying to trick us?

84
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,166
She has Suzaku Kururugi.

85
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:17,566
He's Japanese, so he should be on our side.

86
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,133
Princess Massacre's knight!

87
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:20,783
He's the traitor who shot Zero!

88
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:24,220
...Although a tragic misunderstanding
occurred in the Special Zone,

89
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:28,570
I do not believe that the attempt
to establish the zone was a mistake.

90
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:32,204
We need a gentler world.

91
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:35,341
And those of you in the Black Knights,

92
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:38,575
I ask you to please participate in the Special Zone.

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,100
What?!

94
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,209
Not again!

95
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:41,291
Never again.

96
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:42,862
...and admit to the mistakes that we've made,

97
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:46,411
then we can take the first
positive steps to setting things right.

98
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,279
I believe this with all my heart.

99
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,168
You surprised me, Nunnally.

100
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:58,853
You're trying to create the Japan Special Zone, again.

101
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:01,239
Suzaku, what Euphy tried to do,

102
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:04,848
I mean before the disaster happened, wasn't wrong, was it?

103
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:05,672
No.

104
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,576
I can assure you it wasn't Euphy who was wrong.

105
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:09,787
Hm.

106
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:17,285
Passengers transferring to the
Express Line, please wait on Platform 3.

107
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:20,645
Those transferring to the Sen-Kyou Line,
please change at the next station.

108
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:23,604
The local train will be stopping at platform number 5.

109
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,812
They're not needed any more.

110
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,745
Neither Zero... or my battle.

111
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,170
Uh?

112
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,934
Heh-heh!

113
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,051
That kid viceroy just want to repeat

114
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,215
what Princess Massacre Euphemia did!

115
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,657
No Japanese person would ever take part in it.

116
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:55,859
After luring them in with sugary words

117
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:58,509
and then slaughtering them? Not a chance!

118
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,034
So, what're we gonna do, then?

119
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:02,059
Have a showdown with the Britannians!

120
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:05,026
How do we do that when the only
knightmare we have left is one Guren?

121
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,801
We'll just go to Zero, of course, and...

122
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,597
That's right!

123
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:08,288
Huh?

124
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:09,370
Lady Kaguya!

125
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,072
I'm in agreement with Tamaki, however...

126
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:14,303
Why isn't Master Zero here?

127
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:17,107
Considering his new wife awaits him eagerly.

128
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:20,913
In fact, he failed to write me even once
while I was away in the Chinese Federation!

129
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:23,015
Maybe he dumped you for someone else!

130
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,847
Ah! Don't be ridiculous!

131
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:26,997
It's not true! Seriously, it's not!

132
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:28,522
That doesn't matter at all to me.

133
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:29,205
Huh?

134
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,726
The greatest men succumb to feminine charm.

135
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:34,153
Grown up men have basic physical needs.

136
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,038
Lady Kaguya, what're you saying?!

137
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:37,022
Thank goodness.

138
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:39,205
You're a lot more generous than you seem.

139
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:43,778
I so appreciate you keeping him
company while I was away. Thank you.

140
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:48,692
Hm. No need to thank me.

141
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:50,349
Here, you as well, Kallen.

142
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:51,861
Uh?! I...!

143
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:57,987
We three who support Master Zero! Oh?

144
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,986
That makes us three ladies of his court, doesn't it?

145
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:02,317
His court?

146
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:05,494
Salutations and greetings! Hm?

147
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:06,861
Where's Suzaku?

148
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,259
He refused to stay here.

149
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:09,874
He went after the Black Knights.

150
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:12,399
We were right in the middle of his complete physical, too.

151
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:14,511
Well, that's typical of our boy.

152
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not surprised.

153
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:16,342
Uh...?

154
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,909
We have to perfect the Conquista, right?

155
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:19,946
Ugh.

156
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:21,263
So, how is it?

157
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:25,728
I mixed peanut butter with turmeric sugar
and wasabi paste, then spread it on rye bread!

158
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:28,745
That's typical of you!

159
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,713
Even though...

160
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,549
Even though I've been doing all this
up until now for Nunnally's sake...

161
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:40,605
Huh?

162
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,213
How do you do, everyone?

163
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:52,517
I am Nunnally vi Britannia of the royal family,

164
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,667
87th in line to the imperial throne.

165
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:57,230
Due to the unfortunate,

166
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:59,903
untimely loss of Duke Calares recently,

167
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:01,052
I shall be assuming...

168
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:02,936
What's your problem?! Watch it!

169
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:04,324
...In his place.

170
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:06,715
Hey!

171
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,426
I'm finished!

172
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:17,937
Nunnally may have realized that I lied to her.

173
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:22,357
Even so, she said she wants to carry on Euphie's wishes.

174
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:25,159
And for that, I'll...

175
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,759
We told you money first, didn't we?

176
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,555
Cough it up, ya stinkin' deadbeat!

177
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,474
Loser!

178
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:32,003
Stop it, please!

179
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:33,153
Why are you doing this?

180
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:34,951
Aren't you guys Elevens like me?!

181
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:36,620
Bring the cash next time.

182
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,603
If you want this stuff.

183
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:41,626
Hm?

184
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:43,315
A Britannian?

185
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,945
A student?

186
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,413
Japanese feeding on other Japanese.

187
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:48,695
What a picture.

188
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:52,520
But even worse than that,
they commit petty crimes for a Britannian.

189
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:54,742
Ha! Did you call them Japanese?

190
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,486
We don't need sympathy from any Britannians!

191
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:59,261
We call ourselves Elevens.

192
00:09:59,286 --> 00:10:02,270
And a school boy shouldn't complain about the work we do!

193
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:04,649
Yes, I use these gentlemen to do my bidding,

194
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:06,508
but only with their consent.

195
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,851
My dear student.

196
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:10,038
Don't touch me! You scum!

197
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:11,276
Why you...!

198
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,153
Now get on the ground and do push-ups!

199
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:19,682
As you like.

200
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:23,163
Mr. Kolchak, what are you doing?!

201
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:25,478
And why don't you do some dancing?

202
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:28,422
Whoa! Yeah, baby!

203
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:29,728
Do squats!

204
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:30,545
Start howling!

205
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,015
Applaud!

206
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:46,565
It's really makes no difference at all
if he doesn't come back here.

207
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,192
The one single thing that's important
to me is that he remains alive.

208
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:51,599
Oh, please.

209
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:55,049
The simplest solution would be for him to stop being Zero.

210
00:10:55,886 --> 00:10:59,095
I know. Not a very romantic story, is it?

211
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:03,457
Still, at this rate, the Black Knights
are over, they're history.

212
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,562
Yes. Zero exists for Nunnally's sake.

213
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:10,786
That's what Lelouch said, Marianne.

214
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:16,349
Where's Lelouch?

215
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:19,419
Dunno. What is up with that guy?

216
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:34,168
I figured you'd come here.

217
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:38,272
Where Zero was born.

218
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,403
You started it here, this is where it all began.

219
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:50,964
Lelouch, I want to tell you something.

220
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:52,812
Is that...?!

221
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,151
Refrain.

222
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:56,287
You're familiar with it, aren't you?

223
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,805
Brings back memories of the good old days.

224
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,455
Don't give me that crap!

225
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:05,603
So what if you failed this time?!

226
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:07,962
Can't you come up with another plan and get it back?!

227
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:10,282
Just give us orders like you always do!

228
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:11,618
Should I use my Knightmare?

229
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,101
Or maybe play decoy?

230
00:12:13,126 --> 00:12:14,755
Tell me! I'll do whatever you say!

231
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,228
All right, then.

232
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:18,880
You can console me.

233
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:27,878
There are things a woman can do for that, right?

234
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:37,297
No!

235
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,428
Snap out of it, Lelouch!

236
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,889
You're Zero now! You have an obligation!

237
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:48,826
You've got to live up to the dreams you once gave us all!

238
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,718
So please, keep fooling us until you no longer can!

239
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:56,309
We need you to be Zero this time with all of your heart.

240
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:58,334
Play your role like you mean it!

241
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:12,504
Rolo.

242
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,403
That's right, you're supposed to keep an eye on me.

243
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:30,614
I had forgotten.

244
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,799
Then why not... forget about them?

245
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:33,466
Hm.

246
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:35,939
All the heavy burdens that just weigh you down.

247
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:38,755
Zero. The Black Knights. And Nunnally...

248
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,718
You're wrong! Nunnally isn't a...

249
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:42,616
For Nunnally's sake, as well.

250
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:47,126
If Zero vanishes, then peace will come to Area 11.

251
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:50,859
Lelouch, you can go back to being
an ordinary student again and be happy.

252
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:51,657
But...

253
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:53,430
Is there something wrong with that?

254
00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:55,526
Wanting happiness isn't a crime.

255
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,261
No one would have to be hurt.

256
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,057
Look, we still have time to undo what's been done!

257
00:14:00,728 --> 00:14:04,395
It's all right. I'll never abandon you, I promise.

258
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:07,453
I'll stay with you as your brother forever, Lelouch.

259
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,826
Tell me, Nunnally,

260
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,934
why would you request this?

261
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,853
Why did you want to be viceroy of
Area 11 after learning Zero had returned?

262
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:22,311
Because my entire life, I have lived under
the protection of my big brother, Lelouch.

263
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:24,770
I may not know where he is at this moment,

264
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:28,009
but I'm sure that he's out there
watching me at every turn.

265
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,695
Therefore, I don't want to make an embarrassing
decision as viceroy while he's looking over my shoulder!

266
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:39,005
That mask is heavier than it looks.

267
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,220
The wearer bears a fate.

268
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:43,853
Not just of the Japanese people, but that of the world.

269
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:45,361
Yes. But somebody has to...

270
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,389
This is the Britannian military.

271
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:50,364
Your ship's registry and stated course are erroneous.

272
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,091
Heave to at once!

273
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,243
We will now conduct a forced inspection!

274
00:14:55,871 --> 00:14:56,959
They found us?!

275
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:58,307
It appears so.

276
00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:01,464
Everyone aboard is ordered
to disarm and line up on the deck.

277
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:04,391
You have ten minutes to comply with our order!

278
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:07,132
That's right.

279
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,216
Everybody's gone on the school trip.

280
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:10,585
Should we go after them?

281
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:11,499
No.

282
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:14,414
An empty birdcage suits me just fine for now.

283
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:15,437
Huh?

284
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:23,199
Who's firing?

285
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:32,728
Hi! Welcome back, Lulu!

286
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,426
Light some off, too, Lelouch.

287
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:36,320
We have plenty left over from the festival.

288
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:37,516
Why are you...?

289
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:39,186
What about the school trip?

290
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:42,586
We couldn't leave you here crying
while we three went and had fun.

291
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:45,653
Cuz' the important thing about
vacations isn't where you spend them,

292
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,336
it's all about who you spend them with.

293
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:48,541
Exactly!

294
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:49,974
Why, that's a...

295
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:52,095
Hm? Oh, you mean this?

296
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:54,499
These are supposed to make your wishes come true,

297
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:55,805
so I made one.

298
00:15:57,045 --> 00:16:01,078
For the life of me, I can't remember
who taught me how to make them, though.

299
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,980
And what did you wish for?

300
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,928
It's already coming true.

301
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,087
Well, part of it.

302
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:08,459
I wanted to set off fireworks with everyone.

303
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:09,484
Everyone?

304
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:11,020
For Nina, Kallen...

305
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:11,978
...and Suzaku.

306
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:14,468
It goes without saying, you and Rolo.

307
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:18,274
And because I only folded one crane,
you were the only one who showed up!

308
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:33,220
A long time ago, Nunnally, Suzaku,
and I talked about something.

309
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,459
We wondered what happiness would
look like if we could give it a physical form.

310
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:39,696
If I'm not mistaken,

311
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:44,039
I think it was Suzaku who said that
the shape of happiness might resemble glass.

312
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:46,776
His reasoning made sense.

313
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:49,259
He said that even though you don't usually notice it,

314
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:50,920
it's still definitely there.

315
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:53,507
You merely have to change your point of view slightly,

316
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:56,953
and then that glass will sparkle
when it reflects the light.

317
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,019
I doubt that anything else could
argue its own existence more eloquently.

318
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:05,036
They say if you fold a thousand
of these cranes, your wish'll come true.

319
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:07,789
What about you? Do you wish for anything?

320
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,153
Hmm...

321
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:12,068
I wish the world was a gentler place.

322
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:15,745
That's right. A gentle world is this close.

323
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:20,222
Even if we were clouded by
phony memories, like transparent glass.

324
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:23,987
Always. Always. Always.

325
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:24,770
Lulu?

326
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,372
What're you crying for?

327
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:30,320
Lelouch, are you really moved that much by our friendship?

328
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:31,993
You do have a sweet side!

329
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,191
No, you're wrong!

330
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:35,341
I-It's nothing like that at all.

331
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:37,964
Everyone?

332
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:38,918
Hm?

333
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,724
I'll launch fireworks with you again some day.

334
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:42,782
We will.

335
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,355
We'll do it together, right here.

336
00:17:45,486 --> 00:17:46,859
I promise.

337
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:53,014
Yes, as a matter of fact... my battle...

338
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,081
It isn't just about Nunnally any more.

339
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:56,345
It's time.

340
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,678
Commence firing.

341
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:05,955
Here it comes!

342
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,891
Blow the tanker!

343
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,816
That'll scramble the sonar. 30 degrees down trim!

344
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:11,303
Engines, crash dive!

345
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:12,837
Any contact with Zero yet?

346
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:14,487
Still no response, sir.

347
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,603
We'll assume they're trying to escape underwater.

348
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,253
Send out the Portmans.

349
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,312
Confirming sonar!

350
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:36,245
The engine noise sounds like submersibles!

351
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,376
Dive us down.

352
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:38,901
If they discover us, we're done.

353
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:40,509
Fire ASROCs!

354
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:51,978
Do not panic.

355
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,545
They're guessing where we are.

356
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,566
Encircle the area centering on point theta!

357
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:58,520
We'll smoke the enemy out!

358
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:00,970
What?!

359
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:02,278
All sections report leaks!

360
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:03,262
Your orders?!

361
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:05,151
If we move, then they'll find us.

362
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,139
We hold out.

363
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:07,293
What?! But...

364
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:10,045
We're all gonna die!

365
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,666
Q-1, do you read me? Q-1!

366
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,962
That voice...

367
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,316
Zero!

368
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,409
Your instructions: 50 degrees down trim.

369
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:21,017
Head for point L-14.

370
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:22,667
Crash dive, full ahead!

371
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:23,682
Ha! He made it!

372
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:26,047
Finally! Took him long enough!

373
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:33,718
Continue depth charge drop. Maintain encirclement!

374
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,243
Fire all torpedoes to detonate dead ahead!

375
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:38,074
Set detonators for 40 seconds.

376
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,724
Straight in front of us?

377
00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:41,270
There's no enemy there!

378
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:42,526
Let's try firing them!

379
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:43,324
Huh?! What?!

380
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,453
What other choice do we have? We've got to trust him!

381
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:49,968
Set detonators, then launch all torpedoes straight ahead!

382
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,203
Torpedo launch confirmed.

383
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:55,893
Enemy location, tracked.

384
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:57,547
They're at point L-14.

385
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,359
Focus fire on that point!

386
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:01,766
If they surface, I'll capture them myself!

387
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,208
Salamander to Blue Dolphin.

388
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:05,132
Changing firing angle toward point.

389
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:07,193
Dispatch to Portman expansion zone.

390
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:08,176
Roger that.

391
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:09,410
Tightening up the dragnet.

392
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:11,191
Make sure your target lock's good.

393
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:13,320
Salamander confirming target acquired.

394
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,011
Rotating depth charge launch tubes.

395
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:16,416
Ready to fire!

396
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:22,782
Once the anchors are secure, all hands, brace for shock!

397
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:46,760
It's air?!

398
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:47,881
Now I see!

399
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:49,814
That's methane hydrate!

400
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:51,160
What the...?!

401
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,606
Our buoyancy!

402
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,072
Sir Kururugi! Bubbles!

403
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:01,040
What the...?!

404
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:05,529
H-Helm!

405
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:07,368
No good! We're capsizing!

406
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:10,878
How could...?!

407
00:21:13,645 --> 00:21:16,756
They caused giant bubbles to rise from the sea floor?!

408
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:19,022
Suzaku, look at this!

409
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:21,588
It's beyond calling for reinforcements!

410
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:24,785
Take remaining units and go after the Black Knights!

411
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,760
It's Zero!

412
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,654
Zero's heading right for me!

413
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:32,686
Master Zero!

414
00:21:32,745 --> 00:21:33,920
So this...

415
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,649
This is your answer to me?!

416
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:36,981
Don't shoot!

417
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:40,437
Shoot me, and you'll be disobeying your lady's orders.

418
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:41,460
What?!

419
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:45,393
I hereby accept the offer extended by Viceroy Nunnally!

420
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:48,556
Yes, I will join the Japan Special Zone.

421
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,510
He wouldn't!

422
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,149
Zero's surrendering to them?

423
00:21:52,174 --> 00:21:53,447
But he can't!

424
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,043
Are you serious?

425
00:21:55,068 --> 00:21:56,547
Zero orders you!

426
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:58,668
All members of the Black Knights!

427
00:21:58,712 --> 00:22:02,670
You shall participate willingly in the Special Zone!

428
00:23:38,174 --> 00:23:39,633
Perhaps you're laughing.

429
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:41,341
Perhaps you're enjoying it.

430
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:44,138
However, that isn't the truth.

431
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:48,040
I am the only one who knows the
tragedy that's hidden behind your smile.

432
00:23:48,088 --> 00:23:51,984
If but one person is aware of the
truth and holds the power to save you...

433
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:52,961
Yes...

434
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,956
I must oppose the kind of rule called "peace."

435
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,767
Oppose the system that looks down upon us,

436
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,840
despises us, and treats us like toys.

437
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,789
In the name of Zero...
