1
00:00:00,893 --> 00:00:06,700
Acting at the request of the United Federation of
Nations resolution number one for the liberation of Japan,

2
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:11,912
the Black Knights sent a landing force into
the Britannian Empire colony known as Area 11.

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,639
Targeting the troops commanded by Bismarck Waldstein,

4
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:17,081
the Knight of One, encamped on the Kyushu coast,

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,662
the main force struck, led by
General Commander Li Xing-ke.

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,204
Using this as a diversion,

7
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:26,796
a separate detachment of Black Knights
staged a lethal assault on the Tokyo settlement...

8
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:28,998
But Schneizel, Prince of Britannia,

9
00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:33,187
was waiting for them with a secret
weapon of mass destruction called F.L.E.I.J.A.

10
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:36,004
At that moment, to Zero and the Black Knights,

11
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:39,154
the very existence of this weapon was unknown.

12
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,462
New orders. Black Knights, Ikaruga fleet.

13
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:23,078
Gefjun Disturbers have immobilized all utilities,

14
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:27,018
communications, and pre-fifth generation
Knightmares throughout the Tokyo settlement.

15
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:29,762
The enemy's military might has been cut in half.

16
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:33,229
Hit all major facilities and
eliminate their ability to strike back.

17
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:37,571
We must achieve these goals before the
main forces under Schneizel's command arrive here.

18
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:39,526
By establishing our defense line,

19
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,426
we'll isolate the Government Bureau.

20
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,387
If we can seize Viceroy Nunnally,

21
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,485
then victory will be ours!

22
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,020
Viceroy Nunnally. It's Zero!

23
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,837
Zero is leading an assault!

24
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,046
Zero.

25
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:53,551
Zero's on his way?!

26
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:55,531
Look at that smile.

27
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:58,445
Now that's more like the real you, Kallen.

28
00:02:58,563 --> 00:03:01,979
It's too bad. Your wish won't come true.

29
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:05,404
Because I and my Tristan fight for Britannia.

30
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:09,958
Our first priority is to eliminate the Gefjun Disturbers

31
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:12,400
along the railway's circular routes.

32
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,842
Can we dispatch the Lancelot for that?

33
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:18,704
That'll depend upon the current
state of Sir Kururugi's mindset.

34
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:23,237
The battlefield's not the place for him
to work out his self-esteem issues.

35
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:25,574
Nina, you don't know what you're doing!

36
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,322
If we don't act, Zero will capture the Tokyo settlement!

37
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:29,753
But you're not a devicer!

38
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:32,678
You may have designed the system,
but you have no battle skills!

39
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:35,703
With the F.C.C., I can at least
defend the Government Bureau!

40
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:38,753
But are you prepared to actually fire the F.L.E.I.J.A.?

41
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:42,854
And more importantly, are you prepared to not fire it?

42
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,366
Tohdoh. Have Asahina, and Chiba establish air supremacy.

43
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:47,391
Roger!

44
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:53,137
That should cover everything except their
newer Knightmares, sixth-generation and above.

45
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:53,964
Rolo!

46
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:56,116
How is the infiltration proceeding?

47
00:03:56,313 --> 00:03:58,771
Sayoko and her group have gone on ahead of us.

48
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:01,335
We will rendezvous with them shortly. It's all arranged.

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,276
Good. Be sure you take Nunnally alive.

50
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,146
So, you've come, Suzaku.

51
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:10,360
I'm the only one who can make Lelouch,

52
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:12,635
make Zero, atone for what he's done.

53
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,618
Listen up, Zero. Call off your attack!

54
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:18,587
This unit is equipped with a high-yield tactical warhead.

55
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:22,785
If I unleash it, it will inflict catastrophic
damage beyond all known limits.

56
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,916
As if I'd believe anything that you'd say! Jeremiah!

57
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:29,451
Yes, Your Majesty!

58
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,724
Lord Jeremiah, is that you?! Why?!

59
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:34,999
Suzaku Kururugi, I owe you a debt.

60
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,232
I sympathize with you. I respect you.

61
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:38,966
However, in this situation...

62
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,847
Loyalty trumps all!

63
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,428
The Siegfried's?!

64
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:46,789
Take this! The storm of my loyalty!

65
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:51,766
You picked a bad time for piety.

66
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,006
Now!

67
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,491
Hmph.

68
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:58,247
The Sutherland Sieg seems to be effective.

69
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,593
Yes, but...

70
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:00,301
Huh?

71
00:05:00,326 --> 00:05:04,283
We can never mass-produce a one-off
unit that uses the Siegfried's system,

72
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:05,872
that's understood, right?

73
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:09,372
What I'd really like to know is
why Jeremiah's on our side now;

74
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:11,397
he's not just some knight, you know...

75
00:05:11,422 --> 00:05:15,443
That also goes for the man once
called "the Spearhead of the Empire."

76
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:16,836
What's going on?

77
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:20,564
Why? Why am I fighting against Royal Britannian forces?

78
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,804
Guilford!

79
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:23,672
Assist Jeremiah.

80
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:25,479
Slay Suzaku Kururugi!

81
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:27,629
But Princess, Kururugi is...!

82
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:30,529
There's no time to explain! It's urgent!

83
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:33,149
You must trust me and kill Kururugi!

84
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:38,687
Lord Jeremiah, the reason I'm here
is to put an end to this battle!

85
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,601
Are you saying you can do it?

86
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:43,120
Are you able to dissipate my lord's torment?

87
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:45,478
But, it shouldn't involve the people!

88
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,338
Lord Guilford, too?!

89
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:51,972
Kururugi! We each serve
our royal lords! It's not personal!

90
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:52,830
Suzaku!

91
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:54,322
Fire the F.L.E.I.J.A.!

92
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:56,180
You can kill Zero now!

93
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:59,039
I'm sorry, Nina. I won't unleash it.

94
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:02,162
But...! I swear. I will stop Zero!

95
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:12,437
Excellent. Once Suzaku's finished off,

96
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:15,545
there'll be nothing left to
stop me from taking back Nunnally.

97
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,528
Uh!

98
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,879
No one can defeat a Knight of the Round.

99
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:22,099
No one!

100
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:24,460
Gino, thank you.

101
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,954
Can't you look a bit happier when someone saves your life?

102
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,735
Hm? Lord Jeremiah?

103
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,079
So, what they said about Orange was true, huh?

104
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:33,562
Orange, you say?

105
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:37,029
That is the name of my loyalty.

106
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:41,703
This onslaught. It's all from Schneizel

107
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:43,818
Did he anticipate my moves?

108
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,468
That's right.

109
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:51,843
I'll be rendezvousing with
you a little later than I expected.

110
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:53,543
Yes, I understand.

111
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:57,046
We have just cleared all
interferences up to the 13th floor.

112
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:00,942
Don't worry. I promise, I'll find Nunnally.

113
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:03,591
Right. I'm counting on you.

114
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,278
And once you bring back Nunnally,

115
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,974
I'll have no further need for you, Rolo.

116
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,387
Big brother.

117
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:13,289
I promised you I'd find Nunnally and I will.

118
00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:16,080
And when I do, I'll kill her with my own hands.

119
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:18,135
I'm the only family you need.

120
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:20,052
Master Rolo!

121
00:07:20,077 --> 00:07:23,536
Emergency report from group two,
moving toward the hangars.

122
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,798
They say that they've sighted priority item three.

123
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,409
I won't! I refuse to flee this way!

124
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:33,058
The Prime Minister has personally ordered it.

125
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,500
My brother Schneizel?

126
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,262
The others cannot leave you behind,

127
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:39,174
so if you stay, all must stay and die.

128
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,214
Ha! You're no match for my Gareth!

129
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,897
Keep dreaming! We've got full air superiority!

130
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:48,729
We won't yield!

131
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,342
Oh, no... Tohdoh...

132
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,136
I owe you deeply, Asahina.

133
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:57,741
You've got future plans in the works, right?

134
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,620
Uh, so what's our next move?

135
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,622
Zero ordered us not to attack the bureau itself

136
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:06,397
until Viceroy Nunnally has been captured alive.

137
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:07,917
Zero, huh...

138
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:12,163
They're all... They're all fighting, while I'm...!

139
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:14,861
We'll defend it! No matter what!

140
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:16,745
Lord Guilford has lost his sanity,

141
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,205
but so long as we Glaston Knights
still perform with courage and valor,

142
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,730
we uphold Princess Cornelia's honor!

143
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,169
Answer me, Zero!

144
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,602
If you started this battle
because of me, then let me explain...

145
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,701
Filled with conceit as ever.

146
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,084
You betrayed your father and all Japan.

147
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:47,609
'Course you betray your friends, too. That's who you are.

148
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,441
Uh. What's this?

149
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:52,487
Anya? Wait!

150
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:55,420
Suzaku, leave Zero to Anya.

151
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,469
Which one do you think is stronger?

152
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:01,210
Your shield or my Stark Hadron cannon?

153
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,047
Even this shield can't withstand this for very long.

154
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,243
Contact lost with the Shinkiro!

155
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:09,802
Zero?

156
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:13,000
Apparently he's engaging in combat with the Knight of Six!

157
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:15,152
What're your orders for Hashimoto?

158
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:17,345
And we also have to defend Kujuukuri.

159
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,228
Uh... well, I, uh...

160
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:21,045
Patch Hashimoto over here to me.

161
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,095
Sugiyama, do we have any units we can send to help Zero?!

162
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,342
Uh... just Tamaki.

163
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:28,275
Yes,

164
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,286
Viceroy Nunnally is being put aboard the escape craft.

165
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:34,727
But until the Gefjun Disturbers
have all been deactivated...

166
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,073
Right. We can't use a Knightmare
without being targeted by the enemy.

167
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:41,898
Yes. Understood.

168
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:45,733
Who's going to execute Kallen Kozuki?

169
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:47,256
Sir George.

170
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,591
But are you sure about this? Viceroy Nunnally didn't...

171
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:52,087
It's for her own good,

172
00:09:52,112 --> 00:09:54,946
despite her feeble attempts to assert herself.

173
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,351
Sayoko!

174
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:02,876
You're looking well.

175
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,818
Master Rolo has gone on to secure Miss Nunnally.

176
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:09,320
We came to give you a present, Miss Kallen. It should fit.

177
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:13,244
I think Miss Milly's former fiancé was behind the changes.

178
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,460
There seems to be a draft instruction manual with it.

179
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:19,781
Shall we try to get it working?

180
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,344
It's different, somehow...

181
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:27,838
We can't stretch our battle lines any further.

182
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:30,176
We're already at the breaking point now.

183
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:34,544
All Gefjun Disturbers in Ikebukuro
and Sugamo have been destroyed.

184
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:38,078
Now we can reinforce our lines with
5th-generation Knightmares and older.

185
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:41,223
We're also bringing the Government
Bureau's defense system back on line.

186
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:43,869
The momentum has shifted in our favor.

187
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,294
The lights!

188
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:50,380
We're out of time!

189
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:52,941
Kinoshita, haven't you found the viceroy yet?!

190
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:56,007
The commanders have freed Captain Kozuki, but... Uh!

191
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:57,157
Kinoshita!

192
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,916
Hey! Are you okay?!

193
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,944
I sent the data... on Zero... from my system.

194
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:12,239
That's all I can... do.

195
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,451
What the hell?! I can't find him!

196
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,630
Where's this battle Zero is fighting?!

197
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:21,384
He's my best bud!

198
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,324
Just a little more.

199
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:29,592
Again? Something is...!

200
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,151
The Mordred just... Uh!

201
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:38,295
Zero.

202
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,139
Face it, your Black Rebellion is doomed to fail.

203
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:44,844
They sent another Knight of the Round?

204
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,452
Here's a question:

205
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:51,157
What do people value most? Answer...

206
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:53,099
Their life of course!

207
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,890
The basic system's the same?

208
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:14,177
We're still trying to determine
Master Zero's current position.

209
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:16,093
Shall I transfer the I.F.F. data?

210
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:17,558
Yes, please.

211
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,619
Let's see... Guren S.E.I.T.E.N.

212
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:30,269
Eight. It could be.

213
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:32,040
Confirm activation.

214
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:33,848
Activation, confirmed.

215
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:35,041
You're good to go.

216
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,603
Once the Guren is launched, we'll return to our mission.

217
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:40,911
Right. You take care of the viceroy. I'll help Zero.

218
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:42,932
Agreed. Well, then...

219
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:44,072
Guren!

220
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,495
S.E.I.T.E.N. Eight Elements...

221
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,397
Launching!

222
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:47,846
Now launch!

223
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:56,926
What the...?! Huh?

224
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,987
Father, I let you down. Forgive me!

225
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:04,797
David!

226
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:07,809
Was that Kozuki?

227
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,922
But, that unit she's flying...

228
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:15,026
At this rate...

229
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:19,371
This shield's the only good thing about your Knightmare.

230
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:22,352
Valkyrie squadron, don't let him go, no matter what!

231
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,489
Yes, my lord!

232
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:24,532
I'm in trouble!

233
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:26,568
I used up too much energy with the Mordred!

234
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:28,586
Zero. Do you read me, Zero?!

235
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:30,222
Where are my reinforcements?!

236
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:31,747
Tamaki will be there soon.

237
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:34,022
But a picked up a fleet over the Pacific.

238
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,428
What about it?

239
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,041
Zero, it's me!

240
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,881
It seems to be the Britannian Emperor's flagship.

241
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:40,698
What?!

242
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:42,973
He's coming to Area 11 as well?!

243
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:49,461
No. His Majesty is not coming to the battlefield.

244
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:51,414
What makes you so certain of that?

245
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,348
Do you think he cares about those mundane things?

246
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,877
The day we call "today"?

247
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,366
He doesn't.

248
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,805
Let Zero go!

249
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,414
Or you'll have to deal with me,
Shinichiro Tamaki, his best bud!

250
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:07,981
Dammit! This always happens to me!

251
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:10,009
Yes! Now's my chance!

252
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:12,689
Just what I was waiting for, Zero!

253
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:15,256
To go into attack mode, you dropped your shield.

254
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:19,172
Now, I will take what you value most and blow it away!

255
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:23,889
In this position, I can't...! Nunnally!

256
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:25,200
Hm?

257
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:29,621
Huh? They got me?

258
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:30,771
Kewell!

259
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:39,602
Be careful what you wish for, Vampire of Britannia.

260
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,614
Really?

261
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:42,440
Is that Kallen?

262
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,257
Zero. I'm here.

263
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:45,522
You're elite guard,

264
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:48,063
Kallen Kozoki, is back on the battle line!

265
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,806
You thieves! That's mine! All mine!

266
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:53,843
Not quite. I did some of the upgrades, remember?

267
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:54,615
Oh, right.

268
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,973
It's actually a collaboration. What am I talking about?!

269
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,853
With a capable devicer, even at 60% output,

270
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:03,253
that unit can cut the other Knightmares to ribbons!

271
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,406
That's the Earl of Pudding's work and
Cecile's energy wings! How dare they?!

272
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,928
Altering my Guren without my permission!

273
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:13,161
Still, now that we've got
Kallen back in the combat zone...

274
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:15,145
It will even up the battle.

275
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:19,183
Sir Bradley, you have permission to destroy the Guren.

276
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,103
Irrelevant!

277
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,391
Killing is all one should do on the battlefield!

278
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,434
Ah, ah, ah!

279
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:40,215
Eleven.

280
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,870
Do you know the prime truth of the battlefield?

281
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:45,523
Kill a man off the field, and you're a criminal.

282
00:15:45,548 --> 00:15:48,610
But kill him on it, and you're a big hero.

283
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:49,602
So.

284
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:53,173
The Vampire of Britannia wants
to be a hero now, is that it?

285
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:54,592
No, not at all.

286
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:58,492
War officially allows me to take what people value most:

287
00:15:58,517 --> 00:15:59,767
their lives.

288
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,306
Some knight. You're barely a scoundrel.

289
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,067
And now...

290
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,592
And now what?

291
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:11,952
That's not gonna work.

292
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:14,810
Ah, but now I've got you in close range.

293
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:19,263
What?

294
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:22,502
Question: What do you value the most?

295
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,352
Your own pitiful life?

296
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:26,459
You think an Eleven can threaten me?!

297
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:28,275
Send a postcard.

298
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:33,554
My life! My life is taken...

299
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:35,516
...by a lowly Eleven?!

300
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:39,355
Good work, Kallen!

301
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,660
Now get back to the Government Bureau and get Nunnally!

302
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:43,383
I won't let you!

303
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:44,960
Suzaku Kururugi!

304
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:46,438
Easy now!

305
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:49,099
Kallen! Stand aside!

306
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,453
Forget it, Suzaku!

307
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:53,543
No! Deflected?! The Hadron blaster?

308
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,666
Kallen.

309
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:58,266
So in the end, you chose the name Kozuki over Stadtfelt.

310
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,255
That's right,

311
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,715
which means you and I do battle once again.

312
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,012
So, should I be happy or sad about that, Gino?

313
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:07,951
Why don't we just enjoy it?

314
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,446
Suzaku. Let me settle things with Kallen, okay?

315
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:14,422
It won't be easy.

316
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:16,484
I'm sorry, Gino.

317
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:20,271
This pilot isn't the kind of opponent
you can mess around with.

318
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:23,704
Tohdoh's forces have broken
through to the enemy's command ship!

319
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:28,377
Impossible! My Gareth!

320
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:32,312
Raise all the shields in Area Four!

321
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:34,087
We're just after Schneizel's head!

322
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:36,641
Assume Slash and Encircle Formation!

323
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,637
Tohdoh.

324
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:40,456
I'm sending you some testimony that Kinoshita gathered.

325
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:42,107
This is hardly the time!

326
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:43,840
Listen to it and you'll understand.

327
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:45,656
We can't trust Commander Zero.

328
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:46,516
Huh?

329
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,710
I'm going into the government bureau to capture Rolo.

330
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:58,891
Explosion detected in section 4-I of the ship!

331
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,046
Could it be... Chigusa?

332
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,588
I need to bring this battle into close range.

333
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:10,613
Suzaku! Kallen's not the one you need to fight! Hit Zero!

334
00:18:14,536 --> 00:18:17,019
Your escape route is towards the Ikebukuro front.

335
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:19,307
But there are still Black Knights in your fight path.

336
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,832
Wait till we've mopped them up before you launch.

337
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:24,439
Master Zero, we've found the viceroy!

338
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:26,071
I see! Excellent work!

339
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:29,211
Master Rolo will escort us out of here
as soon as he steals a Knightmare.

340
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:30,402
He'll have it in a moment.

341
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:33,359
Understood! Victory is within our reach.

342
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:35,727
Kallen! Finish off Suzaku now!

343
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:37,504
He's the only thing standing in our way!

344
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:38,237
Right!

345
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:39,789
Get out of there, Suzaku!

346
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,493
You can't beat that Guren!

347
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:42,757
But, Zero...!

348
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:43,627
Ohhh!

349
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:45,110
Self-centered brat!

350
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,721
It's... It's too great.

351
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:51,791
The difference in unit performance.

352
00:18:58,223 --> 00:18:59,092
At this rate,

353
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:02,167
we're going to lose Sir Kururugi as well as Sir Bradley.

354
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,682
Fire it, Suzaku! Use the F.L.E.I.J.A.!

355
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:07,207
No, Nina, power is in the threat.

356
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:09,107
If we actually use it...

357
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:14,372
I can't win...

358
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:17,459
Goodbye, Suzaku.

359
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,737
Miss Nunnally!

360
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:23,254
Kill Suzaku! Do it!

361
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,738
Unleash the F.L.E.I.J.A.! You can still save yourself!

362
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:31,117
But... if I do that... Even if it costs me my life...

363
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:34,987
That's right. This is redemption...

364
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,070
I have to accept it.

365
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:40,886
This is where I'm going to... to...

366
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,116
Live!

367
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:48,520
I... must... live!

368
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,335
Is this... F.L.E.I.J.A.?

369
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,084
Fall back! All units, retreat!

370
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:10,131
Why are the Britannians running?

371
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:14,350
We have to retreat, too! Asahina, are you reading me?!

372
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,259
Get out of the Government Bureau! Asahina!

373
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,368
Something's wrong!

374
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:20,799
Pull the Ikaruga back at maximum speed!

375
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:22,600
You in the Sutherland, what are you doing?

376
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,384
They've fired the F.L.E.I.J.A.

377
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,004
Fired the F.L.E.I.J.A.?

378
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:28,579
Could that be the weapon Suzaku was talking about?

379
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:32,238
Nunnally!

380
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,354
General Tohdoh, I tried to warn you!

381
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:45,064
Why did they use the F.L.E.I.J.A. here?!

382
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:54,183
Princess, save yourself! Princess!

383
00:20:57,578 --> 00:21:01,981
Princess, you must live! Please live!

384
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:19,268
Rolo...

385
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,248
Yes, big brother?

386
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:24,347
Could you please let me speak with Nunnally?

387
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,683
Um. Well...

388
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,889
I can't reach Sayoko.

389
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:33,247
Listen. Big brother. We weren't in time.

390
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:35,669
Nunnally was caught in that flash of light.

391
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:38,422
I'm not asking you about anything like that now.

392
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,882
I just wanna talk to Nunnally, that's all.

393
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:43,713
But... Nunnally is dead!

394
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:46,353
She's dead, big brother!

395
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:48,043
Don't lie to me!

396
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:50,950
Please, Rolo.

397
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:54,335
Could you, just for a moment...

398
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:59,054
Please... let me speak with Nunnally.
