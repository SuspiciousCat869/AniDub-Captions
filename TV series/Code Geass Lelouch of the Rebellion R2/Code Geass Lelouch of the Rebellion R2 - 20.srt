1
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:06,558
Two thousand ten of the imperial calendar.

2
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:12,841
The Holy Britannian Empire invaded Japan to
gain control of its underground Sakuradite resources.

3
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:17,559
My father Genbu called for do-or-die resistance.

4
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:19,712
To stop him, I...

5
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:21,993
It was childish.

6
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:25,008
A tragically childish, impulsive act.

7
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:29,106
I thought to myself "This will stop the war."

8
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:32,472
I thought that there would be no more needless bloodshed.

9
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:36,235
But I was wrong. The fighting didn't stop.

10
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:42,704
All I wanted was to keep people from killing each other.

11
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:49,560
No! It was Geass!

12
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:52,610
The power that can twist a man's will!

13
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:57,070
In the end, it's the same.

14
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,005
I...! Hm?

15
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,895
I didn't know. I didn't understand that...

16
00:01:04,136 --> 00:01:06,049
That it would be this horrible.

17
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:07,868
That so many people would...

18
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,641
That I... That it would be a...

19
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,366
Massacre.

20
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:12,206
Uh!

21
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:14,452
It's a big hit, Nina.

22
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:17,766
The F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead has proven itself.

23
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:20,735
Britannia can't lose now.

24
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:00,697
The Emperor was headed for Area 11,

25
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,989
but he never showed up in the Tokyo Settlement...

26
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,172
Which means he had another objective.

27
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:08,772
His path could have taken him to Shikine Island. No!

28
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,328
The ruins on Kamine Island?!

29
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:19,458
According to the materials left behind by
Director V.V. and our brethren, this location is optimal.

30
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:22,342
It will synchronize with
ancient ruins throughout the world.

31
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:26,697
With this action, we can make the
Sword of Akasha manageable once again.

32
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:32,505
Heh. I never imagined I would use
such an ancient device. It's quite astounding.

33
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,052
So, you're ready to begin then.

34
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,844
What's the Shinkiroh's location?!

35
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:47,394
Sir, we don't know yet.

36
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:50,627
Tsk! We have the Britannians assisting us now!

37
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:53,842
As soon as you find it, alert all forces and destroy it!

38
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:54,867
Yes, sir!

39
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:57,488
Master is in danger. Uh!

40
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:03,550
It's been ages since we were face to face like this!

41
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:04,924
It's me!

42
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:05,904
Uh!

43
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:08,427
C.C., don't tell me you've actually...

44
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:10,169
I'm so sorry!

45
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,100
What are you doing,

46
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,936
closing yourself up in here again like this?

47
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:35,940
C.C.? C.C.!

48
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:36,965
Hm?

49
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:37,966
Who are you?

50
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,240
It's me. See?

51
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:44,223
It's you! So, you've chased me all the way in here, now?

52
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,898
Are you that worried about Lelouch, Marianne?

53
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,892
Oh, come on! Do you really think

54
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,790
I'm such an ideal mother that that's all I think about?

55
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:53,888
Then why did you come here for me?

56
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:55,548
Because so much has changed;

57
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:57,758
I need to know if you're still on my side.

58
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:58,417
Huh?

59
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:03,083
C.C., why did you seal off your own Code
just when you had what you wanted?

60
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:06,816
Charles was ready to grant
your greatest wish: the wish to die.

61
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:08,094
But you stopped him.

62
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,713
Even I don't know why I did it.

63
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:12,231
Actually, I'm a little shocked that I did.

64
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:16,229
Then you have to find the answer, in the real world.

65
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:17,119
Hm...

66
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:19,880
I've made up my mind, and that's all there is to it.

67
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,477
How typical of you.

68
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:22,333
Why is that?

69
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:25,550
The one who always comes in
and messes around with my life.

70
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,967
Because I appreciate what you did.

71
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,999
At least as far as giving me my Geass Power.

72
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:33,225
And you never fulfilled your contract.

73
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,833
If that's what you think, will you come with me now?

74
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,358
Yes, but wait a minute.

75
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:38,981
There's something I can't leave behind.

76
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,027
Hm?

77
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,546
Was there any chance to tell Anya to stay?

78
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:47,058
We'll need someone here to take custody of Zero.

79
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:49,982
So, what do you plan to do, Villetta?

80
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:51,590
Stay with the Black Knights?

81
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:52,406
Uh.

82
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:56,004
Neither my brother nor myself plan to punish you.

83
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:59,923
After all, now that things have
moved forward to the next level,

84
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:02,748
I'd say we have no authority to act against you.

85
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:04,440
Well, I...

86
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,588
I'm probably the last person to say this,

87
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:09,854
but noble rank isn't everything.

88
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:10,581
Uh...

89
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,275
There's no choice.

90
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,098
We have to announce that Zero was killed in battle.

91
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:17,373
Even though we haven't found Lelouch yet?

92
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:19,823
You want people to believe he's dead?

93
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:21,379
Pardon me.

94
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:24,619
I understand that Zero has betrayed us and all of that,

95
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,946
but do you plan on telling everyone about Geass?

96
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,694
We can't, they'd say we were crazy;

97
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:31,650
we'd lose all credibility. There's no way.

98
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,750
And what if the real Zero appears later?

99
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:36,446
How exactly would he prove that he's the real Zero?

100
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:37,508
Uh?

101
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:40,613
In the end, the masked hero is merely a symbol.

102
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:43,273
He can't re-establish himself without us.

103
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:48,217
Oh, really? That's very good news! Excellent.

104
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:52,733
Yeah! They finally got the cell phones working again
and we got the news that everyone is okay!

105
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:54,500
It was a gigasmic relief.

106
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:58,933
Ah... Oh, yeah, your room was destroyed,
but there's space in the clubhouse.

107
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,542
I see. Is the student council room all right?

108
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:05,359
Mm-hm. By the way, where's Rolo? Is he with you?

109
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:09,992
Uh, Yeah... Listen, Rivalz...

110
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:12,371
Can you tell the Prez something for me?

111
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:16,342
Tell her I won't be able to keep my promise
to shoot off fireworks with everyone.

112
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:19,656
Huh? What was that supposed to mean?

113
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,279
Sorry, Rivalz and good luck.

114
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:27,831
Kallen, take care of C.C...

115
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,074
I have to kill him, even if I die doing it.

116
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:33,763
I'm gambling that I can kill an immortal who never ages

117
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,863
and who is immune to the power of Geass.

118
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:38,479
That's the only chance I have left!

119
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:41,581
Preparations are complete, Your Majesty.

120
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:43,939
Very well. Let us begin.

121
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:48,308
I feel something shaking.

122
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,748
Oh, really?

123
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:09,140
All relic systems are now synchronized.

124
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:12,606
With this, shall end the world of the existing God.

125
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:14,873
Destruction and creation...

126
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:17,862
Ragnarok has finally begun!

127
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:18,924
Your Majesty,

128
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:21,296
Prince Schneizel sent a report on the conflict in...

129
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:24,523
Did I not tell you to leave these mundane affairs to him?

130
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,244
Mundane affairs?

131
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:30,285
Has the truth finally begun to dawn on you, Schneizel?

132
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,935
If so, it's too late. This game
called war is already obsolete.

133
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,425
This is KT Television.

134
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,425
Since our studios were lost in the blast,

135
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,067
we've set up a temporary studio at Ashford Academy

136
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:46,456
to bring you this emergency news alert.

137
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:49,581
A short while ago, we received official word

138
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:53,250
that Prince Schneizel has signed
a cease fire with the Black Knights.

139
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:55,796
In addition, according to an official announcement,

140
00:08:55,821 --> 00:08:58,021
Zero, leader and CEO of the Black Knights,

141
00:08:58,046 --> 00:08:59,919
was killed in the final battle.

142
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,779
Zero was wounded in the fight for the Tokyo Settlement

143
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:06,288
and subsequently received medical
treatment aboard the flagship Ikaruga,

144
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,831
but he succumbed to his injuries
before daybreak this morning.

145
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:17,574
Master Zero!

146
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,077
No! No!

147
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:19,656
It can't be true!

148
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:21,631
What's the meaning of this, Ohgi?

149
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:23,817
Is it true that Zero is dead?!

150
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:27,134
Yeah. I'm afraid it's just as the media's reporting.

151
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,527
Could I at least see his face to confirm it?

152
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:32,035
Sorry, but we're busy right now, Jeremiah.

153
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,883
It'll have to wait till later.

154
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,473
Are you serious about this?

155
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:39,217
The Black Knights don't need Zero anymore!

156
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:41,867
We've only gotten this far because of him!

157
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,824
To just throw him away like he's disposable...

158
00:09:44,873 --> 00:09:47,873
He's the one who treated us like we were disposable!

159
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,879
He fooled us from the very beginning!

160
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:53,187
With that despicable Geass power!

161
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:56,254
I called him my friend! The best friend that I ever had!

162
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,779
I loved that guy more than my own life!

163
00:09:58,804 --> 00:09:59,696
But then...

164
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:02,502
We learned the truth. Think about the Black Rebellion.

165
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,744
He was ready to dispose of Ohgi then.

166
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,152
No. Even before that.

167
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,719
That's right. People are...

168
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:11,685
...more than just game pieces!

169
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,206
Their lives matter. That's why we're fighting!

170
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:20,177
Lelouch vi Britannia now commands you!

171
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:24,674
From this moment forward, you shall obey my orders!

172
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:46,554
Damn, she's good.

173
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:50,427
Lloyd, can you give me an
update on the status of the Lancelot?

174
00:10:50,452 --> 00:10:53,810
You know the status. You saw
the condition of the core luminous.

175
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:56,839
No, I'm talking about the Lancelot Albion.

176
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,700
It's ready to roll out.

177
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:03,246
Albion? So what's that about?

178
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:05,548
Oh, I shouldn't have mentioned that.

179
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:07,742
It's a custom Knightmare built for Suzaku.

180
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,833
But in the state of mind you're in,
I don't want you going near it.

181
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:14,110
Lloyd, as the Knight of Seven, I could order you to do it.

182
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:16,051
My unease grows worse and worse.

183
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:20,852
Suzaku, didn't you say that you had to
be prepared not to fire the F.L.E.I.J.A.?

184
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:24,133
Miss Cecile, what's the fundamental purpose of any weapon?

185
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:27,702
Sir Kururugi, you want to debate this like a school boy?

186
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:28,313
The point is...

187
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:31,385
Drop it, Suzaku. This isn't like you.

188
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,660
Huh? Your Highness!

189
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:35,226
It's all right. You can relax.

190
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:36,833
Princess Cornelia!

191
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:38,906
It's been far too long, Your Highness!

192
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,110
Right.

193
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,350
Where is Lord Guilford?

194
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,089
Uh! Well...

195
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:46,829
Cornelia, I'm afraid Lord Guilford was caught in the...

196
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:49,819
He went missing after he
launched the F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

197
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:52,135
It was his heroism that saved all of us.

198
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,598
Guilford?!

199
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:55,873
We may not know if he's alive or dead,

200
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,317
but he did a great deed.

201
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,983
You should be proud of him.
He served you well as your knight.

202
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:01,341
What are you saying?!

203
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:03,939
I'm the one who fired the F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead.

204
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:05,575
That was my deed of honor!

205
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,904
The feat I needed to become the Knight of One!

206
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,287
Hold on, Suzaku...

207
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,810
Is this manipulation designed
to protect Lord Guilford's legacy?

208
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:13,918
What are you saying?

209
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,609
I suggest you stop, Suzaku.

210
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,717
No. I've been naive up till now.

211
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:18,701
No, you?

212
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:22,987
Stubbornly maintaining that the means
are more important than the end result.

213
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:25,614
I was idealistic and self-righteous.

214
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,464
Perhaps, but...

215
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:29,467
In any case, I insist on what is due me, Your Highness.

216
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:31,034
Make me the Knight of One.

217
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,049
Huh?

218
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:37,569
You've crossed the line into insubordination, Kururugi!

219
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:43,814
Anyway, only an Emperor has the power
to dub a warrior the Knight of One. Which means...

220
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:48,027
Which means... I shall rise to this.

221
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:49,148
Huh?!

222
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:49,981
Brother!

223
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:52,710
If I become the emperor, it will remove the problem;

224
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:54,052
it's really as simple as that.

225
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,439
Highness, what you said just now is close...

226
00:12:56,464 --> 00:12:58,846
Gino. What are you planning to do?!

227
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:02,725
Prince Schneizel, can you please tell us all
what has lead you to make this decision?

228
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,727
He considers our affairs "trivial" and " mundane."

229
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:10,574
That's how His Majesty referred to
our mortal struggle with the Black Knights.

230
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,241
But...

231
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:13,108
You've seen it too, Cornelia.

232
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,031
How absorbed Father is with his dangerous research.

233
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:17,796
How he abandons the throne.

234
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:18,802
It's true.

235
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,572
He treats diplomacy and war
like they were meaningless trifles.

236
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:24,597
A man who's lost interest in this world

237
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:28,637
who sees his people locked in a life
and death struggle, and shrugs in indifference,

238
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:30,940
such a man has no right to rule!

239
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:34,248
He's finally made up his mind. But...

240
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,479
Could it be? A coup d'état?!

241
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:38,860
That's wrong...

242
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:41,556
Your Highness, as a Knight of the Round,

243
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:43,914
I can arrange an audience with the Emperor.

244
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,790
Please give me your order to assassinate him.

245
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:48,127
Suzaku!

246
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,235
If I'm predestined to be a killer, then so be it.

247
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:54,116
Gino, I know what I am and what I must do.

248
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:56,656
What matters... are results!

249
00:13:56,822 --> 00:13:59,827
Now then, Your Majesty, as we previously arranged,

250
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:03,437
I'll conduct negotiations with
Prime Minister Schneizel in Tokyo.

251
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:07,044
But, Kaguya. After all, Zero was your husband.

252
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:10,069
Losing Master Zero is a terrible blow it's true...

253
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,115
But we can't dwell on that when our nations are in danger.

254
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,598
We must turn his death to our best advantage.

255
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:19,829
And honestly, I know I called
myself his wife, but he and I were just...

256
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:24,602
That is, in the end, we were married, but, in heart only.

257
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:27,196
His Majesty has landed on Kamine Island?

258
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:28,291
Yes, my lord,

259
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:30,764
along with an unknown group of subjects.

260
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:34,300
Unknown group... Survivors of the Geass Order?

261
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:38,248
Are you serious about sending
Suzaku to assassinate your own father?

262
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:42,148
Gino, do you want this war
to remain in a stalemate forever?

263
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:43,377
What do you mean?

264
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:45,598
The true nature of people is this:

265
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:46,998
they want to be controlled.

266
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:49,802
By their nation, their religion, their traditions,

267
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:52,171
and by figures of grand authority.

268
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:55,948
Above all, the Emperor of Britannia must play his part.

269
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:58,760
So now you're the one to play that part, Your Highness?

270
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:00,354
The grand authority?

271
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:03,837
If I am called upon to do it, then perhaps...

272
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:05,869
Perhaps? How so?

273
00:15:05,894 --> 00:15:09,837
Did you know that the word
"authority" actually has another meaning?

274
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,248
Was this treason Schneizel's idea?

275
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:16,946
It was my decision.

276
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:19,713
Majesty, I appreciate your patronage,

277
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:21,210
that cannot be questioned.

278
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:24,231
But, you are guilty of two crimes!

279
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,329
Oh?

280
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:28,966
First, abandoning your responsibilities as Emperor.

281
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:30,773
And second...

282
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,704
...dirtying your hands with the power of Geass!

283
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:35,646
Is that a capital crime?

284
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:38,643
Geass takes good men and bends them to evil.

285
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,148
You knew that.

286
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,786
You could have saved Euphy. It would have been so easy.

287
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:45,637
But instead you abandoned her!

288
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:47,396
So what?

289
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:51,139
You also drove Lelouch and Nunnally away;

290
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:53,206
their despair is in this sword.

291
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:54,475
Die!

292
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:58,010
Lord Waldstein! What are you doing here?

293
00:15:58,035 --> 00:16:00,569
Did you think you were the only one who knew about Geass?

294
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:02,052
It takes many forms.

295
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:04,452
Who could be foolish enough to relax his guard

296
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:07,977
with a man who constantly betrays everyone who trusts him.

297
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,937
Bismarck, I leave this mundane matter to you.

298
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:12,902
Yes, Your Majesty, so be it.

299
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,314
Hold on!

300
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,152
Ohgi? This is Hong Gu. Requesting landing clearance.

301
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:25,677
We've brought Her Majesty and Lady Kaguya with us.

302
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,077
Uh, right.

303
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:29,923
Uh. Then I'll contact Schneizel's staff as well.

304
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,650
I thought Ohgi had finally changed a bit, but no.

305
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:35,896
Definitely miscast.

306
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,754
His true nature is to be defensive.

307
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:44,181
No. The Geass command that compels me to live.

308
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:46,389
It's screaming at me to run away!

309
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:49,794
Is the Knight of One really that dangerous an opponent?!

310
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:51,881
I've left my weakness!

311
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:54,864
"Weakness?" Fool, what you call "weakness"...

312
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,846
That was the source of your strength.

313
00:16:57,871 --> 00:17:00,529
Gentleness and compassion are what drove you!

314
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:03,683
Take those away and there's nothing left but violence.

315
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:05,316
Which means...

316
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:08,685
You will die here, Suzaku Kururugi!

317
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:10,499
Huh?!

318
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,416
My name is Lelouch vi Britannia!

319
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,977
I am the eldest son of Empress Marianne!

320
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,708
The prince who was abandoned by his empire!

321
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,642
We can't contact His Majesty!

322
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,414
If you encounter anyone suspicious,

323
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,019
don't capture them, kill them!

324
00:17:33,044 --> 00:17:34,575
Yes, my lord!

325
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,481
What are you doing?!

326
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:39,079
Why are you shooting at... Ah!

327
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:41,091
Why are we attacking our own forces?!

328
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:42,158
We're still confirming,

329
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:44,433
but we can't contact gun turret room 3!

330
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,783
Someone may have seized the weapons system!

331
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:48,456
Respond! Turret room 3!

332
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:52,022
If you do not respond now, we will remove you by force!

333
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,614
Follow us, the royal guard!

334
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,819
We'll eliminate all enemies!

335
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,256
Yes, my lord!

336
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:00,452
Uh!

337
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:03,788
The reinforcements from the
Shikine Island base are attacking us!

338
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:06,987
We're getting reports of our
own guards turning on us as well!

339
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:07,956
This is...

340
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:09,272
A damned rebellion!

341
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,504
Yes, my lord! Where is the Emperor?

342
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:15,800
His Majesty is in the safest
possible place. For now, we...

343
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,869
Lelouch! It's my burden!

344
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,081
Ah!

345
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,096
Who is in command aboard the Great Britannia now?!

346
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:28,662
Lady Monica Krushevsky,

347
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:30,354
the honorable Knight of 12.

348
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:33,654
Very well! In that case, I'm taking the Galahad!

349
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,771
You still can't contact the Mordred?

350
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:37,875
No, my lord.

351
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,256
Although I think she's headed for Kamine Island.

352
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:41,219
I see.

353
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:45,827
That means she must have just received
the intelligence and is on her way to His Majesty.

354
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,181
Along with Suzaku? No, this is...

355
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:52,825
My apologies, Lady Kaguya.

356
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,398
The meeting will have to be postponed.

357
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:56,375
We need to go to Kamine Island at once.

358
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,964
I see. Then we shall go with you, as well.

359
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:04,423
There's only one person I can think of who would
be attacking the Britannian emperor in this situation.

360
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:06,206
I believe we all know who that is.

361
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:07,879
I agree, Lady Kaguya.

362
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:09,112
That changes things.

363
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:11,966
We have a few points to verify before we go on.

364
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:15,069
We can continue the meeting
once this matter has been settled.

365
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:19,117
If anyone wishes to stop me, let them try!

366
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:22,548
If there's anyone who can go beyond my despair!

367
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:30,414
Our own forces turning on us.

368
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:34,404
I can't tell friend from foe,
and I can't just destroy them all. Hm?

369
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:36,527
Anya!

370
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,389
Surely you aren't part of this, too?

371
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:41,542
So, the Knight of One is
behind this traitorous coup d'etat?!

372
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:42,677
What's that?!

373
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:53,323
Don't jump to conclusions!

374
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:55,139
How can I trust you?!

375
00:19:57,272 --> 00:19:59,187
The enemy is from Shikine Island!

376
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:00,787
Monica can testify to it!

377
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:03,389
I understand now. Forgive me, Lord Bismark.

378
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,529
All I ask of you is your recognition.

379
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,179
How damaged is your knightmare?

380
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:09,162
My air combat mobility is dropping,

381
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:12,273
but perhaps I can intercept
the rebel forces on the ground.

382
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:15,396
Understood. I'll defend the royal flagship.

383
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:18,660
You're quite the actress, aren't you?

384
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,846
We don't have time to explain
things to Bismarck right now.

385
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:25,038
Since I questioned his loyalty, he didn't question mine.

386
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:26,414
Putting him on the defensive.

387
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:29,831
That's just the sort of "flash"
I'd expect from Marianne the Flash.

388
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:32,329
And it's just perfect for Lelouch's mother.

389
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:33,833
So, what comes next?

390
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,637
Hm?

391
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:37,121
Well, we have to save him, don't we?

392
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:54,823
God! Hear me now!

393
00:20:54,872 --> 00:20:58,027
The time has come to settle this!

394
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,489
You're wrong.

395
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,525
You lift your voice to call upon God,

396
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,758
but it's not God you need to settle things with,

397
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:06,421
Charles zi Britannia...

398
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:10,531
It's me... your son!

399
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:12,514
And how will you challenge me?

400
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,919
Neither gun, nor sword, will have any effect on me.

401
00:21:15,944 --> 00:21:17,944
Nor will the power of your Geass.

402
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:20,302
Nothing you can do can kill me!

403
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:22,333
But I don't need to kill you.

404
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:24,250
By coming to this parallel realm,

405
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:26,358
you've already ensured my victory.

406
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:27,548
Huh?

407
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:35,833
You've sealed the exit?!

408
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:41,139
Yes. You, I, and the power of Geass
are now sealed in this space together.

409
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:44,472
And, If you can no longer interfere with the real world,

410
00:21:44,497 --> 00:21:47,454
then all your plans will be meaningless in the end.

411
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:49,479
May as well be dead!

412
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:52,139
Lelouch!

413
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:55,113
This system which you created has become a prison

414
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:57,804
which now holds your own soul captive!

415
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:03,021
Now, let us repent! Suffering together for all eternity!

416
00:23:37,272 --> 00:23:40,772
Now I see. Perhaps I did choose the wrong path.

417
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:43,047
Perhaps Suzaku was right all along.

418
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:45,168
It's the means that are important.

419
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:47,299
But I can't back down now.

420
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:51,022
For Euphy and Shirley. Nunnally, and Rolo.

421
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:53,574
That's right. I must face him!

422
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,345
I have to wager everything I am against this man!

423
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,049
Charles, the Emperor of Britannia!

424
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:02,088
It doesn't matter what happens to me in the end,

425
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:04,747
but I must win!
