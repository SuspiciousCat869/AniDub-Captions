1
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:05,794
To this day, no one has understood the urgent desires

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,260
and heaving emotions within the young Britannian Lelouch,

3
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:12,637
despite his expectations for the final outcome.

4
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:14,878
Before he can go forward,

5
00:00:14,903 --> 00:00:18,165
there is one more enemy Lelouch must confront.

6
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:21,940
However, this one is different than all others.

7
00:00:21,965 --> 00:00:24,912
For this enemy is human nature itself.

8
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:28,517
Hope and atonement. Freedom and solitude.

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,255
That mass of matter and energy known as the world...

10
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:36,778
Keeps on flowing forward
despite the desires of any one man.

11
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:29,060
Charles, have you learned anything by becoming emperor?

12
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:32,347
Yes, big brother. All people are liars.

13
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:36,125
And this vast nation we call Britannia never changes.

14
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,679
That may be true,

15
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:39,990
but it's just human nature, isn't it?

16
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:42,031
Perhaps you're right about that.

17
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:46,278
Charles you won't forget, will you? Our contract?

18
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:52,068
I know. To kill God and smash this world of lies...

19
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:01,542
That was a close call, big brother.

20
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,199
Shirley regained her memory.

21
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:05,978
She had a gun, and she was coming after you.

22
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:09,135
I see. So you were the one who killed her.

23
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,597
Yes, I did it for you; I have to eliminate your enemies.

24
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,566
Rolo...

25
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:17,143
What, big brother?

26
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:23,486
You handled it very well. If it weren't for you,

27
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:25,719
everybody would've known about my secret.

28
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:29,119
Exactly and it isn't just your secret anymore, brother.

29
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:33,171
True. So, shall we destroy the Geass Order now?

30
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:34,025
Uh?!

31
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,697
The Black Knights can wipe out
the source of Geass once and for all.

32
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:39,724
Big brother, we can't.

33
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:42,081
There are still Geass users there.

34
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:44,614
If we keep avoiding this, we'll never win.

35
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,596
Remember, this is for our happiness. For both of us.

36
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,601
For both of us?

37
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:52,387
That's right. V.V. has begun to suspect you.

38
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,156
Are you afraid of V.V.?

39
00:03:57,426 --> 00:03:59,926
Well, he was the one who found me.

40
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:03,699
Still, Lelouch, can I really believe in you?

41
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:04,937
Of course.

42
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:07,254
We're the only brothers we have, aren't we?

43
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:09,847
Are you going to kill me?

44
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:13,835
Or control me with your Geass? Like you did to Euphy?

45
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:16,683
To prove your sister's innocence,

46
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,603
you renounced your position. Gave up everything.

47
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,361
That's inspiring.

48
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:23,377
You made me think, Cornelia.

49
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:28,933
Is there any more splendid relationship
in this entire world than that of loyal siblings?

50
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:34,495
Organ failure due to gunshot wounds and loss of blood.

51
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:38,169
Shirley. You're saying that she shot herself?

52
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,639
Yes. Apparently on impulse.

53
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,869
Suicide? She couldn't...

54
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:58,202
Has anyone seen Lelouch?

55
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:59,444
Mm-mm.

56
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,808
No!

57
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,475
I see. She was a friend of yours.

58
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,125
Yes. Milly just told me about it.

59
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,829
Were you close?

60
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:12,415
I'm not sure. She was just always so cheerful.

61
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,951
To be honest, she kind of bothered me.

62
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:18,192
I see. Perhaps you were envious of her happiness?

63
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:22,663
Maybe... Maybe that was it. That's why...

64
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:26,030
I never imagined that I would cry over her!

65
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:30,939
Nina, as long as you can
shed tears, then you're all right.

66
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:37,587
I can't believe Lelouch. Who does he think I am?

67
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:41,684
Leaving me behind here like I was
a messenger girl or something.

68
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,064
What?! Ugh, hardly.

69
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:49,054
I'm just really worried that he's forgotten our contract.

70
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,119
Anyway, what are you planning to do?

71
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:53,636
How long are you going to stay inside of...

72
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:54,931
C.C.

73
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:55,517
Hm?

74
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,989
I have finally located where the Order is.

75
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:00,443
Jeremiah and Rolo provided key information.

76
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:03,218
We're going to send in the Zero Squad and wipe it out.

77
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:06,156
Wipe it out? Weren't you going to use it?

78
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:08,133
They're not a military group.

79
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:09,913
They just do research into Geass...

80
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:11,243
We'll crush them!

81
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:14,145
Tell me what happened.

82
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,823
The power of Geass which they
unleashed caused Shirley's death.

83
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,057
She was killed by Geass!

84
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:29,763
And so now you're going to wipe out the Order?

85
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:30,691
As atonement.

86
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:33,421
To make sure the same thing doesn't happen to anyone else.

87
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,519
You said Geass is the power of the king.

88
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:38,445
There can be only one king, so I alone shall have it.

89
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,137
I will erase Rolo. I'll erase Geass from all the others.

90
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:45,872
Its power to make people sinful
will be obliterated from this world!

91
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:48,499
I owe that to Shirley. At the very least!

92
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,850
And are you going to erase me, as well?

93
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,356
You know I can't do that.

94
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:54,351
You are eternally young. And immortal.

95
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:57,680
V.V. is also eternally young. And also immortal.

96
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:59,955
I'll neutralize him and leave him helpless.

97
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:02,882
And there's always the method that Clovis used on you.

98
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:06,365
Besides, I want to see if you're really loyal to me now.

99
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,343
Since you were once the leader
of the Order we're fighting.

100
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:12,534
That was a long time ago. And I was just window dressing.

101
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:15,312
I never had real power like V.V...

102
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:17,126
Still.

103
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,841
We've been accomplices, haven't we?

104
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:22,715
The order will be wiped out which will test you.

105
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,115
I'm prepared to see it through to the end.

106
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,507
Good, because there's one thing more:

107
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,608
I want to know the details of our contract.

108
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,675
What is it you want from all this?

109
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,617
That has nothing to do with the mission;

110
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,682
I have no intention of telling you that.

111
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:38,069
Hmph! Willful woman!

112
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:42,385
Yes, that's right. That's exactly what makes me C.C.

113
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:46,695
Bartley and the others are one thing,

114
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,178
but what do we do about Princess Cornelia?

115
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,001
Shouldn't we at least contact His Majesty?

116
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:57,065
Hm. I wonder if Charles knew about Cornelia's actions.

117
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:58,577
Or if he didn't...

118
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,210
Huh?

119
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:00,297
Director V.V.,

120
00:08:00,322 --> 00:08:03,004
we have the scheduled transmission from Lord Jeremiah.

121
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,380
Right. Can you patch it through?

122
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,493
Surprised to see me?

123
00:08:07,518 --> 00:08:08,284
Uh.

124
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:10,180
So, you're V.V...

125
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:11,718
Lelouch!

126
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,146
How can he have access to Jeremiah's network?!

127
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:15,504
Where's the signal from?

128
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,341
Area 11. Looks like he's inside Ashford.

129
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:21,276
I'm sure I need no introduction at this point,

130
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,486
so I'll just start with direct questions.

131
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:26,807
Was it you who kidnapped
Nunnally during the battle for Tokyo?

132
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:32,164
Also, did you put Suzaku and I and
the others on Kamine Island to observe us?

133
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:33,654
Yes, that's correct.

134
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,799
But the fact that you're asking these questions

135
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:38,643
means you've regained all of
your lost memories, doesn't it?

136
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:40,710
That's right, I am Zero.

137
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:44,121
Then C.C. must be with you. Can you hand her over?

138
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:45,812
We'll let you go free if you do.

139
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:47,170
It's too late for that!

140
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,854
I hereby declare war against you, with no mercy!

141
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,921
Oh yeah! But by the time you get here from Area 11,

142
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:55,071
we'll have moved to another place...

143
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,154
Director V.V.! Knightmares!

144
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,096
What?!

145
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,062
I think it's the Black Knights!

146
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:04,669
V.V.'s current location is verified.

147
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:07,470
Strike force, encircle point alpha-7!

148
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:11,458
I see. So, that's how it is.

149
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,683
That's right. I'm glad you gave me a bit of your time.

150
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,168
You just had to let down your guard for a moment.

151
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:19,203
Since you believed I was in Area 11,

152
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:20,853
you thought you had time to escape.

153
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:22,729
That's why you're trapped now.

154
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:27,141
V.V., the one who shall render judgement here is me!

155
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:41,803
Load the research data into
the Eject Dart and prepare the device;

156
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:43,329
you know which one I mean.

157
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,543
Director, you're facing them personally?

158
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:48,222
I need to buy you time to escape with the data.

159
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:52,197
Besides, I have to teach some
discipline to Marianne's child.

160
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,613
I never would have guessed.

161
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:57,805
I mean, that you were a royal princess, Nunnally.

162
00:09:57,851 --> 00:10:00,023
Forgive me for hiding things from you.

163
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:01,423
Same for me.

164
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:05,279
It's so nostalgic, talking about Ashford Academy.

165
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,000
They told me I wouldn't see Milly and the others.

166
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,187
So Suzaku is the only one I've been able to talk to.

167
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:13,833
They also said my brother has vanished.

168
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,483
No one knows where he is.

169
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:18,278
Tell me, what sort of brother was Lelouch for you?

170
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:19,035
Huh?

171
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,123
I used to have a brother, too, so that's why I ask.

172
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:26,432
I'm happy just to have someone to talk to about Lelouch.

173
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:29,548
Excuse me, please.

174
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:30,531
Mm?

175
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:34,904
Viceroy Nunnally, I'd like to
borrow prisoner 1-0-7 from you.

176
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,058
Uh.

177
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:48,329
Sub-commander Kinoshita, something's wrong here!

178
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:50,872
This isn't a Britannian military installation.

179
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:53,038
Uh. Yeah, you're right.

180
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:55,397
They haven't put up any resistance at all.

181
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,399
They don't even seem to have weapons.

182
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,411
Use extreme prejudice!

183
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:00,448
But, sir...!

184
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:03,820
Britannia has been colluding
with traitors in the Chinese Federation.

185
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:07,612
This lab is developing immortal
warriors whose purpose is to destroy us!

186
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:10,220
I won't let them violate the sanctity of life!

187
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:13,161
The researchers and their data are to be wiped out!

188
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:16,646
We don't know where the subjects
of the immortality research are hidden!

189
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:19,950
Therefore, encircle point alpha-7 and destroy everything!

190
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:21,706
Burn it to the ground!

191
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,543
Any experimental subjects found
are to be sealed inside of high pressure casing!

192
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:30,049
I will investigate each one of them personally!

193
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,998
Have you found Princess Cornelia yet?!

194
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:36,738
We have to use this chance to save everyo...

195
00:11:41,163 --> 00:11:44,538
That man there, wasn't he working with Clovis?

196
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,185
Director C.C.!

197
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:47,980
You've come back to us!

198
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:50,205
Please save us, C.C.!

199
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:58,012
Your Highness, Prince Clovis...

200
00:11:58,124 --> 00:11:59,519
The eternally young,

201
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:02,943
immortal woman you wished to present to His Majesty.

202
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:06,867
It would seem that he was already aware of her existence.

203
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:07,925
Please...

204
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:10,084
Please forgive me, Your Highness...

205
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:14,969
We never should've involved ourselves with that witch.

206
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:26,196
Yes, Zero's gone to attack a Britannian research facility.

207
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:28,632
He's kept the location and mission secret.

208
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:30,615
More of those clandestine activities?

209
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,712
And now that the Saudis have been subjugated

210
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:35,985
we must ratify the united states
charter as quickly as possible.

211
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,593
It's true that more factions are caving in to Britannia,

212
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:40,934
so we need to move very quickly as you say.

213
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,625
But there's positive movement as well.

214
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,733
Italy and Poland have come over to our side.

215
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:47,670
We need to speak to Zero as soon as he returns.

216
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:48,948
Understood.

217
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:52,527
This is what Zero wants, isn't it?

218
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:57,750
Yes. We have to maintain tight secrecy
around his activities and his very existence.

219
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,972
Then I want you to go after deputy-commander Ohgi.

220
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:01,848
Huh?

221
00:13:01,873 --> 00:13:05,028
He's been acting strangely
since the meeting a few days ago.

222
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,794
No. He's been hiding something
from us for a long time before that.

223
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:14,446
Flights to the Chinese Federation
right now are cancelled...

224
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:16,823
I belong to the Office of Secret Intelligence.

225
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:19,752
Th-he one that reports directly to His Majesty?!

226
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:23,479
Right. I believe you have
special flights for diplomatic purposes.

227
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,463
Yes ma'am we do.

228
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,672
Now that Lelouch has roped even Jermiah into this...

229
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:32,858
For Zero's sake, if the deputy-commander
is collaborating with the enemy, then...

230
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:35,768
I must kill Ohgi Kaname!

231
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:40,106
Huh? What are children doing here?

232
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,762
Uh... Hm?

233
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:54,778
What the...?!

234
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,179
Ugh! My hand!

235
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:04,904
What the devil are you doing, Mori?!

236
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:07,080
It's not me! I can't control it!

237
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,014
Uh? It's Geass?

238
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,388
That power means it's...

239
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:15,798
Big brother Rolo!

240
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:18,709
Hey, I miss all you guys. How have you been?

241
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:27,998
The new guy. Your name's Rolo, isn't it?

242
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:29,730
Are you one of them?

243
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,864
I have nothing to do with them now.

244
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,403
As long as I keep following my brother, I'm all right.

245
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:43,958
Once he corners V.V., I'll simply detonate
the bomb I planted in Rolo's knightmare.

246
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,860
My funeral offering to Shirley will be Rolo's life!

247
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,120
He will atone for what he did to her!

248
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,258
What?!

249
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:54,731
The Siegfried!

250
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:55,578
Impossible!

251
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,663
Jermiah! Isn't that unit...?!

252
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:00,775
Yes. Since it works on direct bio-connect...

253
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,078
The only one who can use it beside me is...!

254
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:03,795
Heh.

255
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,083
I thought so!

256
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,759
You surprise me, V.V.!

257
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,220
The observer becomes the perpetrator!

258
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,912
Y'know, I sort of liked you, Lelouch.

259
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:19,770
Because you reminded me of Charles.

260
00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:22,091
I can't believe it...

261
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:24,032
He's using the Siegfried unit here?!

262
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,501
Get out of here! You're the one he's after!

263
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:30,208
Oh?

264
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:32,060
Hold it right there, V.V.!

265
00:15:32,085 --> 00:15:33,591
Please, just surrender.

266
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:35,139
Who do you think you're talking to?

267
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:36,997
You're just a bunch of traitors, aren't you!

268
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:40,147
V.V., I swear I'll tear you out of that thing myself!

269
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,935
All units: attack!

270
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,151
Yes, Your Majesty!

271
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:52,781
That spinning shield is powerful!

272
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:55,897
Marianne's son is getting carried away with himself!

273
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:02,366
That machine was made so that I could prove my loyalty!

274
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:05,920
Jeremiah, I thought that you had
a personal grudge against Zero?

275
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:11,089
I did! Because I thought he was a mere commoner
preventing me from serving the royal family.

276
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:14,133
But now I know who he is,
and I know that by serving him...

277
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:16,576
I am serving my lady, Marianne!

278
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:18,185
Even you...!

279
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:20,633
You dare speak her name to me!

280
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,450
Send out all remaining units!

281
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:29,031
It looks like that monster outside
is piloted by their leader!

282
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,081
Shirley?!

283
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:35,995
According to the forensics, she committed suicide.

284
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,397
She'd never do that!

285
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:39,255
Suzaku, you know that, don't you?!

286
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,364
Yeah, I do. Which means that if somebody murdered her...

287
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:46,981
Yes. Lelouch...

288
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:51,433
Rolo! Can you get to the Siegfried somehow?

289
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:55,070
I'm not able to use my Geass to do time stops on V.V...

290
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:57,012
You just need to grab onto the unit.

291
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:58,322
I have a plan after that.

292
00:16:58,347 --> 00:17:00,331
Okay, I'll do my best.

293
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:04,391
Rolo, the bomb I planted on the Vincent is ready!

294
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,720
It'll destroy the Siegfried and you in one blast.

295
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,866
I have to try!

296
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,456
For big brother!

297
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:16,241
And now it's Rolo's turn.

298
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:19,043
You've lied to me just like all the others, haven't you?

299
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:22,318
Even knowing that your Geass won't work on me...

300
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,172
Oh, yeah!

301
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:29,397
Director V.V.,

302
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:32,099
we've finished preparations
to escape with the research data.

303
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:33,874
Shall we take it to the E.U. for now?

304
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:36,618
Yes. I'll join you after I've finished things here.

305
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:38,556
Now I know how to capture C.C.,

306
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:41,024
so all we need to do is escape and regroup,

307
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,883
then Charles and I can put an end to this for good.

308
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:46,720
I just have to grab it!

309
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:49,620
You are a failed experiment, don't you know that?

310
00:17:49,658 --> 00:17:52,681
Your heart stops every time you use your Geass.

311
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,245
That means you're defective.

312
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,741
You could conk out at any moment.

313
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,808
Not yet! If I eject them...!

314
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,770
Oh, yeah!

315
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:04,995
I've done it, big brother!

316
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:10,659
Well done, Rolo!

317
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:13,187
Now, it's time for goodbye!

318
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:23,797
Who? Who could know the Siegfrieg's only weak point?

319
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,345
So, your name is V.V.?

320
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,103
You were mistaken when you
treated me like an incompetent weakling.

321
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,224
Forgive me, Big Brother!

322
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,766
No, it's all right.

323
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,812
I never expected Cornelia to be here!

324
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:48,170
The Siegfried's shields are all down! Direct attack!

325
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,841
Uh... Uh!

326
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:53,593
Now you're going to suffer, for what you did to Euphy!

327
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:54,601
The source...

328
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:55,958
...of Geass!

329
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,901
It's no use! The Siegfried is finished! Uh!

330
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:10,731
It's you, Lelouch! You are an abomination!

331
00:19:11,382 --> 00:19:12,824
Come, Your Highness!

332
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:18,900
The Siegfried!

333
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,449
Director V.V.!

334
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,743
Calm down! Remember, director V.V. cannot be killed.

335
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,678
He can always use the Twilight Gate on the lowest level.

336
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,253
If we just get the research data
away from here, then we...

337
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:32,108
Ah!

338
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:32,991
Is that...?!

339
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:35,283
Huh?! Lady C.C.!

340
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,456
Forgive me.

341
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:40,720
This is my personal sin for having neglected you.

342
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:44,261
At last I shall put an end to the lineage of Geass.

343
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:48,337
So be it. Perhaps, this is how Lelouch and I should...

344
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:57,749
All of the evidence and testimony
imply that Lelouch is innocent...

345
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,366
But in my heart, I've known
all along that Lelouch was the culprit.

346
00:20:02,391 --> 00:20:03,676
That he was Zero.

347
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,349
I don't know who Zero is!

348
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:07,291
I told you that when I was captured.

349
00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:08,566
Enough of that!

350
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:11,245
To prevent another death like Shirley's...

351
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,320
Nothing is off limits; not anymore!

352
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,764
And that includes Refrain.

353
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,884
The target has fled inside!

354
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,125
I'll look for him, starting on the lowest level!

355
00:20:22,224 --> 00:20:24,453
Rolo, you search from the top down!

356
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:27,768
Kinoshita! Take command and sweep the middle levels!

357
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:34,109
Lelouch, how dare you!

358
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,652
I'm glad you came after all... Charles.

359
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:50,056
The most splendid relationship
in the world is that of loyal siblings.

360
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:55,070
Big brother, is it true you were
the one who sent an assassin after Lelouch?

361
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:56,804
Yes. And thanks to that,

362
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,368
I've been the victim of his assassins.

363
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:03,443
But I've also learned something. That Lelouch is Zero.

364
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,814
That he even tricked Nunnally.

365
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:09,087
You lied to me once again, big brother.

366
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,895
This is as barbaric as the Britannians!

367
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:16,716
Was it really necessary to shoot children? Was it?

368
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:21,800
I'm picking up signs of life.

369
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:25,452
Have you returned to the point where you began? V.V.!

370
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:30,135
What's this?! Dammit!

371
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,410
This is what happened on Kamine Island!

372
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:40,312
How was I pulled out of the Shinkiro?

373
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:44,093
Where is this place? It's not an illusion or a hologram.

374
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,343
That is correct!

375
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,323
And knight mares are such inelegant things.

376
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:54,264
Especially in the face of
this system: the Sword of Akasha!

377
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,443
It's you...!

378
00:21:56,468 --> 00:22:00,510
Lelouch, my son! The time has come at last!

379
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:03,598
The time for final redemption!

380
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,806
How did the Emperor bring me here?!

381
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:42,082
Dammit, I have to think this through!

382
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:44,608
If he did this, he must know that I'm Zero!

383
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,025
So there's no reason to hide it anymore!

384
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:50,506
The best plan is to use my Geass to make him my servant.

385
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:53,717
Then I won't need to capture
V.V. and trade him for Nunnally.

386
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,083
But his own Geass and this place stand in my way!

387
00:23:57,207 --> 00:23:58,906
So what are my options?!

388
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,634
It's all or nothing now!

389
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,251
This is a once in a lifetime chance! I have to seize it!
