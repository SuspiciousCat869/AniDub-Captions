1
00:00:02,634 --> 00:00:05,134
For now, there is still tomorrow.

2
00:00:05,226 --> 00:00:08,935
For Lelouch Lamperouge,
it is a tomorrow he can dream of...

3
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:11,358
And that dream is based on Geass,

4
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:14,918
the power given to him by a mysterious girl named C.C.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,301
It is the unique power to compel anyone to obey him.

6
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:22,876
Using his Geass, Lelouch is determined
to destroy the Holy Britannian Empire,

7
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:24,712
to avenge the death of his mother,

8
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:28,762
and to create a world where his
younger sister, Nunnally, can live in peace.

9
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:32,871
Japan is now a colony known only as Area 11.

10
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:36,659
Here, his vow is made to change the world.

11
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,535
Huh?

12
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,193
A child?

13
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,485
That's right,

14
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,045
I can't remember how many people I've killed.

15
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,754
Nobody counts the number of times
they brush their teeth or eat a meal.

16
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,154
Same with this.

17
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:49,010
My Geass is suited to assassination.

18
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:50,758
That's what I was told.

19
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:54,431
So I kill. There was no other place for me.

20
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:56,660
An under-cover operation

21
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,542
I'll be playing someone's little brother.

22
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,569
Are you sure this is the right assignment for me?

23
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:03,802
I've never known any parents or family, so it doesn't seem...

24
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:07,201
No. If that's the order I'm given...

25
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:10,349
...then my big brother shall be Lelouch Lamperouge.

26
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,025
Your Geass is the power to stop time?

27
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,985
I have no reason to answer you.

28
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:21,267
The orders given to me are as follows:

29
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,106
If Lelouch Lamperouge's memories return

30
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,966
if Zero is awakened,

31
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:27,301
then he is to die.

32
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:28,675
Sixteen...

33
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:30,968
Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen.

34
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,637
What's that? Why are you counting?

35
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:34,058
Since the moment you appeared,

36
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,858
I've been counting the seconds
to myself, carefully, one by one.

37
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:40,310
But now the count is out of synch.

38
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:42,359
Now, why do you think that is?

39
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:45,133
I'll make you my pawn to find Nunnally.

40
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:55,095
Rolo, you can't stop time, no one can.

41
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,289
You've just altered my sense of time.

42
00:03:57,314 --> 00:03:59,072
Understanding that doesn't help you;

43
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:00,877
you still can't beat me.

44
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,706
That's absolute.

45
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:05,023
No one can live in the same time flow with me.

46
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:08,104
You're correct, Rolo, but that doesn't help you either.

47
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:10,574
You'd like to kill me now, but you can't,

48
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,281
and we both know the reason why.

49
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:15,472
If I die, you won't gain either
of the two things that you want.

50
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:16,268
Two things?

51
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:17,658
First, you won't get C.C.,

52
00:04:17,683 --> 00:04:19,747
for whom I've been the bait in your hunt.

53
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:22,188
But if you let me go, I can draw her out for you.

54
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:23,939
I'll help you get her.

55
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:26,177
You'd sell out C.C. like that?

56
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:29,429
She isn't worth my own life; survival comes first.

57
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:30,868
And what's the other thing?

58
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:32,268
Your life.

59
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:34,620
Ha. Like I care about that.

60
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:36,966
Rolo, what is the future?

61
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,609
The future is hope.

62
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:41,545
Without hope your life is on hold. Empty. Waiting.

63
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,895
And you have no hope beyond your mission, Rolo.

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,806
If you capture C.C., what sort of
future will it open for you?

65
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:49,633
Things will just go on as
they are and nothing will change.

66
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:51,247
But this is my mission.

67
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:54,083
Kill me and your mission will never be completed.

68
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:56,427
You wanna capture C.C., don't you?

69
00:04:57,094 --> 00:05:00,344
Tomorrow, I'll lure C.C. out and she'll be yours.

70
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:03,202
Once that's done, your new future will begin.

71
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:05,902
Don't worry. I would never lie to you.

72
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,593
Not to you anyway.

73
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:11,150
This reminds me of Aomori.

74
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:12,966
It isn't as bad as that was.

75
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,491
At least everyone here is wearing their clothes.

76
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,241
Zero used his Geass on the consul general, right?

77
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,014
So, why are they doing this now?

78
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:20,997
Who knows.

79
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:22,758
Still, if they run us out of here,

80
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:24,831
then we and Lelouch will be...

81
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:27,931
Split up all over again. Hm?

82
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:31,177
How unexpected. You came alone.

83
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,839
I thought the United States of Japan had been recognized

84
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:37,266
by the Chinese Federation consul general.

85
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,389
He's going to be disposed of.

86
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:43,725
Or do the Black Knights choose to
take the path of destruction right here?

87
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,350
Hold it! You can't just spring that...!

88
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
I see. You can arrange it

89
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,845
so it appears the consul general is killed fighting us.

90
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,900
C.C.

91
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:54,299
It seems Zero is pulling a trigger he never meant to pull.

92
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:57,789
Will this be noble ambition or base treachery?

93
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:02,424
Convincing Rolo to wait bought me a little bit of time.

94
00:06:02,576 --> 00:06:04,826
As long as he thinks he can get C.C.,

95
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:07,337
he won't report that I've regained my memories.

96
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:09,266
Still, what's his motivation?

97
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,670
Doesn't seem to be a desire for
promotion in Britannia, nor simple loyalty.

98
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:17,493
Is there some other line of
question I should be following?

99
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,397
That's a dangerous card, but it has its merits.

100
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:22,584
I don't have any time to hesitate...

101
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:25,975
'cause tomorrow, Tohdoh and
the others are scheduled for execution.

102
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,806
So what do I do? Rolo knows about my Geass now.

103
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,781
Even if I managed to kill him somehow,

104
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:34,458
the O.S.I. would know that I've regained my memories.

105
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,564
iIf that happens, Nunnally will be...

106
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:42,187
It seems I'll have to keep playing
student until I can rescue Nunnally.

107
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:48,066
Fortunately, Guilford's men and the Office of
Secret Intelligence don't seem to share information.

108
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:51,226
That explains why they haven't found the Knightmare I hid.

109
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,447
But that's all I have in my favor. So what should I do?

110
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:59,766
How do I save the Black Knights
and neutralize Rolo at the same time?

111
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,557
Unacceptable!

112
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:11,810
Did this kid kill Bruno in cold blood or not?

113
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:13,043
And he was the fifth one.

114
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:15,027
All Victor did was touch the kid's locket,

115
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:16,135
and the next thing...

116
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,137
Victor had his own personality problems.

117
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,068
You don't kill a man because of that!

118
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:22,203
Now that there's this guy claiming to be Zero,

119
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:24,145
we have to get our priorities straight

120
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,420
and pull the team together.

121
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,270
That's exactly right, and I'm not
teaming up with the freakin' Angel of Death!

122
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,368
Team? The mission is what's important, isn't it?

123
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,149
Who cares about the team?

124
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:39,737
Hey, Ohgi, is this new Zero the same as our Zero?

125
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:41,012
I wish I knew.

126
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:42,876
Either way, don't get your hopes up.

127
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:44,866
He'll probably abandon us again.

128
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:47,635
What was the source of the explosion in the consulate?

129
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,299
They haven't issued a formal statement.

130
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,874
They've given their approval
for the executions, that's all we've heard.

131
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,441
Hmph. These executions are a
crude show to frighten the Elevens.

132
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:58,124
What a vulgar approach this is.

133
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:00,301
You think Zero will dare to show himself?

134
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:03,095
Even if he doesn't, we still come out ahead.

135
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,524
If this "Zero" can't pull off a miracle,

136
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:07,590
he'll never gain the support of the people.

137
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:09,868
You've thought it through that far, Lord Guilford?

138
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:12,441
In any case, I want him to show up.

139
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:16,693
Or rather, I pray deeply that he does.

140
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:20,226
For the sake of Her Highness, wherever she is now.

141
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:24,260
Why did you recognize the U.S.J.?

142
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:28,085
On your own, without confirmation
from the Vermillion Forbidden City?

143
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:31,782
Even if you are one of the
High Eunuchs, that was unforgivable.

144
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:35,295
Just what were you planning to use Zero for?

145
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,980
I'd no intention to use Zero for anything!

146
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,795
Zero must be pleased in every way!

147
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,685
And the Empress's feelings on this?

148
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,824
That little wench doesn't matter.

149
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,547
The absolute law is that Zero shall bring happiness to me.

150
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:49,151
Simpering traitor!

151
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,512
The Crimson Dynasty is dead.

152
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:57,637
It's no use!

153
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,121
Killing him, controlling the data, disguising it.

154
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:01,710
No matter what plan I come up with,

155
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:03,701
Rolo remains an obstacle.

156
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:08,302
I need to confirm this data before the execution starts.

157
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:19,018
It looks like the execution
will be getting underway shortly.

158
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:20,972
Once again, these are the rebel terrorists

159
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:23,441
who formerly called themselves the Black Knights.

160
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:26,864
Will Zero appear to stop the execution of his followers?

161
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,635
Oh, Zero, please!

162
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,476
General Tohdoh...

163
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:30,832
Don't kill them.

164
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:40,364
Zero betrayed us when we needed him most.

165
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:42,014
I doubt he'll show up to save us.

166
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,720
He's gonna come. If he's the real one, if he's alive,

167
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:47,799
then somehow, someway he'll make a miracle happen!

168
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:49,783
A miracle? Ha.

169
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:51,501
Maintain tight surveillance.

170
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:55,009
It's a long shot, but it's possible
that C.C. might show up.

171
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:02,078
Kaname Ohgi... this is the end.

172
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:06,801
Show yourself, Zero.

173
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:10,328
My father, Andreas Darlton, shall be avenged at last.

174
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:11,174
Hm?

175
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:13,407
I have top secret orders from headquarters.

176
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:15,164
Communications are being intercepted,

177
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,787
so I'm to deliver them to you face-to-face.

178
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:24,735
Right, I'll be borrowing your identity.

179
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,476
Tell me, how are we supposed to interpret this?

180
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,935
If Zero appears, you're free to do whatever you wish.

181
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,537
So, even if we start shooting at the Britannians,

182
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:37,878
you can pretend that you know nothing about it?

183
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:39,853
That's not such a bad deal, is it?

184
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:41,539
You may be a military officer,

185
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:43,866
but you can play politics as well, I see.

186
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:47,842
Sir Kimmel, any problems with
the A.S.E.E.C. mass-pro unit?

187
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:51,003
It may have some glitches left
from when the O.S.I. was using it.

188
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,653
It's a high-value apparatus.

189
00:10:52,678 --> 00:10:55,382
Report in if it malfunctions in any way.

190
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,114
This is Kimmel.

191
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,924
No problems with Vincent. Moving out.

192
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:05,703
Lelouch, if you don't keep your promise, you'll die.

193
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:07,224
Lord Guilford.

194
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:09,905
It's almost time for the execution.

195
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,689
The remaining members of the Black Knights

196
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,801
shall feel the judgement of justice.

197
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:14,826
Zero, please!

198
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:15,974
We're waiting for you!

199
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:17,735
To make a miracle!

200
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:18,997
Elevens!

201
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:21,924
The Zero who you believed in has not appeared!

202
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,799
It has all been a deception!

203
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:26,718
I challenged him to a fair and honest duel,

204
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:29,053
and he has skulked away like a coward.

205
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:30,468
Take aim!

206
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,487
Don't do it!

207
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:37,255
My friends.

208
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,228
Don't move! If you go out now, you'll just die with them!

209
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,649
I know, but...

210
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,885
It's all right.

211
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:45,170
We fought well, now let's die well.

212
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:46,739
You're mistaken!

213
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:49,420
You're wrong, Guilford!

214
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:51,818
He showed up! But still...

215
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:53,885
Hold back, we can't jump into this.

216
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,020
If he's by himself, what can he do?

217
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:57,312
I see.

218
00:11:57,427 --> 00:12:00,053
You snuck up behind me... Zero!

219
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:06,451
Guilford. Those aren't terrorists you're executing!

220
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,916
They are the Black Knights!

221
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,816
Soldiers of the army of the United States of Japan!

222
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:14,105
You expect me to recognize them as prisoners of war?

223
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,426
It's Zero!

224
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:18,080
So, you did come. As expected.

225
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,643
But if you break your
promise to me, I'll kill you, Zero...

226
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:24,668
...or rather, Lelouch Lamperouge!

227
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:37,035
It's Zero. Zero has appeared.

228
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,130
What a reckless, foolhardy move.

229
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:40,237
Zero?

230
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:41,268
Yes, but why?

231
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,683
Is it the real Zero?

232
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,139
Of course it's really him! Zero!

233
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,830
I remember they announced their execution, but...

234
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:49,103
That's all that's been reported.

235
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,620
No... no!

236
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,020
He's alone. Zero is all alone.

237
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,110
He is riding atop a Knightmare Frame,

238
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:57,301
so apparently he's not here to surrender.

239
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:58,866
However, if he intends to fight alone...

240
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,245
See? He came just like I said he would!

241
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,353
Then let's proceed with the operational plan

242
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:04,772
that we started last year.

243
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:08,978
Assuming that Zero can wriggle out of
the little tight squeeze he's gotten himself into.

244
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:14,041
Sayoko, I would like you to begin
making the arrangements for our future.

245
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,585
...commandos appear to be waiting to see what...

246
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,730
Where's Lelouch?

247
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,588
He's with Rolo at the theatre.

248
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:21,988
They've been in there for the last half hour.

249
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:23,349
What will happen?

250
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,601
It's been quite a while, Lord Guilford.

251
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:28,839
Why don't you come out,
and we can talk about the good old days.

252
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,730
Tempting as that invitation is,

253
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:32,172
I'll stay where I am.

254
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:35,537
We'll just settle our past grudges
from the insides of our Knightmares.

255
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:38,493
If Guilford won't come out, Zero can't use his Geass.

256
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,953
Hmph! How predictable of you!

257
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:42,726
Then let's set some rules!

258
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:43,441
Rules?

259
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:45,601
The rules of our duel.

260
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,649
We'll settle this one-on-one.

261
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:51,716
Very well. No one else will interfere with our combat.

262
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:53,234
We will each have one weapon.

263
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:54,497
Agreed!

264
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:59,478
I choose this as my weapon!

265
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:02,170
And for mine, I shall borrow that shield.

266
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:03,674
What? But, that's...

267
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,033
It will do.

268
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:07,626
He's going into battle with a riot shield?

269
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:09,576
So could it be possible that he is...?

270
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,518
Planning to kill himself?

271
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,876
Hmph.

272
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:15,218
You disappoint me, Zero.

273
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:16,805
What shall we do?

274
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,428
I owe him a debt for giving me a perfect
excuse to get rid of that parasite of a eunuch.

275
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:25,086
However, this is hardly a pledge of endearing harmony.

276
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,424
If Zero turns out to be incompetent,

277
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,847
then we'll just use the
Black Knights as our diplomatic tools.

278
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:34,818
I have a question for you, Lord Guilford.

279
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:38,777
What do you do when there is an evil
you cannot defeat by just means?

280
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:41,830
Do you stain your hands with evil to destroy evil?

281
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:44,368
Or do you remain steadfastly just and righteous

282
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:46,601
even if it means surrendering to evil.

283
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:48,874
In either case, evil remains.

284
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,441
A paradox. Is it merely word play?

285
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:54,853
In the name of Cornelia, I choose justice!

286
00:14:54,878 --> 00:14:57,545
I understand! In my case...

287
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,291
...I commit evil to destroy the greater evil!

288
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,607
Yes, Your Highness.

289
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:07,122
What the...?!

290
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:11,774
An Earthquake!

291
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,674
No... This strategy is...

292
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:15,866
The same one from the Black Rebellion!

293
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,588
Infantry unit 12!

294
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:25,546
Go to the control room on level four!

295
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,388
Zero's men are in there!

296
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,528
Kallen, charge in and take command!

297
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:33,386
Right! Autonomous armored knights, follow me!

298
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:36,591
Remember, rescuing Ohgi and the others has top priority!

299
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:38,450
Alpha 4 to Alpha 1! Respond!

300
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:40,517
Alpha 1! Somebody, answer me!

301
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,426
Disgraceful!

302
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:50,685
Yeah, one-on-one my ass!

303
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:54,638
Whoa!

304
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,974
No, Bart!

305
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,990
Black Knights, listen!

306
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:03,349
The enemy around me has fallen into our territory!

307
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:06,026
Wipe out the Britannian forces and save your comrades!

308
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,801
Our comrades...

309
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,780
He used the very structure of the settlement against them?

310
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:11,577
Hurry up!

311
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:14,707
Release everyone before the Britannian forces can regroup!

312
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:16,170
They're going to escape.

313
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:18,172
Right into the Chinese Federation.

314
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:20,943
C.C. is our primary operational target.

315
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:23,343
Leave the military issues to Lord Guilford.

316
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:25,243
These damned terrorists!

317
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:29,138
Britannia!

318
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:32,213
You're on notice: This is Japanese territory now.

319
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,878
There is no Japan!

320
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:37,097
Oh, really? That's why I hate Britannians!

321
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:41,924
Goodbye, Eleven ace!

322
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,584
It's blocked at this close range?!

323
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:50,701
This is the Radiant Wave Surger.

324
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:54,374
The moment you came in close, my victory was assured.

325
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,953
So long.

326
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:04,293
Alfred! How dare you!

327
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,505
Don't shoot! This is Chinese Federation territory.

328
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,083
But...!

329
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:10,625
There are broadcast cameras all over!

330
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:12,740
The Vincent!

331
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:15,266
The Vincent has charged inside!

332
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:29,337
I can't move from here! Run for it!

333
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:34,334
You've come. You've finally come... Rolo.

334
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:39,293
So, you're running after all.

335
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,751
So much for your promise to give me C.C.

336
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:44,739
Lelouch, you were lying to me from the start.

337
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:49,405
Not yet! I can't get caught yet!

338
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,601
All that talk about giving me a future.

339
00:17:51,677 --> 00:17:53,483
I can't die here!

340
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,235
As long as I complete my mission,

341
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,151
I'll open the way to my future!

342
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:03,276
Oh, no.

343
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:05,301
I can't stop a physical object.

344
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,297
It's gonna be a direct hit!

345
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:10,512
Am I gonna die in a place like this?

346
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:16,937
David, stop!

347
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,949
If you hit the Chinese Federation consulate,

348
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,520
it'll start a war with them!

349
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:21,902
Understood.

350
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,251
But why?

351
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,520
Why did you save me? Why would you?

352
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:32,312
Because you're my little brother.

353
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,762
The memories may have been planted in me,

354
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:38,362
but the time that you and I spent together... was real.

355
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:40,478
You're saying...

356
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:43,576
all the things we did up to now... they weren't lies?

357
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:46,218
Because you're my little brother.

358
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,949
Brother? Me?

359
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:54,085
That day... I'd never had a birthday before,

360
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:55,718
and for the first time...

361
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:57,868
What about when you told me your life...

362
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,666
was more important?

363
00:18:59,843 --> 00:19:01,864
Yet you risked your life for this?

364
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:03,891
I made a promise to you.

365
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:06,560
I promised you a new future.

366
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:10,035
Your future is with me.

367
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:12,995
Zero! Our grudges will be settled now!

368
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,483
With one resounding blow...

369
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:18,543
...from this iron hammer!

370
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:27,133
What?! Sir Kimmel, what's the meaning of this?!

371
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:28,747
Uh, no! I just...!

372
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:31,074
Don't tell me... you're one of Zero's men?!

373
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:32,224
No!

374
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:35,212
I... If Lelouch dies, then my mission is...

375
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,889
No, but... What am I doing?!

376
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:43,159
Uh, yes?

377
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:45,316
Rolo? Trouble. It's Ms. Villetta.

378
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:47,383
I'll connect you on a conference.

379
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:49,776
Rolo, where did you go?

380
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:50,922
I, uh...

381
00:19:50,947 --> 00:19:52,406
Ms. Villetta, come on.

382
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:55,433
We can at least go to the bathroom in peace, can't we?

383
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:57,395
So, what were you calling about?

384
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,843
About the Chinese consulate, of course.

385
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:02,537
Oh, yeah. Looks like a real mess down there.

386
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,685
Oh, no.

387
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:05,230
If they find out what's happened,

388
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:07,249
I'll be thrown out of the O.S.I.!

389
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,774
Even that person would...

390
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,167
I understand.

391
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:13,067
I'll keep my little brother out of danger like that.

392
00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:14,853
Of course not.

393
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:18,385
A place where people are being
killed is no place for a boy like Rolo.

394
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:23,467
Britannians, this is your last warning!

395
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:26,147
Any further action will be taken as armed intervention.

396
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:27,664
Withdraw at once!

397
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:33,260
Hey, hey!

398
00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:36,476
Thank goodness! Ohgi!

399
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:38,374
Thanks, Kallen, from all of us.

400
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:39,241
Mh-hm.

401
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,193
And Tohdoh and the others.

402
00:20:41,235 --> 00:20:42,218
Thank goodness!

403
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:44,501
Sorry for being so much trouble.

404
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:46,620
It must've been hard for you.

405
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:48,147
And for you as well.

406
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:50,922
Hey, who's in that Knightmare over there?

407
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:52,303
I don't know.

408
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:53,693
It was an enemy unit,

409
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:56,143
but I'm not sure who's piloting it now.

410
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,343
Zero was protected.

411
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:00,837
Whoever it is, it's not an adversary.

412
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:04,576
C.C.'s right there, but now I can't take her in!

413
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:05,820
From the beginning,

414
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:08,503
you never felt you belonged with Britannia.

415
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:11,176
You belong... with me.

416
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:14,883
Ha. He's mine now.

417
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:18,370
Only an amateur leaves data
like this lying around a control room.

418
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:21,020
Apart from his Geass, he's nothing to me.

419
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:24,117
Leaving me this guy's password was very convenient.

420
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:25,883
And it worked like a charm.

421
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:27,187
Pattern Delta.

422
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:28,103
Correct.

423
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:30,045
When Zero's unit takes that course,

424
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,283
aim carefully and shoot the
pursuing Knightmare from behind.

425
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:37,495
After that, if Zero escapes, destroy
the opposing Knightmare completely.

426
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,195
If he does not escape, go into
stand-by mode and await orders.

427
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,635
Right. I've got it.

428
00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:49,983
Trying to take Nunnally's place, you little phony.

429
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:54,866
I'll use you up and then
throw you away like a piece of trash.

430
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,607
Who does Rolo Lamperouge think he is?

431
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:42,382
Pretending he is my little brother...

432
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:44,103
...I shudder from the disgrace.

433
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,224
It's too bad.

434
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:48,045
If you were someone who is really loyal to the O.S.I.,

435
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,870
I could've had that sniper finish you off right there.

436
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:53,003
Still, you'll make a convenient pawn,

437
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:55,403
so I'll keep you in reserve a little bit longer.

438
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:56,469
But never forget.

439
00:23:56,494 --> 00:23:58,452
All you are is a fake Nunnally.

440
00:23:58,477 --> 00:24:02,124
For now, we'll play the game
as if you really are my little brother.

441
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:06,199
But one day I'll use you for a most decisive move.
