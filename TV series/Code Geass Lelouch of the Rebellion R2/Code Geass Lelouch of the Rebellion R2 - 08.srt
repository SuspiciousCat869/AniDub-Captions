1
00:00:01,371 --> 00:00:06,028
The one time a man never lies is
when he makes a vow in his own heart.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,083
Lelouch Lamperouge made a vow to avenge his mother

3
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:13,116
and to create a world where his sister
Nunnally could live in happiness.

4
00:00:13,248 --> 00:00:16,039
To that end, he obtained the power of Geass.

5
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:18,105
To that end, he became Zero.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,555
And, he undertook all that followed.

7
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:22,122
At the very least,

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,699
that was the truth as it seemed to Lelouch at the time.

9
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,650
Big brother, the promise you made...

10
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:13,280
Yes. I'll keep it.

11
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,693
So you've agreed to the Special Zone.

12
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,622
That doesn't wash away the blood that's on your hands.

13
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,083
Suzaku.

14
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:23,075
I know, Gino, we've gotta pull back this time.

15
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,783
The Black Knights seem to be diving back underwater.

16
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:27,442
Shall we pursue the Vincent?

17
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:28,452
Unnecessary.

18
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:32,036
Suspend the search for C.C.
until we receive further orders.

19
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:36,468
Be careful, Rolo. If they get you,

20
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:38,618
they'll catch me in the same net!

21
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,839
Join the Specially Administrated Zone?

22
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:44,035
What is he thinking?

23
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,727
Who knows.

24
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:45,374
Ohgi.

25
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,149
Huh?

26
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:50,794
If Zero is making decisions that aren't
in the interests of the Japanese people, then...

27
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:52,419
Are you meaning?

28
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,238
Hm?

29
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,211
Zero, listen.

30
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:00,859
Master Zero!

31
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:03,433
How could you leave your new wife waiting?

32
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,506
Lady Kaguya,

33
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:07,527
I'm glad to see you're well and as lively as ever.

34
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,641
And I see you're still surprising everyone

35
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,547
like you always do. Offering to join the Special Zone!

36
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,113
No one expected that at all!

37
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:17,054
Yeah, she's right. What was that all about anyway?

38
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:21,148
I told ya, he's just bluffing so we can
lure the Britannians in and nail 'em!

39
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:25,289
Fighting, then more fighting and then what?

40
00:03:25,324 --> 00:03:26,203
Huh?

41
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:26,971
Hold on!

42
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:28,988
What are you saying, we should dance with them?!

43
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:30,487
We fight because we must!

44
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:32,387
Unless you know some other way to do this.

45
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,839
No, we can never make friends with our conquerors.

46
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:36,572
The Japanese people are fighting for freedom.

47
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:39,619
Tohdoh! What is "Japanese?"

48
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,711
Attention all Elevens.

49
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:45,363
You can now process your Special Zone applications.

50
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:47,597
Ah, what do we do about the Special Zone?

51
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:50,310
Please don't loose your nerves about it at time like this.

52
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:52,099
Is this going to be another massacre?

53
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:54,902
Zero said if we get behind it... We'll be their slaves.

54
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,937
Dammit, I just got a work permit
as an honorary Britannian!

55
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:00,809
Exactly. What's the point of being "Japanese" again?

56
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:03,459
So only people without jobs should join in?

57
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:07,932
Thus far, no elevens have signed up for
the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan,

58
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,921
commonly called the Special Zone.

59
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:12,019
As there has been no contact from Zero,

60
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,565
some officials speculate that he may be facing dissension

61
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,364
within his own organization, the Black Knights.

62
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:20,809
I'd like you to please stick to
the prepared manuscript this time.

63
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,251
I was acting as viceroy...

64
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:23,991
A viceroy is not a king.

65
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,849
Viceroys act as official representatives of the emperor,

66
00:04:26,874 --> 00:04:29,428
ruling each area prudently on his behalf.

67
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:32,776
We will support your attempt
to revive the Special Zone this time.

68
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:37,099
But henceforth, please consult
with me on such matters beforehand.

69
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,858
Leave of absence?

70
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:42,534
Yeah. It looks like I'm going to be a little busy.

71
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,300
With the Special Zone huh?

72
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,033
Oh? And what about all our plans for the garden?

73
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:48,334
Sorry, Milly.

74
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,943
I'll be sure to come back and help out if I get a break.

75
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:54,607
That reminds me, Suzaku. Have you thought about Kallen?

76
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:57,455
Isn't there some way you can help her out?

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,158
Yeah, right, like a plea bargain,
you know. Something like that.

78
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:03,664
We all know you're working for world peace and all,

79
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:06,064
but family and friends are important too, right?

80
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,920
Couldn't you discuss it with the Viceroy?

81
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:10,740
Like when you had me talk to
her on the phone the other night.

82
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:13,215
Huh?! What? You talked to her, Lulu?!

83
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,529
With the young princess?!

84
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:17,221
Uh, well, It was on the night of the welcome party.

85
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:20,330
She mistook me for someone else,
so it was kind of a hazy call.

86
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:21,935
You botched it up.

87
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:27,406
Lelouch, have you really lost your memory?

88
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,058
Or, are you covering up?

89
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:32,786
If you do remember, this is what I'd like to know.

90
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:35,204
Why did you have to kill Euphie?

91
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,762
Surely you could have found another way!

92
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:41,651
Suzaku Kururugi, you traitor! Time to die!

93
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,743
Live!

94
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:49,898
Sir Kururugi!

95
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:51,371
Are you alrigjt, sir?!

96
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:56,821
You, who used your Geass to force me to live,

97
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:59,881
knowing that in my heart,
I sought the punishment of death.

98
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:01,710
Someone like you.

99
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:05,106
Yes, that's right I believe it will be.

100
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,659
We've already sent Sayoko Shinozaki there.

101
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:10,721
I see. Well done, Diethard.

102
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,396
You really are an expert at this.

103
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:15,797
An outstanding job. You're truly irreplaceable.

104
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:19,287
Thank you for those words! I'm deeply honored!

105
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,854
Are you sure your plan for the
following stage will be consistent?

106
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,383
Yes I am. Our tactics may have changed,

107
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:27,890
but our strategic objective remains the same.

108
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:29,937
Take care of things on your end.

109
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,035
You haven't forgotten your promise, have you?

110
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,060
No.

111
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:35,886
I will protect this school.

112
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,803
You and I live here now as brothers.

113
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:40,047
I won't let anything interfere with that.

114
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:44,199
But, I reject the Britannians'
phony claim to control our destiny.

115
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:47,057
I'm helping you because I have something to protect now.

116
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:50,992
If you were discovered, this school
would be destroyed and everything lost.

117
00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:53,311
Right. And then there's V.V. as well.

118
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:56,554
Mm-hm. He'd kill me as a traitor without any hesitation.

119
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,704
And I'd be slain in the next moment.

120
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:01,526
So we share the same destiny, you and I.

121
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,909
Sorry I'm late. Club activities ran over-time.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,791
Uh... so, Zero, what can I do?

123
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:15,354
Please, Ms. Villetta, just saying
that name alone could cost us our lives.

124
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,631
Lelouch, what did you want?

125
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:19,944
About Ohgi. Do you miss him?

126
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:23,003
Alphabet Effect confirmed in fifth.

127
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:26,539
Countdown: 20, 19, 18...

128
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:27,953
I'm back, Nina.

129
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:29,395
Kannon!

130
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,044
Hello. It's been a while.

131
00:07:31,214 --> 00:07:32,895
Prince Schneizel as well!

132
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,712
When did you get back from the E.U.?

133
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:35,945
A short time ago.

134
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,498
I just completed peace negotiations with the French.

135
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,752
In that case, you should keep pushing forward.

136
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:44,999
If you press victory too hard
or too fast, you're inviting defeat.

137
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,374
In every corner of the world, people look for hope.

138
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:51,933
Our victories can trample that hope underfoot.

139
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:54,472
That can be true of enemies and allies.

140
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:57,077
Everyone has something they yearn for.

141
00:08:00,202 --> 00:08:01,493
What?

142
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:05,127
You're Suzaku's cat, huh?

143
00:08:06,763 --> 00:08:09,065
He seems to like you, Anya.

144
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,308
Japanese clothes?

145
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,765
Yes, I always wear them for any of my training sessions.

146
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,503
Do you miss them? Japanese things?

147
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:19,039
Yes, I wonder.

148
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:20,856
I do have some good memories, but I...

149
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:23,423
Sir Kururugi, I've been looking for you.

150
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,512
What is it?

151
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,516
I need your signature on this.

152
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:30,789
It's the order to execute the Eleven
who tried to assassinate you, sir.

153
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:35,051
I need authorization from a Knight
of the Round to carry out the sentence.

154
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,710
The experiments are continuing.

155
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:44,175
I won't squander the faith you've shown in me, your grace.

156
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,529
I promise.

157
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,769
Hm?

158
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:49,398
I haven't forgotten.

159
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,518
During the Black Rebellion, when...

160
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:00,870
Why didn't it work?

161
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,911
Cécile!

162
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:03,749
Right!

163
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,867
Professor Lloyd, stop!

164
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:06,899
Nina!

165
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:08,272
Milly, you, too?!

166
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,619
Please let me kill Zero now!
Let me avenge Princess Euphemia!

167
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,709
That prototype was a failure.

168
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,240
But if you give me a little more time,

169
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,473
I'm certain I can build one that works.

170
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:21,409
You were thinking of Euphie.
You did all of it for her sake.

171
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:23,802
History may remember her as a tragic figure,

172
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:27,249
but I still believe in my sister
and wish to honor her memory.

173
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,203
So do Cornelia and Nunnally.

174
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:33,090
Also Kannon and Suzaku and
many others whose lives she touched.

175
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,448
And you. You believe in her.

176
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:37,348
And that's why I believe in you.

177
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:39,307
I'm grateful, Your Highness.

178
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:43,776
Excuse me. Is something wrong, sir?

179
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:50,019
I'm a Round, I'll sign it.

180
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,998
Yes, that's fine. Thank you, ma'am.

181
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,244
Suzaku.

182
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,835
Hm?

183
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,896
Are you some kind of... masochist?

184
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:03,801
Huh?

185
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:07,989
You know you're disliked here,
yet you volunteered for Area 11.

186
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:10,045
Hated as the hero of the Numbers.

187
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,807
As a traitor to Japan. As the man who killed Zero.

188
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:18,524
You're always on trial here, and out of
envy and hatred, they try to pull you down.

189
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:22,866
There's no point in trying to make people
understand why I'm doing all these things.

190
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:25,628
Because there was someone who did understand.

191
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:29,635
Anyway, when you get down to it, I am a sinner.

192
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,884
Hey there, you two.

193
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:31,549
Uh?

194
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:34,430
Looks like we gonna get that call we were waiting for.

195
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:36,020
The one from Zero.

196
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,319
Should I really be here for this?

197
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:42,579
You wanted to see Zero, didn't you?

198
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:43,736
Yes, but...

199
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:48,236
Sorry, all the other rooms are in use
for Special Zone perparations.

200
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:49,372
Oh, I see.

201
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:51,592
You have to keep this confidential too, I guess.

202
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,300
Is there some diplomatic reason for that outfit?

203
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:56,015
Ah! Yes ma'am, I apologize.

204
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,896
Here it comes now.

205
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:02,987
Ah! Three Knights of the Round.

206
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,283
However, I don't see the Viceroy with you.

207
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:08,510
We don't need to worry her with the details.

208
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,076
Excuse me. I just wanted to ask you,

209
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:14,618
are you the same Zero as before,
or are you a brand new one?

210
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:17,099
Zero's truth is not based on who is within.

211
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:18,833
It's the actions that measure the man.

212
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:21,066
Ah-hah! A philosopher!

213
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,923
You said you'd stop fighting and join in the Special Zone,

214
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:26,581
but do you have full consensus
on that from all of the Black Knights?

215
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:27,847
I have more than that.

216
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:29,889
A million people have been mobilized.

217
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:30,873
A million?!

218
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,385
And they'll all participate?

219
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,452
Yes, but there's one condition.

220
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:36,516
You must let me go.

221
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:39,916
Of course, you'll have to explain this to your own people,

222
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,989
so I suggest you punish me

223
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,097
by sending me into exile.

224
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:45,394
And the Black Knights?

225
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:46,888
He doesn't care about them,

226
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:48,832
he just wants to save his own skin.

227
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:52,139
If word of this gets out,
your own people will string you up.

228
00:11:52,164 --> 00:11:55,947
That's why I've taken the
precaution of keeping these talks secret.

229
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:57,343
How boring.

230
00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:00,196
Area law, section 12, paragraph 8.

231
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,127
It is within the viceroy's authority

232
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:04,722
to apprehend subversive or rebellious elements

233
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:06,263
and send them into exile.

234
00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:09,270
Miss Lohmeyer! Are you suggesting we let Zero go?!

235
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,903
I'm simply stating the legal basis of action.

236
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,167
In that case,

237
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,467
you can make the announcement at the opening ceremonies.

238
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:18,641
That's some kind of sweet deal?

239
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,333
If the big terrorist runs away,

240
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:23,442
the little terrorists will shake and quake and disappear.

241
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:26,717
Perhaps. But where is justice?

242
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,640
Our legal counselors have confirmed that
exiling Zero would be appropriate and within precedent.

243
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:39,935
Right, that might be for the best.

244
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,502
Crimes have been committed.

245
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,622
My own desire to forgive them is a personal matter.

246
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:45,606
Huh?

247
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,802
Would you mind doing this, please?

248
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:50,312
I wrote Euphie's name right, didn't I?

249
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,240
Mm-hm.

250
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,839
Euphie, we're going to make your dream a reality.

251
00:12:58,097 --> 00:13:00,929
A peaceful and gentle world, for you.

252
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,692
Uh. Is something wrong?

253
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:10,325
No. It looks like there's someone else
who's still grieving for Euphie's death.

254
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:13,206
I wonder who it is.

255
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:16,746
I'm glad there are others who loved her like we did.

256
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:18,623
So, are you finished now?

257
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,731
Yes, that was the last thing.

258
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,825
There's nothing holding me here now.

259
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:30,195
This is the area of the Shizuoka ghetto
that will soon become the Special Zone.

260
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,936
A huge number of Elevens has already
gathered for the opening ceremony.

261
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,086
As there are over a million people here,

262
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:39,753
verifying personal I.D.s will
have to wait till after the event.

263
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:46,340
The presence of this many Elevens is a clear testament to
the enormous power and influence that Zero still commands.

264
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,828
What they don't know is that
Zero has already betrayed them all.

265
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,512
You think there'll be a riot?

266
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:54,995
If there is, we'll have the perfect
excuse for a full scale crackdown.

267
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:56,204
Ah, but remember,

268
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:58,634
We don't move until they do, got it?

269
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,343
Yes, my lord.

270
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:04,430
It can't be. Chigusa?

271
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:08,139
Kaname Ohgi are you out there somewhere?

272
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:12,602
Thank you for coming and for taking me back home.

273
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:14,418
Are you alright with this now?

274
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,714
Of course, I was just an acting consul.

275
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,777
Once a new consul is chosen I simply have to return home.

276
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:22,094
Besides, this is an excellent opportunity.

277
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,917
But, what about the Black Knights?

278
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:27,849
The request I made to Britannia
yesterday should set us up for the future.

279
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,319
Lord Xing-ke, are you all right?!

280
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,718
Don't be concerned.

281
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:35,192
I just have to last a little longer.

282
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,724
People of Japan,

283
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,605
Welcome to the Specially Administrated Zone.

284
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,170
I'm overjoyed that so many of you
have gathered here for this great event.

285
00:14:45,195 --> 00:14:49,070
Please, lend me your help so we can make history together.

286
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:51,759
Lord Guilford, you're in no condition for this.

287
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:55,166
The Japan Special Zone was Princess Euphemia's dream.

288
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:57,600
But there's still no sign of Zero anywhere.

289
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,417
That's because the man is a coward.

290
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:01,942
He'll only show up when he thinks we can't get to him.

291
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,914
Now then, before the ceremony officially begins,

292
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:07,961
there is a matter we wish to confirm regarding Zero.

293
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:09,483
As imperial subjects,

294
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,036
all those participating in the Japan Special Zone

295
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:14,233
will have criminal charges against them reduced.

296
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:18,669
And criminals that are class 3 or lower
will have their sentences suspended.

297
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:24,322
However, the instigator of the murder of
former Viceroy Calares cannot be forgiven.

298
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:28,264
Therefore, under special
Area law, section 12, paragraph 8,

299
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:31,643
Zero alone shall be banished and sent into exile!

300
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:32,334
Huh?!

301
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,581
Only Zero?

302
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:37,106
So that means he gets to run away all by himself?

303
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:39,760
Thank you, my Britannian friends!

304
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:42,358
I am grateful for your lenient treatment.

305
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:44,004
So he came here after all.

306
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:45,494
Make your move, Zero.

307
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,833
If there's a riot, we have full license
to wipe out all the radical elements.

308
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:51,214
Duly authorized by Miss Lohmeyer.

309
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:52,733
Show yourself, Zero!

310
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:55,947
I'll escort you safely out of
the country myself, I guarantee it!

311
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:58,962
I don't wish to be in your debt, Suzaku Kururugi.

312
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,654
However, I have a question.

313
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:05,498
What does it mean to be Japanese? A nation.

314
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:06,136
What?

315
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:10,047
Is it language? Territory? Blood lines?

316
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:13,933
No! That's not it! It's in the heart!

317
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,652
Then we're in agreement.

318
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:20,044
A feeling within. Of belonging. Dignity. Pride.

319
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,150
The culture is carried in the heart.

320
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,884
You're Japanese no matter where you are.

321
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:29,333
And what does that have to do
with you running away by yourself?

322
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:30,852
Zero.

323
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,336
I figured they'd try something.

324
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:38,333
What is it? What's going on?

325
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:39,863
Viceroy...

326
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,197
So be it.

327
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:43,526
All forces, prepare to cut them down!

328
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:44,259
Yes, my lord.

329
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:45,004
Hold on!

330
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:47,064
They haven't made any violent moves yet!

331
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,506
Zero may be the one who planned this,

332
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:53,473
but does he have the guts to
come out in the open and show himself.

333
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:58,601
Well, well. It looks like he was
right here on the grounds all this time.

334
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,237
All of them!

335
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:06,833
This is outrageous!

336
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,091
Zero has appeared, but not as expected!

337
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:09,701
That is...

338
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:11,288
So this was your plan!

339
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:13,072
Despite our overwhelming firepower,

340
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:15,480
you've figured a way to move a million people.

341
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,866
Viceroy Nunnally has ordered Zero into exile.

342
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:22,766
Since we are all Zero, we must
all leave this country at once.

343
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,210
What?!

344
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:24,488
No matter where we go,

345
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:27,577
we are Japan, for we carry it in our hearts!

346
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:30,502
Let us set out for a new land!

347
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,712
Come on, all you Zeros! Let's go to a new world!

348
00:17:33,737 --> 00:17:35,431
Time to get exiled, everybody!

349
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:38,198
We're all Zero, so we're all outa here!

350
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,355
That's right! I'm Zero!

351
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,626
Let's get deported!

352
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:42,460
I'm Zero too! Come on!

353
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:46,152
Ah-hah! He wanted a legal excuse
to get them all out of Japan!

354
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:48,855
We prepared for a riot, but we might have to let them go.

355
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,589
Don't panic, it's a bluff!

356
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:53,322
There's no way he can transport a million people!

357
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:55,163
We just got word from the port authority.

358
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:57,813
The port? They wouldn't!

359
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:00,883
The Chinese Federation requested safe passage for...?

360
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:02,450
Yes, the iceberg ship.

361
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:04,888
But the applicant has already left the country.

362
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:07,251
It can't.

363
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,458
We're getting on that?

364
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:11,524
But, it's ice!

365
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,868
Won't it melt?

366
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,310
We'll be fine!

367
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:16,430
The iceberg ship is indestructible.

368
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:21,317
It has so much insulating polymer
and super-Peltier Film, the ice will never melt.

369
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:22,657
Target the leader!

370
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:24,081
Take out the real Zero!

371
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:24,814
Right! But...

372
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,868
How do we know which one is him?

373
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:28,376
This is...!

374
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,902
What's gonna happen?

375
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:33,568
It's that Zero's more than an idol now, he's a symbol.

376
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:37,763
He's made himself into a living avatar for everyone.

377
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:40,298
Elevens! Take your masks off!

378
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,588
Britannian witch!

379
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:42,744
Don't shoot!

380
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:46,525
Don't let them drag us into a fight;
that's not why we're here!

381
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,891
Ohgi, is that you?

382
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,939
Uh, no. I'm Zero.

383
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,914
Please tell me what's going on.

384
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:55,907
Miss Lohmeyer has stayed behind for operational oversight.

385
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:57,714
You mean leave everything to her?

386
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:59,254
It'll be all right.

387
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,626
Suzaku is there with her.

388
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:02,864
Sir Kururugi,

389
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:05,035
we can't let a million laborers leave the country!

390
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,049
Make an example of...!

391
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:07,657
Hold on, please!

392
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:10,441
Zero! Order them to take off their masks!

393
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,724
Do it now or there'll be another massacre!

394
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:14,499
Only if you order it, Suzaku!

395
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:15,996
And even if we're all unmasked,

396
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,104
no one would know who the real Zero is.

397
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:19,338
Sir Kururugi!

398
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:22,116
This is an act of rebellion! Order us to fight!

399
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:25,196
He's wrong. This is a way of
resolving things without fighting.

400
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:26,610
It's your call, Suzaku.

401
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:27,954
You're in charge.

402
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,768
Zero we could let you escape,

403
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:35,299
but a million people? To let them all go with you?

404
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:37,189
If the Black Knights leave,

405
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:39,231
peace will come to Area 11.

406
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:42,546
And Nunnally's reign will no longer
be threatened by our presence.

407
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:45,353
Even so, this is a dirty way to do it!

408
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:48,821
Give the order! To let Zero go!

409
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:52,096
I must give the order to shoot Zero!

410
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:53,266
To kill him!

411
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,274
Hm.

412
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:56,819
I'll do it! Zero!

413
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,437
Crimes have been committed.

414
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:03,739
My own desire to forgive them is a personal matter.

415
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:05,267
That's right!

416
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:07,365
Euphie and Nunnally both wanted to forgive him!

417
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,594
We're dealing with Zero!

418
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:11,056
Zero's to be exiled! That was our agreement.

419
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:13,779
If we break it, the people will never trust us again!

420
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:15,746
The people?! These are Elevens!

421
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:18,812
Only you speak of them as people
because you are one of them!

422
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:20,488
This has nothing to do with that!

423
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:22,846
If they're all subversives, why do you want them here?!

424
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,121
So you can massacre them?!

425
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:25,988
They've challenged Britannian rule,

426
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:27,305
so let them burn in hell!

427
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,666
Shouldn't we get rid of these disruptive elements then?

428
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:31,053
They're exiling themselves!

429
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:31,834
But...!

430
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:35,172
Zero, can you promise that you'll lead them to salvation?

431
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:37,780
Of course. And you, Suzaku Kururugi,

432
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:41,624
can you promise the ones who
stay behind will find salvation in your hands?

433
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:44,772
That's exactly why I became a Britannian soldier!

434
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:46,598
I understand.

435
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:49,320
I will trust in the promise you've made.

436
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,579
Did you hear that? All Zeros!

437
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,911
Sir Kururugi has declared it!

438
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,270
Rebels are hereby exiled!

439
00:20:58,295 --> 00:21:00,212
Nothing holds us back now!

440
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:03,169
Forward! To the land of freedom!

441
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:06,102
Let's go while we have the chance.

442
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:09,137
Goodbye then, Lady of Britannia.

443
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:17,167
A perfect chance to kill them all,
and he's throwing it away!

444
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:19,216
My lord, Xing-ke.

445
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:19,641
Hm?

446
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,708
It sems the Area 11 operation has succeeded.

447
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:23,891
I see.

448
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:27,713
Looks like Zero's next
performance will be... on our stage.

449
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:30,363
So, Suzaku managed to save a million lives,

450
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:32,445
and no one will ever thank him for it, eh?

451
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,102
I think he knew that going in. He's used to it now.

452
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:40,783
His whole plan was based on one prediction:

453
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,756
that I would give the order to hold fire and let them go.

454
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,727
You know me well, Zero.

455
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,434
You are my worst enemy.

456
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:49,216
I know you Suzaku.

457
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,449
And I also know Nunnally. I know her heart.

458
00:21:52,522 --> 00:21:55,071
That is why I could foresee the outcome.

459
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,483
And, for now,

460
00:21:56,508 --> 00:22:00,049
I am grateful to you, Suzaku Kururugi.

461
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:03,022
Don't ever forget the promise you've made to me!

462
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:40,847
No matter how I multiply the avatar of Zero,

463
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:43,107
There is still only one Zero.

464
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:45,444
That's right, Zero is...

465
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,919
I am... the one who killed Euphie.

466
00:23:47,944 --> 00:23:50,569
Which makes me a terrorist. And so, Nunnally,

467
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:53,347
even your pure heart cannot forgive my crimes.

468
00:23:53,372 --> 00:23:56,372
I have to call forth a miracle to
atone for the sins I've committed.

469
00:23:56,397 --> 00:23:59,781
That's why, Suzaku. Why I've turned towards tomorrow.

470
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:02,431
Your becoming a Knight of the Round changes nothing!

471
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:05,172
I do this to battle your power as well!
