1
00:00:01,177 --> 00:00:04,604
Imperial calendar year 2017.

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:07,696
The colony of Japan, now re-named Area 11,

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:12,783
declared a war of independence against the
suzerain state of the Holy Britannian Empire.

4
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:18,408
This uprising, which came to be known as the
Black Rebellion, was marked by heavy bloodshed

5
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:21,657
and ended with the second historic defeat for Japan.

6
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:24,026
Since then, one year has passed.

7
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:26,635
The terrorist known as Zero, presumed dead,

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,097
has again appeared in Area 11.

9
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:32,830
Zero leads an armed group of
Japanese known as the Black Knights.

10
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:35,438
His true identity: Lelouch Lamperouge,

11
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:38,463
the exiled prince of the Britannian Empire.

12
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:18,673
Therefore, once again, here and now,

13
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:22,548
I declare the establishment of the United States of Japan!

14
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,273
Starting from this moment,

15
00:02:24,298 --> 00:02:27,631
this room shall be the first dominion of the USJ!

16
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:30,485
Race, ideology, and religion will not matter!

17
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,087
Being a citizen will have but one requirement:

18
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,337
To do that which is just!

19
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,171
I came here to kill...

20
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:40,407
...Zero.

21
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:46,544
It's my cell phone. Nothing else.

22
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:48,256
Rolo! Are you okay?!

23
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:49,858
Lelouch?!

24
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:50,841
Thank heaven!

25
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,612
I was getting really worried
because I couldn't get a hold of you.

26
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:56,360
You aren't hurt, are you? You're somewhere safe, right?

27
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:58,323
What's going on here?

28
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:01,348
Is the Zero making the speech
right now a different person?

29
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,810
Uh, Big Brother, where are you right now?

30
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:06,752
Me? What are you talkin' about? Especially since... Huh?

31
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:08,649
Hello, Rolo, it's me.

32
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:09,902
M-Miss Villetta?!

33
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:11,289
Lelouch came back to school,

34
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:13,523
and he's making up all the classes that he missed.

35
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:15,806
You should get back here soon, too.

36
00:03:16,357 --> 00:03:18,519
Yes, ma'am, I understand.

37
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:22,550
Well, then? Are you finished with your phone call?

38
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:26,831
It seems all my business... is finished here.

39
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:30,831
The ragtag remnants of the Black Knights

40
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:33,431
and the man claiming to be Zero are currently hiding in

41
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:35,933
a section of the Chinese Federation consulate.

42
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,208
However, there is no cause for alarm.

43
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,398
Acting Viceroy Guilford has taken command of the army

44
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:44,098
in the absence of wounded Viceroy Calares...

45
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,338
the consulate has been completely
surrounded and the public is...

46
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:49,344
You have the town jumping, Lelouch.

47
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:50,333
Naturally.

48
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:51,206
Uh?!

49
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:54,839
A new nation has just been created in their own territory.

50
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:56,752
And not to mention, of course,

51
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:59,785
that it also just declared war on Britannia.

52
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:00,899
What's the matter?

53
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:02,882
When did you two switch places?

54
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:04,514
Before the speech.

55
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:05,731
But I...

56
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:07,702
His voice was re-recorded.

57
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,352
The moment "he" appeared, it was already me.

58
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:11,908
Just like in a magic show.

59
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,440
You planned it on your own.

60
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:15,900
We don't like it when you keep secrets from us.

61
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:16,884
"We" don't like it?

62
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:19,537
You mean, you don't like it. Do you?

63
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,258
Lelouch, open the oven!

64
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:28,569
Yeah, yeah.

65
00:04:29,956 --> 00:04:31,415
Some salt.

66
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,825
Frying pan.

67
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:34,435
A fresh egg.

68
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,782
Bechamel sauce.

69
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:38,419
Put the gelato on another plate.

70
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,403
Oh, and add the rosemary to the sorbet.

71
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:42,290
Then, add the dill to the sauerkraut.

72
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,149
The Black Forest Cake...

73
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:44,950
I can't do this by myself!

74
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:46,977
Why do you only keep asking me to help with it all?

75
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:48,252
We didn't have a choice.

76
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:49,792
Rivalz has no sense of taste.

77
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:51,448
And of course, she is..

78
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:58,008
Well, after all, she isn't the
most focused person in the world.

79
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:00,125
Oh, just behave and do what you're told, now.

80
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,237
Usually, a character like you, would act
as the type who couldn't earn a living.

81
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,427
And he keeps a book of his household spending.

82
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:07,369
How'd you know that?!

83
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,069
Oh, jeez, you really do?!

84
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:12,858
Want a towel?

85
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,231
I will get it myself, thank you.

86
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,058
President, can I ask something?

87
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,583
Certainly, although I may choose not to answer you.

88
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:25,525
So today... we are celebrating
Rolo and me coming back alive.

89
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,340
Mm-hm!

90
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:28,746
You two escaped that terror attack, all right!

91
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:31,492
Shirley was practically out of her mind, the poor girl!

92
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:34,142
"Oh! If my Lulu's been killed, I'll..."

93
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:35,733
Hey, where is Rolo?

94
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:37,746
I spoke with him, but, you know...

95
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,335
The boy's a lot more sensitive than his older brother.

96
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,735
That's partly why he doesn't have any friends, isn't it?

97
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,802
You should simply say he's quiet!

98
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,634
Uh...

99
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,064
Not that I mind your dirty hands on my mouth, but...

100
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,774
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

101
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:51,231
Look at this mess!

102
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:53,713
Nobody remembers anything about Nunnally.

103
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:57,342
My little sister's been replaced
by a pretend little brother.

104
00:05:57,556 --> 00:06:00,696
I wasn't the only one whose memory was rewritten.

105
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:04,179
The entire student council
has been manipulated with, as well!

106
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:05,850
How dare they!

107
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:17,405
Even after the Babel Tower incident,

108
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,505
Lelouch Lamperouge has shown no special changes.

109
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,484
There are 180 cameras on campus,

110
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,347
as well as 47 undercover observers.

111
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:32,282
That's 48 observers.

112
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,349
We've found no clues or information that could

113
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:37,522
connect Lelouch with the destruction of Carthage's unit.

114
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:39,422
Surveillance is perfect.

115
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:42,292
He has no opportunity to use his Geass.

116
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:45,813
If he is Zero, it would be odd
if he returned here to the school.

117
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,505
And what's the status of C.C.?

118
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,327
Where is she?

119
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:51,197
If she's not in close proximity to Lelouch, then...

120
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:53,767
...the odds are very slim that
she would be in the consulate.

121
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:56,869
You mean things are the same
as they were before the incident?

122
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:59,352
You've still no clue where C.C. is?

123
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,277
Those of us in the Office of Secret Intelligence

124
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:05,877
will carry on our mission to capture her!

125
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:08,694
People, continue observing the bait as you have been.

126
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,727
Yes, My Lord.

127
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,640
The enemy's center is where
their surveillance data is transmitted.

128
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:16,754
I can just keep acting the way I have been,

129
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:18,552
but the problem is Nunnally.

130
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:21,646
The fact that all memory of her
has been erased from everyone's minds

131
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,921
tells me she would never show up here at school.

132
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:28,435
In short, the probability is high that
the Britannian emperor has my sister now.

133
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,579
I'm dealing with a man who would
use his own children as pawns.

134
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,898
If they learn that I've regained my memories...

135
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:35,881
that I've reverted to being Zero...

136
00:07:35,906 --> 00:07:37,762
Nunnally will be in danger!

137
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,331
I have to plan my movements carefully.

138
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:44,127
First, I'll trick the people they have spying on me.

139
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,498
And then...

140
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:46,606
Lelouch?

141
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:50,048
Make sure you come to class tomorrow, you hear?

142
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:51,614
Yes, I hear you.

143
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:54,833
Coach Villetta, you really should have more faith in me.

144
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:56,598
Villetta Nu...

145
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:59,402
A woman I once used my Geass on.

146
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:07,714
I can use my Geass power on a person only once.

147
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:11,608
Which means... it won't work on her any more.

148
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:15,914
That leaves my brother Rolo, who shouldn't even exist.

149
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,208
Why don't I begin by gradually subduing him?

150
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,252
Italian state forces are holding
strong on the right flank, too!

151
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:30,788
The victory Bordeaux we drink
tonight will be a fine vintage!

152
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:32,648
Unknown craft approaching from above!

153
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:33,660
What?!

154
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,139
The Lancelot!

155
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:39,789
Britannia's White Death!

156
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:42,325
Knights of the Round here at the front line?!

157
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:44,382
Please surrender.

158
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:45,266
Huh? What?

159
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,273
You have no chance of winning.

160
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,058
Anyone who throws his weapon down will not be shot.

161
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,208
Of all the impertinent...!

162
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:54,091
Destroy him, dammit! He's only one knight!

163
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:57,464
Then so be it.

164
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:06,650
Do you want more?!

165
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:21,771
Allowing him to conduct a solo operation?

166
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:22,728
Are you sure?

167
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:25,402
Kururugi used to be your subordinate, Your Highness.

168
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:27,119
He's now the Knight of Seven

169
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:29,394
and reports directly to His Majesty.

170
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:30,211
Yes, My Lord...

171
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,335
He has been elevated in rank.

172
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,944
He's to be admired.

173
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,835
The world today is overflowing with despair.

174
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:42,810
That's why he uses his humility and sense of duty
as a compass to guide him through these dark times.

175
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:44,446
Nina's gone, too.

176
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,966
I wonder if Suzaku took Arthur with him.

177
00:09:47,157 --> 00:09:48,116
Huh?

178
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,106
What's up?

179
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,937
How come you're looking through the album?

180
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:55,058
Hey, that's the student council
marathon dance file, isn't it?

181
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,817
You know the Prez. She runs us ragged
with all these events she likes to put on.

182
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,950
Oh, that's the Broken Heart Contest.

183
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:02,508
Talk about sad irony.

184
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,733
The Prez stomps on Rivalz's heart
then presents him with the award for winning.

185
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,948
Weird how you happened to escape.

186
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:09,829
Hm?

187
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,706
You heard the news, didn't you?

188
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,960
Our military had Babel Tower completely surrounded.

189
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,698
So how did you do it? How did you manage to get past them?

190
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,635
What're you talking about, Rolo?

191
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,877
Do you wanna know how I got away from the military,

192
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:25,083
or did you mean to say terrorists?

193
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:27,844
I took an emergency corridor.

194
00:10:27,869 --> 00:10:31,502
I tried to call you, but my cell
wouldn't work in that particular area.

195
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:34,050
I see.

196
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:35,797
A locket...

197
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:37,015
That's right.

198
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,696
I remember giving it to Rolo for his birthday.

199
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,419
No, that's wrong.

200
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:44,246
October 25th... is not his birthday.

201
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:46,519
It's Nunnally's birthday!

202
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,529
Rolo, give me that locket.

203
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:51,312
Huh?

204
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:52,906
I don't know what I was thinking.

205
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,691
That's not a good gift for a guy.

206
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:55,841
I'll get you something else...

207
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:59,014
Don't take it! You gave it to me! It's mine!

208
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:01,694
Please don't! Don't take it back!

209
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:03,583
Uh... Sure, fine.

210
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:05,233
You keep it then, Rolo.

211
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,217
Uh...

212
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,729
Right. We haven't observed
any changes in Lelouch's behavior.

213
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:19,557
There are no indications that he's used his Geass, either.

214
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:23,689
The order won't divulge the secrets
of Geass due to its religious nature...

215
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:26,633
Uh, sorry, I can see you're busy. It can wait.

216
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:28,773
Rolo, no! He's one of us!

217
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:30,669
He's on the same mission we are...

218
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:38,598
Wait for orders!

219
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,721
There's a chance he overheard us.

220
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:45,004
Knowledge of Geass is restricted
to just us two in the Tokyo section!

221
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:46,519
We can't take the risk!

222
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,798
But still...

223
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:50,314
How many of our agents have you killed so far?

224
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,490
It was the quickest and most
certain method to keeping the secret.

225
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:55,021
Or am I wrong?

226
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,489
It's been three days since the
United States of Japan was established.

227
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:03,946
I doubt Britannia is going to
keep glaring at us indefinitely.

228
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:06,791
There's even talk about ousting the consul-general

229
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:09,593
back in the Chinese Federation's homeland.

230
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:14,475
And yet, we still haven't received
any instructions from Lelouch.

231
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:17,039
What on earth is he doing?

232
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:24,773
You really are Zero, aren't you?

233
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,427
Of course!

234
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:32,116
I can drag out the extradition
negotiations with the Britannians.

235
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,360
I think I might be able to buy us up to a week.

236
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:36,094
I'll report that to Zero.

237
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,964
As for the Chinese Federation government's...

238
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:40,023
C.C.! I was just thinking!

239
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:43,356
Wouldn't it have made more sense
for you to have played the bunny girl?!

240
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:46,943
Huh?! Uh!

241
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:52,289
Zero is... a girl?!

242
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,023
Correct.

243
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:54,429
I'm not Zero!

244
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:55,996
Oh, you let on too soon.

245
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:57,938
You have no sense of humor, do you?

246
00:12:57,963 --> 00:12:59,350
Don't play around with Zero!

247
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,614
We can see you.

248
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:04,339
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Kallen Kouzuki.

249
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:06,904
You're the pilot of the Guren MK-II, right?

250
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,389
How did you...

251
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:11,416
I'm someone who takes an avid interest in you people.

252
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,507
There's trouble!

253
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:15,608
It's Ohgi and the other prisoners!

254
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,266
Can you hear me, Zero?

255
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:23,548
Listen closely. I am Lord Gilbert G.P. Guilford,

256
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,515
knight of her royal highness, Cornelia li Britannia!

257
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:30,000
Beginning tomorrow at 15:00 hours,

258
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:33,798
these 256 special class A
felons who are guilty of treason...

259
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,498
They wouldn't...

260
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,565
...against the empire,

261
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,231
will all be executed for their crimes!

262
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,596
Zero!

263
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:45,437
If you value the lives of
your people, then you will face me,

264
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:48,081
one-on-one, in an honorable duel!

265
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:51,671
Guilford... You've really gone and done it now.

266
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,766
Lulu! Are you in here all by yourself?

267
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,743
Yeah. Shirley, don't you have swim club now?

268
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,351
Yes, I do, but...

269
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:02,629
You see, I have to go shopping
because I have to buy a birthday gift.

270
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:03,796
Whose birthday?

271
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:06,023
Ms. Villetta, our counselor.

272
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,575
They all agree I should buy it,

273
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,793
since I'm always the one who always gets her mad.

274
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:13,306
Problem is, I'm incredibly
impaired at picking out presents.

275
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:15,954
She seems to enjoy liquor, I could buy her that.

276
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,812
But I don't know what brand she likes.

277
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,206
Should I go with you?

278
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,064
Huh?!

279
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:22,460
I could help you select a present for her.

280
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:25,989
Y-You would?! Seriously?!

281
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:27,514
Sure. You ready to go?

282
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:29,046
Yeah! Mm-hm!

283
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:32,571
All right! Now I've got my scoop! Thank you, guys!

284
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,756
Since you're unable to control your Geass,

285
00:14:51,781 --> 00:14:53,290
this is for your protection.

286
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:55,048
It only has to block optical data,

287
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:57,819
so a normal color contact lens would work fine,

288
00:14:57,844 --> 00:14:59,886
Don't try to probe for information.

289
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:02,727
As you've already guessed, you're holding a special lens.

290
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:03,948
Although...

291
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:06,661
Should your Geass grow stronger than what you have now...

292
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:09,098
Well, we'll just have to end this game...

293
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:11,365
...before that happens.

294
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:13,967
Are you're going out?

295
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:16,050
Yeah, I have to help pick out a gift.

296
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:18,159
It's a present for Ms. Villetta's birthday.

297
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,817
Her birthday?

298
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:21,246
I see.

299
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:24,173
I guess birthdays are important, aren't they?

300
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:25,948
Well, I'd better be going.

301
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:27,223
See you later.

302
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:31,857
Rolo!

303
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,469
Huh? Ah!

304
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,113
Miss President!

305
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:37,012
Rolo, you come along, too!

306
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:37,438
Huh?

307
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:39,137
It'll be fun to chat.

308
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:40,329
Hm...

309
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:42,540
I've learned about wines but never tried any.

310
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:43,815
Outta luck there.

311
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,340
How about this stuff?

312
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:47,031
Maybe those are too sweet.

313
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:48,517
How 'bout a Sopron?

314
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,264
Could this be...

315
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:51,732
...a date?

316
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:52,898
If it's not...

317
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,777
...I'll make it one, then!

318
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:00,188
Just as I planned.

319
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:02,629
Although, I didn't think they'd bring Rolo, too.

320
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:04,313
Typical of Milly...

321
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:09,131
What a great topic for our next meeting of
the Society of Research on Male-Female Dating!

322
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:10,204
Um... Right.

323
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:12,942
Yeah, but it fair for him to follow his own brother?

324
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,009
You're as interested as we are, aren't you?

325
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,826
She may end up being your family member.

326
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,142
She's right!

327
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:19,788
Family...

328
00:16:25,857 --> 00:16:28,306
Target is taking assumed route "Zebra."

329
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:30,488
Roger. Switch off with Group 7.

330
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:32,722
Group 2, watch for contact with C.C.

331
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:35,455
Yes, My Lord. Cleaning the perimeter.

332
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:40,138
Can it be that he really isn't Zero?

333
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:43,461
They specifically set a trap at Babel Tower.

334
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:47,063
Which means my enemy isn't
the settlement's vice-regal government.

335
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:49,517
While I can't tell for certain who's watching me,

336
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,529
the system itself that they're using has flaws in it.

337
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:56,479
If he is Zero, he won't ignore the
execution of his people tomorrow.

338
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:59,256
Maybe his memory truly hasn't returned.

339
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:01,144
Excuse me.

340
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:02,940
How do I fill this part out?

341
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,044
Pardon?

342
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:07,311
Sorry, but could you do me a favor, please?

343
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,625
Sure. What can I do for you?

344
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,481
Well, it's like this...

345
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,082
Mmm...

346
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:25,306
Huh?

347
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:34,642
I'm back.

348
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,054
What were you looking at?

349
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,038
Oh! Um... That!

350
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:43,650
I... was just wishing I could
take a ride on a cable car sometime.

351
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:51,598
It's my fault.

352
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:54,515
My fault that Shirley's memories were wiped.

353
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:56,498
Milly and Rivalz, too!

354
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:59,248
Their memories re-written without their consent!

355
00:17:59,323 --> 00:18:01,713
I just can't let things go the way they are.

356
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:03,181
When this is all over...

357
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:03,934
I swear I'll...

358
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,329
What's the matter?

359
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:07,486
The Prez and the others are following us.

360
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:08,865
What? Where?

361
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,104
Shirley.

362
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:11,113
Huh?

363
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:13,200
I thought of a terrific idea.

364
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,183
Huh?

365
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,849
Target entering store.

366
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:19,519
Alpha-14. It's a small shop.

367
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:21,919
There's a risk I'll blow my cover if I follow.

368
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:23,381
Cover the front of the place.

369
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,602
I'll send three people to cover the rear.

370
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:27,950
Okay.

371
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:31,071
All I want you do to is
pretend that I'm in here for a while.

372
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:32,559
What are you gonna do?

373
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:36,142
I'm going to sneak out of the store
and surprise the Prez and the others.

374
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,981
Sure! I gotcha!

375
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,723
I don't normally shop here.

376
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,944
I hope they don't have any
surveillance cameras or microphones.

377
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:50,553
Shirley thinks this is only a harmless prank.

378
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:52,725
Even on the off-chance that something goes wrong,

379
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,791
I won't cause any trouble for her.

380
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:57,474
I used my Geass to make the preparations.

381
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,390
Now all I have to do...

382
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:05,217
Hello, Omotesando Mall security; may I help you?

383
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:07,992
Huh?! The Black Knights?!

384
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:10,761
We have planted a bomb
in the mall, and we will detonate it

385
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:13,398
if all our following demands are not met immediately.

386
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:15,925
No... He can't be Zero!

387
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,940
Paging Mr. Maximillian from the Hakodate settlement.

388
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:23,079
Paging Mr. Maximillian from the Hakodate settlement.

389
00:19:23,104 --> 00:19:23,744
That means a...!

390
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:24,477
You have a phone call.

391
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:25,817
A terrorist warning!

392
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:27,532
It must be the Black Knights!

393
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,099
Zero's been resurrected!

394
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:31,874
Keep your voices down! The customers will hear!

395
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:32,913
But...!

396
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:37,872
Uh?

397
00:19:39,323 --> 00:19:42,252
A bomb threat has just been
made to Omotesando Mall, My Lord!

398
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:45,948
Okay, hold your positions! Prepare for contact from C.C.!

399
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,529
All tasks at hand have been cleared,

400
00:19:53,554 --> 00:19:55,650
except for the detonator.

401
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,848
10... 9... 8... 7...

402
00:20:00,882 --> 00:20:05,548
...6... 5... 4... 3...

403
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:08,448
...2... 1...!

404
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:11,923
It's the Black Knights!

405
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:13,523
Terrorists?!

406
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,446
What's happening?!

407
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,615
What the hell?!

408
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,186
Whoa, what's going on?!

409
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:23,928
Rolo!

410
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,796
Rolo! Don't run off!

411
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:28,521
Rolo?

412
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:30,690
He's gone!

413
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,540
We've lost the target, M'Lord!

414
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,631
What should we do about the
info that we've got from Scorpion?

415
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:35,399
Where's Rolo?!

416
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:37,992
All cell phone calls are being
jammed to maintain civic order!

417
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:40,834
My Lord, should we act on Scorpion's info or not?!

418
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:42,952
Very well, I'll go myself!

419
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:48,981
And that's just one easy way...

420
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:50,681
...to cause a panic.

421
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:57,158
What's his location?! Uh?!

422
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:01,892
No one's here. Where are they?

423
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:06,209
It seems they've gone looking for C.C...

424
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:07,359
I see.

425
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:08,965
You really have awakened.

426
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,748
I put the man who was following me

427
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:13,750
under my absolute control and turned him into my slave.

428
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,498
Just as I thought, your top
priority was the capture of C.C.

429
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,638
No matter how wrong the information is that you get.

430
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:27,746
As of this moment, this gilded prison of a school
will become my castle, my fortress of freedom.

431
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:29,886
And as for you, dear brother,

432
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:32,775
I'll make you my pawn to find Nunnally.

433
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,784
What?!

434
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:40,544
Geass?!

435
00:21:40,815 --> 00:21:42,690
You stopped time?!

436
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:43,940
Lelouch...

437
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:46,340
Now you and your demonic eye...

438
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,746
...will die.

439
00:21:51,106 --> 00:21:52,481
Zero! Emergency!

440
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:54,404
The Chinese Federation just...

441
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,621
Huh?!

442
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:03,984
Here and now, you cursed Black Knights will be vanquished!

443
00:23:38,457 --> 00:23:42,040
Guilford is about to exectue
the core members of the Black Knights.

444
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:45,657
The very people I need in order to carry out my plan!

445
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:47,682
Somehow, I have to save them.

446
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:48,831
But at the moment,

447
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:51,731
my phony brother Rolo is my main obstacle.

448
00:23:51,906 --> 00:23:55,692
It's only logical that they would
assign a Geass-user to observe me.

449
00:23:55,732 --> 00:23:57,650
But that power of his...

450
00:23:57,782 --> 00:23:58,721
No...

451
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,700
There's a breach I can exploit.

452
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:05,267
For the sake of everyone whose
memories were rewritten, I must!
