1
00:00:02,993 --> 00:00:04,840
Ohgi, are you sure you wanna go through with this?

2
00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:05,682
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:07,890
I have a duty to get everyone to safety.

4
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:08,861
But...!

5
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:11,730
No. I'm just sorry I did this to you.

6
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:12,756
Everyone...

7
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:15,281
In a battlefield controlled by F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

8
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:19,232
Another F.L.E.I.J.A. strike...

9
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:24,821
Twammi fleet is totally obliterated! The operation...

10
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:26,457
I'm not going to stop it!

11
00:00:26,482 --> 00:00:28,524
Stay just out of the Damocles' range!

12
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:30,392
The Avalon falls back as ordered!

13
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:33,007
All units! Attack in waves and force the Damocles

14
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:35,044
to continue launching F.L.E.I.J.A.s.

15
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:39,888
How easily... It's so easy...

16
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:41,263
...for me to...

17
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:44,467
Nunnally, we're ready to fire the next one.

18
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:46,640
Right.

19
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,994
It renders tactics useless.

20
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,940
However... If I can get within a tight range,

21
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:32,817
they won't be able to use it!

22
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:35,940
A blaze luminous!

23
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:37,348
But it's so immense!

24
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:39,498
The Damocles was specially designed and built

25
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:42,231
to achieve absolute air superiority.

26
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:45,567
If it reaches a certain altitude,

27
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:47,467
we'll lose our only chance against it!

28
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,954
Tch! Suzaku!

29
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,479
Can you break through those defenses?!

30
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,619
I'm trying!

31
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:54,211
But their power output is in a different league than mine!

32
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:56,878
But I don't think they can fire a F.L.E.I.J.A. now.

33
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:59,754
And, in turn, our attacks
can't break through their shield.

34
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,600
We may as well be spectators.

35
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:03,101
Is there nothing left for the world

36
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:05,763
except to cower before the
crushing might of the F.L.E.I.J.A.s?

37
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:08,677
Well, that offers a sort of peace, too.

38
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:11,025
Mass our remaining forces around the Avalon!

39
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,023
We're going to launch a direct assault
on the Damocles with our hostages on board!

40
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:16,382
Sure about that?

41
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:19,638
Your return here means it's nearly figured out, I presume.

42
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:23,151
The rest depends on you and Suzaku, Your Majesty.

43
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:24,037
Schneizel!

44
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:26,030
Are you trying to kill the captives, too?!

45
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,646
Now that the Black Knights have been beaten...

46
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,467
We aren't beaten yet!

47
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,605
Very well then, I'll wait ten minutes.

48
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,861
Ten minutes?!

49
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:37,125
Aren't you talking to me because
you're already in position to counterattack?

50
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:40,962
All right, fine. Ten minutes.

51
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,964
That's a hefty loan, sir, considering
we need ten minutes to prep the next shot.

52
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:48,971
It saves me from dealing with them after the battle.

53
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,200
Are you saying you don't need the Black Knights anymore?

54
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:56,011
What purpose would a collective
military strength possibly serve?

55
00:03:58,245 --> 00:03:59,745
Hey, Rivalz.

56
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:01,569
What's up, Prez?

57
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:04,161
It's amazing. I mean, when you think about it,

58
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:06,961
our student council members
are out fighting the whole world.

59
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:08,783
What, is that sarcasm?

60
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,396
'Cause I wasn't able to protect Nina, correct?

61
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:14,525
Don't beat yourself up. You did your very best.

62
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:16,344
I tried, but I...

63
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:19,127
No. You really did.

64
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:21,877
From behind?!

65
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:26,923
The Black Knights!

66
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,221
I'll defeat you myself, I swear!

67
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:32,002
Sneaking from behind, Xing-ke?

68
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:34,594
I won't let the Avalon be shot down!

69
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,615
Xing-ke, you'll fail!

70
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,736
Justice weighs on my side!

71
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,269
It's over!

72
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:56,315
What the...?!

73
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,465
Kururugi!

74
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,331
You dare fight in your condition?!

75
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:01,056
You turned your back on your country

76
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:04,094
in order to climb in rank,
so here is the ugly way it ends!

77
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,827
What is this you fight for?!

78
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:08,656
The one thing I want that I'll fight for is a future!

79
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:10,794
Your future is worthless!

80
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:15,235
I failed!

81
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:18,604
General!

82
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:26,521
Dammit!

83
00:05:26,546 --> 00:05:27,371
Oh?

84
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:29,154
They've done better than I expected.

85
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,811
Primary float, damaged.

86
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:32,502
Damage level, 75%.

87
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:35,402
It's failed. The Avalon is falling!

88
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:39,875
I can't let them board it!

89
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,623
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

90
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:44,915
Okay! Now to settle things once and for a...

91
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,960
Huh? I'm not giving in! I've got pride, too, ya know!

92
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,458
I wasn't in time. Did they get in?

93
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:57,527
If we engage them in close combat,

94
00:05:57,552 --> 00:06:01,752
we've a chance to take over their power
and communications, then rescue the hostages!

95
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,483
We hear and obey!

96
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:05,633
Holding out this long was good enough.

97
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:07,158
Land the ship in the Pacific.

98
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:09,948
You will now follow mission Apate Aletheia.

99
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,773
Master Lelouch...

100
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,788
You have served me well.

101
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:18,077
I'm grateful for the resolve you've all shown.

102
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:20,968
Yes, Your Majesty.

103
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,529
Should we fire another F.L.E.I.J.A. now?

104
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:27,858
We still have our blaze luminous
and should wait for criticality.

105
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:28,963
Good point.

106
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,267
But it's an excellent opportunity
to eliminate the Black Knights.

107
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,708
No, I suppose we shouldn't. That's too ambitious.

108
00:06:35,777 --> 00:06:37,379
Yes, I understand.

109
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:40,479
This is a personal request from me. However...

110
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:43,804
It was Princess Euphemia's wish, too, wasn't it?

111
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,402
Yes, which is why I have to do it.

112
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:47,967
But for the device to be complete,

113
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:51,559
the environmental data needs to
be entered into the final program.

114
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:52,742
You should let me go with you...

115
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,715
No, you've done enough for me, Nina.

116
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,865
What you just said reveals your true feelings about this.

117
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,681
Yes, you've done enough for me.
For Zero, Euphy's murderer.

118
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:06,777
I won't find it in my heart to forgive Zero.

119
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,994
Maybe not for the rest of my life. But...

120
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,973
This is separate from that.

121
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,294
I simply had to find my own
answer to everything that's happened.

122
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:17,042
That's all there is to it.

123
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,476
You're truly amazing.

124
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:27,231
C.C.! Are you all right?

125
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:28,594
Well, that's a switch.

126
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:30,411
Were you really worried about me?

127
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:32,469
You're a valued combatant.

128
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,100
Hmph. That's why I came to pick that up.

129
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,375
Then... will you be escorting me?

130
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,929
You're going out there?

131
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:42,465
Though taking such action could
mean you'll have to kill Nunnally yourself.

132
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,354
I have no choice if she stands
in the way of the Zero Requiem.

133
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,942
Lelouch, don't you hate me for
cheating you out of your own life?

134
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:51,550
By giving you your Geass,

135
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:54,409
I affected your life and drastically changed your fate.

136
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:57,233
That doesn't sound like you, the immortal witch.

137
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,315
C.C... the Geass power you gave me...

138
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:06,446
It only put me on the path that would
lead to my destiny, and nothing more.

139
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:09,129
Everything that followed was my choice.

140
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,871
In all my life, I've never met a man like you.

141
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:14,108
C.C...

142
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,440
Kallen!

143
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,298
I'm going to stop you!

144
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:22,596
Goodbye, Lelouch.

145
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,981
Leave this to me! Get to the Damocles!

146
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:31,964
You stubborn...!

147
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:33,727
Stop! You're no match for the Guren!

148
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:36,711
I'm sincerely glad that you care, Lelouch.

149
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,108
Now go on, hurry!

150
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:42,758
Just make sure you come back! That'll make me smile, okay?

151
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:45,094
Yes! I promise you!

152
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,852
I have to succeed, no matter what!

153
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:51,844
This move must work!

154
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:55,150
Enemy Knightmares approaching.

155
00:08:55,175 --> 00:08:56,942
The Shinkirou is leading them.

156
00:08:57,044 --> 00:09:00,713
Lower the blaze luminous away from
the F.L.E.I.J.A. launch tube, immediately.

157
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:03,542
We're going to redirect our aim at the Shinkirou.

158
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:06,284
Lelouch, discarding your life at the end?

159
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:07,502
How unsightly.

160
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:09,400
Realignment complete.

161
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:14,311
Nunnally. It ends now. Can you do this?

162
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,129
Yes, brother Schneizel.

163
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:19,128
Blaze luminous, lowered.

164
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,261
Now.

165
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,077
Right. Entering data.

166
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:31,231
The F.L.E.I.J.A. changes
composition from moment to moment.

167
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:34,442
If we collide it with a reaction
corresponding to that composition,

168
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:36,467
we can prevent it from reaching criticality.

169
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,131
However, you need to input

170
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:40,947
the local environment data just prior to detonation,

171
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:43,202
within a 19 second time frame.

172
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:44,802
And, even if you complete the program,

173
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:48,338
you'll only have 0.04 seconds to execute.

174
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:54,961
With this, peace will come.

175
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:57,715
Suzaku!

176
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,831
Yes, Your Majesty!

177
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,192
Now!

178
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:18,594
It should work in theory, but...

179
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,927
Princess Euphemia...!

180
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,319
Hm?

181
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:31,494
A F.L.E.I.J.A.!

182
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:33,620
It disappeared!

183
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,983
It worked? They did it?

184
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:40,466
In 19 seconds and then in 0.04 seconds?

185
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:43,531
I didn't expect them to have made a toy like that.

186
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:49,315
Ready... Fly in!

187
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:53,633
They gotten through the blaze?!

188
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,449
They have indeed.

189
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,386
Enemy infiltration, alpha-three!

190
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:08,619
Where's the key?! I must find the Damocles key!

191
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:20,879
Delta block communications cut!

192
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:22,992
Float control room six has been destroyed!

193
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,498
Prince Schneizel!

194
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:26,936
My kudos, Lelouch. I salute you.

195
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:29,596
For forcing me to implement my final plan.

196
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:31,623
Huh?! You're really going to do that?!

197
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:32,088
Hm?

198
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:32,862
Yes.

199
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:36,428
Turn the Damocles into
a prison for Lelouch and the others.

200
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,725
After we've abandoned ship,

201
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,333
we'll obliterate the Damocles entirely with a F.L.E.I.J.A.

202
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,169
What a fine coffin for him.

203
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:48,904
I'm certain you'll be pleased with it, Lelouch.

204
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,069
If Damocles reaches satellite orbit,

205
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:53,344
even the Lancelot will be useless against it.

206
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:55,410
To win, we need to stop Schneizel.

207
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:57,258
I'm analyzing the internal structure.

208
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,866
I have to break the password.

209
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:00,050
What?!

210
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:04,986
Gino?

211
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:08,821
Lelouch! I refuse to accept you and your Britannia!

212
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:11,517
I'll destroy you, here and now!

213
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:15,604
Guh?! How is it so powerful?!

214
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:20,671
Gino!

215
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:21,869
Suzaku!

216
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,567
Lelouch, go on ahead!

217
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:26,306
There's an enemy to be defeated and someone to be rescued!

218
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,971
It's all up to you now! Go!

219
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:28,996
Right!

220
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:30,361
Coward!

221
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:41,879
You insist on fighting me, Gino?

222
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:42,688
Yes.

223
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:45,411
I will do whatever it takes to protect something I love!

224
00:12:45,436 --> 00:12:47,498
And I'm fighting for the same reason!

225
00:12:47,523 --> 00:12:49,731
To protect what?!

226
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:52,215
Is Schneizel on the control and command floor?

227
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,532
Or else, could he be...?

228
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:54,658
Seventh sequence.

229
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:57,756
F.L.E.I.J.A. detonation point set to within Damocles!

230
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,765
Damocles and the F.L.E.I.J.A.s
are simply machines in the end.

231
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,540
We can always rebuild them.

232
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:07,854
But, sir, you know the Toromo
Agency doesn't have the resources.

233
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,288
Nor does Rosenberg.

234
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:12,792
Yes... But Lelouch is now the enemy of the world.

235
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:15,392
If it turns out that our system has destroyed him...

236
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:19,244
There will be plenty of organizations
happy to build F.L.E.I.J.A.s for us.

237
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,273
Isn't that basically terrorism?

238
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:24,419
Besides, there's Princess
Nunnally's opinion to consider, also.

239
00:13:24,444 --> 00:13:27,448
Why care for what she says? Bait has no opinion.

240
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:29,528
What do you mean... you're abandoning her?!

241
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,465
World peace or a single life?

242
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,225
It's sad to say, but one cannot
be compared with the other.

243
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:42,061
Where is it? Where's the key?

244
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:44,345
I have to stop Lelouch!

245
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:51,300
We have to hold out here

246
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,811
until His Majesty completes his mission!

247
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:59,219
I despise what Lelouch is now.

248
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:00,867
The Knight of Six?!

249
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:03,402
Now that's a fitting opponent for me!

250
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,546
You have no country! You have nothing to avenge!

251
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:18,161
You also don't have a shred of ambition!

252
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:21,086
Someone who has no reason to fight should just leave!

253
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,596
I've made a reason to fight! A promise!

254
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:26,052
Are you saying that you love Lelouch?!

255
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:27,761
I don't know.

256
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:29,979
But I believe the time has finally arrived

257
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:33,254
for me to stop "accumulating
experiences" and start living.

258
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,902
That makes you sound almost human!

259
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:37,569
Well done.

260
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:43,706
Kallen, I concede. You win.

261
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:45,981
Don't care, 'cause to me, it doesn't matter.

262
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:47,294
Bye now.

263
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:52,190
Heh.

264
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,325
Winning or losing, I never would have thought

265
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,663
that those feelings were still inside me, alive and well.

266
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:01,769
The key... Where's the key?!

267
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:03,475
It's got to be here!

268
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:06,956
I have to stop Lelouch, and it's all up to me to do it!

269
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,681
If only I could...

270
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:14,485
Standing by to launch.

271
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,533
Rendezvous point with Sir Hartgren is as planned,

272
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:17,990
no changes.

273
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,129
Course clear. Ceiling favorable.

274
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:22,067
Huh?

275
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:29,361
I've been waiting for you, Schneizel.

276
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:31,621
I see.

277
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:35,338
I suppose this means that you have me in checkmate.

278
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:40,902
Please tell me.

279
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,608
I'm dying to know.

280
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:45,138
Just how did you discover what my plan was?

281
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:46,350
You're mistaken.

282
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,363
What I anticipated was the pattern of your own nature.

283
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:50,517
My nature?

284
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,879
You don't have the desire to win.

285
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,515
You remember that chess match?

286
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,457
At the Vermillion Forbidden City?

287
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:00,440
And the coup d'etat of the Black Knights...

288
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,981
You only play games you can't lose.

289
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:06,588
So... you predicted that I would abandon the Damocles?

290
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:10,054
Schneizel, this time, I'm going
to make sure that you lose.

291
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,829
Meaning I'll be put to death.

292
00:16:15,402 --> 00:16:17,886
Hong-Gu, move from corridor three to take the bridge.

293
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,946
U.F.N. representatives...

294
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,379
Xing-ke...!

295
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,421
Your Majesty! You're all right?

296
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:27,108
Yes! We were saved by those people over there!

297
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,300
That's correct.

298
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:31,140
Master Xing-ke, we are now on your side.

299
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:33,653
You all betrayed Lelouch then?

300
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:34,340
Huh?

301
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:36,704
And for a valid reason. He threatened us!

302
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,479
However, now that Lelouch is no longer here...

303
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:41,627
At the very least, we believe that the others

304
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:44,508
think dictatorship is wrong and will never support it.

305
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:45,824
Very well then.

306
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:50,239
Yes. The final battle will most likely
take place within the Damocles.

307
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:53,014
Ohgi... I mean the Secretary General...

308
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,893
Either way. You're saying he's okay, right?

309
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,197
Y-Yes...

310
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,972
My brother didn't kill me.

311
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,847
I'm still here after all is said and done.

312
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,312
In a more normal world, he'd be an excellent ruler.

313
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:08,686
He isn't driven by the ambition that egotists have.

314
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,491
I was a fool not to have seen that.

315
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:13,420
Wouldn't you agree?

316
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:22,368
Princess, I...

317
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:27,481
Guilford. You're never going
to stop calling me that, are you?

318
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,619
I have a question.

319
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:36,129
We're you intending to use the
Damocles as a tool to dominate the world?

320
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:37,189
I wasn't.

321
00:17:37,214 --> 00:17:39,745
I only wanted to give everyone what they wanted.

322
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,810
To bring peace to civilization.

323
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:44,208
Disregarding humanity's true nature?

324
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:46,022
That's a matter of opinion.

325
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:48,485
Then you actually imagined you could maintain

326
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,799
the world in a perpetual state of "now."

327
00:17:50,824 --> 00:17:51,614
But...

328
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:54,587
life without change might be called anything except life.

329
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,886
It's nothing more than experience.

330
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:57,747
But...

331
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:00,751
link those together, and they become knowledge, right?

332
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:04,261
Schneizel, you truly are superior.

333
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:07,422
So superior, you can't even see it!

334
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:10,720
Yes. Emperor Charles sought the past.

335
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:14,987
You seek the present. But I seek the future.

336
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:18,095
But the future may be prove to be worse than the present.

337
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,287
No... It will be better.

338
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,521
Because, no matter how long it takes,

339
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:25,379
people will continue to seek out happiness.

340
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,656
Even though that will end up making people greedy.

341
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:32,816
Your folly also knows no limit.

342
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:35,095
You're really too emotional about this.

343
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,220
Hope and dreams are merely names for aimless fiction.

344
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:42,070
You're restricted, since you belong
to the symbol known as a royal family,

345
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:43,862
which looks down on the world.

346
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:45,770
I've seen it over and over.

347
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:47,906
The people who struggle against sadness.

348
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49,464
Those who seek the future.

349
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:51,991
How they all carry on, wishing for happiness.

350
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:56,314
Human nature is why I chose Geass and to wear a mask.

351
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,997
Lelouch, you're contradicting yourself.

352
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:01,443
You, who continually deny the will of others,

353
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:04,426
are standing here before us,
affirming the will of humanity.

354
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:07,302
That's enough. Kill me now and be done with it.

355
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:10,251
But... a F.L.E.I.J.A. will still decimate you.

356
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:13,193
We will gladly give our lives
to bring peace to the world...

357
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:13,943
Hm?

358
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,272
And that's how I came to my decision...

359
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:18,472
...that I'd give you the gift of the words.

360
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:20,270
"You shall serve Zero."

361
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:22,379
Then you never intended to kill me at all.

362
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:23,920
You wanted to...!

363
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,629
H-Highness!

364
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:34,837
Dammit! Why didn't I see it coming?

365
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,945
He anticipated Schneizel's thoughts

366
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,470
and recorded that conversation...!

367
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:42,566
Order me to do whatever you wish, Master Zero.

368
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:47,472
Schneizel... your willingness to let yourself be killed

369
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:50,229
is exactly what has led you to be defeated.

370
00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:52,656
Don't move!

371
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:55,243
Zero! This story's finished!

372
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:57,018
You never should have come this far!

373
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:59,822
You shouldn't even be alive, you bastard!

374
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:07,251
What right have you to deny my existence?

375
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:08,645
You have none.

376
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:11,503
Prince Schneizel...

377
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:15,070
A man would sacrifice his
own life without any hesitation!

378
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,885
Such is the power of Geass!

379
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:21,519
Z-Zero... At least...

380
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:25,235
...finish me with your Geass, too.

381
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:29,751
Sorry, Diethard, you're just
not worth wasting my Geass on.

382
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:41,037
Now, Schneizel, you can begin by
canceling the self-destruct for the Damocles.

383
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:43,768
Understood. However, Nunnally is the one

384
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:46,172
who has the F.L.E.I.J.A. control switch.

385
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:54,399
It doesn't matter how strong you made your machine!

386
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:55,766
You won't beat me!

387
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,479
We'll see about that!

388
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:03,752
And this is the result... Gino.

389
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:07,651
No, I've done what I came to do here.

390
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,699
He damaged the blaze luminous system?

391
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:12,897
Now, Kallen!

392
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:14,547
Thanks, Gino!

393
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:18,691
Suzaku! I've come to end it!

394
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:21,610
Our continually crossing paths!

395
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:34,016
It's you, isn't it, big brother?

396
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,439
It is.

397
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:37,716
The reason you're here must be this.

398
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:40,074
Did you come for the Damocles key?

399
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,558
Yes. It's dangerous. Dangerous to you.

400
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,681
Then that's why.

401
00:21:44,706 --> 00:21:45,843
Huh?

402
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:49,418
Why... I won't close my eyes to things any longer.

403
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:55,743
She's broken father's Geass?!

404
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:57,627
With her own will?!

405
00:21:58,294 --> 00:21:59,737
Now, Lelouch...

406
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:03,178
Will you use your Geass on me, as well?

407
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:41,568
Perhaps I've only been wandering
since that day we first met.

408
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:44,754
I was so sick of a world that never changed.

409
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:45,903
But...

410
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:49,708
I couldn't give in to the
despair by telling lies to myself.

411
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:52,102
Yes... My name...

412
00:23:52,127 --> 00:23:54,960
My personal history... The power I've gained...

413
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:59,205
Maybe... it's all been a path for me,
at the end of which I'll find the truth.

414
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:02,489
Perhaps that's what I've sought all along.

415
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,105
Well, then...
