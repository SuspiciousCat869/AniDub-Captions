1
00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:02,719
So? Tell us!

2
00:00:02,744 --> 00:00:04,514
How are things with you and Lelouch?

3
00:00:04,568 --> 00:00:05,227
Huh?

4
00:00:05,252 --> 00:00:07,728
You two are the official school couple now, aren't you?

5
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:08,759
Have you kissed yet?

6
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:11,127
Um, th-that was just for the event.

7
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:12,476
We're not fooling around.

8
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:13,834
Don't be embarrassed.

9
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:16,960
It's no secret that you've always
had a big crush on Lelouch.

10
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:19,319
Oh! Not you too, Coach Villetta!

11
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:20,761
But you love him, don't you?

12
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:22,013
Enough to shoot me?

13
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:22,956
Huh?

14
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:25,188
It's been very difficult, you know?

15
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:29,899
Having to come here and spend each day
cheerfully smiling at the young woman who shot me.

16
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:33,752
My true feelings have to be
hidden behind the mask of a teacher.

17
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:42,432
Shirley Fenette... How dare you!

18
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:44,333
How dare you shoot me!

19
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:04,159
Lulu!

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:05,810
Uh?

21
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,944
That's right. While Lelouch was Zero,

22
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,792
he killed my father.

23
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,623
So, Jianmen pass has fallen?

24
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:33,874
We've also taken over the air force facility in Macau.

25
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,297
We should send Asahina and Hong Gu to defend Jianmenguan.

26
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:41,634
And why don't we assign Minase and Sugiyama
to take charge of municipal affairs there?

27
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,942
Well, looks like things are going smoothly.

28
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:48,231
Our so-called foes are just local
military factions that won't join us,

29
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:50,733
but they'll deploy forces without talking to each other.

30
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:53,459
Not to mention that you've
already got a hold of the empress.

31
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,981
The one leader who could unify all those factions.

32
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,153
Exactly.

33
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:58,557
You're off?

34
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:00,489
I'm going to Ikebukuro.

35
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:03,347
But I'll help you with the rest of
your homework when I return.

36
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:05,370
I'll catch you later, then.

37
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:17,056
Lulu was Zero. And coach Villetta was a soldier.

38
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,474
And Kallen was one of the Black Knights.

39
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:23,444
Then what about Nina? And the Prez? And Rivalz?

40
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:26,288
Is our school the weirdest place on Earth?

41
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:29,330
Oh, why is Nunnally now the viceroy?

42
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:32,341
What are the lies, and what is the truth?

43
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:36,997
Attention: The local express is running 10 minutes

44
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:40,189
behind schedule and will be arriving at platform three.

45
00:04:40,262 --> 00:04:42,258
For those passengers who do not wish to wait...

46
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,444
Very well.

47
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,576
For the first stage, this will be fine.

48
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:46,494
All right then,

49
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,592
we'll continue with the same procedure.

50
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:50,977
And now, here's an announcement to all our

51
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:54,336
patrons about a special deal. For a limited time only,

52
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,653
we're running a campaign...

53
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:56,758
Shirley!

54
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,244
Wait! It's just me.

55
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:04,338
Huh?

56
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:07,212
So what's wrong? Why'd you want to me to come here?

57
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:08,807
Um...

58
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:10,421
Uh...

59
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:11,910
Shirley!

60
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:15,241
Lelouch.

61
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,678
Where's Lelouch? On a date?

62
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:22,967
At the moment, he's out testing the G cars.

63
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,909
Hmph. How convenient.

64
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:25,723
Huh?

65
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:28,586
Rolo, why have you turned your back on your country?

66
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,620
Unlike me, you were dispatched
here by the Order, so why would you...

67
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:33,481
Just why are you asking me that?

68
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,413
What's between my brother and me is...

69
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:35,899
Uh!

70
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:37,208
B7 to control.

71
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,447
Suspicious male sighted near the chapel.

72
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,287
B5 and B9 have moved in to apprehend him.

73
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:48,579
Hmph.

74
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:51,915
Look what happened simply by asking where Lelouch was.

75
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,750
Lord Jeremiah! But how?!

76
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,692
Target is moving toward the clubhouse.

77
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:59,339
B2 and B8 have been eliminated, as well.

78
00:05:59,364 --> 00:06:00,964
Sound a school-wide alarm!

79
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:03,241
Get students out of the vicinity of the target!

80
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,008
Attention all students and personnel.

81
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,200
This is an emergency announcement.

82
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,526
Do not go near the clubhouse area.

83
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,635
A suspicious person has been sighted there.

84
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,243
Out of my way.

85
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:17,143
I have no desire to kill a woman if I don't need to.

86
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,621
We at least share that.

87
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,517
I, too, would like to avoid any unnecessary killing.

88
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:22,250
Oh?

89
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:23,590
En garde!

90
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:29,327
Cyborg?!

91
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:31,352
And I have Zero to thank.

92
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,757
They say they're going to kill God.

93
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:34,849
God?

94
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:37,807
I thought they were speaking metaphorically, but now...

95
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,591
At the very least these people
believe what they're saying!

96
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:43,949
Ridiculous. To believe in God. There's no such being!

97
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:45,205
That's right.

98
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:50,519
No winged goddesses or long-bearded old men
in white gowns with kingdoms in the clouds.

99
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:53,203
No. Not that sort of God. Uh!

100
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:53,908
Uh!

101
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:54,737
Hmph.

102
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,320
Princess Cornelia!

103
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:01,778
Who knows what type of Geass he controls!

104
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:04,621
You must never let your guard down, even for a child.

105
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:06,456
Yes, that's correct.

106
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:10,385
Cornelia, you do live up to your reputation, don't you?

107
00:07:11,216 --> 00:07:13,806
As your uncle, I'm very proud of you.

108
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:15,693
My what?!

109
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,696
We made a solemn vow.

110
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,911
If there was ever a god that made men fight each other...

111
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:23,343
...we'd kill him and his divine rule.

112
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:25,101
Even if you are a cyborg,

113
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:27,987
your exposed Hmphan parts make you vulnerable!

114
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:29,695
You have good aim!

115
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,632
I'll stop you! For Master Lelouch's sake!

116
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:33,722
Uh?!

117
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:40,154
Your skill in martial arts is impressive.

118
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,342
But, it won't impede Jeremiah Gottwald.

119
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:44,791
Sayoko!

120
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:45,774
Uh!

121
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,902
Dammit.

122
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:48,995
Steal time!

123
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,274
Okay! Now get him while I'm holding him still! Go on!

124
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:54,794
With great pleasure!

125
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:04,529
But that's not possible! My Geass...

126
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:06,820
It should stop time with absolutely anyone!

127
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:08,628
Rolo Lamperouge!

128
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:11,845
Just as I thought! You've been fooled!

129
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,811
But how could you break my Geass?

130
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:16,307
How? Because I was chosen, that's how!

131
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:18,270
Picked by the Order to be an assassin!

132
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:20,304
Then you've come to kill Lelouch, is that it?!

133
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:21,479
Lord Jeremiah!

134
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:22,489
Huh?

135
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:26,420
Villetta! You mean Lelouch has snared you, too?!

136
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:29,522
Lelouch is at the Ikebukuro station right now!

137
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,567
Lord Jeremiah, I'm begging you!

138
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:34,415
What ever you do, please let me go!

139
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:38,226
All right, then.

140
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:48,453
What do I do? I called Suzaku out here,

141
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:51,906
but what should I say to him? Especially with Lulu here.

142
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:54,480
Shirley, what kind of game are you playing?

143
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:56,969
Or was it Suzaku who called her out here?

144
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:00,674
Rivalz told me that Lelouch has
been here in Japan the entire time.

145
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:03,588
Intelligence from the O.S.I. backs that up, also.

146
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:06,530
But... Why don't I believe it?

147
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:13,606
Villetta. What are you doing?

148
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:15,648
Are you betraying Lelouch, or... are you...

149
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:17,881
We should contact Lelouch right away.

150
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:19,910
I will stay here and protect the place.

151
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,935
The rest of you go on to Ikebukuro.

152
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,310
If Lelouch is ready for him,

153
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:26,290
we may be able to pin Jeremiah from two sides.

154
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:29,816
I have to tell Suzaku.

155
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:33,487
He needs to know that Lelouch
is Zero and the he killed my father!

156
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:39,799
This is the boundary line, right here.

157
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:43,090
The demarcation between the settlement and the ghettos.

158
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,901
We have to erase it.

159
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:48,577
Hold it. What if these two are accomplices?

160
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:51,349
To turn Area 11 back into Japan?

161
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:54,873
That's it! They've been friends since way back!

162
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,023
Uh?

163
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,048
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

164
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,596
No!

165
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:06,913
Shirley!

166
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:12,776
Stay away from me!

167
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:13,632
Shirley!

168
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:17,011
You're both liars! You two
are nothing but a pair of fakes!

169
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:19,301
I won't... Aaggh...!

170
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:48,693
No! Let me go! Let me go!

171
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:51,206
Stop it! I can't lose you!

172
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:54,894
I don't want to lose you or anyone else in my life!

173
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:56,796
Not one more person!

174
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:58,408
Please...

175
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,976
Shirley!

176
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:02,760
Uh-huh.

177
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:08,223
Uh! Suzaku!

178
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:20,717
Hey... You've done this once before, haven't you?

179
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:21,731
Huh?

180
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:24,983
You know, that time back at school
when you tried to catch Arthur.

181
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,341
Yeah, you're right.

182
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:27,325
Uh?

183
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:32,179
I guess you're right Shirley. We have done this before.

184
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:35,144
And Suzaku is always the one who pulls you back up.

185
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,711
If Lelouch had been the one on top,

186
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:37,903
both of us would have fallen.

187
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:39,364
You exercise nut!

188
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:42,222
If you're gonna brag,
you should've saved us before we fell.

189
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:44,166
That's ridiculous.

190
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,342
Why am I laughing?

191
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:48,623
After what Lelouch did to Euphy!

192
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:56,369
I'm wrong. He's acting on his own. Lulu is...

193
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,716
Oh.

194
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,901
'Scuse me. Uh?!

195
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:04,544
Lelouch, be careful!

196
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,801
Jeremiah's heading toward you right now!

197
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:08,672
He's an assassin sent by the Order.

198
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:10,313
My Geass didn't work on him!

199
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:12,258
Wait, Jeremiah is alive?!

200
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:14,468
And what do you mean an assassin, Rolo?

201
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:15,610
I'm not sure.

202
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,558
Anyway, don't do anything rash until we get there.

203
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,009
What's up? Is something wrong?

204
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,448
This is bad. With Suzaku here...

205
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:26,594
By your expression, I'm guessing
that wasn't a friendly phone call.

206
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:27,874
Ah, ow!

207
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,732
Suzaku, stop that!

208
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,847
My problem comes first, doesn't it?

209
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:32,466
Right.

210
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:35,469
Oh, yeah, that's right, you two were
waiting for each other here, weren't you?

211
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:37,154
What's the matter, are you jealous?

212
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:38,249
Hmph.

213
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,037
Thanks so much, Lulu.

214
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:41,955
Can't we wait for just a while? We should...

215
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,132
Come on. Let's go, Suzaku.

216
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:46,019
Wait! Hold on!

217
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:48,524
This area is about to become a battlefield.

218
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:51,207
And I can think of no safer place for Shirley,

219
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,638
than to be with Suzaku.

220
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:05,390
Jeremiah Gottwald?

221
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:06,863
Yes, I am.

222
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,831
What? The guy's bulletproof!

223
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:15,020
I understand. Lelouch has used his Geass on you.

224
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:16,592
Huh?

225
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:17,502
Huh?!

226
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:30,152
Not only does Geass have no effect on him,

227
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,528
he has the power to cancel it, as well.

228
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:34,790
Fire?!

229
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,242
Terrorists?!

230
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:43,407
Hmph.

231
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:45,973
Right! Come up and get me, Orange!

232
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:49,507
So, what's this important thing
you need to talk to me about?

233
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,830
Uh, well I'm...

234
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:54,254
Well, I'm in love with Lulu.

235
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:57,661
But you hate him, don't you?

236
00:13:58,383 --> 00:13:59,515
I liked him...

237
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,711
...at one time.

238
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,216
And now?

239
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:07,767
I thought something was wrong.

240
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,315
The two of you used to be so close together.

241
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,323
What happened, did you have a fight?

242
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:15,498
I can't forgive him.

243
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,600
Nothing is unforgivable, you know.

244
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:21,433
In other words, it only means that
you're not willing to forgive him.

245
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,344
You don't want to forgive him.

246
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:26,698
I forgave him. I chose to a long time ago.

247
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:30,048
Shirley... What are you...

248
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:35,079
Did you call the fire department?

249
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:38,234
In situations like this, doesn't the Army respond first?

250
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:40,915
Sir Suzaku Kururugi! I'm the Knight of Seven.

251
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,611
Uh! M-My lord!

252
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:45,311
This might be an act of terrorism, so from here on,

253
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:48,594
I'm taking command of all the
perimeter police and fire fighting units.

254
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:49,869
Right, understood, my lord!

255
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:53,127
And I want you to protect that
young woman right over there.

256
00:14:56,975 --> 00:14:58,725
What is it? We're in the middle of a meeting.

257
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,484
Like I care? Ain't no meeting I was invited to!

258
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:04,954
Emergency call from Zero.

259
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:06,438
Somethin' weird's going on there.

260
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:07,248
Uh?

261
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,261
Zero! It's Ohgi.

262
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,050
What's happened? What's the emergency?

263
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,925
If it's about the guys from Taiwan, right now we're...

264
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,719
Ohgi!

265
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:19,956
Mm! That voice! It's...

266
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,479
Lelouch, just hang in there!

267
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:30,729
All units in position. Support teams en route.

268
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:32,616
Lulu...

269
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:35,023
Please get into the vehicle, Miss.

270
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:37,100
It's the Knight of Seven's orders.

271
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:42,271
Wha...?! Miss, come back here!

272
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,729
Hold on, Lulu!

273
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:46,244
Don't worry, I won't leave you alone!

274
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:51,890
You won't escape me!

275
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:57,996
Lulu, where can you be? Uh!

276
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,433
He must be fighting.

277
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:06,277
Lulu's fighting...

278
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,167
...on his own.

279
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,019
A mechanical body...

280
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,348
And you've got a Geass canceller.

281
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:22,694
Your vengefulness is truly top-notch, Orange boy!

282
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:25,844
There's no vengefulness. It's sheer loyalty.

283
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,394
How I hate to hear that.

284
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,038
What could the emperor have
possibly done to deserve such loyalty?

285
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:37,563
Wha...?!

286
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,550
From your performance,

287
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:41,961
I figured that you must be using sakuradite.

288
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:44,354
A Gefijun Disturber...!

289
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:47,525
Well, well, I see you've done your homework.

290
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,731
You're aware, that when this
sakuradite disruption system is complete,

291
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:54,215
we can paralyze all urban functions
with the railway's circular route.

292
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,292
In other words, bring Tokyo to a standstill.

293
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,365
I'm grateful. You've been an exemplary test subject.

294
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:07,916
Rolo!

295
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,763
Shirley, you're here?!

296
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:12,746
Answer me, Rolo.

297
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:13,621
Um.

298
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,641
Do you truly... love Lulu?

299
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:20,132
Now then, are you going to tell me what I want to know?

300
00:17:20,157 --> 00:17:22,552
Where is the Order located? And where is V.V.?

301
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:25,406
You're the one... who will talk here!

302
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:26,450
What?!

303
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:29,371
Because I have... my reasons...

304
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:32,198
I'm resolved to see my loyalty through!

305
00:17:32,223 --> 00:17:35,684
I must know the truth for certain... once and for all!

306
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:37,811
But how...?! He shouldn't be able to move!

307
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:41,502
Why, Lelouch? Why did you adopt the role of Zero?

308
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,746
Why did you turn against your homeland?

309
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,937
Becoming an enemy of the emperor as a result?!

310
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,725
I did it because I am Lelouch vi Britannia!

311
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:57,859
My father, the Britannian emperor,
allowed my mother to be killed!

312
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:00,584
In so doing, he stole Nunnally's sight...

313
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:03,431
her legs... and our futures from us!

314
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:11,781
I know. I remember, because I was there, too.

315
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:13,204
Uh?! You were?!

316
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:18,096
My first assignment. To guard her. Lady Marianne,

317
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,223
whom I loved and respected.

318
00:18:20,248 --> 00:18:23,123
But I failed to carry through with that loyalty.

319
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:25,716
I just wasn't able to protect her!

320
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,407
So you founded the Purebloods, then?

321
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:28,919
Master Lelouch.

322
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:31,138
Everything is becoming clear now.

323
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:34,898
You became Zero for the sake
of Lady Marianne, didn't you?

324
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:38,294
But if you didn't come here to
kill me, then what are you trying to do?

325
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,986
I don't serve V.V...

326
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:41,892
I follow only one.

327
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:44,006
It's Lady Marianne...

328
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:48,969
Now... I'll die without regret.

329
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,538
Lord Jeremiah!

330
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:57,316
Ugh! My prince...!

331
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:59,450
Jeremiah Gottwald, listen.

332
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:04,136
Your steadfast loyalty is still
desperately needed here. Isn't that right?

333
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,211
Indeed. Yes, Your Majesty.

334
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:11,406
Rolo, I love Lulu. But what about you?

335
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,658
What a question.

336
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,956
He's my only brother, so of course I love him.

337
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,852
Then you're on Lulu's side, right? Right?!

338
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:18,429
Uh?

339
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:20,361
Please. Let me join you!

340
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:23,658
I want Lulu to be safe, too! I can help you protect him!

341
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:26,875
I want to bring all the happiness back into Lulu's life!

342
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:30,046
Then maybe he can be together with his sister Nunna!

343
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,615
Right. I've sent Jeremiah on ahead.

344
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,890
He'll take care of any obstacles in the way.

345
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:41,283
Don't try to fight him! He just came over to our side!

346
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,550
Uh?

347
00:19:58,717 --> 00:19:59,971
Shirley!

348
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,134
Shirley, who did this to you?!

349
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,008
Lulu...?

350
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,021
I'm glad... we can talk at the very end...

351
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:14,400
Don't say that! It's not the end!

352
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:16,227
I'll call a doctor, so just...

353
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:19,017
Ever since my memories have come back,

354
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:21,352
I've been feeling so very afraid...

355
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:23,666
A teacher who wasn't a teacher.

356
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,666
Friends who don't... have memories to share.

357
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,996
Everyone... was just... lying...

358
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:34,248
It felt as though... the whole world was spying on me.

359
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:38,834
That's the world... you've been
fighting all by yourself, isn't it?

360
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:40,273
All alone...

361
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:42,377
So that's why I...

362
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:46,569
why I wanted to be someone
who would at least be truthful to you.

363
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:47,658
Shirley...

364
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:50,317
Lulu... I love you.

365
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:53,709
Even knowing how you caught my father in all this...

366
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,175
I simply couldn't hate you.

367
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:59,090
Even though you made me forget everything...

368
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,134
I still fell in love with you...

369
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,034
Even though my memories were tampered with...

370
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:06,142
I kept falling in love...

371
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,077
with you all over again...

372
00:21:08,207 --> 00:21:10,852
No, Shirley! You can't die...!

373
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,427
No matter how many times I'm reborn...

374
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:24,067
I'll keep falling in love... with you, Lulu...

375
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,658
I suppose... that it's simply fate...

376
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:31,151
No, don't die! I order you not to die...!

377
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:34,494
So, is that okay then... Lulu...?

378
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:36,723
And as I'm reborn...

379
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:40,229
I'll fall in love with you over and over...

380
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:42,359
I'll keep...

381
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,775
...falling...

382
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:46,692
...in love... with...

383
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:52,173
Shirley! Shirley...!

384
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:41,862
C.C. once told me something.

385
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,668
She said that Geass was the power of the king.

386
00:23:44,752 --> 00:23:46,639
And a life of solitude.

387
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:48,852
Then this must be what she meant.

388
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,018
Shirley... I wanted...

389
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:55,052
I had to apologize for involving you with Geass.

390
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:57,205
For making you the sacrifice.

391
00:23:57,443 --> 00:23:58,955
How can I make up for that?

392
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:02,989
Tell me, please. Tell me...
