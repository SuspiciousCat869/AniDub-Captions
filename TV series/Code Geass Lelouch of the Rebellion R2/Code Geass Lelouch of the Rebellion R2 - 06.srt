1
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:06,235
Is that you, Lelouch?

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,051
It's me, Nunnally.

3
00:00:09,746 --> 00:00:11,587
If your memory hasn't returned,

4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,345
you won't know who she is.

5
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:16,920
Go on, Lelouch, let's hear your answer!

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,355
Suzaku, you've got me trapped.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,362
Um. This is my brother, isn't it?

8
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:27,513
I can't do this! I can't lie to Nunnally!

9
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:30,293
I... I... Uh?

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,957
Rolo?

11
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,058
Good work. Keep him like that.

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,285
You'll have to hurry. Don't forget the time limit.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,693
I know. Nunally, listen to me.

14
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:47,772
Lelouch! It is you!

15
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:51,427
For right now, we have to act like we're strangers.

16
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:54,260
It's necessary! Just follow my lead!

17
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:58,191
I'm going to come for you. I swear it!

18
00:00:58,216 --> 00:00:59,606
And so, until then...

19
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:02,783
Until then, I love you, Nunnally!

20
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:08,656
Uh, you're confusing me with someone else.

21
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:11,468
That's right, I'm just a student at the school here.

22
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:15,487
Lelouch, your memory really hasn't come back?

23
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:17,510
Yes. I beg your pardon.

24
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,491
Forgive me.

25
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:21,160
When I heard you was a good friend of Suzaku's,

26
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:23,519
I guess I just jumped to conclusions.

27
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:25,127
It's just I...

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,772
No, please, it's an honor for me
to speak with a royal princess.

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,770
Um, could you please put Suzaku back on?

30
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:34,923
Yes, Your Highness.

31
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,235
Forgive me, Nunnally.

32
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,322
I didn't mean to cause a misunderstanding.

33
00:01:40,564 --> 00:01:42,512
No, it's all right.

34
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:45,470
He just seemed so similar that it surprised me.

35
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:49,345
Well, um, I'll see you when I get to Area 11.

36
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,018
Don't underestimate the threat.

37
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:54,047
He may be at a disadvantage,
but, we're still dealing with Zero!

38
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,863
You can be sure he has some plan underway.

39
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:57,263
Such a cowardly response.

40
00:01:57,288 --> 00:02:00,556
And they call you the "Spearhead of the Empire". Hmph.

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,466
Fortunately, Viceroy Nunnally has me to protect her.

42
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,268
Your services won't be needed.

43
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:06,376
But, general, Zero is...

44
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:07,743
Dead, Lord Guilford!

45
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,358
Zero was killed last year!

46
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:12,133
The Zero we face now is just using his name!

47
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,645
Princess Cornelia would regret seeing
your contemptible fear for this cheap imposter?

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,479
Speaking of regret.

49
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:21,485
Earl Asplund.

50
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:22,887
Sorry we're late.

51
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:26,283
Adjusting Lancelot took longer than we thought it would!

52
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:28,454
It's been quite a while, Earl Asplund.

53
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:31,558
That's because I'm working
directly under little Charlie now!

54
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,668
Are you referring to His Majesty!

55
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:36,360
Please forgive him, sir!

56
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,493
Lloyd, please!

57
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,897
Hm? Did I say something wrong?

58
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:41,297
I see that you haven't changed.

59
00:02:41,322 --> 00:02:43,229
As for the item we discussed...

60
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:45,993
Yes, It comes to us via Prince Schneizel.

61
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:48,800
It's rather nice, having a second prince to call on.

62
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:50,258
You have my thanks.

63
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:52,043
Unbelievable!

64
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:55,968
This prodigal aristocrat is
serving as Lord Kururugi's guardian!

65
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:59,743
He'd better not interfere with
efforts to educate the new viceroy.

66
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,865
Did Suzaku lie to me?

67
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,677
But, my own brother... I don't understand.

68
00:03:07,702 --> 00:03:10,077
Has something happened between them?

69
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:49,465
The new viceroy is set to arrive at
Area 11 tomorrow to take up her post.

70
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,531
The name and background of the new viceroy
still has not been released to the public.

71
00:04:53,556 --> 00:04:56,598
The big question's the
Chinese Federation consulate, right?

72
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:57,911
You mean regarding Zero?

73
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:59,958
As there has been no formal announcement,

74
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:03,317
some think Chief Consul Gao-Hai may be acting on his own.

75
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:07,079
The consul general's standing will
depend upon the balance of power...

76
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:10,481
W-What about the stand-off in Area 11?

77
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:13,029
Oh, I'm afraid I don't know the details.

78
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:15,906
Can you tell me anything about the outside world?

79
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,496
I've never gone beyond the walls of this palace.

80
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:23,973
That's because this Forbidden City in the
Luoyang Capital is the very center of the world, Empress.

81
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:24,911
But...

82
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,892
I'm going to go outside and see what's happening.

83
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:28,819
Huh?

84
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:32,186
The truth is, I came today to say goodbye to you.

85
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:34,065
Oh, no!

86
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,065
Not now, when I've finally made a real friend.

87
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:39,029
I'm very sorry,

88
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,689
but you know my husband is waiting for me.

89
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:47,871
The supplies were successfully received in Niigata.

90
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:49,002
I see.

91
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:53,077
However, there's no way to
get them into the consulate now.

92
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,519
As expected.

93
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:58,263
Nunnally is going to be the new viceroy.

94
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:00,520
Will you be able to fight her? Your sister?

95
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:04,015
Fight? Nunnally?

96
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,781
Is that some kind of joke?

97
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,392
Then you're just going to leave her alone?

98
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:08,888
Out of the question.

99
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,711
If nothing's done, Nunnally will be used
as a political tool, just like she was before!

100
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:16,181
A girl who can't walk and can't see...

101
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:19,486
Do they plan to use her as a pawn, then throw her away?

102
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:21,983
I'm doing all this to keep that from happening!

103
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,873
That's why I formed the Black Knights!

104
00:06:23,898 --> 00:06:25,806
I became Zero for Nunnally's sake!

105
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:29,223
I'm well aware that your
sister's your entire reason for living.

106
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:30,067
However...

107
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:33,752
I am going to create a world
where Nunnally can live happily!

108
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:36,875
To do that, I will obliterate Britannia!

109
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,862
You mentioned, V.V.

110
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:40,702
Is he in the Britannian homeland?

111
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:42,677
I don't know that much about him.

112
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:45,773
However, I know that he's your father's first ally:

113
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,789
Emperor Charles of Britannia's chief confederate.

114
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:50,064
Confederate?

115
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:52,964
Long ago, they made a pact.

116
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:54,771
I shall slay the god!

117
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:57,379
Yes, that is our binding contract.

118
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,472
Tell me, Charles, why didn't you tell Nunnally

119
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:06,287
about Zero's true identity. And about Geass.

120
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:09,441
It wasn't necessary for her to know.

121
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:13,506
You know, Charles, you really are still a child.

122
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:16,649
Perhaps I am, big brother.

123
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,610
Where's Viceroy Nunnally?

124
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,849
She's in the garden.

125
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:27,374
Even if she came to the bridge...

126
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:28,989
I guess there'd be no point

127
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,223
The Black Knights?!

128
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:31,293
They're not here?!

129
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,974
Right. We only just confirmed it ourselves.

130
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:36,135
I'll give you all the information I have.

131
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:42,087
That way, it should be crystal clear that
my country has no hostile intentions toward Britannia.

132
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:43,529
Did Zero go with them?!

133
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:44,735
It appears so.

134
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,999
They took their knightmares with them and they vanished.

135
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:49,679
We're guessing they left through an underground level.

136
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:51,158
To where?

137
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:53,141
No idea. That's all I have.

138
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,891
They wouldn't attack Nunnally?

139
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,208
We've been had.

140
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:58,874
Should we... strike back.

141
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,810
The Black Knights!

142
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:07,099
The objective of this operation
is the capture of the new viceroy!

143
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:08,235
No matter what happens,

144
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,666
she absolutely must not be harmed!

145
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:12,923
Keep her safe, is that clear!

146
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:14,081
Roger!

147
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:19,783
Tamaki, what are you doing?!

148
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:22,520
Amateurs!

149
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,947
Bringing land-based units for an aerial mission... Ah!

150
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:29,839
Surface flares will have no effect on our defense.

151
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:31,668
Surround and attack now!

152
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:34,908
All right, General Tohdoh, the rest is up to you.

153
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,414
Right. Good luck, Deputy-Commander.

154
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:42,745
Impossible!

155
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:44,816
They're landing on top of us?!

156
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:50,683
Two more enemy Knightmares have landed on our main wing!

157
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,208
They're on our escorts as well!

158
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,901
Send our aerial forces to...

159
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:57,156
You took the bait, commander.

160
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:00,078
I figured you'd concentrate your air power on the smoke.

161
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:01,914
The obvious response.

162
00:09:04,364 --> 00:09:06,489
Now we can focus on the flagship.

163
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,235
All right! We're withdrawing!

164
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:13,231
Deploy the remaining air ships.

165
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:15,339
Have the escort ships fire as well!

166
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:17,649
But sir, the enemy is targeting our float units.

167
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,714
We can't shoot back because our shields are up!

168
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,966
Then how can we defend this ship?!

169
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:26,147
If I'd known this was possible,
I'd have brought Lord Guilford along!

170
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:30,031
It'll take an hour for reinforcements
to reach us from the Tokyo settlement!

171
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:31,933
What if a Knightmare makes it inside?

172
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:32,999
Then we crash.

173
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:35,129
Our job now is to help the survivors...

174
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,589
What... is that?

175
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:43,118
Die!

176
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:50,570
Ya.

177
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:52,108
Understood.

178
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:59,631
Nunnally, I'm coming to save you.

179
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,443
Now, Samurai Leap over Floating Boats attack!

180
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:12,831
You can put your shields up,

181
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:15,258
but once we get inside, your finished.

182
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,789
Looks like they're running out of air strength too.

183
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:19,572
You'll end up a skinned rabbit.

184
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:20,764
Don't get cocky.

185
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,856
Right, right. I'll stick to basics, but, huh?

186
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,399
Reinforcements from Tokyo? So soon?

187
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:30,935
No, it looks like their rear guard.

188
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:33,112
And, they have float units.

189
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:34,453
Knightmares!

190
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,785
It can't be! That machine is...

191
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:40,203
Now, Let's bring down the curtain.

192
00:10:40,228 --> 00:10:42,131
Output on all units is normal.

193
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:44,073
Isn't mass production nice?

194
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:45,972
Well, I'm not so sure about this.

195
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:48,039
Did Prince Scneizel really approved the budget?

196
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,731
If he didn't, he'll notice it pretty soon.

197
00:10:50,756 --> 00:10:51,589
What?!

198
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:53,614
You didn't tell him what you were doing?

199
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:55,951
I don't need to fly for this.

200
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:00,706
You have the right instincts, but the wrong Knightmare.

201
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:05,074
Sorry! I'm out.

202
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,585
Damn Guilford, acting without orders!

203
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,985
But he saved us, my lord.

204
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,710
Yes, and he'll take all of the credit for it!

205
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,145
All tasks at hand have been cleared.

206
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:16,791
And now, the tide of battle shall turn!

207
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:20,826
Nunnally...

208
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,922
Look! Zero's inside!

209
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:31,502
What are those guards doing?

210
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:33,304
Viceroy Nunnally, it's Zero!

211
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:35,506
I'm informing General Upson now.

212
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:40,305
Their reunion is starting. It must not be disturbed.

213
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:43,977
Nunnally...

214
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,779
We're together again. At last.

215
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:53,148
You're, Zero, aren't you? The terrorist.

216
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:55,298
Have you come to kill me as well?

217
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,158
Like you killed my brother Clovis and my sister Euphie?

218
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:03,771
Even so, will you wait just a moment, please?

219
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:07,527
I think that what you're doing is wrong!

220
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:11,163
It's a Harken!

221
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,563
Hit him now, Kouzuki!

222
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:13,671
Right!

223
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,215
Okay, it's discipline time!

224
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,254
What a weird-looking fighter plane.

225
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,758
Even so...!

226
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,161
A Knightmare?!

227
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:36,642
I'm finished. Sorry.

228
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:39,048
That just leaves four enemy units.

229
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:41,169
The Knights of the Round as well!

230
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,446
I'll never bear this disgrace.

231
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,188
Now what?!

232
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,288
Starboard escort ship has lost control!

233
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:48,026
What?!

234
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:49,261
It's on a collision course!

235
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:50,245
Turn the ship!

236
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,354
We'll never make it!

237
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,036
We're going to crash!

238
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:06,027
The Mordred always handles things in its own unique way.

239
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,083
Anya, don't do that again, okay?

240
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:10,844
We don't want to kill the viceroy now, do we?

241
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:12,680
But I saved her.

242
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:16,119
Lloyd, how's the Lancelot?

243
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:19,442
Ready and waiting for you! Come and get it!

244
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:23,327
General! What are you doing in that gun turret?

245
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,610
At this rate, I'm going to be demoted!

246
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:27,760
I have to do something to prove myself!

247
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:29,477
I'll kill the Black Knights!

248
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:36,311
You fool! You shot your own engines!

249
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:44,581
Right now, Zero is standing in front of me.

250
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:47,848
Lelouch, give me the courage I need.

251
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:51,238
It's Britannia that is wrong.

252
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,469
The emperor believes that might is always right.

253
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:56,700
Do you approve of that?

254
00:13:57,623 --> 00:13:58,717
Well...

255
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:02,631
Viceroy Nunnally, you're just being used.

256
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:07,623
You're saying they sent a blind,
crippled girl to win everyone's sympathy?

257
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,931
Then, you're wrong.

258
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:09,569
Hm?

259
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:13,031
I asked them to send me. That's why I'm here.

260
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:16,811
Where's Zero?

261
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:19,931
We can't contact him because of the ECCM effects.

262
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:23,140
I want to rendezvous with Chiba
and Kouzuki and scout inside the ship.

263
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:25,046
But the ship's going to crash.

264
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:27,000
Do you think you have time for that?

265
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:27,875
It's very...

266
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,977
Senba!

267
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:33,364
I don't like picking on those
who are weaker than me, but...

268
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:36,210
Never thought a place like this...

269
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:37,956
Senba!

270
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:40,369
Using land units for an aerial attack?

271
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:42,788
That's not your kind of tactic, Toudo.

272
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:45,633
You requested it?

273
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:48,019
I think with a peaceful approach,

274
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:50,378
I can make the world a gentler place.

275
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:52,820
That's why I want to carry out Euphie's plan

276
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:56,225
to create the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan.

277
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,683
You'd have that return?!

278
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:02,485
Zero, won't you please try to help me to rebuild it?

279
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:08,006
People can start over! Please!

280
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,517
Zero's coming to steal Nunnally away,

281
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:15,402
but there's been no word
from the Office of Secret Intelligence.

282
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,761
So, am I fighting Zero or Lelouch?

283
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,515
Sir Kururugi, I'm confirming the data now.

284
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,292
The number 2 float unit on
Viceroy Nunnally's Flagship has shut down.

285
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:26,567
The number 3 and 4 float units are interlinked,

286
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,467
so a case theta has occured.

287
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:36,383
To sum that up, we'll all be swimming in the ocean soon.

288
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,983
Uh. Except for general Upson,

289
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:41,338
who's regrettably didn't make it.

290
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:44,425
Right now, rescuing the viceroy has top priority!

291
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:49,633
Initiating search for her wheelchair beacon.

292
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,139
Starting E.C.M. signal noise cleanup.

293
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:55,650
Phase, preset. Sending the layout of the ship's interior.

294
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:57,031
Confirming Data link.

295
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:57,996
Complete.

296
00:15:58,063 --> 00:16:00,956
Transmit the viceroy's location as soon as it's known.

297
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:02,835
Channel M.B., roger!

298
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,308
Lancelot Conquista...

299
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,291
Now launch!

300
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:07,441
Launching!

301
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:23,186
Kallen, I have to save Nunnally. Nothing else matters now.

302
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:28,099
I won't ask for your forgiveness... any more.

303
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:30,856
Kouzuki, hide! Get inside of the ship!

304
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,492
I can't. Not until everyone's gotten away!

305
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,248
What the hell!

306
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,206
Kouzuki!

307
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:46,048
Pull the eject lever, Kouzuki!

308
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:48,448
No use! It isn't working!

309
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:51,129
Defective equipment at a time like this!

310
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:54,894
Tag, you're dead.

311
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:06,672
I'm falling!

312
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:08,708
Forgive me, Guren...

313
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:12,663
Mother, Naoto...

314
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:16,502
What a perfect position!

315
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:18,235
Wha...? Rakshata?

316
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,502
Sorry to keep you waiting.

317
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:22,277
I have the new Black Knight glide wing pack for you.

318
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:24,129
You did review the manual I sent?

319
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:26,138
Uh, sure. I'm good to go!

320
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:28,288
All right, let's try it out then.

321
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,869
We'll give you the basic guidance from here.

322
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,123
Please rescue Master Zero.

323
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:34,372
Uh, right!

324
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:36,490
Opening number 3 launch chamber.

325
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:39,581
Connection signal with Guren Mk-II, confirmed.

326
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:43,164
Take to the skies, my soaring glide wings!

327
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,468
Rotate!

328
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,781
Guidance signal, confirmed.

329
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,240
Contact angle, aligned.

330
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:54,307
Link up.

331
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:55,686
Linking up!

332
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,573
Fly!

333
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:07,606
Armor piercing artillery, right arm unit!

334
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:10,156
Right arm unit decelerating for linkup.

335
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:14,188
Transmission neuron 0.5 to 0.8 M.M.P.

336
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:15,802
No obstacles detected.

337
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:18,783
Elastic muscles 1 through 5 are operating normally.

338
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:22,141
Activation of shock control, confirmed. Linking up.

339
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,315
Kallen, please.

340
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,540
No matter how many enemies are coming...!

341
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:39,483
Our unit will go after Tohdoh!

342
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:41,781
Right, and we'll protect the viceroy.

343
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:43,614
Huh? In the sky?

344
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:45,931
The Black Knights have a float system, too?

345
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:47,715
Kouzuki! Save Zero!

346
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,115
I'm on it, sir!

347
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:53,819
Oh? You've gained wings and a shield, huh? So what!

348
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:56,840
If this Guren doesn't work perfectly, then I'm finished.

349
00:18:56,865 --> 00:19:00,106
Well, we don't have much choice, try shooting it.

350
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,840
You've got a point, there!

351
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:09,527
From long range?!

352
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:15,915
I can do it! With this Guren Flight-Enabled Version!

353
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,050
Nice one.

354
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:18,708
Suzaku, get to the viceroy!

355
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,146
Don't let your guard down!

356
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:22,696
That's the pilot who defeated Lord Jeremiah!

357
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:24,708
The one who beat Orange boy?

358
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,413
Come on!

359
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:31,077
Well, look at that.

360
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:32,769
As good as the Knights of the Round?

361
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:35,013
We'll see, right now.

362
00:19:37,414 --> 00:19:39,997
Don't underestimate the Guren!

363
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:43,088
Dirty shoes.

364
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:47,790
I'll take care of you guys later.

365
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:53,176
Gad!

366
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:54,904
It can fire wide-range, too?!

367
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,265
What's its total energy?!

368
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,838
The same amount, but scattered.

369
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,847
With the internal damage it caused,
those units won't be able to function for a while.

370
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,698
So, what's with that knightmare?

371
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:07,089
Uh-uhh. It's all the pilot.

372
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:09,465
I shouldn't have held back on my attack.

373
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:12,873
Kallen, Why would you come back under these conditions?

374
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,425
Is it that Zero's on the ship already?!

375
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,338
MOVE IT!

376
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,050
Have a taste of the Gefjun Net!

377
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:27,708
We have a countermeasure for this!

378
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:30,473
You're still stuck where you are!

379
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:34,229
No way!

380
00:20:34,254 --> 00:20:37,495
It can't be more powerful
than and advanced Yggdrasil Drive!

381
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,615
Suzaku!

382
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:40,173
We've located the viceroy!

383
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,596
She's in the garden space to the rear of the main bridge!

384
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:45,693
But hurry! Now there's only
47 seconds till the ship crashes!

385
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:47,450
I promise, I'll save her!

386
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,472
Damn!

387
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:54,436
Kallen! Forget about Suzaku!

388
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,419
Save Master Zero!

389
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:57,402
I understand, but where?!

390
00:20:57,438 --> 00:20:59,741
Tsk! There's no time left.

391
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:02,016
I'll have to use the Core Luminous Cone.

392
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,457
Go!

393
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:12,573
What do I do?

394
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,131
I can't reveal Zero's identity to her,

395
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,380
but I can't take her by force either.

396
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:19,831
I can see now that would traumatize her!

397
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,954
Suzaku!

398
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,675
Escape with me!

399
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,158
Nunnally!

400
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:31,273
Suzaku!

401
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:35,469
No! Not after he sold me out to the emperor!

402
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,319
Suzaku! Down here!

403
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,738
Were you frightened?

404
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:42,971
Forgive me! It's all right now!

405
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,808
Nunnally with Suzaku!

406
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:52,377
Zero! Not this time!

407
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:01,750
Nunnally!

408
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:40,996
Eight years ago, because our mother was murdered,

409
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:43,238
because we were abandoned by Britannia,

410
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:45,763
protecting Nunnally became everything to me.

411
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:49,729
Cleaning the house, making our dinner everything.

412
00:23:49,981 --> 00:23:53,064
But now! I'm a fool!

413
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,063
Nunnally has dreams of her own.

414
00:23:55,098 --> 00:23:57,473
She has chosen a path for herself.

415
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,680
It's so obvious. So simple.

416
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:04,305
What should I do?
