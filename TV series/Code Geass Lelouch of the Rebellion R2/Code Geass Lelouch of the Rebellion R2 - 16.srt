1
00:00:01,993 --> 00:00:03,909
The world continues moving on,

2
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:06,952
thanks to miracles which Zero has performed.

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:08,843
The world is being reborn,

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:12,093
thanks to actions which Zero has taken.

5
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:16,518
Yes. The world is moving to the next stage, as it should.

6
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:19,966
Against conflicting emotions, Zero must carry on.

7
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:24,062
For the hands which mark time cannot be stopped.

8
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:03,827
The Emperor's gone?

9
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:04,810
He's disappeared?

10
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:05,846
He has.

11
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:09,352
I've just received word from
Prime Minister Schneizel about it.

12
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:13,718
It's important that we restrict
this information to only those present here.

13
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:19,002
He also said that this situation is only
known to a handful of people in the homeland.

14
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:21,152
What on earth happened to him?

15
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:24,034
There is no news on the investigation.

16
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,420
Hold on a minute.

17
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,826
Won't this affect our plans to
attack the Chinese Federation?

18
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:32,951
If His Majesty isn't present to issue
a declaration of war, then we can't do anything!

19
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:34,851
And there's domestic security.

20
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:37,167
If the Numbers were to learn of this situation,

21
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:39,969
you had better have new policies in place.

22
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:40,857
Well I'd...

23
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:43,055
People expect action from authority figures!

24
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,446
Uh, Miss Lohmeyer?

25
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:46,762
Do you think you'd like to handle it alone?

26
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:49,309
Sorry. I meant no disrespect.

27
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,115
Is this for the best?

28
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,530
With the Emperor gone,

29
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:55,432
Nunnally should be safe for now, but...

30
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,044
I've done it!

31
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,553
The actions which Britannia
has taken prove the Emperor is absent.

32
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:04,638
It's seems he is truly trapped in the other realm.

33
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,771
Though I am concerned about what he said before,

34
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:10,534
I am content simply knowing that Nunnally is safe.

35
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:13,207
Um, what should I be doing now?

36
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,477
Let's see now...

37
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:18,246
Sing me a song while hopping on one foot
and wearing your clothes inside out.

38
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,094
Yes. Right away, master.

39
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,053
Wha...?

40
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,546
No, wait! I was kidding!

41
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:25,471
I'm sorry!

42
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,537
Please don't beat me hard again!

43
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:29,438
Her mind has completely reverted.

44
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:33,269
She's now only the slave girl
before the power of Geass came.

45
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:34,960
Don't you worry.

46
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:37,538
I would never do anything to harm you at all.

47
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,646
It's the truth. I promise you.

48
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:43,521
Master Lelouch.

49
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:45,805
Yes, Jeremiah. What is it?

50
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:49,998
I see. You got her out of there,
inside of the Sutherland's cockpit.

51
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:51,565
Please forgive me.

52
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:54,034
You ordered me to destroy them all,

53
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:57,217
but killing a member of the
Britannian royal family was just...

54
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:58,226
Forget it.

55
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,590
Or rather, I should say, well done.

56
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,865
Tell me, Lelouch, what is it you are
seeking within that accursed power?

57
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,344
What am I seeking?

58
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:09,421
I'm seeking to save a sister that I adore.

59
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:11,255
How dare you!

60
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:13,593
Kinoshita.

61
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:15,105
Captain Asahina!

62
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,305
I see. Bloodstains.

63
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:20,261
I'd sure like to know... What was Zero doing?

64
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:21,053
Well I...

65
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,878
...won't say a thing.

66
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:24,693
Those are Zero's orders.

67
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:26,385
The details are top secret.

68
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:28,669
Even General Tohdoh isn't allowed to know.

69
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:31,455
You toss real confident weight around for a newbie.

70
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,028
Value in this team is gained by confidence.

71
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:37,386
And confidence is earned by
a Black Knight from Zero himself.

72
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,861
That's some trusting value system.

73
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:41,482
I'm so sorry!

74
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:43,215
What the hell's that mean?!

75
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,011
There's no need to apologize!

76
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:46,995
It's either right or wrong!

77
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,765
You think you can flip on the
good guy routine whenever you like?!

78
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,457
Not when I'm this pissed off!

79
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:54,566
Kallen Kouzuki's a soldier, not a sideshow!

80
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,292
Hmph! I'm mostly pissed off because you're not resisting.

81
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:01,180
There. Put me to death.

82
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:05,588
An inmate assaulting a Knight of the Round
should be a good reason enough for anyone.

83
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:06,822
No, I won't.

84
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:08,971
Because I'm the one who did wrong.

85
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:10,288
"No, I won't."

86
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,751
I hate you!

87
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,567
And so,

88
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:18,748
by ratifying this charter, it will give birth to an
alliance that will rival the Holy Britannian Empire.

89
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:20,763
And its name shall be...

90
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:24,107
...The United Federation Of Nations!

91
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:27,932
It's wonderful, Master Zero!

92
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:31,066
There are exiled regimes
throughout the Britannian colonies.

93
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,065
Some have agreed to participate.

94
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,405
With this move, we've finally earned
a just cause to launch a war of liberation!

95
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,871
A just cause to launch war...

96
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:44,046
If the forthcoming operation to
recapture Japan is indeed successful,

97
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:47,882
then other undecided nations
will join us in a chain reaction.

98
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:48,699
Mm-hmm.

99
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:49,880
And it will succeed,

100
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:52,942
but we must form the U.F.N. before Britannia can act!

101
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,401
Time decides our victory or defeat.

102
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:58,466
I ask only that you cooperate on the focus of our plan.

103
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:03,052
I know representatives here must
discuss the needs of their individual countries.

104
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:04,198
But remember...

105
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:07,973
What you decide will change the course of world history!

106
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,621
Hi, everyone! How are you?

107
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:16,983
I'm so sorry!

108
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:20,688
It's an up-and-coming one-woman
festival with Milly Ashford here!

109
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,833
Well you're not exactly alone, you know.

110
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,306
Guess what, audience?

111
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:27,456
We're going to the jungle, right here in the city!

112
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:28,315
We are?

113
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,573
Animal time!

114
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,598
And that means hot topics with Trend Watch!

115
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,439
I brought you some food to eat.

116
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,714
It's only me.

117
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,344
Huh?

118
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:48,746
It's called pizza.

119
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:50,793
I'd think you be hungry by now.

120
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:52,293
I really wanted you to have some,

121
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:54,850
so I asked Sugiyama to help me out.

122
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:04,677
You don't remember, do you?

123
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,860
Go ahead. Try it.

124
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,900
It's all right. You can eat.

125
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:19,326
Okay!

126
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,754
It's good, isn't it?

127
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,977
Oh, yes, yes! It's really, really good!

128
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:29,200
Thought so.

129
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:30,831
I'm glad you like it.

130
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:36,075
Prez, I'm not sure that's the
way to start out a new career.

131
00:07:37,852 --> 00:07:39,650
I see. That's right.

132
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:41,717
You don't even know what this is, do you?

133
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:48,656
Troubled mind?

134
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,179
Nothing but trouble.

135
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,918
Even though I chose it myself.

136
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:54,827
Decisions I made eight years back.

137
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:56,686
Do you still place trust in him?

138
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,902
The you from eight years ago?

139
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:02,419
Are you asking if the choices I made were foolish?

140
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:05,066
Memories that people have are always vague.

141
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:06,664
No point in believing in them.

142
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:08,579
I'd have to disagree with that.

143
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:09,777
But I know it.

144
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,375
In my case...

145
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:14,035
I kept a diary from nine years ago.

146
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,651
I don't remember anything from it at all.

147
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:17,571
Huh?

148
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,550
And there's more I don't trust.

149
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:23,135
The data I stored doesn't match any memories I have.

150
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,448
Could that be it?

151
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:26,152
The Emperor's Geass?

152
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:27,777
But why use it on Anya?

153
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:29,385
Even recent things.

154
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,118
My memories don't match the recordings at all.

155
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:34,539
Like when fighting with the Chinese Federation,

156
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:35,489
they don't...

157
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:42,191
What do people value most, Sir Kururugi the traitor?

158
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:44,048
Their own life, of course.

159
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:47,985
So I see that you've returned
from the Belarusian Front, Sir Bradley.

160
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:50,260
It's the Knight of Ten.

161
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:53,698
I see your skill at courting with
the new ladies is still intact.

162
00:08:53,723 --> 00:08:55,887
Princess Massacre wasn't enough for you?

163
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:59,873
Speak another untrue word of her name
and you will have to face me in a duel, sir.

164
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,681
Oh. It's seems you've forgotten.

165
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:04,747
I'm very well known as the "Genius of Homicide."

166
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:08,973
Perhaps being only a Number without
any true bloodline has dulled your...

167
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:11,831
They sent the Galahad?!

168
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:14,396
Both of you! Cease your squabbling!

169
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:15,966
The Knight of One.

170
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:18,958
But why would they send Bismarck Waldstein here?

171
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:20,774
Anya, a foolish question.

172
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:24,721
Obviously The Black Knights will invade Area 11 first.

173
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:26,058
Luciano.

174
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:29,191
I've brought the Valkyrie Squadron for that here as well.

175
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,776
I have also readied Gareths for this event.

176
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,146
Now is the time for us to join our forces
under the command of Prince Schneizel.

177
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:39,046
So save your solo flaunting for the battlefield!

178
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:41,410
Hah! I understand it well.

179
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:43,260
Whatever you say, my lord.

180
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,937
So Lelouch always acted like that, huh?

181
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,587
My big brother can be so stubborn at times,

182
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:52,654
but actually, he's really very kind.

183
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,527
My brother Naoto was like that as well.

184
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,808
Oh! I'd heard we had captured the Black Knight Ace,

185
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,839
but I didn't expect to find such a lovely young girl.

186
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:04,808
I don't believe I gave you
permission to enter this area, Sir Bradley.

187
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,887
My apologies, Your Highness.

188
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,875
Well... So you're the Vampire of Britannia?

189
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,841
Yes.

190
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:16,023
It's a shame we're not on a battlefield
or I could savor your blood as well.

191
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:16,835
Pity.

192
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,169
So, are you here to finish off the hostage?

193
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:20,098
Not so.

194
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:22,996
Hostages have only one value I care for.

195
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,731
It seems to hold dear its own life.

196
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:27,006
And while alive,

197
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:31,039
one can do anything he has a whim for to its body.

198
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,706
Have you no sense of pride, Dear Sir Bradley?

199
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:37,004
Threatening an unarmed, imprisoned woman.

200
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:40,741
The naïve child. Still getting by on family laurels?

201
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:41,802
Hmm...

202
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:42,714
Tell me.

203
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:47,592
Are you implying that it's easy to become
a Knight Of The Round on family recognition alone?

204
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:48,579
Huh?!

205
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,639
Mount the F.L.E.I.J.A onto the Lancelot?

206
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:54,087
Well the intention was for
Suzaku to pilot the Guren, but...

207
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,666
The Guren?

208
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:56,856
Sorry, he's right.

209
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,773
I got so carried away I forgot.

210
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:02,518
It's just Lloyd and I got so
wrapped up in our little hobby, we...

211
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:03,093
Hobby?

212
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:06,006
Rakshata's mechanisms are quite easy to tinker with.

213
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:08,698
Now it's so souped-up it can't be flown!

214
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:11,432
End result, you're our little devicer again!

215
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:13,123
Excuse me, Professor Lloyd,

216
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:14,689
now that you mention the Lancelot...

217
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:18,925
You wouldn't mix up a strategic
weapon with a tactical one, would you?

218
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,625
I have thought it through.

219
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:23,952
Any matter caught within the primary area of effect field

220
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:27,079
will be annihilated by the
F.L.E.I.J.A.'s rapid sphere collapse.

221
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:27,995
Hold on!

222
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,691
You want Suzaku to fire a weapon like that?!

223
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:33,239
He'd kill his own people. A massacre.

224
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:36,654
Suzaku, you don't consider
yourself an Eleven anymore, right?

225
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,583
That's why I want to entrust the F.L.E.I.J.A. to you.

226
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,626
You'd give me that burden?

227
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,768
You were Princess Euphemia's knight,

228
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,195
so naturally...

229
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:49,350
Mm-mmm, Nina, darling.

230
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,497
A fine quandary might just kill Suzaku,

231
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:54,522
and take you along as well!

232
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:15,195
Yes. We've finished preparations
for our worldwide broadcast.

233
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,087
Lin Xing-ke and General Tohdoh are in the waiting area.

234
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:19,195
Right.

235
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:20,904
Very good.

236
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:23,333
After I meet with the Indian and Guinean members,

237
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,350
expect me at the assembly.

238
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:27,218
Do not leave this room.

239
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:28,758
Uh, okay.

240
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,325
And so, later...

241
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,059
Later?

242
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,002
I mean, see you later.

243
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,050
Huh?

244
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:37,802
I'll be off, then.

245
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,614
R-Regarding the union of the nations charter,

246
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,431
I will leave explanation of it to Representative
of the Supreme Council, Kaguya Sumeragi.

247
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,527
Are you all right?

248
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:51,410
We could always...

249
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:52,925
No! I already got the...

250
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,460
You're the Empress. We know you can.

251
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,944
Good thing we followed old Zero, isn't it, buddy?!

252
00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:01,428
Sure is.

253
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:02,750
By the way, where's C.C.?

254
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:04,345
I heard that she was still feeling ill.

255
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,847
Morning sickness, huh?

256
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,830
Congrats to Papa Zero!

257
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,804
Tamaki-san, maybe you've had a little too much.

258
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:12,454
Bring on the good stuff!

259
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:15,047
A soldier wearing makeup is disgraceful.

260
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:17,081
I have to make you look good.

261
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:19,702
Um, sir...

262
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:22,560
After this current situation is over...

263
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:26,947
I'd like to propose a request to Kyoshiro Tohdoh that...

264
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:29,493
Great! You're finally here!

265
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,958
Is this any time to be running late again?

266
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:33,189
I know. Sorry, guys.

267
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:35,362
Ohgi. Did you oversleep again?

268
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:36,387
Too slow.

269
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:38,287
Sorry I'm late, but the truth is, uh...

270
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:39,937
We're all here, let's go.

271
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:42,910
It's our day to change all of the history books, right?

272
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:45,835
We are coming live to you right over Horai Island.

273
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,466
Where the ratification ceremony

274
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:50,422
for the United States Charter is about to begin!

275
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,920
To help viewers understand this development,

276
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:55,552
the ceremony and ratification of this new charter

277
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:58,936
will create a federation of nations
that will rival our own empire.

278
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,964
As parts of the now dissipating E.U.

279
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:04,327
are joining as well, it will have a great unified power.

280
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,889
Included from the E.U. are: Poland, Italy...

281
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:09,885
Can't reach soldiers like Suzaku...

282
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,995
No brainer, but why can't I contact Rolo or Lelouch?

283
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,464
The Black Knights have convinced

284
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:16,966
all of these these representative nations to participate.

285
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:19,541
Therefore the leader behind this must be Zero.

286
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:22,732
In short, the U.F.N. will most
likely be an enemy to Britannia.

287
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:27,356
Military forces are deployed
in Kyushu, Chugoku, and Hokuriku.

288
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,629
As everyone watching this broadcast has witnessed,

289
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:35,602
all 47 nations have just
ratified the United States Charter.

290
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:37,281
Please stay tuned...

291
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,381
Lord Guilford, we've finished
preparations for your troops review.

292
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:43,350
Very good. On my way.

293
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:44,933
Yes?

294
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,160
Don't worry, if it's about the troop review I...

295
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,685
Lord Guilford.

296
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,960
Orange boy?

297
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:55,277
They're forming a union of nations, just as you said.

298
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:58,818
But the militaries of each country
will never be able to work together.

299
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:01,137
They'll just be an unruly mob.

300
00:15:01,162 --> 00:15:02,937
No. There is an option.

301
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:05,454
...and those of international accords,

302
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,193
this article takes precedence.

303
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:11,176
Finally, article 17 of the United States Charter.

304
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:16,537
All ratifying nations do now declare
to abandon native military power forever.

305
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:18,600
Abandon military power?

306
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,500
Are they mad?

307
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:20,904
To guarantee security,

308
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:23,516
member nations have agreed to employ a fighting force

309
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,958
not affiliated with any one country.

310
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:28,606
They have contracted the Black Knights.

311
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,314
We hereby accept.

312
00:15:31,502 --> 00:15:36,160
Our acceptance also allows for
U.F.N. funding and personnel involvement.

313
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:40,584
In return, we will become the shield
to defend every member nation,

314
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:44,006
and its sword to oppose any external foe!

315
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:46,014
The option, right?

316
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:52,306
Disturbances in this world are caused
by military powers of disparate nations.

317
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:54,562
The U.F.N. shall only use military force

318
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,885
in accordance with a full
resolution by the supreme council.

319
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,127
And with that, I shall put forth the first motion.

320
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:03,756
Japan is being held by an unjust foreign power,

321
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:07,495
and the U.S.J. have asked for our help
to free them from this occupation.

322
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,895
I request that the Black Knights be dispatched at once.

323
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:13,319
All those in favor please stand up.

324
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,443
And so with overwhelming majority,

325
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:23,147
under U.F.N. resolution number 1,

326
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:26,297
the Black Knights shall now go forth to liberate Japan.

327
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:27,488
So be it!

328
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,933
Under U.F.N. resolution number 1,

329
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,667
our first operational objective shall be...

330
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:33,927
...Japan!

331
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,068
Our Japan.

332
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:38,718
And now we shall take it back!

333
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:40,589
Might rescue Kallen, also.

334
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:43,437
Huh? Yeah, we'll do that.

335
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:47,516
Hear me, Zero!

336
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:48,818
What?!

337
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,937
The system's hacked?!

338
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:52,564
It's coming in from 14 external paths!

339
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:54,343
The emperor!

340
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:56,379
Well. Look who's back.

341
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:59,919
Was this fake disappearance your doing, father? A charade?

342
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:01,516
Switch to the auxiliary lines!

343
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,791
Cut the link, dammit!

344
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:04,904
We can't! They've got those as well!

345
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:08,802
Zero. You thought this foolishness would surprise me?

346
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,758
Impossible! He's still alive?!

347
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,260
However, it matters not.

348
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:15,910
This charter you've made is a child's note.

349
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:19,272
The E.U., once a third of the world, is now dead.

350
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:22,138
You've only helped distinguish Britannia on a map

351
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:24,239
from the rest of the pitiful dirt.

352
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,204
The situation is very simple and clear.

353
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:30,331
For in the end whoever succeeds in this battle

354
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:33,022
shall gain control of the entire world.

355
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:35,520
Very well. Have at me, Zero.

356
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:37,002
I'm ready.

357
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:41,642
So will you win it all now, Zero,
or will you lose everything?

358
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:44,777
Time to learn the gambles of war.

359
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:48,372
All hail Britannia!

360
00:17:48,397 --> 00:17:55,741
All hail Britannia! All hail Britannia!

361
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,091
Long live Japan!

362
00:17:58,116 --> 00:17:59,893
Long live Japan!

363
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:04,481
All hail Britannia!

364
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:11,333
Long live Japan!

365
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,966
The emperor is still alive?

366
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:16,235
Um, excuse me.

367
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,364
Welcome back.

368
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:18,631
This isn't good.

369
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:19,747
Not good at all.

370
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:22,079
I have to rescue Nunnally at once!

371
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,694
Maybe I could use Cornelia some way.

372
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:30,944
No! The hostage ploy would have no effect on him.

373
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,026
Perhaps use Jeremiah or Rolo?

374
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:34,241
No, I can't!

375
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:36,189
And Geass won't work on him!

376
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:38,760
Should I reveal to the world that Zero's Lelouch?

377
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,789
No!

378
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:43,310
If the Black Knights found out their leader
were an enemy prince, I'd lose that too!

379
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:46,943
And rescuing Nunnally is useless
if there's no country that will accept us!

380
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:49,051
Dammit! What should I do?!

381
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,483
Um, master, I kept this last piece so you could have it.

382
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,714
You left without having breakfast and must be hungry.

383
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:58,047
So please, if you...

384
00:18:58,072 --> 00:18:59,560
Be quiet!

385
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:09,660
Hey...

386
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:12,762
Forgive me, master, I'll clean it up at once!

387
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:14,333
No. Leave it there!

388
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:16,544
Careful now, you're bleeding.

389
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:19,575
Uh... No. It's fine.

390
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,231
I'm okay. I get cut up all the time.

391
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:24,826
All the time?

392
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:31,916
Bleeding feels even better when it's cold.

393
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:34,049
It feels warm on your outside.

394
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:36,529
It stings a bit, but only on the outside,

395
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:38,962
and that's always better than hurt on your inside.

396
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,023
It's just...

397
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:43,052
Any kind of warmth helps make you try to keep going.

398
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:45,287
Oh, lookit, master, you're shaking.

399
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:46,927
Are you cold now?

400
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:50,481
Yeah, maybe. Maybe I am.

401
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,556
And the hurt on the inside...

402
00:19:57,581 --> 00:19:58,914
How's it healed?

403
00:19:59,002 --> 00:20:00,527
You just think of...

404
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:05,237
...some friends.

405
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,676
I've never actually had one.

406
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:10,739
Not like families, that always comes and goes.

407
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,351
I mean someone special who stands beside you.

408
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,109
At least I guess that's what I've heard that friends do...

409
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:18,468
Yes, they do.

410
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:19,802
I'm right?

411
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,251
A friend will stand by your side?

412
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:23,827
Exactly right.

413
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,852
A friend is always there.

414
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:37,816
I'm here.

415
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:40,202
It's Lelouch.

416
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:41,206
I know.

417
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:45,043
Um, so... Have you seen the news?

418
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:48,102
About Area 11 becoming a battlefield again?

419
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:49,093
Yes.

420
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:51,433
The Tokyo Settlement. It'll be in danger?

421
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,000
Depends... on your decisions.

422
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:54,983
Huh?

423
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,651
Lelouch. Are you Zero?

424
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:03,506
Yes, I am.

425
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,043
I am Zero.

426
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:09,399
Now tell me why an enemy of Britannia is calling.

427
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:12,129
Help me. Please save Nunnally.

428
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:16,391
The emperor has been using her
as hostage to try and lure me into his trap!

429
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,224
Don't you see?

430
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:19,516
That's why I've had to operate in secret!

431
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:22,762
Please, Suzaku!

432
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:25,156
You're the only person I can turn to now!

433
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,543
How dare you!

434
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,197
You think that request means anything to me?!

435
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,264
No, I don't.

436
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,647
But I need your help. I need it now!

437
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:34,268
Always so selfish.

438
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,595
Yes! You're all I have.

439
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,595
The only friend I can turn to!

440
00:21:39,518 --> 00:21:40,718
Suzaku!

441
00:21:40,743 --> 00:21:43,014
Protect her. It's Nunnally.

442
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,314
My heart's begging!

443
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,608
Very well, then.

444
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:51,283
However... One condition.

445
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,493
I will protect Nunnally.

446
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:56,283
But you must come to Area 11 by yourself,

447
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:57,683
where she is.

448
00:21:57,785 --> 00:22:00,070
The place will be the Kururugi shrine.

449
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,952
The two of us meet there.

450
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:03,169
Alone.

451
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:39,641
With things as there are,

452
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,775
should I have forced my way through
to save Nunnally much earlier?

453
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:43,778
But if I had,

454
00:23:43,803 --> 00:23:46,224
I'd be forced to treat her as an enemy hostage.

455
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,026
And she will never come to me of her own free will.

456
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,828
With all this hatred united against Britannia,

457
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:55,962
I can't stop the malice that
will now be directed at Nunnally.

458
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,697
It's all too dangerous.

459
00:23:57,818 --> 00:24:00,365
Right. Only one chance left.

460
00:24:00,443 --> 00:24:02,382
All I have left is trust.

461
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:04,515
I need to trust Suzaku!
