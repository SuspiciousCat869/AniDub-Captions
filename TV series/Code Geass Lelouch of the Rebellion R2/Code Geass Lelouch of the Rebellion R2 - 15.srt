1
00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:05,822
The young Britannian Lelouch vowed to
avenge his mother who was killed 8 years ago,

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:10,955
and he pledged to create a world where
his younger sister, Nunnally, could find happiness.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:16,140
For that purpose, he gained power
from a mysterious girl named C.C.,

4
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:17,930
the power of Geass,

5
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:22,587
the absolute ability to compel
any person to do whatever he commands.

6
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:27,059
Lelouch used this power to embark on a path of destruction

7
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:31,822
aimed at the heart of the Holy
Britannian Empire ruled by his father...

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,582
But at the end of that path, what will he have gained?

9
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:37,759
And what will he have lost?

10
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,872
Geass is called the power of the king,

11
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:44,005
yet of this power, only one thing is clear:

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,398
those who use it walk a path of solitude.

13
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:30,249
It's been a long time, Lelouch.

14
00:02:30,298 --> 00:02:32,298
My prodigal son.

15
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:35,756
Answer my question about 8 years ago!

16
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:37,976
Why didn't you try to protect mother?!

17
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:40,201
You knew the others were plotting against her!

18
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,559
You knew everything!

19
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:43,624
People are not equal.

20
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:44,299
What?!

21
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:46,755
You have a unique form of Geass,

22
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,030
a power that no one else possesses.

23
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:52,059
Use it to get the answer from me!

24
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:53,593
He's baiting me,

25
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:56,164
trying to get me to use my Geass on him.

26
00:02:56,222 --> 00:03:00,557
But, if I look into his eyes, then he'll look into mine!

27
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:04,636
His Geass requires eye contact, just like mine does...

28
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:08,030
So the moment I look, his Geass will take control of me

29
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,805
and he'll alter my memories!

30
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,258
What do I do?!

31
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,906
What's wrong?

32
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:17,893
Are you not my son, a prince of Britannia?

33
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:20,449
I have no time to make the wrong choice!

34
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,624
These orders are from Zero!

35
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:27,322
Search through all facilities! Obey Zero!

36
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:29,672
Bring all corpses to the designated area.

37
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:33,565
We must determine if any of the
experimental soldiers are among them.

38
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,349
But this is... a massacre!

39
00:03:37,431 --> 00:03:42,518
Bartley, I hated you for reconstructing me with this body.

40
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:45,972
But your loyalty to the imperial family was genuine.

41
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,709
So be it.

42
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:51,759
I make my final decision! I will respect you!

43
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:58,913
Lelouch vi Britannia commands you!

44
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,918
And now, die!

45
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:13,521
Very well, then.

46
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:36,363
I won.

47
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,393
I won.

48
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:43,101
Nunnally... Mother...

49
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:47,230
I, uh... I did it.

50
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:59,296
I don't knowbout Lelouch! How many times must I say it?!

51
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,436
Would you swear to it solemnly, on Shirley's grave?

52
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:04,578
Uh.

53
00:05:05,563 --> 00:05:07,628
Now, you're going to tell me everything.

54
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:08,889
With the help of this Refrain!

55
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:12,224
Don't. Please, don't! Stop it!

56
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,497
You don't have to be afraid.

57
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:17,820
You'll lose your will-power soon,

58
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:20,722
and then you'll answer all my questions.

59
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,674
Brother, help me...

60
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,605
Now, you will obey my commands.

61
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:34,447
I will not... be like him...

62
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:41,568
How many years has it been
since we were together face to face, V.V.?

63
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,749
In the end, I couldn't run away from my destiny, could I?

64
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,972
Now I bear the burden of... that destiny...

65
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:52,747
Huh?

66
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:54,978
Of immortality...

67
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,749
What? V.V., are you...?

68
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:01,934
So, please, Charles...

69
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,764
Well, do you swear it?

70
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:07,709
Yes. In this world full of lies...

71
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,273
We will never lie to each other.

72
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:17,306
That's because I... I am your... your big brother...

73
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:21,627
I killed him. It was so easy.

74
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:24,988
I had questions for him.

75
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:28,824
Deaths he should have answered for, but now...

76
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:31,122
Oh? Whose?

77
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,742
You're impudent, Lelouch!

78
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:38,024
You're alive?! That's impossible!

79
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,487
That bullet went through your heart!

80
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:43,137
Plots and schemes, deceptions.

81
00:06:43,162 --> 00:06:47,422
You really thought you could
defeat me with those cheap tricks?

82
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:49,756
You want the power of a king?

83
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:52,927
Then have the courage to come at me like a king!

84
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:54,980
Die!

85
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:57,961
You think that's how a king does it?

86
00:06:57,986 --> 00:07:00,225
My Geass isn't working!

87
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:07,231
You still do not understand?

88
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:10,437
I am beyond the power of guns or swords now!

89
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:14,296
No matter how you attack me, it's useless!

90
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:21,676
Charles, why steal V.V.'s Code now?

91
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:25,262
Why would you kill the older brother you loved so much?

92
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:32,441
V.V., you loved Marianne, didn't you?

93
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:36,715
He's become immortal, too?!

94
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:40,066
I can't win. There's no way I can win!

95
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,974
I've gained a new power in place of Geass.

96
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,288
A power that goes far beyond.

97
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:48,762
And so, Lelouch, behold and I shall show you

98
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:52,047
the true nature of this world!

99
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:03,098
What is this?!

100
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:20,321
Chigusa.

101
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:23,250
That was the name you called me when I lost my memory.

102
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,823
What's my real name?

103
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,974
Villetta.

104
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:31,003
But that doesn't change anything.

105
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:33,065
I'm a Britannian baroness.

106
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,432
No matter what the reason,

107
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:37,543
if I don't erase the disgrace
of my having loved an Eleven,

108
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:39,609
I won't be able to live in this world.

109
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:41,358
Hmph. I suppose not.

110
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:44,930
If I must die, I just wish it could've been in Japan.

111
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:47,667
You came here knowing I was going to kill you?

112
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:50,901
Everybody dies. I wanted to choose the time.

113
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:53,531
You can also choose to kill me if you want.

114
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:54,553
Tell me!

115
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:58,397
Why did a terrorist save a Britannian in the first place?!

116
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:02,564
In the beginning, I thought I could
get information from you about Zero.

117
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:06,195
I tricked you, kept you under surveillance.

118
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,235
But, while we lived together...

119
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,533
I'm your sworn enemy!

120
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:10,018
But I still love you!

121
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:11,236
Are you insane?!

122
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:14,698
I must be. You are the enemy.

123
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,208
But I can't stop myself from loving you!

124
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:21,632
I wish I'd never set eyes on you!

125
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:22,817
Uh?!

126
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:25,169
Uh? From intelligence?

127
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:31,442
What is Geass?! I want the truth?!

128
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:38,286
How strange. A child who's wrapped
himself in lies desires the truth from others.

129
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,239
What?

130
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:42,542
The false name and false mask of Zero,

131
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,975
what has it gotten you?

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,569
Everything! It got me all the things
that ordinary people can never obtain!

133
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:50,352
Followers! Territory!

134
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:51,995
You lost Euphemia.

135
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,536
Suzaku and Nunnally are also lost to your lies!

136
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,776
Shut up! I did what I had to do!

137
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,525
People lie to survive! No one is blameless!

138
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:02,871
You want others to know your true self,

139
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:05,650
yet you only show them a false face.

140
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:09,101
How can anyone know you if you don't reveal yourself?

141
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:10,293
If you hide behind masks.

142
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,459
You are afraid that they'll find out who you really are.

143
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:14,575
No!

144
00:10:14,737 --> 00:10:17,538
In the end, your lies serve no purpose.

145
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:22,347
Because you are me and I am you. All else is illusion.

146
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:26,282
Though there be worlds
without end, there is but one being.

147
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:31,182
In the past. In the future. And now. Only one.

148
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,484
One...? What are you saying?

149
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,926
Charles.

150
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:38,603
Play time is over now.

151
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,557
There's nothing in it for me now;

152
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:42,332
no value in the games anymore.

153
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:43,599
C.C.?

154
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:47,239
You don't have to cajole him like this to get me here.

155
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,651
I already exist in this realm.

156
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:55,450
True enough, C.C. In that case, I shall grant your wish.

157
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:57,841
You know what C.C.'s wish is?!

158
00:10:57,935 --> 00:11:03,097
Lelouch. It's time you knew the
conditions of our contract. And what I desire.

159
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:11,829
My wish is to die. To end my
existence in all worlds forever.

160
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,984
But why? Why would you want to die?!

161
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,224
In the final stage of Geass,

162
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:21,788
the user attains the position of
the one who granted them the power.

163
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:24,566
Thus, you have gained the power to kill me.

164
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:27,696
Kill you? C.C...

165
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,370
Of all those I made contracts with,

166
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:32,687
none has ever reached that point.

167
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:36,086
But now there's Charles. He has done it.

168
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:40,643
You mean... you made your contract
with me so that you could cease to exist?!

169
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:41,793
Correct.

170
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:43,889
But why would you want to die?

171
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:46,607
It's providence, a boundary.

172
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:49,480
Only when it's finite can we call it life.

173
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:52,297
That's wrong! We call it life because we feel it!

174
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:56,489
Same thing. There is no life unless there is death.

175
00:11:56,546 --> 00:11:58,826
That's just wordplay; it's not real!

176
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,734
People die. That's real.

177
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,164
Then why are we born at all?!

178
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,089
What's the purpose of it? The meaning?!

179
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:05,770
You know the answer.

180
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:07,599
Those things are all just illusions.

181
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:10,333
No! Living just to die is too sad!

182
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:14,566
Without death, all we have
are random events... accumulation.

183
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,474
You can't call that life.

184
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:20,453
If you have a reason for living, then you have to kill me.

185
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:22,864
Do that, and you'll be Charles's equal.

186
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,271
You'll finally be able to beat him.

187
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,476
So fare thee well, Lelouch.

188
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,355
You're too kind to end our contract.

189
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,853
Wait! You're...

190
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:48,071
Charles, why did you steal V.V.'s Code?

191
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:50,968
Is there any point in asking such questions?

192
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:53,001
After all, you're about to die.

193
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:54,682
I suppose you're right.

194
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,391
So very well then,

195
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,476
I'll proceed with the redevelopment of
the Saitama ghetto according to this schedule.

196
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,668
Wait a minute, please.

197
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:07,430
Huh?

198
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,243
Here.

199
00:13:08,268 --> 00:13:09,755
Is something wrong?

200
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:13,784
This plan you worked out,

201
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:16,459
it isn't going to penalize the Elevens, is it?

202
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:17,899
Of course not.

203
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:20,732
It's the best possible plan for them and for us.

204
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:21,702
That is...

205
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:24,399
...a lie, isn't it?

206
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:26,722
Please rework the plan once more.

207
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:29,928
I don't wish the Elevens to be disadvantaged by it.

208
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:34,174
Princess, I am an expert. Please let me handle the...

209
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,707
Miss Lohmeyer! I-I believe that I... I'm the viceroy!

210
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,314
After all this,

211
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:46,233
my only choice is to confront Lelouch about it directly!

212
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,579
Huh? Suzaku did you finish your work at the bureau?

213
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:51,283
Have you seen Lelouch?

214
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:55,110
Uh-uh. I guess what happened
to Shirley really shook him up.

215
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:56,961
He hasn't been home or at school.

216
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:57,813
Hey!

217
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:05,036
Where's Lelouch Lamperouge now?!

218
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:06,901
There is no unusual activity.

219
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:09,906
I asked where he is! Where's Commander Villetta?!

220
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:11,262
Where's his "brother" Rolo?!

221
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:14,370
As I said, there's no unusual activity to report.

222
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:16,374
It's the same as always.

223
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:20,511
So that's it. The entire O.S.I. staff has been...

224
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:26,456
Please forgive me. I had to speak with Nunnally.

225
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:28,855
It's all right. We're still getting ready.

226
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:30,225
What happened?

227
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,758
Oh, you know the topic.

228
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:34,170
Lloyd's Camelot group and Suzaku.

229
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:36,161
I meant with the Toromo Agency.

230
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:37,395
Oh, that.

231
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:40,230
It depends on the results of this test.

232
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:43,604
Yes. My brother Schneizel contacted me.

233
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:47,213
We can raise Area 11's status to satellite region.

234
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,361
He said it's in recognition of
improved public order and productivity.

235
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:52,796
That's good news.

236
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:55,695
Lelouch must have been Zero all this time.

237
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:57,456
But if I report that to the Emperor,

238
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,071
what happens to Nunnally?

239
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,888
If Lelouch regains his memories,

240
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:05,289
then I shall simply use Nunnally to deal with him.

241
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:08,974
Suzaku, you're not hiding anything, right?

242
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:10,166
Of course not.

243
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,538
You're the one person that I'd never lie to.

244
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:16,303
Then will you tell me who it was
I spoke to on the phone that time?

245
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:18,900
Wasn't it my big brother?

246
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,106
Suzaku...

247
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,808
You're just like him, aren't you? Like my brother...

248
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,037
He's gone? Zero's gone?

249
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,682
Yes. We received a signal that he'd sighted the target,

250
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:33,466
but he and the Shinkiro are missing.

251
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:35,707
Missing? My brother is...?!

252
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:42,383
Where am I?

253
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:50,189
Uh! Hey!

254
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,955
It's no use.

255
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:02,665
These are all my memories. You can't interfere.

256
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:05,993
C.C... No. You're not, are you?

257
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:08,640
Who are you? Tell me.

258
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:12,755
I'm Lelouch. I am your...

259
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,424
Do you have some reason to live, child?

260
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:20,196
I don't know. I just don't want to die!

261
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,054
Then let's make a contract.

262
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:25,271
I will give you a special power so you can survive.

263
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:29,344
And in return, one day you will grant me a special wish.

264
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:30,984
Do you swear that you'll do it?

265
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:32,086
So is this...?

266
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:36,042
It is. I swore to uphold that contract.

267
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:44,246
Stop it! Stop it, both of you! Please!

268
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:49,118
I'm sorry about this.

269
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:51,685
We were getting along quite well together.

270
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:53,120
Stop!

271
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,754
Ohgi!

272
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:05,028
The Geass I manifested was to make people love me.

273
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:06,188
Love you?

274
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:09,168
Because, deep in my heart, I...

275
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,944
I wanted to be loved by someone.

276
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:16,817
And my wish was granted.

277
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:19,581
Because of my Geass, I was loved by everyone.

278
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:21,559
But in the end it was too much.

279
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:24,326
Love without limit was love without meaning.

280
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:26,608
I forgot what love really was.

281
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:29,224
The only person I believed in was her.

282
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,583
Because my Geass couldn't work on her,

283
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:35,153
she was the one person who
would scold me for being trivial.

284
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:36,323
And yet...

285
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:40,807
Yes yes... I gave back all the gifts
I received, like you told me to.

286
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:44,477
But it can't be helped, can it? It's because of the Geass.

287
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:48,794
I'm grateful to you Sister,
but this is a pain for me, too.

288
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,056
I'm so tired of all the proposals and flowers.

289
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:55,022
Now some of them are starting a religion around me!

290
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,505
Then shall we end it?

291
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,474
Huh?

292
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:00,054
I need someone to take my place.

293
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,058
Someone with a Geass that's exceptionally strong,

294
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,896
so eternity can finally end for me.

295
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:07,963
Can you imagine the agony?

296
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:11,050
The hell of living on and on for eternity?

297
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:13,242
Uh, what are you talking about?

298
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:16,473
I'm sorry, dear! I'm afraid I tricked you!

299
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:28,175
She had just pretended to be
friends with me right from the start.

300
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,668
I was a tool, a way for her to end her life. That's all.

301
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,319
You're still not in here.

302
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:39,796
That means you're not from my past.

303
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:42,171
You're a real person, aren't you?

304
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:44,875
Am I? I couldn't really say.

305
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:47,421
I wonder if you're very important to me.

306
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:48,758
That's impossible.

307
00:18:48,783 --> 00:18:52,077
Oh? The fact you were sent here

308
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:55,050
means I once tried to save you from something.

309
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,027
Or someone.

310
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,011
Huh?

311
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:02,510
The people who hated me, the ones who were kind to me.

312
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:06,287
All of them eventually vanished into the flow of time,

313
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:08,181
the endless flow of eternity...

314
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:11,194
But now, your tormented days...

315
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:15,654
Yes. They're over now. My long journey ends here.

316
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:17,446
C.C.!

317
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:21,913
You've opened it, Lelouch! The Thought Elevator!

318
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:29,214
I see it now! This realm of existence itself
is a system for interfering with thought!

319
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:32,576
Soon it will be over.

320
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:36,045
Lelouch, sit where you are and watch!

321
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:50,154
Stop it! C.C. is my... She's my...!

322
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,208
Tell me, C.C...

323
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,176
Why didn't you make me take your place?!

324
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:56,910
You could've had your death that way!

325
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:59,477
Forcing me into your hell of eternal life!

326
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:04,145
C.C., it wasn't out of pity?! Was it?

327
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,493
Don't die looking like that!

328
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:10,539
You should come to death smiling!

329
00:20:10,663 --> 00:20:14,221
I promise you the smile you never had! Please...!

330
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:18,191
What do you think you're doing, C.C.?!

331
00:20:20,572 --> 00:20:22,954
You have stolen enough from me already, Father!

332
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:24,729
You won't have her, too!

333
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,061
No! No, you'll ruin it all!

334
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:45,009
I know what it was now! I understand what your Geass was!

335
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,992
And I know your true wish!

336
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:51,738
Come closer. Let me reach you!

337
00:21:01,414 --> 00:21:03,622
F.L.E.I.J.A. Activation confirmed.

338
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,757
It worked.

339
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,238
I can't believe the explosive force!

340
00:21:08,263 --> 00:21:10,304
Chief. Congratulations!

341
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:13,539
Oh, no. The whole staff at Invogue deserves the credit.

342
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,389
You'll have to accept the compliment, Nina.

343
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:19,036
You are a genius.

344
00:21:19,138 --> 00:21:21,426
I'm very honored, Prince Schneizel.

345
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:25,838
Now war itself will change, and mankind with it.

346
00:21:26,863 --> 00:21:29,363
Damocles is here at last!

347
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:34,028
Hey! We're back, C.C.! Wake up!

348
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,880
I've already contacted Rolo.

349
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:40,876
We'll use him to get out of here.

350
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:43,071
Who are you, sir?

351
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:44,211
What are you saying?

352
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,336
We need to talk about the Emperor and that...

353
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:48,401
Are you my new master?

354
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:49,284
Uh.

355
00:21:49,522 --> 00:21:52,907
I-I can clean and help prepare food for cooking.

356
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:56,414
I can also fetch water and tend cows and sew.

357
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:58,866
I can read a little and count to twenty.

358
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:03,118
Oh. I can carry away corpses, if you need that.

359
00:23:37,613 --> 00:23:40,453
Kallen has been captured, Shirley is dead.

360
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:42,363
And now I've lost C.C. as well.

361
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:45,849
Even so, this is no time to wallow in sentimentality!

362
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:48,155
I have a plan to rescue Nunnally.

363
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,097
The problem is timing: when to strike.

364
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,484
Even if we move now, there are too many
uncertain elements waiting for the aftermath.

365
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:56,969
If I want to be sure of this,

366
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:59,202
I'll need a United Federation of Nations.

367
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:03,452
And for that, keeping the Emperor in that
other realm will be an absolute requirement.

368
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:04,519
But...
