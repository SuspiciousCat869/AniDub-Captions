00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,708
[KONOHA]
If you looked up "model student"

2
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,375
in the dictionary, you'd
probably find a picture of me.

3
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,250
I like being depended
on, being liked.

4
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,750
And I don't mind
going the extra mile

5
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,250
to make sure that people do.

6
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,375
Not to brag, but I have
a lot of talents.

7
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,125
Although, being pretty good
at a bunch of stuff

8
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,791
isn't as awesome as
you might assume.

9
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,500
Whether it's sports
or academics,

10
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,541
I always rank among the
top handful of my peers.

11
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,750
That said, I'm never the
absolute best at anything.

12
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,125
When the dust clears,

13
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,291
someone else inevitably
walks away with the prize.

14
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,458
So you can imagine my
shock when I was elected

15
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,416
to serve as student
council president.

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,708
It felt so good to win
for a change, y'know?

17
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,708
Finally, I was at the
top of the heap.

18
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,833
But the green-eyed monster
reared its head again.

19
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,791
Compared to Karen Tendo,
I felt like some sad-sack

20
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,416
who happened to get lucky once.

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,541
I know that jealousy is
a waste of my time;

22
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,208
it doesn't make anything better.

23
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,250
Still, how am I
supposed to be chill

24
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,958
about her outshining me at
all the stuff I try to do,

25
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,083
when everything comes
to her so easily?

26
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,708
That's the problem. I can't.

27
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,458
[KONOHA]
If there's no other business,

28
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,875
then let's call it a day.

29
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,333
Thank you for a great meeting!

30
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,250
[STUDENT COUNCIL]
You too, Miss President.

31
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,666
Guess we'll be
heading out now.

32
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,166
Try not to overwork
yourself too much, okay?

33
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,250
[KONOHA] I'll be fine.
Have a good walk home!

34
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:38,000
The scent of pure, innocent
maidens, and it's all mine!

35
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,541
[laughing]

36
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,125
Student council is a
hundred percent hot ladies!

37
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,750
It's like they're my harem!

38
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,041
[gasps]

39
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,500
Oh, crap! I forgot!
No time for chair huffing!

40
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:58,458
[laughing]

41
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,375
[KONOHA] I'm rocking
the perfect disguise!

42
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,250
Behold! The bearded rando!

43
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,500
But my real disguise
goes deeper.

44
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:19,916
It's true. That of the
"innocent school girl."

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,875
In my heart of hearts,

46
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,333
I'm nothing but a thirsty,
dyed-in-the-wool,

47
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,041
totally irredeemable...

48
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:34,041
[KONOHA]
...hentai-game super-fan!

49
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,708
And just like that,
I've found it!

50
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,416
The newest title in the
<i>Build</i> series by Gagi!

51
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,750
They do such a legit
job with the plotlines,

52
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,791
you feel like you've earned it

53
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,625
once the girls
finally get freaky!

54
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:49,666
[chuckling]

55
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,583
[KONOHA]
Hm?

56
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,250
[KONOHA] Maybe I should
get a console game,

57
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,375
just to balance things out.

58
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,291
[chuckles]

59
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,083
[STUDENT COUNCIL C] Yeah,
if Karen Tendo went here

60
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,666
instead of Otobuki, she'd have
won student council president

61
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,416
by a landslide.

62
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,666
[STUDENT COUNCIL A]
I know, right?

63
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,458
But Konoha's cool. Like,
she gets the job done.

64
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,416
Oh, this game is
probably more my speed.

65
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,916
[KEITA] You're really sticking
with the game club.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,750
I admire your dedication.
Way to go, Misumi!

67
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,333
[KONOHA]
Those shirts they're wearing...

68
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,333
They go to the same
high school as Tendo!

69
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,583
Aw, man!

70
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,166
Pretty boys like him are
like catnip for my soul!

71
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,291
But the other one's just meh.

72
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,458
Like those bland protaginists
you always see in dating-sims.

73
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,416
You know him?

74
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,458
[KEITA]
That guy? I hope not.

75
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,208
[KONOHA]
Uh! That was close!

76
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,916
Can you maybe recommend me some
good dating sim games, Amano?

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,750
[KONOHA]
Say 'em loud!

78
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,708
Okay.

79
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,791
But this isn't a conversation

80
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,416
I'm used to having
with anyone else,

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,291
so I hope you don't think
my picks are lame.

82
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,166
I promise I won't judge you.

83
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,125
Everybody is going to
have his own favorites

84
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,666
when it comes to
this sort of thing.

85
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,125
Well, I'm pretty sure I
like the same sort of stuff

86
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,500
as everyone else.

87
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,541
Nothing too out-there for me,
thank you very much.

88
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,875
[groans]

89
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,333
[KONOHA]
Jeez, what a lightweight.

90
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,250
This Amano guy needs to sack
up and start naming names.

91
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,750
So then, were there any titles
you've already heard of

92
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,875
that you were maybe wanting
to know more about?

93
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:27,958
[EIICHI]
Hmm...

94
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,291
I did do a little
research on my own

95
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,083
the other day to prep for this.

96
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,291
Ah!

97
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,791
People were flipping
their lid about this one

98
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,208
on the internet, weren't they?

99
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,416
[KONOHA] Yeah, that game's
got a pretty good rep.

100
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,416
Nice an' safe.

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,416
It's an absolute masterpiece!

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,083
I went to school
tired for a week

103
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,750
from staying up
late to beat it.

104
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,916
[EIICHI]
Goodness!

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,500
Well, if this has your
stamp of approval,

106
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,791
I think I'll go
ahead and buy it!

107
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,291
[KONOHA]
Done already? Boring.

108
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,291
[KEITA]
Whoa! Wait a second!

109
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,875
Just because I adored it,
doesn't necessarily mean

110
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,541
you'll feel the
same way about it.

111
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,875
Oh, you think so?

112
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,500
[KONOHA] Ugh. You
wishy-washy little cockroach!

113
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,791
Just to confirm it.

114
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,041
You wanna know the difference

115
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,833
between a bad dating-sim
and a good one, right?

116
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,791
No one who's a part of the
club is well-versed enough

117
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,708
in these games for
me to ask them.

118
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,208
[KEITA]
Hmm...

119
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,291
I got it! Hang tight for a sec.

120
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,833
[yelps]

121
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,166
[KONOHA] Pick one already
so I can drool in peace!

122
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,791
I bet you're the sort
who takes an hour

123
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,333
to name their character at
the beginning of a game!

124
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,166
[KEITA]
Ah! Found it!

125
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,625
If you're really depending
on me for a recommendation,

126
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,333
go with <i>Rainbow Court</i> !

127
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,500
[gasps]

128
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,291
I don't think I've ever
heard of that one.

129
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,791
[KONOHA]
Of course you haven't.

130
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,750
It's almost prehistoric
in video game years.

131
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:39,208
And even back then, it didn't
exactly set the world on fire.

132
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,166
I'm afraid they didn't
sell that many copies,

133
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,708
even back when it was brand new.

134
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:43,875
[KONOHA]
You see?

135
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,375
[EIICHI]
So why'd you pick it?

136
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:49,125
I, um, I had a lot of fun
playing through it. That's all.

137
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,500
[gasps]

138
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,833
Cool.

139
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,583
Oh! But there's no pressure
to go with that one.

140
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,791
Whichever you pick is fine!

141
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,958
I figure if I can
talk up anything,

142
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,333
then it might as well
be a hidden gem

143
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,125
that could use a
chance to shine, right?

144
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,750
It's like, when a quality
title gets the cold shoulder

145
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,666
from everyone just because
now the art style

146
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,208
might be a little bit outdated.

147
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,375
I don't know why,

148
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,083
but stuff like that just
really gets to me.

149
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,500
I guess I treat video games
as if they're people.

150
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,916
I'd rather root for the underdog
who never got a fair shake,

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
than cheer for the one who's
winning the race by a mile.

152
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,375
Uh! I'm sorry!

153
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,750
I didn't mean to
go off on a rant

154
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,833
about some ancient software.

155
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,333
But that said,

156
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,500
I feel like <i>Rainbow</i>
<i>Court</i> is still one of

157
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,416
my top three favorite
games of all time.

158
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,833
That's how much it meant to me!

159
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:32,916
Back then...

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,750
[KONOHA]
Hold on. What's wrong with me?

161
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,375
Why is this so... touching?

162
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,333
In that case,

163
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,791
I'm gonna put my money on the
underdog this time around.

164
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,541
[door opens]

165
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,750
[CHIAKI] Konoha? I didn't
know you were home.

166
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,875
Yeah. For a while.

167
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,791
[CHIAKI] Look here. And
where'd you pick this gem up?

168
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,250
Stop! Put it down!

169
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,208
[CHIAKI] You never told me
you liked these kinda games.

170
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,750
It's not even mine.
I'm borrowing it!

171
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,000
[CHIAKI] So why do I
see a price tag then?

172
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,666
Just give it back
already! Come on, Sis!

173
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,291
[TASUKU] So Amano and
Aguri tied the knot,

174
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,416
right after they
graduated from college.

175
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,166
Like clockwork.

176
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,083
We all told 'em we were happy
for 'em, 'cause it's what ya do.

177
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,750
Three cheers for the lucky
couple, et cetera.

178
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,916
That's the outside.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,958
On the inside, we're
conflicted as hell.

180
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,750
Hoshinomori inhaled
her body-weight in cake

181
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,625
so she wouldn't have
to congratulate Amano.

182
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,625
Tendo and I didn't OD on
dessert, so that's a plus,

183
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,000
but it still drove us nuts
to watch our hearts' desires

184
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,375
heading into the big
penalty box of matrimony.

185
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,208
The ceremony was held
at a reception hall

186
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,458
not far from our
old high school.

187
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,666
Looking back, those years
were a real crap-fest

188
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,125
as far as our group dynamic.

189
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,166
[TASUKU]
Or none of that happened.

190
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,291
It's a no-brainer.

191
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,125
You cram everyone
together in one room

192
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,583
and talk until stuff gets fixed!

193
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,291
Why are you being
such a dummy, huh?

194
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,333
It's not like I spun a
seven on purpose, Aguri!

195
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,875
[TASUKU] As solutions go,
it's pretty damn obvious.

196
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,916
And it's not like I hadn't
figured it out way before now.

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,458
With so much
weirdness going on,

198
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,166
it had been tough to get all
five of us in the same place.

199
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,541
Finally, though,
a stroke of luck.


200
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,541
[CHIAKI]
Hey, you guys.

201
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,541
Take a look at this photo
my mom texted me!

202
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,708
[TASUKU] <i>The Love-Love</i>
<i>Game of Half-Life</i> ?

203
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,166
[CHIAKI]
Cool, huh?

204
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,500
I guess my mom won it in a
contest at our supermarket.

205
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,583
Cool.

206
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,333
There's an article
about this online.

207
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,708
It's a new board game all
about romance, right?

208
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,541
[CHIAKI] Uh-huh, I think
it sounds kinda fun!

209
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,916
But I guess we'd need
more people, huh?

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,458
Ah. That is a challenge
with board games.

211
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,375
Deal me in.

212
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,250
It should be doable
with three of us.

213
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,791
We can make it an official
gamer meet-up activity.

214
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,958
Do you think so?

215
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,083
In that case, would you
like to come over?

216
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,833
Though I'm not really
sure if I want Keita

217
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,791
knowing where my place is.

218
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,333
What's that supposed to mean?

219
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,125
[KEITA, CHIAKI growl]

220
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,041
[TASUKU]
Not this again.

221
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,000
[chuckles]

222
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,541
Hey, so here's an idea.

223
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,291
How 'bout we get
more people to play?

224
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,916
The more the merrier, y'know?

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,958
[CHIAKI]
Any suggestions?

226
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,708
Actually, I do have
somebody in mind

227
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,583
I think would be a perfect fit.

228
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,375
Is their name Tendo?

229
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,416
[TASUKU] She is a gamer.
Sling her an invite, Casanova.

230
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,708
Why me, huh?

231
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,958
Wow, the thought of
Tendo coming to my place,

232
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,000
it's ever-so-slightly
nerve-wracking.

233
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,333
In that case, why don't we
have Aguri come over, too,

234
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,958
and take the pressure off?

235
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,541
She's gotta be
better at board games

236
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,791
than she is at video games!

237
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,833
[CHIAKI] Oh, that's a
good idea. Thank you!

238
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,750
You're surprisingly
enthusiastic about all of this.

239
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,375
[TASUKU]
Mh-hm.

240
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,250
[TASUKU]
Ha-ha! Finally!

241
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,041
Everybody in the same
place at once!

242
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,041
If we can just to each other
for five friggin' minutes,

243
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,458
we can get all this hashed out

244
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,208
and put this weird love-pentagon
out to pasture already!

245
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,583
At least, it sounded
like a solid plan.

246
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,583
[TASUKU]
The so-called couples

247
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,958
are all sitting away
from each other,

248
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,791
'cause everyone's
wound so tight.

249
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,333
Which is fine I guess,

250
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,291
since it means we can't
fall back on chit-chat

251
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,750
with our significant others.

252
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,833
'Kay, so it's my turn to
move now. Right, you guys?

253
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,416
Here goes nothing.

254
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,958
[TASUKU]
All you do is spin the spinner,

255
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,333
move your piece
that many squares,

256
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,625
and do whatever it says.

257
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,958
It doesn't require any thought,

258
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,875
so you end up talking
about whatever,

259
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,000
which will be the perfect chance

260
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,958
to start dropping
some truth-bombs.

261
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:04,000
I was so sure my plan was
foolproof, even for this crowd.

262
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,041
And yet...

263
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,833
[AGURI]
One, two, three.

264
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,791
"Newlywed life is going great!

265
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,833
You get pregnant with your first
child on your honeymoon.

266
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,791
You and your spouse
receive 3,000 yen

267
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,458
in gifts from everyone."

268
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,708
[TASUKU]
This game is such BS!

269
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,125
What the heck?

270
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,791
We've been married for a minute
and now you're pregnant?

271
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,458
Hey! You weren't complaining
during the honeymoon part!

272
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,416
This is at least half
your fault, mister!

273
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,000
[sighs]

274
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,541
[TASUKU] Lookin' back, maybe
this <i>Love-Love Game of Half-Life</i>

275
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,791
wasn't the best idea.

276
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,041
The student part of
the game kicked off

277
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,083
with Amano and Aguri dating.

278
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,666
Meanwhile,
Hoshinomori can't land

279
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,041
a steady job after graduation,
and works a bunch of temp gigs.

280
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,166
And then there's Tendo...

281
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,458
Well, time to find out what
life has in store for me!

282
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:51,833
[KAREN]
Eight.

283
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,416
Let's see.

284
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,750
"Your crush gets married, and
you become more focused on work.

285
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,041
Fifty-thousand yen
in extra income."

286
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,250
[chuckles]

287
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,000
Look at me. I'm so rich.
Isn't that awesome?

288
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,625
[TASUKU]
Tough break, Tendo.

289
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,291
You deserve better, but
<i>Half-Life</i> is a harsh mistress.

290
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,375
That happened.
Guess it's my turn.

291
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,583
[TASUKU]
It's the marriage space.

292
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,375
[TASUKU] When you land here, you
give the spinner another whirl.

293
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,666
All players get numbers,
and whatever it lands on,

294
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,041
you can force that
person to marry you.

295
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,250
If I get a one or two,
I can start over with Aguri,

296
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,333
and Amano gets kicked to
the tiny cardboard curb.

297
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,208
I got a lot riding
on this, spinner,

298
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,500
and not just in
the game, either!

299
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:37,333
Come on. Come on. Do me a solid!

300
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,083
Dammit!

301
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,916
Uehara! This is such a big step!

302
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,750
[TASUKU] What's that look for?
I just spun the damn thing!

303
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:49,333
[CHIAKI] Um, my turn now!
I hope I land on something good!

304
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,916
[CHIAKI]
Two.

305
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,416
It says: "Your partner
has cheated on you.

306
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,083
You are forced
to pay their lover

307
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,500
to get them out of the picture.

308
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,958
You and your spouse
lose 5,000 yen."

309
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,166
Oh, no.

310
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,666
[TASUKU] Okay. Enough
with the death-stares.

Okay. Wish me luck!

Who are you calling a horndog?

Sorry about that.

These kids are doomed.

468
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,500
Mono? You've never
mentioned them before.

469
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,958
Ah. That's my mistake.

470
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,208
They're an online friend of
mine in this mobile game.

471
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,291
Honestly, their companionship's
top-notch in a lota ways.

472
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:07,250
Oh, great. A close friend of
indeterminate gender online.

473
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,083
Ya got any more of 'em?

474
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,916
Not many, but the few that I do

475
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,791
are among my most
important ones.

476
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,333
That's interesting.

477
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,000
And what do these mysterious
internet friends know about you?

478
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,750
Oh. Not a lot.

479
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,458
I use different nicknames based
on whatever I'm doing online.

480
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,083
Sorry that took
so long, everyone.

481
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,458
[KEITA] But most of the time,
it's one name or the other.

482
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,750
Honestly, 90% of
my conversations

483
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,333
are with two people.

484
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,208
[KEITA]
When I'm online raiding,

485
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,041
I play under the
handle "Tsucchie."

486
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,333
That's the name my friend
Mono would know me by.

487
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,250
Other times, I'll be
posting back and forth

488
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,583
on the forums with this
awesome indie game developer

489
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:46,666
known as Nobe.

490
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,125
In those cases,
I go by the name Yama.

491
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,500
[KAREN]
Just the two, then?

492
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,708
I assumed you might be
better at talking to people

493
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,416
when it isn't face-to-face.

494
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,125
[KEITA] 'Fraid not.
Thanks for the vote...

495
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,250
Is something wrong, Tasuku?

496
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,833
[TASUKU]
God, what a train-wreck.

497
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,166
It's just that Mono and
Nobe are special to me,

498
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,916
each in their own unique way.

499
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,333
It's almost like they get a part
of me that no one else does.

500
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,166
[TASUKU]
If I weren't face-palming,

501
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,625
I would see a girl who finally
bought herself a ticket

502
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,916
to Obvious-town
for the big parade,

503
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,750
only to miss the end
of it by five minutes.

504
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,333
Hoshinomori's heart
just stumbled

505
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,833
into a checkpoint unprepared,

506
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,291
and now she's eyeballing a
fight she can't hope to win.

507
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,250
That of the too-late soulmate.

508
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,208
So bored.

509
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,875
Isn't there anything
fun to do around here?

510
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,041
[gasps]

511
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,416
[KONOHA] What's wrong, Sis?
Why're you down there?

512
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,166
Yama.
