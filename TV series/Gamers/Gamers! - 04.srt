00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,458
[KAREN] For Otobuki High
School student Karen Tendo,

3
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:21,208
it's never too early to
get up and greet the day!

4
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,750
[laughs]

5
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,625
Another beautiful
morning out there!

6
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,250
[KAREN]
As soon as she's awake,


7
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,333
she begins her day
with a nice, brisk jog.


8
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,916
For girls like Karen Tendo,

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,625
mornings are a precious time
for self-improvement.

10
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:40,625
[WOMAN 4A]
Good morning!

11
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,875
Good morning to you, too!

12
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,541
[MAN 4A]
Show that trail who's boss!

13
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,708
Right back atcha, sir!

14
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,750
[KAREN] And so I, Karen Tendo,
begin another day of promise

15
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:53,083
and possibility by putting
my very best foot forward!

16
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,666
After I've worked out my body,
it's time to work out my mind.


17
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,250
The early-morning quiet is
the perfect time to get some


18
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,000
studying done, especially
for today's busy student.


19
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,250
[KAREN] A light breakfast,
and then I'm almost ready


20
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,750
to head out the door.


21
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,500
People don't know this about me,
but I don't really put

22
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,833
too much extra effort
into my appearance.

23
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,666
How someone looks
shouldn't matter.

24
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,833
It's your personality and your
heart that make you special.

25
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,041
Right!

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,416
[KAREN]
When I get to school,


27
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,375
the first thing I do is catch
up with all of my friends.


28
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,458
Karen! How ya doin'?

29
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,333
Good morning!

30
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,458
Great, and you?

31
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,916
[KAREN] My approach is to
give each of life's moments


32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,708
my full attention, and give
100% to whatever I do.


33
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,583
I hang out with friends
while we're on break,


34
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,958
but that's not all.


35
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,416
Hey, wait! Please let me
help you with that.

36
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,833
[KAREN] I also lend the
faculty a helping hand!

37
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,250
You're such a
responsible student!

38
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,416
[KAREN]
I don't have an ulterior motive.

39
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,708
In my opinion, you should help
out whenever you're able.

40
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:06,208
And with that, it's time for the
least favorite part of my day.

41
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,708
Heartbreak.


42
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,416
[REJECTED BRO 4A] Please say
that you'll go out with me!

43
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,708
[KAREN] I hate doing it, but if
someone's going to fall for me,

44
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,000
the least I can do is turn
them down face-to-face

45
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,333
and be clear about it.

46
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,833
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,083
[KAREN]
And I am.

48
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,333
My heart aches with
every rejection.

49
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,291
I don't like having
to hurt people.

50
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,291
After class, I head
to the game club.


51
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,041
Of which I'm secretly a
member and president.

52
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,833
We're small, but we're all
committed to honing our skills

53
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,958
until we're the very best
at what we play.

54
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,208
Some afternoons,
no one says anything.

55
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,125
The air is filled with
tension and resolve,

56
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,333
and I absolutely love it!

57
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,125
[KAREN]
When I get home,


58
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,666
I review the day's lessons,
and then I play a bit more


59
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,500
to make sure I'm up-to-date
on the other games out there.


60
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:57,541
Last but not least, I try and
get a full night's rest.


61
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,541
Good night, everyone.

62
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,833
[KAREN] Thus ends another
magnificent day in the life

63
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:07,208
of Karen Tendo, and tomorrow
will be even better!

[gasps] Whoa, what the heck?

68
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,833
Why was I having a dream about
Keita Amano, of all people?!

69
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,291
An' why was it such a sexy one?!

[gasps] I forgot to
do my homework!

is the perfect time to get some

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,708
[screams] Why did I
sleep in so late?!

76
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,291
[KAREN]
A light breakfast.

00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,916
Ah! Thanks for the grub!

[KAREN] And then, I'm almost
ready to head out the door.

79
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,291
People don't know this about me,

too much extra effort

How someone looks

It's your personality and your

further away from it.

Let me think...

00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,000
Like the first time I talked to
Amano and he dropped those games

150

and I helped him
pick 'em all up.

151
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,916
Or the time I got him
to visit the club room!

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,041
Remember? That was fun!

153
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,583
Or the time he turned me down.

154
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,000
Or how he totally caught me
stalking his classroom today.

about being the best player,

466
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,916
I support you guys all the way!

467
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,208
I get it.

468
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,791
[KEITA]
And me?

469
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,583
I guess I'm just wishy-washy.
I don't stick with a title long

470
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:44,083
enough, so I never learn how to
master the game like you do.

471
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,625
Honestly, you...

472
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,291
Just when I think I've
got you all figured out.

473
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,000
Uh. Sorry about that.

474
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,041
[KAREN] I meant it as
a compliment, dummy.

475
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,125
[KAREN] Okay! Today's
walk is officially done!

476
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,375
See ya later, Amano!

477
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:04,375
Okay. But, why'd you
wrap it up so quickly?

478
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,916
[KAREN]
Well, if you must know...

479
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,958
...there's a game back at home
that I'm dying to play!

480
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:47,958

481
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,708
Tendo. What the hell?

482
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:50,916
[KAREN groans]

483
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,583
You're worse! Like,
way worse than before!

484
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,083
What is this?! You were
finally getting good again,

485
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,375
but now you're playing
like a toddler

486
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,000
who's got the controller
in their mouth!

487
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,916
[KAREN] Every time
it starts getting fun,

488
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,833
my mind drifts to Amano's face,
and then I get all distracted!

489
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,166
[groans] It's his fault!

490
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,875
Everything is Amano's fault! Ah!
