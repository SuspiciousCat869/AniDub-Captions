1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,416
I'm sorry!


2
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,416
I guess I misunderstood why
you guys were holding hands!


3
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,416
Yeah. No kidding.


4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,583
[TASUKU]
Here I am.


5
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,333
Just hangin' out with
Hoshinomori again.


6
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,125
[CHIAKI]
Uh, are you all right?


7
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,416
You look kinda down.


8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,583
Don't worry about me.
I'm okay. Really.


9
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,291
Just thinking about
how the universe


10
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,958
has a messed-up sense of humor.


11
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:00,125
Huh. I think I get what
you're talking about!


12
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,250
Like how is Keita's
girlfriend so cute


13
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,791
when he looks like the
blandest NPC ever?


14
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,291
That is a weird one.


15
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,708
What does a hot chick like her
see in that nerd, anyway?


16
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,625
Why'd he rub my nose
in it out of nowhere?


17
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,041
The way he bragged about her,


18
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,208
like she was some kind of
achievement he'd unlocked!


19
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,291
It was so tacky!


20
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,958
The whole thing really
got me aggro'd!


21
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,750
Uh. What if he just meant
what an awesome friend she is?

22
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,291
Seriously, I've never seen a
guy brag about his girlfriend

23
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,500
so shamelessly
in my entire life.

24
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,000
[grunts]

25
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,250
You sure you're okay?
You really do look sick.

26
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,833
Nah, I'm good!
Never been better!

27
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,666
Let's talk about something else.

28
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,041
Okay.

29
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,416
Level with me.
Whaddya think of Amano?

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,750
If he was in a Cap[beep] game,

31
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,166
I'd hope he was a
helicopter pilot.

32
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,166
Nerdy and brutal. Wow.

33
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,166
[sighs] 'Kay. What do you
think about Tendo, then?

34
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,041
[gasps] Tendo?
That's kind of random.

35
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,833
I don't really know
how to answer that.

36
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,291
Like, she and I are in the same
class, but we don't ever talk.

37
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,083
I mean. It's no shock that we
run in different circles.

38
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,166
I'm a wallflower
compared to her.

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,666
[TASUKU] You and Amano even rag
on yourselves the same way.

40
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,666
That said, I do think
she's awesome.

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,875
We have gaming in common,

42
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,833
even though I didn't
want to join her club.

43
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,875
It would be neat if we could
be actual friends someday.

44
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,166
[TASUKU] Seriously, you
and Amano need to go out.

45
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,416
[CHIAKI]
Hm? Say what now?

46
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,083
Why on earth would I
want to go anywhere

47
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,750
with that <i>moe-</i> loving
philistine?

48
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,458
As long as we're talking about
Tendo, what about you, then?

49
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:33,041
I mean, like, what do you
think of her as a person?

50
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,833
[TASUKU] Hm? You wanna know
what I think of Tendo?

51
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,416
[CHIAKI]
Yeah. Mm-hm.

52
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,125
As far as I can tell,
she's perfect.

53
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,333
[CHIAKI gasps]

54
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,000
[TASUKU] Perfectly nuts
for Amano, that is.

55
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,416
I knew it.

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,708
You're interested in her,
just like every other guy.

57
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,041
Hey, c'mon, it's nothing
to get all pouty about.

58
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,625
Between your looks
and your personality,

59
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,541
you've really got
a lot going for ya.

60
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,458
Don't diss yourself.
You're a catch.

61
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,791
Thank you.

62
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:58,625
Wait!

63
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,416
Ah! [whimpering]

64
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,958
[TASUKU]
Uh. My bad!

65
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,500
I forgot that girls get all
weird about their hair and junk.

66
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,750
I gotta go!
Thank you for the soda!

67
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,416
Where ya going?!
Wait a second!

68
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,666
Check, please!

69
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,791
[WAITRESS 5A] Uh, sure,
I'll be right with you.

70
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,000
[KEITA]
He's totally cheating!

71
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,125
I mean, who knows what he
said before we got here,

72
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,291
but I heard the part where
he said Tendo was perfect!

73
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,625
And I heard the part where he
patted Chiaki on the head!

74
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,125
You're romancing too many
party members, Uehara!

75
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,166
Up, up, down, down, left,
right, left, right, B, A...

76
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,833
Cheat codes don't
work in real life!

77
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,875
[AGURI sighs] I knew seeing
it with my own eyes

78
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,416
would be tough, but, in
a way, it's almost easier.

79
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,333
I get it. Sometimes, you
just gotta see things

80
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,125
with your own eyes.

81
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,000
[CHILDREN laughing]

82
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,333
[BOY 6B]
Wait for me!

83
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:51,416
But my feelings for Tasuku
still haven't changed.

84
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,791
How do we solve this conundrum?

85
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,333
I literally don't know.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,500
That's enough of
my drama for now.

87
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,041
What about you, Amano?

88
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,833
Uh! What drama do I have?

89
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:07,375
[AGURI] It starts with a "T"
and ends with an "endou."

90
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,458
Are you even trying
to make it happen?

91
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,958
Back in the day, I used to be
all shy and meek like you,

92
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,875
but I applied myself, and voila!
Look how good I'm doing.

93
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,291
Your boyfriend's creeping around

94
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,083
like he's got
permadeath toggled on.

95
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,750
I don't think-- I take it
back! I take it back!

96
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,291
The point is, self-improvement
doesn't magically happen

97
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,958
on its own.
You have to work at it.

98
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,375
But in dating-sims, you can
trigger most of the flags

99
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,583
by min-maxing your stats.

100
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,000
I got bad news for ya.

101
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,083
Life isn't a video game, okay?

102
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,916
I'm aware of that.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,666
But, sometimes they hold
a mirror up to real-life,

104
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,708
illuminating truths
that would otherwi--

105
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,791
Shut up already.

106
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,833
Right. Shutting up.

107
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,458
Real-people relationships aren't

108
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,875
a thing you can
dump points into,

109
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,625
like there's some big friend
meter keeping score.

110
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,041
You can't just give 'em a turnip

111
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,833
at the turnip festival
or whatever.

112
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,750
I know what you think,
but in this world,

113
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,166
one plus one doesn't equal two.

114
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,583
Okay.

115
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,708
When it comes to the world
of real-live people,

116
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,791
it all equals love!

117
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:05,625
Huh?

118
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,458
That was a typo!

119
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,333
"One plus one equals love"?

120
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,916
You're darn right!

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,125
[KEITA]
I know which stat she min-maxed.

122
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,958
Okay, but before we can
get to the love-math part

123
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,125
of the equation, I think it'd
be best if she at least

124
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,333
saw me as a friend first,

125
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,083
or at least a fellow
carbon-based life-form.

126
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,125
Don't put yourself down!
Either way,

127
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,208
you have to talk to her, or you
aren't gonna make any progress.

128
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,541
But it's so daunting.

129
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,958
Maybe you could
tell me the story

130
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,375
of how you confessed
your feelings

131
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,708
to Uehara when the two of
you started going out!

132
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,791
[gasps] You really wanna
hear how Tasuku an' me

133
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,500
became a couple?! [giggles]

134
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,916
[KEITA]
Crap. What've I done?

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,041
[AGURI]
Are you ready?! I said,

136
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,916
"You wanna go out with me?"

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,958
Huh?

138
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,291
I asked, and Tasuku
told me yeah,

139
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,250
that it was cool with him,
so, that was that!

140
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,541
I heard through the grapevine
Tasuku liked girls who

141
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,375
kept things simple,
so that's what I did!

142
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,625
But even if I didn't know
that going into it,

143
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,083
I betcha it would have come out
of my mouth the same exact way.

144
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,208
You make it sound... easy.

145
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,958
Tsk, tsk, tsk! Shows what
you know, smart guy!

146
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,291
The feelings that feel simple
are the most honest ones

147
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,250
you've got! You don't have to
say 'em all clever-like!

148
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,500
That's why, if you really
wanna be friends with Tendo,

149
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,000
all you have to do is
open your mouth

150
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,500
and the right words
will come out.

151
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,958
'Cause it'll be what
you're feeling!

152
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,458
And that's always great!

153
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,166
[KEITA]
I guess, but can I really do it?

154
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,000
[AGURI]
Yeah! 'Course you can!

155
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,458
Ha, ha! I promise!

156
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,333
Maybe I'll walk right up to
Tendo tomorrow and try it.

157
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,541
Why not?

158
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,875
[gasps] Look at you,
being all super manly!

159
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,875
I'm gonna talk to Tendo!
Just you wait and see!

160
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,416
Attaboy!

161
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,541
And I give you my word that
I'm not gonna quit on Tasuku!

162
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,125
We can get the best ending!

163
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,375
Yeah! 'Cause we're
working as a team!

164
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,958
[BOTH laugh]

165
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,208
[KAREN] I'm sorry. I refuse to
beat around the bush about this.

166
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,916
I'm not interested in going out
with you, even a little.

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,875
Not a chance.
And starting off as friends

168
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,500
isn't gonna really
help you that much.

169
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,375
What does it mean,
when a guy talks about

170
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,000
being friends with a girl?

171
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,958
Hold up, is it the friendship
where you wait in the wings

172
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,250
because you think
you might actually

173
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,875
have a shot with me later on?

174
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,041
Even putting the ulterior
motive thing aside,

175
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,625
I don't find you all that
compelling as a person.

176
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,625
In conclusion, we're never
going to be an item, because--

177
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,041
What the...?

178
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,500
[REJECTED BRO 6A]
I get it, okay?

179
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,041
[gasps]

180
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,166
[EIICHI]
Breaking hearts, I assume?

181
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,583
[KAREN]
Maybe?

182
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,416
[KAREN] Giving someone's
love-confession a vague answer

183
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,333
is the worst thing in the world.

184
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,875
They end up with false hope
if you're too nice about it.

185
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,583
Better to just
nip it in the bud.

186
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,333
So you say. But I think
you can nip it in the bud

187
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,708
without using a guillotine.

188
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,916
What does that mean?!

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,583
I wasn't that brutal.

190
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,041
Honestly,

191
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:51,000
I think you sounded a little
like a monster down there.

192
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,791
Maybe it's because your
default answer is always a no,

193
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,666
your words hit harder
than you intend them to.

194
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,791
Turning down guys
is a habit, right?

195
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,666
What if it's making you
a creature of habit?

196
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,166
You're probably right.

197
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,708
No! Wait! I'm not trying to
make you feel bad about it!

198
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,333
That's not it at all!
I just mean,

199
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,666
maybe you should set aside all
the standard auto replies

200
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,041
and just speak from your heart
a little more often, you know?

201
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,291
From my heart?

202
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,791
Yeah. Like. You always
give me the impression

203
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,666
that you go through your
day wearing the perfect

204
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,666
Karen Tendo persona
like a suit of armor,

205
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,708
holding the world at bay.

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,541
[EIICHI] Even when you're
talking to your friends,

207
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,791
you always give us the
"perfect Tendo" replies first,

208
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,000
and figure out how you really
feel about things later.

209
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,291
If only you could
flip that around.

210
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,125
You're saying, I should lead
with how I actually feel

211
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,500
about stuff, and if it's too
real or raw or whatever,

212
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,458
I can always use poise
to fix it later?

213
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,750
That's the idea. I think
that sort of honesty

214
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,500
would serve you much
better in the end.

215
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,000
[KAREN]
Interesting.

216
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,333
And what you're
doing right now

217
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,041
certainly isn't working
on the Amano front,

218
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,000
so you might as well
take a crack at it.

219
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,083
What was that?

220
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,166
Huh? Nothing!
Just talking to myself!

221
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,416
Yeah, you're right.

222
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,833
I'm gonna meet life
with an open mind.

223
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,291
Stop rejecting
everything as reflex.

224
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,083
Speak from the heart for once,
speak from the heart for once,

225
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,708
speak from the heart for once,
speak from the heart for once.

226
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,833
From the heart. From the
heart. From the heart.

227
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,041
[DELINQUENT 6A chuckles]
Look at the body on this chick!


228
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,125
Whaddya say I show
you a good time?


229
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,583
[FLORA] I have no interest
in delinquents like you.


230
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,666
Let's be on our way now.


231
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,375
[DELINQUENT 6A] Dammit, this
bitch has got a mouth on her.


232
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,625
Just get over here already!


233
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,250
[FLORA screams]


234
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,583
[FLORA]
Keita, why?


235
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,208
[DELINQUENT 6A] Ran off with
his tail between his legs.


236
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,083
Let's bounce, baby. [chuckles]


237
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,833
[FLORA]
Keita...


238
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,208
[screams] This is my
10th play-through!

239
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:57,041
Why is it so impossible to get
the good ending with this one?!

240
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,208
[KEITA] And of course, it's the
girl who looks just like Tendo.

241
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,083
Maybe it's a sign that she
and I just aren't compatible.

242
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,583
[phone vibrates]

243
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,791
Uh?

244
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,833
[AGURI] Get some good
sleep tonight, Amano.

245
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,916
Tomorrow's a big day,
after all! Like, for reals.

246
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,041
I'd better not see you looking
like a zombie in the morning,

247
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,375
I mean it.

248
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,791
In other words, don't
stay up all night gaming!

249
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,541
That's an order!

250
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,500
[AGURI giggles]
Hey, I'm sorry.

251
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,750
Even you aren't that
big of a dummy, yeah?

252
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,041
Anyway, have a good night!

253
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,208
[KEITA]
I am that big of a dummy!

254
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,416
[TASUKU]
Hey, Amano.

255
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,041
So I heard about you
meeting up with Tendo

256
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,541
after school tomorrow.
I gotcha covered, dude.

257
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll round up an audience
for the big event.

258
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,583
You'll be the talk of the
school if you pull this off.

259
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,541
Seriously! I hope you're
ready for some mad respect.

260
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,958
'Course, you mess it up,
you're screwed. Lolz!

Don't you "lolz" me,
you jerk-face!

00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,458
Uh...

263
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,625
[KEITA] He really is going above
and beyond to help me out

264
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,125
with this, I probably
shouldn't snap at him.

265
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,541
[phone vibrates]

266
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,708
[KEITA] Ah, it's about the
in-game event tomorrow.

267
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,958
Mono must be pretty shy.
They never really say much.

268
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,458
[KEITA]
Aguri. Uehara.

269
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,875
Even you, Mono.

270
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,166
Thank you all.

271
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,250
I think I have a little
more fight left in me.

272
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,375
[FLORA]
Loading the checkpoint.

273
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,833
I wonder if I'm supposed
to be nice to every girl

274
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,208
in the game, not just the
one I'm trying to romance.

275
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,958
That's not generally how
dating sims work, but maybe...

276
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,708
[FLORA]
It's funny.


277
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,416
Ever since I first met
you 10 years ago...


278
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,708
[KEITA]
Huh? No way.


279
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,500
Did I pull it off?


280
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,250
[FLORA] I've been waiting to
hear you say those words to me!


281
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:01,416
I love you, Keita!
With all my heart!


282
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:08,375
[FLORA] You're kind to everyone!
That's why you're my hero!


283
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,750
At long last.

284
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,166
I finally won the game.
I get it.

285
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,041
When people are there for you,

286
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,666
you have to be there
for them right back.

287
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,708
No one succeeds by
going it alone!

288
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:25,166
I dedicate this victory to
Aguri, and Uehara, and Mono.

289
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,250
Thanks you guys!
You're the best!

290
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,916
Even if Tendo shoots me down
tomorrow, I'm already on

291
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,666
cloud 9 because our friendship
is so freakin' awesome!

292
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,583
[MASAYA] Tendo's coming to
our class to see Amano?!

293
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,750
[MIKA] Yeah! And you
know what's up, don'tcha!

294
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,916
[MIKA, MASAYA]
Tell us already!

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,250
How on earth would I know?

296
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,041
I mean, it's not like me
an' Tendo are super-close

297
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,708
or anything. I got nothing.

298
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,125
[TASUKU]
Oh, but I do!

299
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,458
I'm the one who spread
the rumor all over school.

300
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,666
Hell, I'm the one
who told Tendo!

301
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,916
Uh?

302
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,791
[TASUKU] Come on,
it's like I said before.

303
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,791
I'm tryin' to get you some
street-cred by popping

304
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,708
the friend question in front
of a bunch of people.

305
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,333
[KEITA] Yeah, okay. But that's
got nothing to do with

306
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,250
why I'm trying to get
close to her, y'know?

307
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,666
[TASUKU]
Wait, is he mad?

308
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,000
Look, I'm sorry.

309
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,333
I shouldn't've set this up
without asking you.

310
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,708
I'll cancel the whole
damn thing if you want.

311
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,125
Don't get me wrong.

312
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,250
I'm so grateful that you would
go to all this trouble

313
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,583
on my account,
but it just feels...

314
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,125
[sighs] I'm gonna level with ya.

315
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,750
The reason why I made
this a big deal was

316
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,458
to try an' do you a solid.

317
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,000
How you figure?

318
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,291
[growls]

319
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,250
What happens if it's not?

320
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,416
Metaphorically speaking,
let's say you and Tendo get all

321
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,958
buddy-buddy without making
it a big three-ring circus.

322
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,333
Other people are gonna see
you guys hanging together

323
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,750
and go into rumor overdrive.

324
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,916
Huh...

325
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,166
[TASUKU]
Get it?

326
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,958
Doing this in front of a
crowd might feel weird,

327
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,791
but it is gonna save you a ton
a grief in the long run.

328
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,666
Okay, then! They're all
gonna be teenagers,

329
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,791
meaning word'll spread around
pretty damn fast, am I right?

330
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,541
But where're we
gonna do it, huh?

331
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,708
What's your home turf
and full of teenagers?

332
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,500
Work with me here!

333
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,791
[screams] It's gotta
be in Class F!

334
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,125
Right after school lets out,

335
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,208
when nobody's left for
their clubs or teams yet!

336
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,166
That's the idea.

337
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,958
You're such a genius, Uehara!

338
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,875
I'm so sorry!
How could I doubt you?

339
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,083
[TASUKU laughs]

340
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,708
The base part of
this vector, AB...

341
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,375
[AGURI] Amano likes Tendo,
that's the first piece.

342
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,333
He thinks she's cute, of course.

343
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,083
Tendo doesn't like him
back, not like like.

344
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,833
But I'm pretty sure she doesn't
hate him or anything.

345
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,708
Him an' me are
teammates right now.

346
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,166
And I love my Tasuku a bunch!

347
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,041
Note, add more hearts.

348
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,708
But then there's
Tasuku and Tendo.

349
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,750
And maybe he likes her.

350
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,458
[AGURI whimpers]

351
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,666
[AGURI]
Don't cry, Aguri!

352
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,500
Dry those tears!
You've gotta be brave, okay?

353
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,833
I'm good!

354
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,833
Problem is with this girl,
down here.

355
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,458
Amano says they hate each other,

356
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,250
but I can tell they're
pretty close.

357
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,708
Is there any "like liking"
going on with those two?

358
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,041
She definitely likes Tasuku.

359
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,708
She changed her look for him.

360
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,375
And Tasuku.

361
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,833
He...

362
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,166
[AGURI]
All right. Here it goes.

363
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,125
[screams] How can
this be happening?!

364
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,333
I used to be all shy and
plain like Hoshinomori,

365
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,625
so why's he like her?!
I don't get it!

366
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,125
Ooh! An idea!

367
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,416
[AGURI] Amano's friend-request
thing after school today!

368
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,750
I'll figure out Tasuku's
real feelings then!

369
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,250
[AGURI]
Mm-hm!

370
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,791
[CHIAKI] Keita's talking
to Tendo after school?

371
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,625
How come? Wait a sec.

372
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,166
Isn't he going out

373
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,666
with that pink-haired girl,
Aguri, he was bragging about?

374
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,125
Now that I think of it,

375
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,541
I'm pretty sure I've heard folks
say that she and Uehara

376
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,916
are an item, so where
does that leave Keita?

377
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,333
[gasps] What if he loves her?

378
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,958
But it's all tragic
and unrequited,

379
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,583
so she feels nothing
for him in return?

380
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,958
Yes, of course!

381
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,166
Keita's stuck in a one-sided
sham of a relationship!

382
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,375
There's no way
he'd turn to Tendo

383
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,125
if he were truly happy
with Aguri, right?

384
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,625
So, what's her game, huh?

385
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,833
What if Aguri's just
in it for the money?

386
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,791
I bet she drags him
to cafes and shops

387
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,541
and makes him pay
for everything!

388
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,916
She's walking all over Keita

389
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,666
like he's a dance-pad
controller!

390
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,875
He's a <i>moe-</i> loving bastard,

391
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,541
but I can't abandon a
fellow gamer in a crisis!

392
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,791
[TASUKU] Sure, lying to
Amano is a crap move,

393
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,500
but he's not getting that
crowd later for his sake!

394
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,958
I did it for me!

395
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,833
Aguri's gonna show up
to watch the Tendo thing

396
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,375
'cause she's
a girl, blah-blah.

397
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,041
And that's when the full genius
of my plan comes into play!

398
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,083
Check it!

399
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,083
I'll be there,
hiding in the crowd,

400
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,166
to watch her watch
the Tendo thing!

401
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,166
[TASUKU laughs]

402
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,291
[TASUKU] Aguri will never
suspect anyone's looking at her

403
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,541
while the main event's going on,

404
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,500
so she'll drop whatever
game-face she's got on!

405
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,875
If she and Amano
are just friends,

406
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,916
she'll be happy to see him

407
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,500
getting buddy-buddy
with Tendo, too.

408
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,250
Nothing to be jealous
of there, right?

409
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,791
However!

410
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,250
If Aguri looks disappointed or
weird or anything like that,

411
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,708
then I have my answer!

412
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,416
She's cheating on me!

413
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
With... Amano!

414
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,666
[TASUKU laughs]

415
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,083
[AGURI] Okay, if Tasuku
like likes Tendo,

416
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,333
he's gonna feel all
weird about her

417
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,041
becoming friends
with Amano, right?

418
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,875
Yeah, and I betcha it'll
show on his face,

419
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,458
'cause he thinks nobody's
payin' attention to him!

420
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,000
But, what if he isn't
watching Tendo and Amano?!

421
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,041
What if he's got his
eye on Hoshinomori?

422
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,083
If Hoshinomori and Tasuku
both look weird,

423
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,250
it's 'cause she likes Amano,
and Tasuku likes her!

424
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,875
[AGURI laughing]

425
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,458
[CHIAKI]
That's it!

426
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,583
Keita isn't going to all this
trouble for a friend request!

427
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,250
He's reaching out
to Tendo for help!

428
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,458
He's not brave enough to
escape his fake girlfriend!

429
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,833
Oh, the humanity!

430
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,583
Don't you worry! 'Cause
I've got your back, bro!

431
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,875
I'll go to Class F.

432
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,750
I'll watch it happen
with my own eyes,

433
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,000
and I'll figure out what game

434
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,625
that little she-devil
is running on you!

435
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,333
[laughs]

436
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,708
[TASUKU]
Whoa, time-out!

437
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,083
If Aguri really is hooking
up with Amano on the sly,

438
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:14,083
then this whole Amano-Tendo
thing is just a huge misdirect!

439
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,291
What if, when I spy on Aguri,
she's making some weird face

440
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,375
at me, her dumb,
cheated-on boyfriend?

441
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,666
It's like the tea-bagging
after the headshot!

442
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,083
No!

443
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,791
Yeah. Like things are gonna get

444
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,083
anywhere near that
awkward for me today.

445
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,083
[laughs]

446
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,833
[AGURI gasps] But what
if Tasuku looks at me

447
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,500
to see if I'm looking at him
when this whole thing

448
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,666
goes down? Yikes.

449
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,166
Checking on your poor girlfriend

450
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,583
when she hasn't done anything
wrong in the first place!

451
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,416
You'd have to be the
cheating-est cheater ever

452
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000
to do something like that!

453
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:50,000
Hey, no way Tasuku could be that
much of a jerk, so no problem!

454
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,000
Man! When did I get so clever,

455
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,750
thinking of all these
possibilities?!

456
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,083
I'm even surprising
myself with this stuff!

457
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,625
[CHIAKI] Okay, self!
Here's another scenario!

458
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,041
What if Aguri and Uehara look
at each other strange

459
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,750
during the Keita-Tendo thing?

460
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,333
If the two of them are an item,
they're gonna freak out

461
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,750
when he asks to be
friends with Tendo,

462
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,625
'cause they'll see it as
the cry for help it really is!

463
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,375
[CHIAKI hyperventilating]

464
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,500
[CHIAKI] But, that's enough doom
and gloom without any proof.

465
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,291
I mean, things couldn't
get that horrible, right?

466
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,375
[TASUKU]
For better or worse...

467
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,791
[AGURI
...The Tendo thing in Class F...

468
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,541
[CHIAKI] ...will drag the
truth into the light!

469
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,041
[ALL laughing]

470
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,166
[CHIAKI laughs]

471
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,541
[gasps]

472
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,583
[KAREN] Ah! It still
doesn't make any sense!

473
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,958
What's so important that Amano
needs to see me after school?

474
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,000
Honestly, all I can think of
is that he wants to tell me

475
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,291
our friendship is over!

476
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,375
[sighs]

477
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,791
[KAREN]
Can I blame the guy?

478
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,916
He just wants to
play games in peace.

479
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,375
Having anything to do with me is
one gigantic pain in the butt,

480
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,375
I'm sure of it!

481
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,500
Amano's super-shy,
you big dummy!

482
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,791
Pestering him's a great
way to scare him off,

483
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,791
and that's what you did!

484
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,208
I can't overthink things!

485
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,666
Even if he rejects you!

486
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,125
Even if you're marching into
a room full of heartbreak!

487
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,541
You face it with dignity!

488
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,750
You're a class act, and that's
what they're gonna get!

489
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,250
[bell rings]

490
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,583
[ALL]
It's go time!

491
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,166
[KAREN]
It's simple.


492
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,250
I'll prepare myself
for the worst.


493
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,375
And whatever he says,


494
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,166
I'll respond to it
openly and honestly.


495
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,041
Okay.


496
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,083
It's his idea, so he goes first.


497
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,708
But, I'm not heading
into this all defensive.


498
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,958
I'm gonna meet life with an open
mind, starting here and now.


499
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,666
All I have to do is
look him in the eye


500
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,166
and say what I'm feeling.


501
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,291
Easy, right?


502
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,708
[exhales] Okay!

503
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:46,750
Excuse me!

504
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,583
Is Amano around here anywhere?

505
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,916
[KEITA]
She showed up!

506
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,083
And now I have to do this
in front of everyone!

507
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,333
Hey! Over here.

508
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,250
[TASUKU]
Good luck, dude!

509
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,500
Uh. Uehara.

510
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,541
[KEITA]
And Aguri!

511
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,041
Chiaki, too!

512
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,166
Everyone's here, rooting for me.

513
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,208
So, what's up?

514
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,875
[inhales, exhales]


515
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,625
So good to see you, Tendo.


516
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,333
I'm glad you could stop by.


517
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,666
I heard that you
wanted to meet here.


518
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,333
So, Amano, what exactly did you
wanna speak to me about?


519
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,833
Yeah, about that.


520
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,708
I guess this encounter
is turn-based.


521
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,041
I'm no good at
this kind of thing.

522
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,458
Really, what I'm about to
say doesn't come easy.

523
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,250
Huh? What's the matter?!

524
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,125
Stop. Let's not draw this out.

525
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,916
Just say your piece, Amano.
I think I'm ready for it.

526
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,125
[KEITA]
Uh. Okay.

527
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,875
[KEITA]
"Think I'm ready for it"?

528
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,333
Man, it's just a friend request!

529
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,041
[KEITA]
Oh! Oh, crap!

530
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,166
She's about to shoot me down!

531
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,625
Hey, uh. Is something
the matter?

532
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,750
Ah! Nope! I'm fine. Really.

533
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,791
[KEITA]
What?!

534
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,375
Everyone's watching, but Uehara
can't even bear to look at me!

535
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,666
[gasps]

536
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,208
I'm... still right here.

537
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,250
[KEITA]
I get it. They know.

538
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,125
They know I'm gonna
crash and burn,

539
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,791
and don't want to see
the moment of impact!

540
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,000
All right. Even if Tendo
wants nothing to do with me,

541
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,041
I'm going to come
out of this okay.

542
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,166
I'll take comfort in
the friends I do have!

543
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,708
[exhales, inhales]

544
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:31,166
[KEITA]
Tendo. Would you...?

545
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,541
[TASUKU screams]

546
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,291
[TASUKU] Aguri's making
a guilty-ass face,

547
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,208
and she's totally staring at me!

548
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,916
Which means, she's 100%
hooking up with Amano

549
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,250
and knows this is all a charade,

550
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,250
so she's scoping
out my reaction!

551
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,750
Son-of-a-bitch!

552
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,541
[KEITA]
Tendo. Would you...?

553
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,458
[AGURI screams]

554
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,708
[AGURI]
Tasuku's staring at me

555
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,708
and he's got this crazy
guilty look on his face!

556
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,666
That means my boyfriend's been a
cheating cheater the whole time!

557
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,875
And now he's gonna cheat on
Tendo with Hoshinomori!

558
00:22:58,958 --> 00:22:59,958
Or the reverse!

559
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,375
Or cheat on all of us
with all of us!

560
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,625
I don't even know anymore!

561
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,666
[KEITA]
Tendo. Would you...?

562
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,708
[CHIAKI screams]

563
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,500
[CHIAKI] Uehara and Aguri
are staring at each other,

564
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,458
and their faces are so full
of guilt, it's ridiculous!

565
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,041
Which means the two
of them are an item!

566
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,625
Which means her and
Keita are a sham!

567
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,416
Which means they're freaking
out right now about

568
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
whatever's about to come
out of Keita's mouth!

569
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,500
[KEITA]
Tendo. Would you...?

570
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,625
[KAREN] Remember, Karen,
be in the moment.

571
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:24,875
You're fine.

572
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,000
There's no need to be
on the defensive, right?

573
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,041
You're not here to shoot
down some random guy

574
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,291
who sent you a note.

575
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,958
You don't need a reply
waiting up your sleeve.

576
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,916
Even if he rejects me,
I'm going to be an open book.

577
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,125
Whatever he says,
I'll be honest.

578
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:43,125
I owe that kind of honesty to
Amano, and I owe it to myself.

579
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,291
[KEITA]
Tendo. Would you...?

580
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,541
[KEITA]
As those words left my mouth,

581
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,333
I thought of everything
that had happened

582
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:54,666
since she first said hello, that
fateful day in the game store.

583
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,333
[KEITA] Would you like
to go out with me?


584
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:01,000
Uh-huh! I would love to!

585
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,666
Oh. My bad. That came out
a little different than I--

586
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,916
[STUDENTS]
What?!
