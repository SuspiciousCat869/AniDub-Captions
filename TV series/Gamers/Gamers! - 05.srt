[TASUKU]
Dammit, Aguri.

00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,208
Where the hell did you
run off to with Amano?

7
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,666
[CHIAKI]
Hey, uh...

8
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,000
I was hoping that we could
talk about game development

9
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,583
a little bit,
if that's all right?

10
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,083
It might be a nice way to pass
the time while we walk around.

11
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,250
Sure. Go crazy.

12
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,625
Wait. Are you developing a game?

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,791
I guess you could say that!

14
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,750
[sighs] Don'tcha think
you'd be better off

15
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,750
having a conversation
like that with Amano?

16
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,708
[grunts]

17
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,208
[TASUKU]
You hate him that much?

18
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,125
Who, Keita? Let's just
say that if he were

19
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,666
in first place in
a go kart race,

20
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,333
I'd gladly crush him with a
flying blue shell of doom.

21
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:06,250
[TASUKU] That's a really
detailed diss for not caring.

22
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,333
--[phone vibrates]
--Uh! Oh, sorry,

23
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,916
I got a message! This'll
just take me a second!

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,125
I can totally see you
playing a mobile game

25
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,541
over your shoulder, y'know.

26
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,833
Well?

27
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,875
Uh! I didn't think the raid
would take this long!

28
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,916
Sorry! Just one more minute!

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,291
You are so just
Amano in a skirt.

30
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,833
[TASUKU]
"Mono," huh?

31
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,875
Weird nickname.

32
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:36,166
Hm... Seems familiar.
Where have I heard it?

33
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,833
Uh! Hold on!

34
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,083
Don't tell me Mono's your
handle in that phone game!

35
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,833
Yeah, does it matter?

36
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:43,875
I know I'm gonna regret this,

37
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:44,750
but why is your
username "Tsucchie"?

38
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,958
Well, whenever I'm online.

39
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,458
I like to use a name
other than my own...

40
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,750
My mom's maiden
name is Tsuchiyama,

41
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,625
so I shortened it down.
Oh, I also go by Yama...

42
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,583
[TASUKU]
It's a pretty lame back-story.

43
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,125
Hey, that's my mom!

44
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,166
--[gasps]

Uh. My bad!

48
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,583
I just noticed that other
username, Tsucchie.

49
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,916
I wonder what they're
all about, you know?

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,083
Couldn't tell ya. All I know
is, I've been good friends

51
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,041
with Tsucchi ever since
I started playing.

52
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,958
I feel like the whole thing
is kinda like a mystery!

53
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,083
I mean, I know we've never
hung out in real-life,

54
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,250
but, I feel pretty close
to them, nonetheless.

55
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,625
Word-for-word what I thought.

56
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,708
[gasps] What's up with you?

57
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,750
[inhales]

58
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:33,083
[TASUKU] How can two people
be so friggin' star-crossed?!

[AGURI screams]

60
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,875
Man down!

61
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,583
Huh?! What're you
talking about?

62
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,708
Level with me!

63
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,375
How do you really
feel about Amano?!

64
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,458
I hate him even more than
DLC that's cut from

65
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,208
the original game
as an easy cash-grab.

66
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,250
[TASUKU]
That's some serious hate.

67
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,166
[TASUKU]
So, I just wanna make sure.

68
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,208
It's not, "I hate the guy, but
I'm secretly in love with him?"

69
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,500
Not even a little.

70
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,916
I'd rather bite off
my own tongue

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,041
than have to talk that
loser about anything.

72
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,333
Wow. Graphic.

73
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,708
[sighs] Hey, I meant
to ask you before.

74
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,916
Why'd you pick Mono
as a screen-name?

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,833
Huh? Oh, you mean my
handle in the game?

76
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,666
I thought it'd be
a nice gesture.

77
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,833
Uh? "Gesture"?

78
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,166
Yup! My mother's maiden
name is Mononobe,

79
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,291
so I shortened it down
for a nickname.

80
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,333
I like to use a name other
than my own whenever

81
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,166
I'm online, to give
it some distance.

82
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,833
Oh, and I use the
name Nobe, too,

83
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,791
especially if I'm talking
about the games I make.

84
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,791
It's nice having a public
face for that sort of thing.

85
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,708
[TASUKU] Do you hear the words
coming out of your mouth?!

86
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,500
I just can't with you geeks!

87
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,125
I'm good. Sorry, folks.

88
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,708
Uehara. What has
gotten into you?

89
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,375
[TASUKU]
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

90
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,833
So, then. Game development.

91
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,541
That's what you wanted
to talk about, right?

92
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,166
Oh. I forgot.

93
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,583
It's just... I'm trying to
figure out which direction

94
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,958
I should take my
next video game,

95
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,208
in terms of the gaming
scene, I mean...

96
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,791
[TASUKU] Seriously,
how the hell are you two

97
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,708
not madly in love
with each other?

98
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,208
The fact that you and
him aren't a thing

99
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,000
makes me wanna
punch a wall!

100
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:09,250
[sighs] I dunno. But I'm still
rooting for Tendo, too.

101
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,958
Where the hell did Amano go
with my girlfriend, anyway?

102
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,208
[exhales] If only
there was an easy way

103
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,583
to give this slow-burn romance
a swift kick in the ass,

104
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,000
but they don't even
talk to each other.

105
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,666
[TASUKU gasping]

106
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,791
Uh!

107
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:24,916
[TASUKU]
I'm a genius.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,333
You don't look so good.

109
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,166
[TASUKU] All I could do was
stand there and tremble

110
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,166
at the thought of my solution.
It was perfect. Like, really.

111
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,416
Genius level perfect.

112
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,500
[TASUKU laughing]

113
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,041
[KEITA, CHIAKI]
We're having a meet-up?

114
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:43,958
That's right!

115
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,375
We're gonna talk about gaming.

116
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,000
It's gonna rock, you guys.
Let's make some noise!

117
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:48,875
[KEITA, CHIAKI]
Woo...

118
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,041
Work with me here!

119
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,375
Look, you both love video games

120
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,625
more than what's probably
healthy for a person.

121
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,666
However, you're not feeling the
vibe over at the game club.

122
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,541
That's the case for both of you.

123
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,875
[KEITA, CHIAKI]
So?

124
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,958
Both of you need a club
without all the club crap

125
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,041
that goes with it. Behold.

126
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,916
The creation of a brand-new
organization meant just for you!

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,208
Here in this room,
we three shall usher in

128
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,041
a new era of game appreciation!

129
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,000
[KEITA, CHIAKI]
Oh. Oh!

130
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,291
[TASUKU]
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

131
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,500
[KEITA] Um. That's great,
except for one thing.

132
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,416
I agree.

133
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,333
[TASUKU]
Which is?

134
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,041
—I don't wanna do it
—I don't wanna do it

135
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,375
--if she's gonna be here!
--if he's gonna be here!

136
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,250
[TASUKU] Why are
they so stubborn?!

137
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,666
[CHIAKI, KEITA growl]

138
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,666
[sighs] If you can't be
around each other,

139
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,083
I gotta respect that.

140
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,958
It's a shame you're gonna
miss out on everything

141
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,708
the meet-up has to offer
you guys, though.

142
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,041
Check it. A big part
of this was gonna be

143
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,500
getting to argue
about video games.

144
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,541
--Whoa!
--Argue?

145
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,833
[TASUKU]
Hook, line, and sinker.

146
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,833
[TASUKU] Well, yeah.
Beating someone you hate over

147
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,875
the head with your
opinions is tons of fun.

148
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,458
But, hey, if you guys
aren't feeling it.

149
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,041
[BOTH]
I guess I could stay.

150
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,041
[TASUKU] And sha-bam!
I'm like Cupid-level good.

151
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,041
You two should just
get married now.

152
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,500
[KEITA]
Uh. Wait.

153
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,708
Isn't a three-person
meet-up kind of lame?

154
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,916
[CHIAKI] I agree. Not with him,
but with the concept.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,625
[TASUKU]
Chill. We might have a fourth,

156
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,375
but she's... kinda on
the fence about it.

157
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,041
Sorry I'm arriving
a little late.

158
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,250
Yeah. I had to talk to
one of my teachers.

159
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,833
Wait! It's Tendo?!

160
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,375
I'm just glad ya made it.

161
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,000
Glad to be here! I'm flattered
I got an invitation

162
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,666
to your meet-up
to begin with.

163
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,541
The game club keeps me very
busy, but I'll see what I--

164
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,500
[KEITA]
Something... wrong?

165
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,250
[TASUKU]
Earth to Tendo.

166
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:43,375
Uh, ah, yeah! I didn't know you
were going to be at the meet-up,

167
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,583
too, Hoshinomori.
Small world, ain't it?

168
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,125
Yeah! Sure is!

169
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,416
But, I hope this isn't weird

170
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,958
with my having turned
you down and all.

171
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,208
Uh, same here. I didn't say
no to make you feel bad.

172
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,500
Nah. It's fine. But, I do
have one question.

173
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,541
[KEITA, CHIAKI]
Mm?

174
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,083
Tell the truth.

175
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,416
Are you... both sitting here
because the other one came, too?

176
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,416
Don't spare me. I can take it.

177
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,291
[TASUKU]
Uh? She really thinks these two

178
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,833
are hot for each other?
She couldn't be more wrong.

179
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:10,666
That's right.

180
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,875
You called it.

181
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,041
[KAREN whimpers]

182
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,583
[TASUKU]
What are you doing?!

183
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,166
[KAREN]
Um, never mind.

184
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,083
I don't think the gamers meet-up
is a good fit for me, after all.

185
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,000
[TASUKU] Uh. Crap! I need
to get Tendo in on this!

186
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,083
Watching her drool over Amano
while he and his she-clone

187
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,208
are busy hating each
other is comedy gold!

188
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,958
Plus, it keeps him away from
Aguri, not that I'm worried!

189
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,458
Hey, let's not be hasty!

190
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,708
How 'bout you give it a try

191
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,750
and you can decide later
if it's your thing, huh?

192
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,000
[laughs]

193
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,833
[KAREN] Uh, sure. I mean,
I'm already here.

194
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,416
I don't recall you being so
hands-on with people before.

195
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,458
--Is that a new thing?
--Yeah, I guess!

196
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,833
So. What're we talking
about today?

197
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,583
Hoshinomori's trying
to get her head around

198
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,416
her next game
design project.

199
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,291
[KEITA, KAREN]
Huh?

200
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,416
[KEITA]
Oh, wow.

201
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,000
You make games, huh? How cute.

202
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,708
[TASUKU]
Dude. She makes those

203
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,625
weird games you're
always raving about.

204
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,250
[KEITA, CHIAKI]
Hmph.

205
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,750
Those two are always like that.
It's kind of a thing.

206
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,333
Oh, they don't like
each other? Shame.

207
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:12,000
[TASUKU] Anyway. What part of
it were you hung up on, again?

208
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,541
Right. Here I go.

209
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,833
It's like, I don't
trust my instincts.

210
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,500
I used to. I would just
charge ahead and make

211
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,291
whatever kind of game suited
my fancy at the time.

212
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,791
But when I do that...

213
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,625
[TASUKU]
People think they suck, right?

214
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,208
My games are way more
popular when I play it safe

215
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,166
and give the user-base
what they desire.

216
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,333
I've done it before,
but when I do...

217
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,916
[TASUKU]
Then you think they suck.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,125
Anybody?

219
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,333
[KAREN]
That's a tough one.

220
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,125
What do you have
to say about it?

221
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,416
Uh?

222
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,958
I really don't have
an opinion either way.

223
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,000
--Uh?
--Huh?

224
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,958
What the...?
And the truth comes out!

225
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,458
You don't give a damn
about my games! Do you!

226
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,458
Well, yeah. But I don't
think I said it right.

227
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,583
Wow. Ruthless, Amano.

228
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,166
Think about it, though.

229
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,541
All that matters in the end is
whether the game's what you want

230
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,458
it to be. It's not my call.

231
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,166
Okay. Way to get
yourself outta that one.

232
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,625
Wait! Seriously?

233
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,375
You mean, you don't
hold game developers

234
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,666
to any sort of standard
with their final product?

235
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,250
No. I guess not.

236
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,666

[KEITA]
It's fine.

239
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,208
Make whatever game
you wanna make.

240
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,333
You can't control whether
it's gonna be a hit or not,

241
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,375
but it's gonna reflect what's
inside of you, no matter what.

242
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,583
[gasps]

243
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,125
[KEITA] I mean,
you could follow your muse

244
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,291
and end up with a masterpiece.

245
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,750
Or, you could slap together
something trophy and derivative

246
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:41,208
and still have it end up
being a lot of fun to play.

247
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,291
My muse...

248
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,291
Uh. Yeah!

249
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,791
I don't even know if
that makes any sense!

250
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,250
But, it's like, there's this
indie game developer

251
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,041
whose stuff I totally love.

252
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,250
You can tell they
give it their all.

253
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,958
There's so much humanity and
care present in every detail.

254
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,833
That's why, no matter
what a designer intends,

255
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,375
popularity-wise,
whatever they come up with

256
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,375
is going to be true
to that person's heart.

257
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,625
Wow. Well said.

258
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,125
That was a beautiful
answer, Amano.

259
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,541
In general, I really
don't care either way

about whatever crap
Chiaki shovels out.

You're a monster!

Hoshinomori and him

in the first place.

how to talk to you, okay,

on her 'cause she's a girl.

You an' Tendo were hangin'
out at the arcade, right?

464
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,000
Wait, we hung out?!

465
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,625
You are so dumb.

466
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,958
[KEITA]
Yeah! Maybe.

467
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,083
But we were competing,
so it doesn't count!

468
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,791
Sorry, man. I know it's like
the end of an era for you

469
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,375
or whatever, but you're friends
with some real-life girls now.

470
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,125
So it's time to pony up, got it?

471
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,416
[KEITA]
Are you sure Tendo's my friend?

472
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,750
[KEITA] Doubtful. What if
she's just buttering me up

473
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,875
to get in good with
her true target, Uehara?

474
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,291
You hung out.

475
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,041
That's like 90% of what
friends do, you lame brain.

476
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:08,250
[sighs] Maybe that's true for
most people, but this is Tendo.

477
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,458
Look, I'm fully aware
she's stupid hot,

478
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,875
but she's a human being
like the rest of us.

479
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,125
Yeah, I get it, but I'm
so beneath her notice,

480
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,916
it doesn't make any sense to me.

481
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,250
Get over it, man.

482
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,583
Maybe you weren't on her radar

483
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,333
so much before you
dissed her club,

484
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,666
but now you've been
working that social link.

485
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,500
If she hates you that bad, why'd
she go on a walk with you?

486
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,416
It was a fluke that
she bumped into me!

487
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,750
She probably only asked
to be polite, y'know?

488
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,583
[TASUKU]
Polite?

489
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,625
Ah, what the hell!

490
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,833
It's odd. They're
my relationships,

491
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,916
but in a way,
you're more invested

492
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,750
in my success or
failure than I am.

493
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,291
Well, that's what
friends are for.

494
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,750
You're way too good to me!

495
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,958
I mean that!

496
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,791
[sobs] Thanks for taking
me under your wing!

497
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,166
My life just hasn't been the
same since I met you, Uehara.

498
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,666
How about you save those
lines for the ladies?

499
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,500
[TASUKU, KEITA]
Uh?

500
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,000
Uh, hey guys! You know what?

501
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,500
I have somewhere less
awkward to be! So!

502
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:10,250
I'm just gonna go there, and...
I swear I didn't see anything!

503
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,500
[TASUKU, KEITA]
Mm?

504
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,875
[TASUKU]
Hm?

505
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,666
Aw, FML! Meet-up's
cancelled. See ya later!

506
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,458
Hey, come back!
It's not what it looks like!

507
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,875
We were just talkin'
about dude stuff!

508
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,250
What?! Wait,
why'd they run away?

509
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,458
I need to call Aguri
on the double!

510
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:30,666
This sucks! I don't
get any of this!
