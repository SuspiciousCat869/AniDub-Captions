00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,583
[AGURI]
So you want me to be part

2
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,291
of your gamer meet-up thing?

3
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,250
That's right.

4
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,750
But I don't really play games.
Wouldn't that be weird?

5
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,291
That doesn't matter to us.

6
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,416
As long as you have
a love for the genre.

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah. I'm pretty "whatever"
about 'em, you know?

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,375
As long as you love someone
who has a love for the genre!

9
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,500
Get it?

10
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,041
Awesome! Then I can
join the meet-up!

11
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,541
And I'm always looking
for more chances

12
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,458
for me and Tasuku
to hang out together.

13
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,000
But I don't wanna be
that annoying girlfriend

14
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,791
who never gives
her guy any space.

15
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,083
[grumbles]

16
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,625
Uh, not that it matters,

17
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,833
but I've invited Tendo
to join, as well.

18
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,625
[gasps]

19
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,125
So Tendo's gonna be there?

20
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,041
I don't care either
way, of course!

21
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,625
Tendo's always been a
gamer, so it makes sense.

22
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,916
Nothing weird about that at all!

23
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:22,166
I'm loving this dessert!
It is so good!

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,458
[KEITA]
How about seconds, then?

25
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,833
You mean it? Yay!

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,291
If you promise me you'll
come to the meet-up,

27
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:30,708
this is all yours.

28
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,791
Fine, then! I promise I'll go.
Now gimme that plate!

29
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:37,833
Well, if that's the case,
sounds like we've got a deal!

30
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,208
[KEITA]
Eat up, Aguri.

31
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:46,583
At least that torte will
never betray your affections.

32
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,208
I mean, Tasuku
did confess his love

33
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,500
to another girl
behind your back.

34
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:55,625
If you wanna double-down
on dessert, you do you!

35
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,541
[KEITA]
Okay.

36
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm still confused by all this,
but congratulations, Chiaki.

37
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,000
The guy you have a crush on
told you that he likes you back.

38
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:42,166
You've gotta be on
cloud nine, right?

39
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,041
Hm? Why the long face?

40
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,166
Uh, I guess... I'm just shocked.

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,250
Yeah.

42
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,333
The fact I like a boy
and he likes me,

43
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,458
that's pretty
incredible, isn't it?

44
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,125
This is awesome.

45
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,916
As if!

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,416
I'd turn this guy down
without a second thought,

47
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,416
and you should, too!

48
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,291
Yeah, the two of you
may like each other,

49
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,416
but isn't he already spoken for
in the girlfriend department?

50
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,041
He'd better not come
sniffing after you, Sis.

51
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,291
I'll punch his cheating face!

52
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,041
[KEITA]
She's right!

53
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,416
If Chiaki and Uehara end up
together because of this,

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,916
how am I supposed to look poor
Aguri in the face again?

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,291
Okay!

56
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,791
Let's send this player to
the burn ward, you guys!

57
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,375
Um, I don't know if I can.

58
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,250
This is all kinda new to me.

59
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,208
I've never rejected
someone before.

60
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,125
[KEITA gasps]

61
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,666
We could get some
advice from a girl

62
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,333
who's rejected dozens of guys!

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,708
[KAREN]
Uh, hey, Amano! What's up?

64
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,875
Hey, Tendo.

65
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,333
I'm sorry to call
you up like this,

66
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,375
but I need to know how
to reject someone's

67
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,958
romantic advances on the double!

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,500
[KAREN]
What?

69
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,458
Rejecting someone is tough,
and I have no idea how to do it.

70
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,375
I could use some advice!

71
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,875
[KAREN] Uh, is-is this just
a hypothetical question,

72
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,833
or a real-life problem?

73
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,041
Real-life! It's
happening right now!

74
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,083
[KAREN]
No! I can't!

Wha--?!

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,666
Please, I beg of you!

77
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,791
I don't know who else
to turn to with this!

78
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:07,791
And if it's going to happen,

79
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,416
I could really use
your help, okay?

80
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,708
[KAREN]
If it's going to happen?

81
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,250
You blindside me
with this phone call,

82
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,833
and you're not sure either way?

83
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,125
I shouldn't have said if!

84
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,458
It's definitely going to happen,

85
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,041
but I'm hoping we
can do it right!

86
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,875
[KAREN] I can't believe you're
asking me to help! It's cruel!

87
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,666
Just because I turn people down
a lot, it doesn't mean that--

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,291
[KAREN crying]

89
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,833
What's going on?
Say something, Tendo!

90
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,708
Out of nowhere, it sounded like
you got majorly punched-out!

91
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,458
[KAREN] If by "majorly
punched-out" you mean

92
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,458
"took a brutal uppercut
in the final round,"

93
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,583
then basically, yeah!

00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,041

What?

97
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,708
Why would you bother
coming over to help me

98
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,416
if you were going to--?

99
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,041
I'd never let you suffer!

100
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,583
What guy wouldn't run to his
beloved girlfriend's rescue?

Beloved?

Are you still there?

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,416
[KAREN]
The Eagle has landed.

105
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
What does that even mean?

106
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,666
[KAREN] Sorry for freaking
out on you before.

107
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,875
I'm okay now.

00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,458
No. I'm excellent!

109
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,500
I still don't get the thing
you said about the eagle!

I don't think I'll ever know
how I got a girlfriend

who's so adorable.

[KONOHA] How's that supposed
to help my sister, huh?!

118
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,291
Sorry about that. Had a
bit of mission creep.

What about you? I'm sure you've
dealt with it before, right?

Dealt with what, loser?

121
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,083
Y'know, turning people down

122
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,000
when they confess
their feelings to you.

123
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,541
You're cute.

124

So I'm sure that sort of thing
happens to you all the time.

Well, when I turn them down,

127
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,166
I usually give 'em the ol'
"I'm flattered that you like me,

128

but I don't have time for
that stuff right now."

Yeah! "No time"!

Hentai games keep you busy--?

Whatever do you mean?

133
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,458
Hentai games keep you busy,
but they're not helpful now.

[KONOHA clears throat]

Well, when I tell
people I'm too busy,

139
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,333
I'm not exactly lying.

140
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,416
My student council president
duties eat up at lot of my time.

You're a different story.

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,750
Fair enough.

00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,791
But I do spend a lot of time
working on my games,

144

so that's an excuse.

Oh yeah, right.

00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,291

in freeware game design

a little bit too.

sister! Oh, yeah!

Yes! The two of us just
love programming!

That's cool, but could you
maybe sit back down again?

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,458
It's embarrassing.

and all the other girls

who are involved in this whole
situation, I guess there's...

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,083
...there's only one
way to get this

156

Here's what we're gonna do!

We're gonna drag Tendo and Aguri
to the next gamers meet-up,

159
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,083
and we're not leaving that room

160
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,166
until all of us are
on the same page!

161
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,583
[KEITA]
Achievement unlocked!

162
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,291
[TASUKU]
Hey, Amano--

163
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,708
Everybody, thank you
for taking the time

164
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,333
to come to the meet up.

165
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,750
I appreciate you clearing
your schedules for this.

166
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:21,000
You're here because I need to
discuss something with you.

167
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,416
It's a topic of the
utmost importance.

168
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,125
Hey, Amano. Where're
you going with this?

169
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,625
[AGURI] I've never seen your
serious-business face before.

170
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,875
Whatever the meeting's about,
it's gotta be a bombshell.

171
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,083
It is. And it couldn't wait.

172
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:38,208
Not even one more day.
We need to talk about...

173
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,958
[KEITA]
To talk...

174
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,958
...about how as a group...

175
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,708
...none of you even
know how fast

176
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,875
I'm gonna buy <i>Space</i>
<i>Ocean 5</i> tomorrow!

177
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,750
[TASUKU, KAREN, AGURI]
That's your big reveal?

178
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,166
What the heck?

179
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,750
I thought you were gonna talk
about the Uehara thing!

180
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,333
I'm sorry!

181
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,125
Seeing everyone staring at me
really stressed me out, okay?

182
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,291
So what are you
going on about?

183
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,500
<i>Space Ocean</i> doesn't
ring any bells.

184
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,000
Actually, it's an RPG.

185
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,416
Even more specifically,
it's the fifth installment

186
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,791
in my absolute favorite
game franchise.

187
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,333
I was gonna run over
to the game store

188
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,958
as soon as class lets out
tomorrow to buy the new one.

189
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,583
You're correct about <i>5</i>
hitting the shelves tomorrow.

190
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,500
As a fellow fan, I'm
buying a copy myself.

191
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,041
You preordered, right?

192
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,541
Well, of course I did.

193
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,166
That's what I'd be saying

194
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,458
if this were any other <i>Space</i>
<i>Ocean</i> game coming out.

195
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,875
But I guess I forgot

196
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,666
'cause a lot's been
going on this summer.

197
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,333
[OTHERS]
Yeah, no joke.

198
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,041
[CHIAKI] Buying it after
school without a preorder

199
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,041
is gonna be tough.

200
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,708
There's no guarantee.

201
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,208
[KAREN] Maybe they'll have
a copy, if you're lucky.

202
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,875
You know, like if
someone cancels.

203
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,500
Right. I know the odds,
but I'm going to try anyway.

204
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,500
I swear to you, I will not rest
until I've bought that game.

205
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,291
In that case, you better be
ready to haul ass outta here

206
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,375
when the bell rings.

207
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,166
[KEITA]
Yup! That's the plan, at least.

208
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,458
Even though it's the fifth one,

209
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,500
you're still bonkers
for the game that much?

210
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,500
[KEITA] Totally. It's
really important to me.

211
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,625
As long as they keep
making them, I'm on board.

212
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,583
I've played a couple <i>Space</i>
<i>Ocean</i> games over the years,

213
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,000
but I don't understand
getting that obsessed.

214
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,416
It might sound weird to say,

215
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,541
but the original one
was sort of a first.

216
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,875
Not like the very first video
game I played, or anything.

217
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,333
But it was the first game where
the plot and the characters

218
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,708
really touched my heart.

219
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,708
It sounds like me with cats!

220
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,625
[KEITA] And the follow-up
title almost felt like

221
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,750
it had been programmed
with me in mind.

222
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,250
I'd played a lot more
famous RPGs by then,

223
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,458
but that one
really hit the spot.

224
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,166
All the elements came
together in a way

225
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,541
that left me feeling breathless!

226
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,333
I know it's silly,
but I almost feel like

227
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,750
I was born to be a <i>Space</i>
<i>Ocean</i> completionist!

228
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,000
[TASUKU, KAREN, AGURI]
Cool.

229
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,250
[KEITA] That's why I feel
like such a dunce

230
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,750
for not remembering to preorder.

231
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,375
But the collector in me can't
bear to just download it.

232
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,166
I promise you, I will buy a copy

233
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,166
of <i>Space Ocean 5</i>
on disc tomorrow!

234
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,750
Even if this quest
should end me,

235
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,958
I will die victorious and
ascend to gaming Valhalla!

236
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,083
I don't think you're gonna
croak along the way.

237
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,333
But I'll be crossing my
fingers for ya, buddy.

238
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,958
[KEITA]
Thanks! I'll take it!

239
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,666
Whatever happens at
that store tomorrow,

240
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,958
I'll give it my best shot
and make you all proud!

241
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:08,416
[AGURI] Yay! Attaboy, Amano!
Break a leg! Woohoo!

242
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,625
[knocking]

243
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,708
[KONOHA]
Hey, Sis?

244
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,750
Yeah?

245
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,625
Why're you sitting
in a dark room?

246
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,000
Uh! What the heck?

247
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,333
Ah. Sorry for the mess.

248
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,833
I was digging through
my old games

249
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,000
and they ended up everywhere.

250
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,583
Yeah? How come?

251
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,875
I was looking for my
<i>Space Ocean 2</i> disc.

252
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,208
I forgot about it,
but it's really good.

253
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,291
Wanna give it a try, Konoha?

254
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,875
[KONOHA]
Nah, I'll pass.

255
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,416
So how was the big showdown?

256
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,541
Must've worked out if you're
pulling out old RPGs.

257
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,666
It was a flop.

258
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,916
Keita chickened out
at the last second,

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,500
so we're not any closer
to clearing things up

260
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,000
than we were before.

261
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,166
It ended up being nothing
but a gigantic waste of time.

262
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,208
[KONOHA chuckles]

263
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,750
I thought he'd wuss out.

264
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,333
But you can't be too mad.

265
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,708
You're part of why
stuff is so confusing.

266
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,291
You even roped me into it.

267
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,041
[CHIAKI]
I'm really sorry about that.

268
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,375
For what it's worth,
you're being a big help.

269
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,500
So... something you
wanna talk about?

270
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,166
I'm just gonna say it.

271
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,166
I dunno where
you're coming from.

272
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,708
I figured I'd try and find out.

273
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,958
"Coming from"?
What does that mean?

274
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,125
Yeah, like you don't know.

275
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,791
[giggles]

276
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,458
[CHIAKI]
Here's what I do know.

277
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,916
Keita has a girlfriend already,
and they seem pretty happy, so--

278
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
[sighs]

279
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,791
Aw, jeez.

280
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,708
Can you at least figure out what
you want outta this whole mess?

281
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,041
It'd help a lot.

282
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,250
Like, come on,

283
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,958
I'm the one who's
stuck having to pretend

284
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,750
to be Nobe and Mono
whenever I see him.

285
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,750
Yeah. I guess you're right.

286
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,791
Do you wanna get closer?

287
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,291
If you do, there's nothing
wrong with that, y'know.

288
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,583
Maybe you just wanna keep
fighting with him all the time?

289
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:01,166
Or maybe you want the
guy outta your hair.

290
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,750
[gasps]

291
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,750
Hey, c'mon!

292
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,125
It's not like you need to
figure out all this stuff

293
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,958
right here and now!

294
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,125
Okay. I'm calling
it a night, Sis.

295
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,041
I hope you get some rest.

296
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,250
And I'm sorry for
bringing it up.

297
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,541
No. It wasn't a problem.

298
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,291
See ya in the morning.

299
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,625
[CHIAKI]
She called it.

300
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:38,958
When it comes to Keita,
I... I don't know what I want.

301
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,791
[KEITA]
All right then, Uehara, I'm off!

302
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,333
[TASUKU]
Make it happen.

303
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,291
Honestly, his love
of video games

304
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,708
makes the rest of us
look like slackers.

305
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,625
Well, in that case,
I guess I'm outta here, too.

306
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,208
[TASUKU] So long as Amano and
Tendo are in happy-couple mode,

307
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,291
I'm the only one who's
got Hoshinomori's back!

308
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,375
I need to make sure she
realizes what team I'm on!

309
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,333
An' with Aguri busy,
this is perfect timing!

310
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,625
Okay, then.

311
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,458
Uh! What are you doing here?

312
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,833
Hey, how's it going?

313
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,416
I was hoping we could
talk for a bit.

314
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,000
Talk? Yeah, all right!

315
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,208
But I have to warn you, I still
don't have an answer either way!

316
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,750
It really took me
by surprise, Uehara!

317
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,250
I'm not ready to break
any hearts over this, okay?

[TASUKU]
I get it.

320
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,916
She's still figuring out
how she feels about Amano.

321
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,166
She's not sure either way

322
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,708
if it's worth hurting
Tendo to steal her dude.

323
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,416
Makes sense.

Hey, I get it.

My bad, Hoshinomori.
I'm not tryin' to rush ya.

326
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,166
Don't apologize!

327
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,083
Anyone in your position would
wanna know how I feel!

328
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,291
I'm just sorry to make you wait!

What's up, you guys?

330
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,041
I'm not sure what
I'm interrupting here,

331
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,250
but it looked sufficiently done,
so, whatevs, I'm going for it.

332
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,666
That's cool, I guess.

333
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,250
The thing I was talking
about sorta hit a dead end.

334
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,666
Actually, I'm having a bit
of a dilemma right now,

335
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,083
and I was hoping that
maybe you could help me.

[AGURI] This is a trap.
And I fell for it!

339
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,166
Check it out! This was her
back in middle school.

340
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,500
Pretty blah, am I right?

Hey, stop!

Crazy what a bit of hair
dye can do for ya, huh?

the old version, too!

Why'd you invite these
random guys along?

347
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,958
You know I have
a boyfriend, Sarina.

348
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,125
So do I. But I don't see
what that's got to do with it.

Wow. For real?

[JERKFACE A]
Hey, Aguri! Tell me somethin'.

00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,416
I heard you went to some
gamers meet-up thing!

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,875
So what if I did?
Why do you care?

[AGURI]
What do you mean?

359
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,666
A thing like that's gotta be

360
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,041
a wall-to-wall nerd

I cannot believe
you just said that!

doin' it to a real chick

and not some, like,
elf or whatever!

You know what?

I'd rather hang out with
the nerdiest one of them

than deal with you meanies

We invite you along, and
that's the crap you pull?

Then how come you copped
such an attitude back there?

If we're making fun of guys who
aren't even your boyfriend,

why do you give a crap?

You don't know them.

game-loving nerd

with more consoles than friends,

on some rando, huh?

all bent out of shape about?

Go on. I think
we're both curious!

I hope it's not awkward
I brought this to you.

Lately I feel like I've been
kind of... kind of... off.

For lack of a better
way to put it.

413
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,583
I mean, ever since I started
going out with Amano,

414
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,208
my skin has been softer
than a baby's buttcheeks!

Everything I eat is way more
delicious than it should be!

to hang out every
day after school.

But he ran off to buy
that game today.

miss him is all,

with Aguri after class lets out.

Well, I wouldn't lose any sleep

over the time he
spends with Aguri.

She even told me she
only thinks of the dude

429
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,041
as a high-maintenance kid

Oh, wow. What a relief.

Amano without his games?

He'd be a disaster.

I don't think you
should be jealous

435
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,208
of the time he spends gaming.

436
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,583
'Cause I think it's part of
what makes Keita who he is.

He acts like a wimp,
but he can be stubborn, too.

438
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,291
Sometimes he puts
gaming front and center

439
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,750
when he should try to level
up a bit more in real life,

440
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,083
but it's not a bad thing.

441
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,875
It's part of why you like him.

him with video games.

have it any other way.

used to think I was cute!

but it kinda feels like you're
bustin' my chops right now!

468
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,500
[KAREN, CHIAKI] Nobody asked
for your opinion, cheater!

469
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,708
[screaming]

470
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,166
My boyfriend's being
called a cheater

471
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,291
by the girls he's
cheating on me with!

472
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:50,125
Save me, Amano! Save me!

473
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,291
I'm sorry.

474
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,500
I guess I kinda got
carried away, didn't I?

475
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,958
It's okay. Really.

476
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,416
It was just a
misunderstanding.

477
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,291
That's right!

478
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,791
Hello?

479
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,166
I'm the dude who just got
slandered by the three of you

480
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,375
at the top of your lungs.

481
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,500
[CHIAKI, KAREN growl]

482
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh, yeah!

483
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,000
I called Amano back when I
thought everything was horrible.

484
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,166
False alarm.

485
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,416
I wouldn't worry.

486
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,125
He probably hasn't even
checked his cellphone.

487
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,791
This is the afternoon
he dedicated

488
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,416
to finding <i>Space Ocean</i> .

489
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,958
Yeah. Nothin's gonna
get in the way of that.

490
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,458
Right. Guess I forgot!

491
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,500
[chuckles]

492
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,041
[KEITA]
Aguri!

493
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,208
[CHIAKI]
Huh?

494
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,875
Hey! Look who's here!

495
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,541
Huh? Wait a sec!

496
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,333
What about your message?

497
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,000
You were crying and
yelling about Uehara.

498
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,750
I thought you guys
had broken up.

499
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,500
Oh. About that...

500
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:46,583
Well, it's funny,
really. Kinda-sorta...

501
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,750
Don't tell me it was
just a false alarm.

502
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,125
You're right!
Everything is fine!

503
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,583
Wow, seriously?

504
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,333
Ugh! This is what I get for
trying to be considerate!

505
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,291
[AGURI] I'm super-duper
sorry. Forgive me!

506
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,583
[KEITA groans]

507
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,583
I've got a question.
How come you're even here?

508
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,708
How come?

509
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,333
Well, you know why.

510
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,625
Aguri called and it sounded
like she was in trouble,

511
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,208
so I rushed over ASAP.

512
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:16,333
But you were out trying to buy
your favorite video game ever.

513
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,083
That? As soon as I got
her message, I gave up.

514
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,916
This was more important
than some RPG.

515
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,125
[AGURI laughs]

516
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,666
You're all sweaty from
running over here!

517
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,250
Maybe those jerks at the café
were right about you, nerd!

518
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,708
Who are you calling
a nerd, you lunatic?

519
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,666
The only reason I'm here
is because somebody

520
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,000
totally cried wolf about having
broken up with her boyfriend!

521
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,416
[AGURI giggles]

522
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,083
[AGURI]
You're such a dummy, Amano!

523
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,583
I never mentioned a wolf!

524
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,875
I thought Tasuku was being
a snake, but that's different!

525
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,958
[KEITA]
It's an idiom!
