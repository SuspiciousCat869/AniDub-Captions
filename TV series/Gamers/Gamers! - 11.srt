1
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:32,875
[AGURI giggles]

2
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,458
You're silly, Amano!
I never mentioned a wolf!

3
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,625
I thought Tasuku was being a
snake, but that's different!

4
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,791
[KEITA]
It's an idiom!

5
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,208
[TASUKU] Clearly she's
depressed as all hell.

6
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,875
I'm just gonna mind
my own business.

7
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,000
[KAREN]
Uehara. What's up?

8
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,583
You seem like you're
wound kinda tight today.

9
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,208
What's with that nervous look?

10
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,375
Hey, can you even
blame me for that?

11
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm surprised, that's all.

12
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,500
You always used to strike me
as a pretty cool customer.

13
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,833
Usually, yeah.

14
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,666
But I know how intense you
can get outta nowhere,

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,208
so it puts me on edge.

16
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm not that bad.

17
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,416
Even Amano seems
to be calming down

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,250
and having more fun when we
hang out together lately.

19
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,583
He does? Pretty weird, huh?

20
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,083
I bet it's Aguri's influence
rubbing off on him.

21
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,208
I get what you're saying

22
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,541
because I feel like
she's been acting

23
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,875
more grown up as well lately.

24
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,416
[BOTH sigh]

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,208
Do you think that's Amano's
influence rubbing off on her?

26
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,708
Probably.

27
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,500
The little guy does have a way
of getting into your head,

28
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,083
as much as I hate to admit it.

29
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,625
Oh. I know.

30
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,000
And when you get close
to someone like that...

31
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:53,458
...your true self might
start emerging as a result.

32
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,000
[TASUKU] I guess Aguri's one
step closer to adulthood

33
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,958
thanks to Amano
spending time with her.

34
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,250
[KAREN] And Amano's that
much more of a person

35
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,875
thanks to all those
afternoons spent with Aguri.

36
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,833
[BOTH] Could they be any
more perfect of a couple?!

37
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,916
[KAREN]
Just for the record,

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,583
I don't think those
two cinnamon rolls

39
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,583
are sneaking around behind our
backs or anything like that.

40
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,583
Yeah. I know.

41
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,333
[TASUKU] Neither of them would
ever be cool with cheating

42
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,166
on the person they're dating.

43
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,166
They're not wired for deception.

44
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,333
But still...

45
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,541
Here it is.

46
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,583
I don't know if he and
I have anything more

47
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,041
than what Aguri has
with him as a friend.

48
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,750
Maybe he's meant to be her
boyfriend instead of being mine.

49
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,708
[TASUKU]
Screw that.

50
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm not giving up yet!
We can turn this thing around!

51
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,500
[gasps]

52
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,875
How so?

53
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,916
They might be cinnamon rolls,
but I bet you and me

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,500
can get up to some pretty
top-tier scheming if we try!

55
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,958
Huh? What are you talking about?

56
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,125
I gotta know more, Uehara!

57
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,041
[TASUKU]
Uh, you mean like right now?

58
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,500
But aren't we standing
in front of your house?

59
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,083
[KAREN] I don't care where
the hell I'm standing!

60
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,833
Tell me how we're gonna
save our relationships!

61
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,083
I wanna know more!

62
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,875
Uh. Okay, here's what I think.

63
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,500
Follow me here.

64
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,958
When your relationship status
gets all vague and junk,

65
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,500
what's the absolute
sure-fire method

66
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,041
to get stuff figured out again?

67
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,708
There is a way!

68
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,833
Well? Spit it out!

69
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,833
You show the world
that you're a couple.

70
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,041
And you show them!

71
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,208
[gasps]

72
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,750
Check it out.

73
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,416
If Aguri and Amano can
see how happy the other is

74
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,416
in their current relationship.

75
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,250
[KAREN]
Show them...

76
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,291
You okay?

77
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,791
Show them you're a couple!

78
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:18,166
[laughing]

79
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,166
[TASUKU]
How come I'm in cahoots

80
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,375
with Hoshinomori's
romantic rival?

81
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:27,458
[KAREN laughing]

82
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,541
[KEITA]
Huh?!

83
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,666
You wanna go on a double date?

84
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,208
[KAREN]
Yeah! What do you think?

85
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,416
Uh, what do you think about it?

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,625
You sound pretty hyped.

87
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,708
[KAREN] We can invite Uehara
and Aguri to come along,

88
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:42,041
and then we can go on some grand
adventure, just the four of us.

89
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,250
When you put it that way,

90
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,875
I guess it sounds like our gamer
meet-up at school, but...

91
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,541
But what?

92
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,375
Double dates are just so...

93
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,833
I mean, isn't it
weird to hang out

94
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,208
with another couple like that?

95
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,333
It almost feels
like we're trying

96
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,375
to prove something to the world.

97
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,041
[KAREN]
Prove something? As if!

98
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,500
Seriously.

99
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,291
We can try going out with
them if you really want to,

100
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,208
but I think I would be too
embarrassed to have any fun.

101
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,500
[KAREN] Well, I'm a
little nervous myself.

102
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,750
I've never done this sort
of thing before, so...

103
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,708
It does seem kinda
new-game-plus

104
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,666
compared to a typical
single-couple date.

105
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,166
That's exactly what it is!

106
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,750
What if the first boss
fight we encounter

107
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,541
wipes the floor with us
'cause we're underleveled?

108
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,083
It could happen!

109
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,083
[KAREN] I don't think we're
going to hit any boss fights.

110
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,125
Okay.

111
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,833
Just so I know where we're at,

112
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:29,708
are you absolutely opposed to
the idea of going out with them?

113
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,625
[KEITA]
I want to make Tendo happy.

114
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,541
That's what a good
boyfriend does.

115
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,500
But a man's gotta stick
to his guns, right?

116
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,791
[KAREN] I just thought
it would a fun idea...

117
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,875
Of course I'll go on a
double date with you, Tendo!

118
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,291
Four hearts are better than two!

119
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,333
[KAREN]
You mean it? Oh, thank you!

120
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,916
Okay, we'll meet
up at the station

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,166
this Sunday at ten
in the morning,

122
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,791
so don't stay up
late tomorrow night.

123
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,583
And don't worry about tickets
into the theme park.

124
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,500
My parents know somebody
who can get us some.

125
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,958
Just make sure to
bring enough money

126
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,208
for food and transportation,
and you'll be fine.

127
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,208
They have an evening
parade this time of year,

128
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,958
so we'll be getting
home pretty late.

129
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,958
Make sure you let
your parents know.

130
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,708
Maybe you should be
writing this down.

131
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,791
But it's all pretty
cut-and-dried, I think.

132
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,375
Sounds like
everything's covered.

133
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,708
Glad to hear it!

134
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,166
Then I'll see you bright
and early Sunday morning.

135
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,708
Sweet dreams tonight, Amano.

136
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,750
Uh, yeah, right.
Sweet dreams to you, too.

137
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:24,791
[beeping]

138
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,166
[BOTH] Spiel Kingdom,
in all its "whatever" glory!

139
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,250
[KAREN laughs]

140
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,500
[KAREN]
It's just like that crappy town

141
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,416
halfway through the game
that only has one quest!

142
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,625
[KEITA]
Yeah!

143
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,166
That town where the
vendors sell junk items

144
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,125
you stopped picking
up hours ago!

145
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,208
I don't get why they're
so hyped about this place,

146
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,541
it seems kinda lame.

147
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,166
Yeah.

148
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,875
Well, if you're a super fan of
the RPG they based this town on

149
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,166
and replicated here,
you'd be in gamer's heaven.

150
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,750
[BOTH]
Uh-huh!

151
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,333
[KAREN] Look at those gnomes!
They're just perfectly hideous!

152
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,583
[KEITA] I don't think I've ever
felt halfway through a game

153
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,500
more than I do in
this very moment!

154
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,125
Hey, uh, you play
games like this,

155
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,541
how come you aren't nerding out?

156
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,250
Because even for a
gamer like myself,

157
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,875
that level of spaz
gives me the creeps.

158
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,458
That's a relief.

159
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,208
I was worried that this place
was awesome and I didn't get it.

160
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,416
You're good. They're
nuts, that's all.

161
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,791
Wow!

162
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,625
This cheap, real-world look
is something to cherish!

163
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,916
These days, VR has
become all the rage.

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,083
Most folks would just program
something this blah!

165
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,458
Yeah, you said it!

166
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,375
Uh! Look at that statue!

167
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,208
It's dinged up, but not
too dinged up, y'know?

168
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,375
[AGURI]
Please, Tasuku!

169
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,791
We've only been
here five minutes

170
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,958
and I already wanna ditch 'em
the first chance we get!

171
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,333
Try to stay calm, Aguri.

172
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,125
For what it's worth,
I'm right there with ya.

173
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,166
[KEITA, KAREN] You guys aren't
having an argument, are you?

174
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,750
[TASUKU, AGURI] No, but if we
were, it'd be all your fault!

175
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,416
[KAREN]
So far, so good, right?

176
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,583
[TASUKU]
Yeah.

177
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,666
What's your take on
the situation, huh?

178
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,166
They're up there,
and we're back here.

179
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,541
I just don't know
about this double date.

180
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,916
How does Tasuku even
dream this stuff up? Crazy.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,916
[KEITA]
Oh, gosh!

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,250
You don't really
know a restaurant

183
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,416
till you've seen
their breakfast menu!

184
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,916
You seem pretty upbeat
about this whole mess.

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,500
[KEITA]
Yeah, I am! Wanna know why?

186
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,875
Tell me why.

187
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,625
Because my girlfriend
and your boyfriend

188
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,916
decided for everybody that
we're all gonna go on a date

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,375
in front of each other!

190
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,750
There's nothing left for me
to get stressed out about!

191
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,333
It's game over, man! Game over!

192
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,250
[laughing]

193
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,583
It doesn't count
as being upbeat

194
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,333
if you're really just having
a nervous breakdown

195
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,958
and slapping a smiley
face on the front!

196
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,250
Uh, y'know, I like
this place and all,

197
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,041
but Tendo's really
excited to be here.

198
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,583
You don't think that
this double date...

199
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,291
...is camouflage...

200
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,416
[BOTH] ...to cover up the fact
that they're cheating on us!

201
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,333
[KAREN]
Uehara.

202
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,458
It's high time we begin
the charm offensive!

203
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,750
[TASUKU]
Copy that.

204
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,083
You an' me gotta
roll up our sleeves

205
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,625
and win some hearts here.

206
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,166
Whaddya think?

207
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,041
Maybe hold their hand first
to get that feels-train rollin'?

208
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,625
[KONOHA] Oh my gosh!
Fancy running into you guys!

209
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,916
[KEITA]
What the--? Is that Konoha?

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,583
What's going on, Konoha?

211
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,833
Tell me you didn't plan this!

212
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,458
[CHIAKI] Tomorrow, huh?
Isn't that sort of last-minute?

213
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,583
You don't have
weekend plans, anyway.

214
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,625
What the heck?

215
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,875
You know I spend
most of my off-time

216
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,416
getting my games up to snuff.

217
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,625
You shouldn't just assume
I've got nothing going on.

218
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,875
Think of it as practice

219
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,750
for when you go there
on a date with Amano.

220
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,125
[gasps] A date?

221
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,791
Who says that's even in
the realm of possibility?

222
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,125
Well, I've got
these free tickets,

223
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,958
but I don't wanna waste 'em.

224
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,875
But going sounds
like a lotta work.

225
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,250
I have so much to do on my game.

226
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,625
C'mon, are you going,
or wussing out?

227
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,666
Well, I'm not ready right now.

228
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,166
Plus, all things
considered, he's taken.

229
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,458
Keita has Tendo, so
what's the point anyway?

230
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,083
[KONOHA sighs]

231
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,458
Real-talk, Sis.

232
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,125
You gotta stop putting your
own feelings dead last.

233
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,666
Keita's feelings for online-you
are gonna fade away

234
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,750
while you're busy trying
to get your act together.

235
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,791
[grunts]

236
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,000
[giggles]

237
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,458
That's okay!

238
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,125
If you really wanna stay home,

239
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,125
maybe I'll see if Keita
wants to go with me!

240
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,958
Yeah, that's a great idea!

241
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,041
Have fun with your
code and stuff!

242
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,166
[CHIAKI]
I'll go.

243
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,083
Sorry, what was that?

244
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,333
[CHIAKI]
I'll go to the amusement park!

245
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,833
I'll be your plus-one!

246
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,333
Even though it's a pretend date,
wear your cutest clothes!

247
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,791
Good night!

248
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,125
My cutest clothes?

249
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,666
[KAREN] I don't care where
the hell I'm standing!

250
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,416
Tell me how we're gonna
save our relationships!

251
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,791
I wanna know more!

252
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,000
[KONOHA] I couldn't hear
what they were being

253
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,833
all sneaky about,
but there's no way

254
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,833
they're leaving Sis in the dust!

255
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,041
Not while I've
got these puppies!

256
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,083
I'm Chiaki's sister, Konoha!

257
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,416
[TASUKU]
Okay, so you're the sister.

258
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,708
[KONOHA]
Hey now, that is close enough!

259
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,750
I don't go for ugly older dudes!

260
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,625
[TASUKU]
Ugly older dudes?

261
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,708
[TASUKU groaning]

262
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,083
What are the odds we'd
all be here on the same day?

263
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,125
[KONOHA gasps]

264
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,500
Yeah, that's pretty
coincidental!

265
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,000
Wouldn't you agree, Sis?

266
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:17,916
You know what, though?

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,333
Isn't it a little rude to hold

268
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,041
an official gamers
meet up activity

269
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,625
without one of your most
important members present?

270
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,375
Just sayin'.

271
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,041
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

272
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,458
We didn't mean to make you
feel left out, I promise.

273
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,333
It's just that we-- We're
actually double dating, so...

274
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,708
Ah! So the four of you
came here on a double date!

275
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,041
I can't imagine doing
something so public myself.

276
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,041
How brave of you!

277
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,750
Um, what if we hung out
in one big group

278
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,750
so the two of you could
get to know each other?

279
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,708
[KAREN, KONOHA]
The hermit is giving us advice?

280
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,958
[KEITA]
K.O.!

281
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,125
[snickers]

282
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,458
[KONOHA] Why do they let
you spin 'em that fast?

283
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,833
Are you okay?

284
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,541
Yeah! Never better! I mean it!

285
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,291
Don't worry about me!

286
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,500
[laughing]

287
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,166
Let's do this next, guys!

288
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,416
Yeah. It's Spiel Kingdom's
most famous attraction.

289
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,500
The Kizuna Dungeon.

290
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,833
Whoa! They really
nailed the atmosphere!

291
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:48,875
[AGURI] I love it! Creepy stuff
like this is right up my alley!

292
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,958
Something wrong?

293
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,166
Oh! I'm fine!
Nothing to worry about!

294
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,791
Okay.

295
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,666
[TASUKU] C'mon, Tendo. You
can't throw in the towel yet!

296
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,875
[KAREN]
Yeah, you're right.

297
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,583
There's still time
to turn this around!

298
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,333
[KONOHA laughs]

299
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:11,083
Hurry up! The Kizuna
Dungeon awaits!

300
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,500
[VOICE A]
Lockie the Hero?

301
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,833
I wouldn't expect to find
you in a place like this!

302
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,708
Oh, wow. It's really
detailed, huh!

303
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,458
Yeah, they pulled out all
the stops for this one.

304
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,833
[VOICE A] The traps in here
might annoy you, but trust me.

305
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,791
Try not to get too
steamed about them!

306
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,750
[AGURI screams]

307
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,166
[VOICE A] Shocking what
you'll find stuck in a wall!

308
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,875
[KEITA wheezes]

309
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,750
[VOICE A] A bunch of the
Evil King's minions

310
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,500
are waiting somewhere up ahead!

311
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,416
[KAREN screams]

312
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,958
Tendo, are you okay?

313
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,833
Yeah, I am now.

314
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,500
[VOICE A]
The inky darkness awaits you!

315
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,541
Step forth with that
special someone,

316
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,916
and let the strength of
your bond carry the day!

317
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,666
Chiaki. Are you
sure you're okay?

318
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,125
Well, wanna give it a shot?

319
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,458
Yeah!

320
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,791
Then, I guess it's our turn.

321
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,625
Shall we, Amano?

322
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,625
[KAREN]
Amano?

323
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,166
[KONOHA]
Ah!

324
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,625
Yay! There we go!
Nice fresh air!

325
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,875
What's the big idea?

326
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,583
I was about to go
in there with Tendo!

327
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,833
Oh, I'm sorry!

328
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,791
You looked a little
green around the gills.

329
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,583
Yeah, thanks for that.

330
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,333
You're not looking so
good yourself, Chiaki.

331
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,666
Hey, what's the matter?

332
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,541
I'm fine, okay?
Stop worrying about me.

333
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,291
I'm just a little
dizzy. That's all.

334
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,541
She fainted!

335
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,458
[KONOHA]
Oh no, Sis!

336
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,041
I'm glad you're finally awake.

337
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,416
You wanna move your head?
My leg's asleep.

338
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,458
Oh. Sorry about that, Konoha.

339
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,250
I really am fine now.

340
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,458
Are you really okay?

341
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,416
What are you doing back there?!

342
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Amano's actually the one who
carried you over here, Sis.

343
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,750
Uh! Like carried me carried me?

344
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,083
You're stronger than you look.

345
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,375
Though I guess you couldn't
be much weaker, huh?

346
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,875
[KEITA grumbles]

347
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,833
You still look pale,
so take it easy for a bit.

348
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,250
I'm pale all the time,
not just now!

349
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,041
[snickers]

350
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,250
[KONOHA]
Well, then!

351
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,041
I'm going to go buy us some
drinks! You two hang tight!

352
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,750
[BOTH]
Huh?

353
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,625
Oh, I'd be happy to get them.

354
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,666
[KONOHA] No chance, Amano!
You wait here with my sister.

355
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,708
Just in case she needs
carrying again, okay?

356
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,125
All right.

357
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,000
Stop staring at me!
It makes me uncomfortable!

358
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,500
Oh, sorry.

359
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,875
[CHIAKI sighs]

360
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,166
I--

361
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,416
[phone buzzing]

362
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,125
Hey. It's Tendo.

363
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,916
I should take this.

364
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,375
[KEITA]
Huh?

365
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,833
[CHIAKI gasps]

366
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,916
I'm sorry I grabbed your arm.

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,458
It's just, when I'm in
big places like this,

368
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,625
I get a kind of anxious
all by myself.

369
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll stay.

370
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:42,916
But Tendo--

371
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,083
[KEITA]
She'll probably text.

372
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,041
I mean, she's pretty
diligent like that.

373
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:46,791
[phone buzzes]

374
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,958
See? There she is now.

375
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,708
She says they're waiting
for us over by the dungeon.

376
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,708
You should be with her.

377
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,041
[KEITA]
Don't you wanna sit down?

378
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,583
[KEITA] Spending the whole
day at a theme park like this

379
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,166
can be pretty overwhelming.

380
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,583
Between that and
all the walking,

381
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,875
it's no wonder you keeled over!

382
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,000
What made you two wanna come
here today, in particular?

383
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,416
I got dragged into it!

384
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,333
Konoha wanted me to scope
out this place for a date

385
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,000
she's pushing me to go on!

386
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,375
[KEITA]
Really?

387
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,250
Hold on! Who're you thinking
of going on a date with?

388
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,375
Why would you ask me that?

389
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,333
What difference does
it make who it is?

390
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,416
Yeah, I guess you're right.

391
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,333
Can I ask you something?

392
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,875
I wanna know... what do you
think of Mono and Nobe?

393
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,000
Think of her, I guess.

394
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,666
To tell the truth,

395
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,333
I'm still getting used to
the fact they're Konoha.

396
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,625
But nothing's changed.

397
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,291
Not in any way that matters.

398
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,750
They're still really
important to me.

399
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,166
[CHIAKI]
More important than Tendo?

400
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,583
Hey, wait.

401
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,208
How come you're making it
sound like a competition?

402
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,000
[CHIAKI]
Forget it! I'm just being nosy!

403
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,291
I was trying to
make conversation.

404
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,791
Tendo means a lot to me.

405
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,666
I've always thought
that she was special.

406
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,750
Sometimes I suddenly
remember at random moments

407
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,083
that we're actually going out

408
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,958
and I just can't believe
how fortunate I am.

409
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,791
It's the same, though.

410
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,916
When I think about
Uehara and Aguri,

411
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,916
they're really important
to me, as well.

412
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,666
Just like you, Chiaki.

413
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,166
[KEITA] I was a loner with
zero friends until recently.

414
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,166
I would've never imagined
that I'd get to hang out

415
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,708
with you guys like
this, you know?

416
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,125
[KEITA chuckles]

417
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,166
And none of it would've happened
if Tendo hadn't taken the time

418
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,750
to say hello to me that
one day at the game store.

419
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,958
I just wish I could figure out

420
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,291
why she likes me so
much in the first place.

421
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,416
Honestly, we still seem
like a pretty odd couple.

422
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,875
Stop trying to sound
all humble, you butthead.

423
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,958
What the--? Who's
trying to be humble?

424
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,750
All I wanted to do
was explain myself!

425
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,416
[yelping]

426
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,041
[CHIAKI]
Konoha?

427
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,208
[KONOHA clears throat]

428
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,541
[KONOHA humming]

429
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,875
What about the drinks?

430
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,125
Why don't you walk all the way
over there and buy us some

431
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,791
if you're so damn thirsty?

432
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,166
What?!

433
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,041
We should get a move on.

434
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,958
I'm sure everyone else
is waiting for us.

435
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,166
[KONOHA]
Hm?

436
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,916
You go on. I think I'm
gonna call it a night.

437
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,208
Already, Sis?

438
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,166
[KEITA]
Are you still feeling woozy?

439
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,583
No, but I think you
should at least

440
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,208
get to spend what's left of
the day with your girlfriend.

441
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,708
[KONOHA]
Chiaki.

442
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,250
It's okay.

443
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,166
[KEITA]
You can't go home yet.

444
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,041
After all, you wouldn't
wanna miss the parade.

445
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,416
Come on!

446
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:03,250
Uh! Hey! Wait for me, you two!

447
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,083
[KEITA]
Sorry you had to wait!

448
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,750
Way to leave us hangin', Amano!

449
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,416
[AGURI]
Where the heck were you guys?!

450
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,125
[KEITA] We'd have been back
sooner, but Chiaki passed out.

451
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,791
What? I'm fine really!

452
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,583
I was a little lightheaded
earlier, that's all.

453
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,333
[KAREN]
Thank goodness!

454
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,500
[AGURI gasps]

455
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,375
[AGURI]
You guys, we've gotta hurry!

456
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,000
The parade is starting up!

457
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,416
It's time for that already?

458
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,083
Yeah, it's like the
highlight of coming here!

459
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,458
We can't miss it!

460
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,000
[AGURI]
Move those skinny legs, Amano!

461
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,333
[KAREN] Come on, Hoshinomori!
The parade awaits!

462
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,833
[KEITA] Look how many
people showed up for this!

463
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,416
[AGURI gasping]

464
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:08,916
[AGURI gasps]

465
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,916
Hey! What'cha doin'?

466
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,750
Why don't we go to the front
so we can see 'em better?

467
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,583
[AGURI]
Uh.

468
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,333
Oh! Okay!

469
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,416
[KAREN sighs]

470
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,041
[KAREN]
Huh?

471
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,333
Amano?

472
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,291
You wanna move up
to the front, too?

473
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,583
[KAREN]
Uh.

474
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:31,958
Well, duh!

475
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,541
But I'm only holding your hand

476
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,416
'cause I know for a fact you'll
get lost in the crowd otherwise!

477
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,875
So hold on tight!

478
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,708
'Kay, let's get moving, Tendo!

479
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,583
That's the spirit!

480
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,583
I'm sorry about today, Sis.

481
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,666
I may have gone
overboard a little bit.

482
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,083
Everything worked out fine.

483
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,875
[KONOHA]
Well, how'd it go?

484
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,083
[CHIAKI]
What do you mean?

485
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,791
Did he shoot you down?

486
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,208
No, he didn't "shoot me down."

487
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,583
Thanks for the
vote of confidence!

488
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,208
[KONOHA]
You didn't tell him, didja?!

489
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,583
[CHIAKI] The time wasn't
right. I'm being strategic!

490
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:03,750
I swear!

491
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,916
Though I didn't tell
him the truth today,

492
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,916
I promise someday I will
make Keita a slave

493
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,708
to my overwhelming charms
in the romance department!

494
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,666
Who're you?
Chiaki the Barbarian?

495
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,875
[BOTH laughing]

496
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,750
[CHIAKI] Let's go to the
front with the rest of 'em!

497
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,375
[KONOHA]
Sure! But don't faint, okay?

498
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,666
'Cause I can't lift you!

499
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,000
[CHIAKI] I won't!
I'm feeling great right now.

500
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,291
C'mon, Konoha! Onward!

501
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:32,333
[CROWD cheering]

502
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,958
Whoa! What's up?

503
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,083
You're the bestest, Tasuku.

504
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,541
No, you are.

505
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,750
I'm really glad that today
wasn't game over, after all.

506
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,041
It's so pretty.

507
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:56,125
Hey, Tendo! What do you
say we get even closer?

508
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,916
[KAREN]
Okay!

509
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,541
[KEITA screams]

510
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,125
Are you all right?
