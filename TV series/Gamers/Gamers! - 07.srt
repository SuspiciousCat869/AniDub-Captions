1
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:32,750
[KEITA]
Tendo.

2
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,208
Would you like to
go out with me?

3
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,708
[KAREN]
Uh-huh! I would love to!

4
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,375
See? That's the guy.

5
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,125
How the hell did he
pull it off, though?

6
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,291
Okay. I know I shouldn't
say this, but...

7
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,958
She's light-years outta
that nerd's league.

8
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,416
[KEITA]
Looks like they disconnected.

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,541
So much for a good match.

10
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,333
Damn, I'm super jealous
of that dude.

11
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,291
I wish I had a hot
blonde girlfriend

12
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,500
who was crazy about me.

13
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,541
Quiet down, you idiots,
he's gonna hear us!

14
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,291
[sighs]

15
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,458
[KEITA]
Uehara.

16
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,500
I've decided that I need
to stop demolishing

17
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,416
my classmates' expectations.

18
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,875
Uh-huh. I have no idea
what you're talking about,

19
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,250
but I'm glad your
reign of terror or

20
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,333
whatever is finally
coming to an end.

21
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,833
Just in time, too.

22
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,375
You're getting a crazy
amount of attention.

23
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,791
The horror.

24
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,208
Don't act like an
innocent bystander.

25
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,208
Last time I checked,
this was partially your fault.

26
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,083
Well, that's a fair point.
Guess I gotta own it.

27
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,000
But how was I supposed to
know you were gonna skip

28
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,166
the friends thing and go
straight for the jugular?

29
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,000
That moment was pretty god-tier.

30
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,416
Yeah. Kinda wild, huh?

31
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,916
[KEITA] Even though
Tendo said yes to me.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,208
What if it was all just a ruse
to get closer with Uehara?

33
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,375
It's possible.

34
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,041
I wish I could borrow
some of your luck.

35
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,458
I don't even know what
I'm supposed to say

36
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,041
to Aguri after all that.

37
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,708
Huh? Can't you just
talk like normal?

38
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,541
How are we supposed
to do that, huh?

39
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,458
The guy Aguri likes
is with Tendo now.

40
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,791
[KEITA] Hold on. The guy she
likes is with Tendo now?

41
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,250
Don't make me spell it out!

42
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,625
See ya.

43
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,500
[TEACHER 2A]
Good morning. Take your seats.

44
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,875
[KEITA] The guy Aguri
likes is with Tendo.

45
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,875
But Aguri doesn't like any guys,

46
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,291
except...

47
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,958
[KEITA screams] That means
Uehara is cheating on her!

48
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,583
And that's why he doesn't
know what to say!

49
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,375
He's caught in a web
of his own lies!

50
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,416
[KEITA sighs]
I get it now.

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,250
It's easier for him to pursue
his secret romance at school

52
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:07,333
if everyone thinks Tendo's
going out with me.

53
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,916
Maybe she'll let me take back

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,541
the whole "wanna go out?"
thing I sprung on her.

55
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,125
I mean, it was a mistake anyway.

56
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,791
Sorry! I should've looked
where I was go--!

57
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,208
[BOTH gasp]

58
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,750
[sputters]

59
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,291
[clears throat]

60
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,291
What's the matter?
Say something.

61
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,291
You're even paler than
usual right now.

62
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,708
Uh! I'd... love to stay
and chat with you,

63
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,416
but I have to take care of
a thing somewhere else!

64
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,041
I'll see ya later! Good-bye!

65
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,833
Huh? Uh, bye.

66
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,750
[KEITA whimpers]

67
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,958
[KEITA]
Sorry, Tendo. That was lame.

68
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,416
[sighs]

69
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,333
Huh?

70
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,625
Hey, you! Twelve o'clock!

71
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,208
Whatcha want, <i>moe</i> -hater?

72
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,583
It's about what happened
yesterday! Okay.

73
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,958
We all know Tendo said yes,

74
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,125
but you know why she
said yes, don'tcha?

75
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,041
Uh. I can hazard a guess.

76
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,083
It's probably some kind of
mission of mercy on her part.

77
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,625
Well, as long as you're aware!

78
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,791
I gotta say, though, if that
were a quick-time event,

79
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:11,750
you rocked it!

80
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,958
[KEITA]
Yeah.

81
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,083
I guess I had a few
lucky button-presses.

82
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,750
The moment she said yes,

83
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,833
you cast a major debuff
on that she-devil

84
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,083
who was hanging on you
for all the wrong reasons.

85
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,916
Uh. "She-devil"?

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,916
Uh! Don't mind me!
Just thinking aloud!

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,166
We might be enemies,
but that doesn't mean

88
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,208
I wanna see you suffer
in matters of the heart.

89
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,500
What...?

90
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,083
You're gonna make me
spell it out, then? Fine!

91
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,125
Aguri might be nice
in most ways,

92
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,625
but she was never really
your girlfriend, 'kay?

93
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,083
It's time to face the truth.

94
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,416
Clearly.

95
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,708
She can't be my girlfriend
if we never went out.

96
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:42,916
This is awesome!

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,291
You don't seem
like you're pining for

98
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,708
what you used to have at all!

99
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,041
I didn't have anything,

100
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,125
so why would I be
pining for it, Einstein?

101
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,333
Now you're talking!

102
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,416
Out with the old and
in with the new, right?

103
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,791
You're adjusting to this
change like a real pro!

104
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,875
Okay.

105
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,958
[bell rings]

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,166
[AGURI] What, are the stickers
not clear enough?

107
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,708
Uh...

108
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,666
[AGURI growls]

109
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,041
[KEITA]
Can you ever forgive me?!

110
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,708
[AGURI giggles] Aw, come on,
don't freak out on me.

111
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,291
I'm 20% just kidding!

112
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,125
I don't feel so hot about
80% not kidding!

113
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,333
[sighs] Well, whaddya
want from me?

114
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,208
Ever since I got proof
that Tasuku's been

115
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,875
sneaking around on me
with other girls,

116
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,875
the whole world
just seems kinda blah.

117
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,666
[KEITA] Okay, but don't you
think maybe it's a stretch

118
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,500
to assume that he's cheating on
you, just because he looked at

119
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,500
you funny during my big
moment with Tendo?

120
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,375
Then why'd he make that
weird face at me, huh?!

121
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,833
I'm his cute little girlfriend!

122
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,875
There's no need to look
panicked, but he did!

123
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,166
[KEITA]
Uh, good point.

124
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,958
Hanging around with you has
given me nothing but bad luck.

125
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,166
No offense, but my life is
turning into a real suck-fest.

126
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,750
Hey, don't say it like that.

127
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,916
Makes it sound like I'm
jinxed or something.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,625
Well, you're definitely not a
rabbit's foot, that's for sure.

129
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,291
Hoshinomori and Tendo both
met Tasuku because of you!

130
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,083
But, Uehara didn't seem to care

131
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,875
if he hung out with Tendo
so long as I got to.

132
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,458
Then again, he could've
used me as his cardboard box

133
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,500
to sneak in for the
kill, whatta snake.

134
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,375
I don't think he'd make
you be his camouflage.

135
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,666
When it comes to your
friendship, you guys're solid!

136
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,750
Yeah!

137
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,541
Maybe I'm that
expendable team member

138
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,833
you only swap into the
party for side-missions.

139
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,416
[growls] C'mon!
Stop being so negative!

140
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,750
It's annoying!

141
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,458
So, what're you going to
do about this Tendo thing,

142
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,375
now that it's way
more complicated?

143
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,791
Uh! It's hard to say.

144
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,291
Do you think

145
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,916
I should break up with her,
since I didn't mean to ask?

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't ask me.
It's your life, Amano.

147
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,458
[KEITA]
Yeah. I guess you're right.

148
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,041
What's important is
how you feel,

149
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,291
and nobody else can
figure out that stuff.

150
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,208
Huh?

151
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,416
I'm serious. Look.

152
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,166
Whether you wanna be in this
relationship or you wanna bail,

153
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,666
you need to make up
your own mind about it.

154
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,708
Uh--

155
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,791
I'm sorry. You're right,

156
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,083
I just need to sack up and
face this problem head on.

157
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,333
Sounds good. Attaboy.

158
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,250
Gross! What the heck did I get?!

159
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,125
[KEITA]
Wait, you liked it fine before!

160
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,833
I honestly didn't notice
the flavor until just now!

161
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,291
Guess my tongue had
Tasuku on the brain!

162
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,041
[BOTH laugh]

163
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,833
See ya later!

164
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,958
[KAREN] Amano got in touch with
me out of the blue this morning.

165
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,750
Why did he want to
meet me up on the roof?

166
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,833
What if he wants to talk about
the state of our relationship?

167
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,916
Stop it, Karen.
Try to stay calm.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,083
This is terrible!

169
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,958
I don't want him to
see me freaking out!

170
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,125
What if Amano didn't even
mean to ask me out

171
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,833
in front of everyone
in the first place?

172
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,083
It kills me to think of it,
but that would explain a lot,

173
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,416
I guess. I mean, really.

174
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,875
How come he just popped
the question

175
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,083
like that without any warning?

176
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,083
I'm scared to see him.

177
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,083
What if he just wants
to break up?

178
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,375
[KEITA]
Hey, thanks so much for coming!

179
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,500
Sorry it's so last-minute!

180
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,208
[KEITA]
Do you, um...

181
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,291
Do you hate me, Tendo?

182
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,500
If you do, just say so, and
I won't bug you anymore.

183
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,083
No, of course not!

184
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,291
If that's true, then why
won't you look at me?

185
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,625
I don't get it.

186
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,208
You know why!

187
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,583
And I know why we're
meeting up here!

188
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,500
Huh?

189
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,875
You brought me out on the roof

190
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,625
so you could break up
with me in peace and quiet,

191
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,458
isn't that right?

192
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,791
Uh!

193
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,750
It's fine. I get it.
You don't need to sugar-coat

194
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,875
the harsh truth of the
matter for my sake.

195
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,416
That face you made when I saw
you in the hall spoke volumes.

196
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,791
No, you just startled me.

197
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,083
Whatever! You don't have
to twist yourself in knots

198
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,666
to try and make me feel better!

199
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,791
You wanna take it back when
you asked me out, right?

200
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,125
Well, don't worry.

201
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,083
I meant it when I said yes,
but I definitely

202
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,000
got caught up in the heat
of the moment, too.

203
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,000
[KAREN] No. Why am I
acting all closed off again?

204
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,541
[KEITA]
I think, most of all,

205
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,125
I'm relieved, you know?

206
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,000
[KAREN]
About what?

207
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,000
I mean, you don't seem
to hate me or anything,

208
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,000
and everything beyond that
is kind of a bonus round.

209
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,500
Of course I don't.

210
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,000
How dumb would you have
to be to think I do?

211
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,375
Oh. Hey. Well, that's a plus.

212
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,333
And I hope you still
feel that way,

213
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,791
but first I have to get
this off my chest.

214
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,833
[KAREN]
Here it comes...

215
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,500
If it's not too much
of an imposition,

216
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,708
would you please go out on
a date with me, Tendo?

217
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,916
[gasps]

218
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,375
I know you're busy, but we can
do it whenever works for you.

219
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:38,041
And, I'm sure I'll be fine with
any place you'd like to go.

220
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,666
Hold on. What the heck
is happening right now?

221
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,250
I asked you on a date, which
seemed to prompt karate-hands.

222
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,041
No, I heard you say all
the words. It's just...

223
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,208
Is it that weird?

224
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,291
I mean, we are
boyfriend-girlfriend now.

225

[KAREN grunts]

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,916
Don't get me wrong! I'm not
saying this is going to be

227
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,416
the easiest relationship
in the world!

228
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,958
And we're not exactly equals

229
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,375
when it comes to the high school
food-chain thing, you know?

230
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:04,625
Honestly? A guy like me could
never hold a candle to Uehara.

231
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,333
He's ranked, and I'm still
working through the tutorial.

232
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,750
[KAREN]
Uh...

233
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,166
So what if I suck?

234
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,583
As a gamer, I think it's wrong
to quit out of a match!

235
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,208
If you're gonna play,
you play to win!

[KAREN gasps]

237
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,333
Are you all right, Tendo?

238
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,875
Sure! I mean, I guess I can.

239
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,291
A date would be pretty nice.

240
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,583
Like you said, we are
boyfriend and girlfriend now,

241
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,750
so this sort of development
is par for the course!

242
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,333
It's out of our control!

243
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,000
This is probably way late,

244
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,500
but even though I'm
a total noob at this,

245
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,916
I really look forward to

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,458
whatever time we get to
spend together as a couple.

247
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,750
I promise you that.

248
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,916
[KAREN] Uh, thanks.
That's very polite of you.

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,750
I'm looking forward
to it myself.

250
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,208
Ooh! But if you have any plans

251
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,000
of pulling a speed-run,
think again!

252
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,541
Don't you go anticipating
any double-XP weekends!

253
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,041
Okay?

254
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,125
You kind of lost me there, but,
right! No bonus modifiers!

Good! Don't you forget it.

256
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,875
Now, if that's all
you had to say,

257
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,666
you are dismissed
for the afternoon!

258

Yes, sir! Have a safe
walk home, Admiral Tendo!

You as well!

00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,250
[KAREN] Wait! Why are we
saluting each other?

261
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,958
I'm his girlfriend,
not his ranking officer!

262
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,875
But, it's not like I can just
let down my guard, right?

263
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,416
I have to keep him
at arm's length

264
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,083
for the sake of my own sanity!

265
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:24,166
If he gets any closer to me,
I'm gonna lose my mind!

[KEITA]
Behold!

267
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,083
The place where normies go when
they wanna pretend to be gamers!

268
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,916
Around 1.

269
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,458
All right then.
Shall we give it a go?

270
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,666
Yes! Good idea!

271
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,458
[KAREN] It looks like arcade
games are on the first floor.

272
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,125
That's a lucky break for the
likes of us, but maybe we should

273
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,333
leave those for later on!
Let's see here.

274

Maybe we should
start out with the...

Aw, geez. I dunno.

276
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,166
This place is six stories tall!

277
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,833
Mm. Mm?

278
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,416
How about we just wander
around for a little bit?

279
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,750
We can do whatever
looks like fun. Right?

280
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,541
Okay.

281
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,333
[KEITA groans]

00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,541
Oh, my gosh!

This place is amazing,
isn't it?!

00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,458
[KEITA] It... It's definitely
something else.

285
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,875
It's kinda weird, though.

286
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,250
All of this sporty stuff
feels way more fun here

287

than back in PE class.

288
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,583
Right? Maybe it's
because we want to.

289
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,500
Having a coach bark at
you to do something

290
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,083
sort of kills the appeal.

291
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,125
I'm sure that's part
of the reason why,

292
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,833
but there's more to it.

00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,000
Huh?

wanna try out next?

Okay, then. It looks like
there are a couple more

297

Nope! My bad!

The only thing left
to do is the arcade!

Isn't there a big pool
area under your hand?

Yeah. I must've missed
that part somehow.

Why don't we check it out?

Just give it a try
and see what we think?

so we're covered.

You're avoiding the pool

so you don't have to face the
sight of me in a bikini, huh?

to see you in one, okay?!

00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,625
Uh.

314
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,291
Wait! I do wanna see you in
a bikini, but I shouldn't!

315
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,916
Nobody should! Does "Helen
of Troy" ring any bells?!

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,916
Women have doomed
humanity before! Huh?

317
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,458
Hey, it's all right.

318
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,708
If you don't wanna go to the
pool on our date, that's fine.

319
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,583
[KEITA] The year is 20XX,
and humanity is doomed.

320
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,541
[KAREN]
Sorry that took so long!

321
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,166
Anyway. I hope the
suit looks okay.

322
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,666
[KEITA screams]
I knew she'd be cute,

323
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,541
but I didn't expect her
to one-shot me!

324
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,291
Thank you for this boon!

325
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,833
That's kind of a
weird thing to say

326
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,416
when a girl asks you how
she looks in a swimsuit.

327
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
You look amazing in it,
but I didn't want to

328
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,041
cheapen the moment with
generic compliments!

329
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,166
[KAREN] Give me one generic
compliment, at least!

330
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,000
I even put this dumb
flower in my hair!

331
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,625
"Lookin' good, champ!"

332
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,708
Wow, good job.

333
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
[COUPLE laughing]

334
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,375
Stop! You're such a meanie!

335
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,750
I'm serious!

336
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,708
That looks pretty fun.
Do you wanna give it a try?

337
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,083
Huh?

338
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,958
But if we do, we need to
establish some ground rules

339
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,916
before the splashing can begin.

340
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,750
[KEITA]
Rules? Like what?

341
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,083
How about this?

342
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,750
The game is turn-based,
with the attacker getting

343
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,000
to throw water once per
round of the encounter!

344
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,916
Rounds are 10 seconds
or till an attack,

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,416
whichever comes first!

346
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,416
Whoever gets the other person's
hair wet is the champion!

347
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,750
[KEITA] Tendo, you've
got control issues.

348
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,833
Ready for a good soaking?

349
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,666
[KEITA] Yeah! Come at me
with all you've got!

350
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,458
[KAREN]
Curses!

351
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,291
[KEITA] Now it's my turn!
I'll wait a moment,

352
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,708
to lull her into a false
sense of complacency!

353
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,916
Go!

354
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,416
No! Why did I take the bait?!

355
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,833
[yells]

356
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,583
[KEITA]
Counterattack!

357
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,166
I've lost.

358
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,291
[laughs] I am the champion!

359
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,625
[GIRLFRIEND 7A]
I'm gonna get you, ya big cutie!

360
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,083
Take that!

361
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,875
Man, that was adorable!
I'm gonna get you! I'm...

362
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,166
Yeah, maybe you and I

363
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,333
should head over to
the arcade games already.

364
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,791
I just threw up in
my mouth a little.

365
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,208
[BOTH gasp]

366
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,041
[GUY 7A] If you're flying solo,
you can hang with us!

367
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,208
[gasps]

00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,333
[gasps] Keita!

369
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,166
[CHIAKI whimpers]

370
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,000
Hey, you wanna give me
that arm back, kelp-head?

371
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,750
Just shut up for two seconds!

00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,250
Look, pretend we're a
couple for a minute!

373
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,041
They'll lose interest if
they think I'm spoken for.

374
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,250
Aw, screw it.
She's here with a guy.

375
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,166
[BOTH sigh]

376
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,375
[KAREN laughs]

377
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,625
Ah! What are you doing?!
Tendo's right there!

378
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,166
Huh? Yeah, I noticed
her right away.

379
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,208
Hey, Tendo. It's nice
to see you again.

380
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,833
Yeah! A pleasure!

381
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,416
I don't wanna be a jerk about
it, but I happen to be here

382
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,208
with the girl whose boyfriend
I technically am right now!

383
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,750
Wait, are you trying to say
that you're on a date?

384
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,583
I figured that out when I saw
you two together, genius!

385
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,166
If you know we're on a date,

386
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,750
then why are you taking
my elbow to second base?!

387
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,333
I guess that you're right.
I shouldn't get in the way.

388
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,666
Even if your relationship
is just a total act

389
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,500
that she's putting on
to help you out.

390
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,250
Who says it's a total act?

--Huh?

[BOTH squeal]

00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,125
[CHIAKI]
I am sorry to intrude, though.

395
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,958
I never meant to be
a third wheel.

396
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,333
It's not a big deal.

397
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,500
But, what are you doing
here all by yourself?

398
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,708
Oh, that's right!

399
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,500
My little sister wanted
to come here today

400
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,625
so she invited me along,
but we got separated

401
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,625
and now I have no idea
where she could be.

402
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,583
I'm pretty worried about her.

403
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,625
Hey Hoshinomori, we'd be happy
to help you look for her.

404
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,208
She's probably looking
for you, too,

405
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,750
so I bet we'll find
her in a snap!

406
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,875
[gasps] That would be great,
if you both don't mind.

407
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,958
It's not like I've got
anywhere else to be, right?

408
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,041
Count me in.

00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,625
Thanks so much.

00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,250
[KAREN] Thanks, but us girls can
handle the search-and-rescue.

411
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,750
[KEITA, CHIAKI]
Huh?

412
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,166
[KAREN] Amano doesn't need
to help us look for your sister,

413
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,333
so you can put a cork in
all that blushy gratitude.

414

He's gonna wait by himself

way over by the video
games, isn't he?

Uh, copy that, sir!
Wait by the games! Aye-aye!

Very good, soldier.
Better get marching, Amano!

Yes! Godspeed, sir!

420
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,166
You're a lot more
formal with each other

421
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,875
than I woulda thought.

422
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,125
[KAREN]
Thanks for waiting!

423
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,541
I hope that you're ready
for the main event!

424
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,000
[KEITA] So, why is Chiaki
still hanging around?

425
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,916
Oh, wow!

426
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,083
As it turned out, we
couldn't find my sister

427
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,000
because she'd gone home.

428
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,375
Wait, why are we
talking about that?!

429
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,750
I can see it in your face!

430
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,458
You don't have the
foggiest idea why Tendo

431
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,583
bothered to go on a date
with you today, do you?

432
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,416
Huh?

433
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,791
Honestly, Keita!

434
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,708
Is this so-called date doing
anything for you at all?

435
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,958
It's too late for you,

436
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,250
but you could still do
something nice for her,

437
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,833
if you'd use your
brain for once.

438
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't get it.
What're you trying to say?

439
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,708
[laughs] I'm handing you a
golden opportunity here, dummy,

440
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,166
check it out! The chance to
make your girlfriend happy

441
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,875
with some head-to-head
game competition!

442
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,958
Why does it feel like you're
looking for an excuse

443
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:30,916
to play something?

444
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,708
Whaddya mean? I would never...

445
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,416
[KAREN]
Did you say, "competition"?

446
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,458
That sounds like a great idea!

447
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,583
[KEITA]
Uh...

448
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,833
This game is the sort where
there's no clear winner

449
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,916
until the very last lap is run!

450
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,875
Even though I've only
ever played this at home,

451
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,500
you're going down, Keita!

452
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,916
[KEITA] Both of you
are gonna rue the day

453
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,916
you picked this for our
competition! And go!

454
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,916
Just givin' you guys
a lead start!

455
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,916
Heh! That's what you get
for picking a tricky car

456
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,291
you don't know how to handle!

457
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,583
[KEITA growls]

458
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,291
[KAREN] You can bounce back,
so don't give up!

459
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,000
Uh, right!

460
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,541
Awesome driving!
Way to finesse that curve!

461
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,333
Eat my dust!

462
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,625
Amano's not bad, either!

463
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,958
The controls are definitely
coming easier to me now!

464
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,166
[CHILDREN]
No way, you got Bomb Roulette!

465
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,291
Heh. Yeah, nice
knowin' you, buddy!

466
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,625
You just landed the item
that has a 50/50 chance

467
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,333
of blowing up you,
or every racer except you!

468
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,416
Using it on this course
can be a real gamble!

469
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,208
You're gonna regret
giving me that info!

470
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,833
I can see the finish line!

471
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,791
Victory is mine!

472
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,291
[KEITA]
Time for some roulette!

473
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,791
[KEITA grumbles]

474
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,833
[sighs]

475
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,250
[KAREN stifles laughter]

476
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,458
[KAREN laughs]

477
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,250
[KEITA]
Are you okay?

478
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,458
[laughs]

479
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,958
[KEITA]
Huh?

480
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,833
I don't mean to laugh in your
face, but the way you lost

481
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,041
at the finish line was
so hilarious! I'm sorry.

482
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,416
No, that's okay. I'm just
glad you're not mad

483
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,416
at me for pulling
that stunt at the end.

484
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,791
Why would I be?

485
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,041
Uh...!

486
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,625
It's just a hunch, but
you didn't use that item

487
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,958
at the end of the race because

488
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,791
you were invested in
beating us, am I right?

489
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,375
Sorry I didn't take the
competition more seriously.

490
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,000
[KAREN]
You did the right thing.

491
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,916
'Cause whether you won or lost,

492
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,583
we all had a lot of fun,
thanks to that.

493
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,750
Heh.

494
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,750
[KAREN]
You make gaming fun.

495
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,333
I like that.

496
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,166
Thank you.

497
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,333
And I like the way you never
go easy on me, Tendo.

498
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,833
How you challenge me.

499
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:53,958
[KAREN]
Still not very good

500
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,750
at the generic
compliments, are you?

501
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,500
You could've played it
safe on the turns

502
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,333
and handed me the
win back there, but,

503
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,250
I wouldn't have enjoyed the
victory unless I earned it.

504
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,791
That's me.

505
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,625
Too stubborn not to face every
challenge with all I've got.

506
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,208
You're not wrong.

507
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,750
But it's precisely those
qualities that make you so

508
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,625
special and unique. I mean that.

509
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,083
[KAREN gasps]

510
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,625
[KEITA]
By the way, Tendo, are you

511
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,416
playing that Fire Tactics
title that just came out?

512
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,541
Well, of course!
How could I not?

513
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,250
You know, I've been meaning
to ask how you like it so far!

514
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,666
Are you playing
casual or classic?

515
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,958
I'm classic all the way!

516
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,583
[KEITA laughs]
Saw that coming.
