[TASUKU]
Hey, Amano.

3
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:15,958
Morning, Uehara.

4
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,125
How's it going...?

5
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm mad, and I want
my time back!

6
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,583
Remember that game
you talked up?

7
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,666
Turns out it's boring
as all hell!

8
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,708
No way! You played
the Nobe game?

9
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,291
Tell me about it!

10
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,166
[sighs]

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,000
[TASUKU] Damn thing
started strong enough.

12
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,166
I'm down for survival horror,
and I was pretty hyped to see

13
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,375
how the stuff they were setting
up was gonna play out.

14
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,750
Then it turned into a fishing
game halfway through,

15
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,916
and I wasn't feeling that
so much, y'know?

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,125
But since it was a
recommendation from you,

17
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,125
I thought, "I'm just gonna
power through to the end."

18
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,625
That ending.

19
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,708
Oh, that ending!

20
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,666
[TASUKU] The last shot of the
game was some old geezer posing

21
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,708
in front of a stupid black
bass he just caught!

22
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,458
What the hell did I play?!

23
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,708
Yeah! That's textbook Nobe.
You gotta love it, right?

24
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,083
You outta your mind?

25
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,375
That game is just a bunch of
ideas thrown together.

26
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,916
I wouldn't play that again
if you paid me!

27
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,125
Sorry about that!

28
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,500
The rational part of my brain
is aware that Nobe's games

29
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,833
are a real train wreck.
But there's something kinda

30
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,875
charming about how randomly
the pieces all come together.

31
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,000
[TASUKU]
You're not makin' any sense.

32
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,583
How can I explain?

33
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,916
Oh, I know!

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,250
It's like when you fall in love.
There's no logic.

35
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,333
[TASUKU]
Big talk from a guy

36
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,875
who's never gotten
to first base.

37

[KEITA yelps]

38
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,500
Hey! Who cares what
base I've reached?!

39
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,958
Just because you and Aguri

40
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,458
have probably gotten to
home plate, an' stuff.

41
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,541
Uh!

42
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,458
Or not!

43
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,541
Don't worry about me, v-card!
I do just fine!

44
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,666
What about you and Tendo?

45
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,541
Huh? What do you mean,
me and Tendo?

46
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,500
Haven't you seen her a bunch
since you blew her off?

47
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm actually sad about
how little I've seen her.

48
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,208
How little?

49
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,125
Wow, you honestly mean
that, don't you?

50
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,541
Yeah. Though it almost
feels like I see her

51
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,416
out of the corner of
my eye sometimes.

52
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,125
Ah. Never mind.

53
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,250
I guess that's good
enough for now.

54
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,166
Just make sure you don't
pass her by so much

55
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,000
that she forgets about you.

56
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,000
Pass her by?

57
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,875
Wait... like a StreetPass?

58
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,416
Yeah, like StreetPass.

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,333
Except not at all!

You mind if I help out
with this raid?

63
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,000
Uh, yeah, fine.

I know I'm gonna regret this,

65
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,583
but why is your
username "Tsucchie"?

66
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,041
Well, whenever I'm online,

67
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,833
I like to use a name
other than my own,

68
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,416
just to give it some distance.

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,333
My mom's maiden
name is Tsuchiyama,

70
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,708
so I shortened it down.

71
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,333
Oh, I also go by Yama
from time to time.

72
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,041
[TASUKU]
It's a pretty lame back-story.

73
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,916
Hey, that's my mom!

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,708

Okay, so what about Mono?

Oh, they're awesome!

We met in-game.

77
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,833
I've been friends with Mono
ever since I started playing.

78
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,708
We've never hung
out in real-life,

79
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,250
but I feel pretty close
to them, nonetheless.

80
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,208
There's something
mysterious about it!

81
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,500

some training in the off-season.

is like majorly DOA.

Is that an emulator?

Romantic comedy!

God knows it's
never gonna happen

Yeah. You're right.

89
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,541
A girl like Tendo would never be
interested in someone like me.

chops about it, okay, Amano?

is your target!

Her name is Chiaki Hoshinomori.

103
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,625
They say she'd rather stare at
her handheld than be a person,

104
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,708
so... she's basically you.

105

Wow, what're the odds?

106

But I still don't get why I have
to hit on some random girl.

and march in there!

00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,166
Awful! You're just awful!

Tendo, wait!
Sorry man, I should go.

169
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,083
O... kay.

170
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,916
That was kinda weird.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,375
Well, back to business.
Uh, Hoshinomori?

172
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,666
[gasps] Why, why are
you looking at me?

173
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,750

It came out last week.

00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,583
[KEITA] I should've said
it back at school,

178
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,208
but I'm Keita Amano,
from Class F.

179

[CHIAKI]
"Amano." Okay.

180
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,708
I guess you like games, 'cause
I saw you playing one and all.

181
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,291

Uh?

00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,750
You're a member of the

188
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,041
Look, I'm very sorry,

189
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,458
but I still have no
interest in joining.

190
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,500
That's my final answer!

191
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,791
Wait! I'm not actually
in the club.

192
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,583
This isn't like a
recruitment scheme.

193
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,375
Honestly, I said no
to them myself.

194
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,791
Uh?

195
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,291
Wait, Tendo tried to
enlist you, too?

196
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,541
Uh-huh.

197
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,750
She invited me to one
of their club meetings,

198
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,291
and I checked it out like
I said I would, but...

199
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,458
But then it turned out
that the club's activities

200
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,791
weren't really what you had
in mind as a gamer, right?

201
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,041
[gasps] That's right!

202
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,583
[KEITA] It's not that
there's anything wrong

203
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,875
with the game club,

204
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,875
but it wouldn't have been
a good fit for you!

205
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,166
How'd you know?
I like playing with people,

206
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,041
and I like to win, but I don't
need to be the best ever.

207
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,083
I'm a gamer because they
make me feel something

208
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,958
that nothing else
in the world does!

209
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,333
Yeah! Ditto!

210
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,416
And if playing with the
club made me feel like that,

211
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,625
I'd join it for sure.

212
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,708
I really hated having
to turn Tendo down

213
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,041
when she asked me to be
a member! But I did!

214
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,333
We both did, because
games are our life,

215
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,541
and we need to be true to them!

216
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,333
Exactly!

217
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,291
[KEITA] And with that,
the two of us broke the ice.

218
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,625
Our shared passion
gave Hoshinomori and I

219
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,625
something to talk about.

220
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,291
[KEITA] Uehara assumed
we'd have a lot in common,

221
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,208
but even he would have been
amazed at how much.

222
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,708
The more we talked and texted
each other, the clearer

223
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,583
it became that we were
two sides of the same coin.

224
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,291
And when the topic was gaming,
she and I were totally in sync!

225
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,541
What we'd played before, how
we'd approach a boss fight.

226
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:12,583
It was as if we took the words
out of each other's mouth!

well up until then.

When I think back
on it objectively,

she was a lot nicer to
me than you, Uehara.

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,166
Just kidding.
I love you the best!

Why'd you get all PVP?

What did she say
that was so horrible?

Believe me, you wouldn't
have let it slide, either.

You sad little man.

As soon as she spoke
those words,

253
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,791
I told Chiaki in no uncertain
terms how wrong she was!

254
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,708
Lame.

boxers in a bunch.

I am the one who made you
talk to this chick, so...

257
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,291
I'll help you two little
weirdos work this all out.

258
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,958
[BOTH]
Huh?!

259
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,875
[CHIAKI] How could you
seriously think that, Keita?!

260
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,291
The Japanese game industry
is drowning in <i>moe</i> ,

261
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,250
while foreign dev teams are
focusing on story and gameplay!

262

If you look at sales
and critical acclaim,

it's obvious which side
has all the momentum!

It just goes to show how
wrong you are, <i>moe</i> lover!

about the glory of <i>moe</i> ?!

foreign game and said out loud,

"If only these girls
weren't so ugly!"

[CHIAKI, KEITA grunt]

273
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,375

bury the hatchet!

Well.

278
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,833
Look who drops her ideals when
the cute boy tells her to.

279

Arguing over video games is
harmless enough, I guess.

Hey!

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,375
[TASUKU] So, weren't you
hype about <i>Aegis Eight</i>

286
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,875
before ya both went
into rage mode?

287
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,833
I guess it couldn't
hurt to ask Chiaki

288
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,750
how far through the game she is.

289
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,500
Um. I guess I could tell you.

290
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,625
If you must know, I got
to the Elven hideout!

291
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,541
Ah! That's where I am, too!

292
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,250
That whole area is one of
the best in the franchise!

293
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,666
I agree!

294
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,583
You never get to see a level map
like that one anymore,

295
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,666
where you can tell they agonized
over every  single detail!

296
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,083
Totally! The way they
show you that the Elves

297
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,625
are bigoted against humans
without ever having to actually

298
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,250
say it aloud is a triumph
of in-game world-building.

299
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,833
[gasps] Mm-hm!

300
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,583
But it pales in comparison to
my favorite part of the area.

301
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,500
But there's just one thing
that keeps that level

302
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,375
from reaching utter perfection.

303

aren't something

Girly rage, 12 o'clock.

315
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,625
I'm gonna call it an afternoon.

316
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,583
Anyway, sorry to waste
your time like this.

317
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,541
No! It's okay, really!
I-I don't mind at all.

318
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,041
You clearly know your stuff.
Hearing you talk games was cool.

319
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,625
And who cares if you
have seaweed for hair?

320
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,083
Girls with messy hair are
pretty cute, if you ask me.

321
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,083
Huh? You think
messy hair is cute?

322
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,916
[AGURI screeching]

323
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,208
[KEITA]
Aguri looks like she's about to

324
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,000
crawl out of a TV screen!

325
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,583
[TASUKU]
Whaddya say?

326
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:16,000
You like games and so does he,
so can ya be buddy-buddy again?

327
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,000
Fine. I'll try my best.

328
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,041
[KEITA] I'm glad he's
clearing the air between us,

329
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,333
but does he have to look like

330
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,750
he's hitting on Hoshinomori
while he does it?

331
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,333
Oh, for what it's worth,

332
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,375
your hair looks good how
you have it now.

333
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,833
But if you cut it short, your
face won't get lost in it,

334
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,541
and that'd be
pretty cool, too.

335
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,083
So, you think I should cut it?

336
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,708
Yeah! If you tried a bit,
you could be cute as hell.

337
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:36,625
I mean that.

338
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,666

340
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,375
[KEITA] Please tell me Aguri
didn't hear him say that

341
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,750
through the classroom door!
This is so bad.

342
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,125
Huh?

343
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,541
[AGURI whimpers]

344
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,291
Hey, Misumi.

345
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:56,125
Any idea what's going on between
Hoshinomori and Amano?

346
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,291
To be honest, I couldn't
really tell you.

347
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,708
That said, it looks like they're
getting along pretty well,

348
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,000
don't you think?

349
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,541
But how well is pretty well?!

350
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,833
There's a lot riding on this,
Misumi! Cough it up!

351
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,750
You could just ask him yourself.
You know that, right?

352
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,916
[TASUKU] She's pretty
quiet today, for her.

353
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,083
[AGURI]
Hey, uh, Tasuku.

354
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,333
What were you doing over
in Class A before?

355
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,750
Wait. So, you saw all that?

356
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,291
I was, you know...

357
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,208
Is it something you
don't wanna talk about?

358
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,000
What, no way?!
It's nothing like that!

359
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,708
I was tryin' to patch things up
between Hoshinomori and Amano.

360
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,958
Ah. I get it.

361
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,833
Then Hoshinomori was the
girl that you talked to.

362
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,375
Uh...

363
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,000
So, what's the deal with that
Amano guy you hang out with?

364
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,333
What do you mean?!

365
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,750
We just like talkin' about
video games and stuff!

366
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,500
Okay then.

367
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,041
[KEITA] I dunno. I feel like
his new title played it

368
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,625
way too safe across the board.

369
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,500
[KEITA] It didn't have any of
Nobe's usual crazy plot twists.

370
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,750
Huh?

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,500
See ya later.

373
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,500
And hey, keep your eyes
peeled for that one chick.

374
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,041
All right.

375
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,000
[DAIKI] How does a girl that
cute appear outta thin air, man?

376
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,625
It doesn't make any sense.

377
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,125
[TASUKU] They make her sound
like she's Tendo-level hot.

378
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,666
Is that even possible?

379
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,166
[KEITA]
Uehara!

380
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,875
Are you heading home soon?

381
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,791
Yeah. Soon as Aguri
shows up, I am out.

382
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,208
Oh, good.

383
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:58,291
Huh? What's with that weird
sigh of relief, huh?

384
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,541
Well, I just thought
Aguri might have

385
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,833
said something important to you

386
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,291
on the way home yesterday,
but I guess not.

387
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,625
Nah. It was just
the normal junk.

388
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,833
[KEITA]
Excellent. Never you mind, then!

389
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,541
[TASUKU] Why does Amano
care what Aguri might have

390
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,875
said to me? It's not like they
know each other, right?

391
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,166
[TASUKU]
Hey, Amano.

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,250
Do you and her...?

00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,875
Um, yeah. We've met.

Shut it! Jeez!
You're such a jerk!

What the--?
Hoshinomori, is that you?!

403
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,666
Uh-huh!

404
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,083
[TASUKU] Wow. I know I
gave her a little advice

405
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,208
about her looks, but I
thought she'd get, like,

406
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,916
10% hotter, not this!

407
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,291
I'm sorry. I guess
this is weird.

408
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,041
Uh. How ya figure?

409
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,000
Well. I mean, yesterday, you
told me I should cut my hair

410
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,166
to be cute, and now
I look like this.

411
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,250
Hey, no problem.

412
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,958
I'm just glad it
worked out, you know?

413
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,875
And it turns out I
was right about you.

414
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,041
You're cute as hell!

Seriously, Uehara?

00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,291
[KEITA]
Huh?

419
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,625
Aguri?

420
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,666
But are you sure? Like does
this work for me, Uehara?

421
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,291
It's crazy, but my family
didn't recognize me when

422
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,916
I came out for breakfast this
morning, so I was kinda worried.

423
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,541
Whaddya mean, does it
even work for you?

424
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,041
You're a freakin' knockout!

425
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,791
Yeah, do you think so?

426
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,208
[laughs] Thank you
for the compliment!

427
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,583
Hang on. Amano.

428
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,750
Where's he at?

429
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh, Keita ran off that
way a moment ago.

430
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,500
After someone named
Aguri, I think.

[KEITA panting]

433

[KEITA] Crap!
No sign of pink hair anywhere!

434
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,541
[KEITA]
Hey, Tendo!

435
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,416
Ah! It's Amano!

00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,750
Thank goodness!

437
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,041
I think we got off on the
wrong foot yesterday.

438
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,500
Anyhow! Sorry I
came on so strong!

439
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,708
[KEITA]
Huh? What's she on about?

440
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,375
No! Don't care!
Gotta keep moving!

441
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,041
Tell me something.
Did you happen to see

442
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,750
a pink-haired girl run
by here, maybe?

443
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,625
Cute and ditzy, might've been
bawling her eyes out?

444
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,708
[gasps] Now that you mention it,
there was a sad,

445
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,916
pink-haired girl heading
straight for the lockers.

446
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,291
Uh. I owe ya one!

447
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,875
Wait! Amano!

448
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah, what's up?

449
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,500
You never told me why

450
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,375
you're chasing after her
in the first place!

451
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,375
Y'know! Typical
relationship drama!

452
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,583
[KAREN]
Relationship drama?

453
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,166
There you are!

454
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,166
Ew. It's the guy who
hangs on my boyfriend.

455
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,000
Is that what people think around
here when they see me?!

456
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,458
[KEITA] No wonder they
give me such a wide berth.

457
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,000
Anyway, what do you want?

458
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:59,250
Oh! Uh, I thought...

459
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:03,041
I-- I thought maybe you'd like
to go have some tea with me!

460
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,125
Huh?!

461
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,375
[KEITA]
Is it me?

462
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,250
Or does this feel like
I just asked her out?

463
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,083
[KEITA]
So awkward.

464
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,041
This is what I get for just
shooting from the hip.

465
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,625
Hey! So, uh.

466
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,541
Yeah, what?

467
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,916
I think you're operating under
a bunch of assumptions

468
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,791
that might not actually
be the truth.

469
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,041
[AGURI]
Hm?

470
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,958
I don't think there's
anything going on

471
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,166
between Uehara and Chiaki
that's, like, romantic.

472
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,500
But I heard him.

473
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,541
He said Hoshinomori was
"cute as hell" back there.

474
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,500
Oh, that was just a figure
of speech, don't sweat it!

475
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,833
Yeah! And just the
other day, he told me

476
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,458
how you've been looking
super-cute to him lately!

477
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,458
Do you mean it?

478
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,708
[KEITA]
Of course! Cross my heart!

479
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,791
Your boyfriend's crazy
about you, Aguri.

480
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,708
If there's anything
I know, it's that.

481
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,333
He's too good for that sea--

482
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,000
I mean Chiaki, so don't
you worry about her!

483
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,583
Believe me when I say I'm
rooting for the two of you!

484
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:05,625
[gasps] I'm gonna go get
something else to drink.

485
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:06,708
I'll be back.

486
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,416
[giggling]

487
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,958
[sighs]

488
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,208
[KEITA]
How did I pull this off?

489
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,291
Oh, there's an event.

490
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,250
I'll send Mono an invite.

491
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:22,583
[KEITA]
It looked like things

492
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,083
were going to get really
bad there for a sec.

493
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,791
--[crash]
--[gasps]

494
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,375
[AGURI whimpers]

495
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:43,041
[KEITA]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
