1
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,708
[CHIAKI] I still remember
the very first game I wrote.

2
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,208
I couldn't have been
older than nine or ten.

3
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,708
The designer enjoys
the act of creation,

4
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,708
and the player enjoys
the end result.

5
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,375
There was something so
simple about that concept

6
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:51,041
that I fell in love with
programming right away.

7
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,666
Before I knew it,
I was an actual developer,

8
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,333
with a bunch of
freeware game credits.

9
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,041
Don't get me wrong, though.

10
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,625
As much as I love making games,

11
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,833
there are times I
get discouraged.

12
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,583
Comes with the territory.

13
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,958
Sure it's just a hobby,

14
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,833
but creativity takes
a lot out of you.

15
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,000
And the mean comments
don't help any.

16
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,916
Some days, I wanna give up.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,250
But I keep finding the courage
to release more games as Nobe,

18
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,208
thanks to this one player.

19
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,666
They cheer me on.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,958
And even when I
put out something

21
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,416
that nobody else
likes or understands,

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,625
they seem to appreciate it.

23
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,375
Knowing they're out there,
it cheers me up.

24
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,083
[groaning]

25
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,666
Whatever you're doing
down there, Sis,

26
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,041
it isn't cute in the slightest.

27
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:42,708
What?

28
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,250
The last thing I remember
was me playing

29
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,333
that stupid board
game with everyone.

30
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:49,791
Uh-huh. I think they
left a few hours ago.

31
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,416
Wow. That's weird.
I'm really drawing a blank.

32
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,875
You and I were
talking, and then...

33
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,208
Hey, Sis, tell me something.

34
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,416
[KONOHA]
Yeah?

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,000
You know how you're
halfway through a manga,

36
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,458
and the lead girl sees
the guy she can't stand,

37
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,250
and he's helping a
stray dog in the rain,

38
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,166
so she randomly falls
in love with him?

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,333
That kind of thing
drives me crazy.

40
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,875
What brought that on?

41
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,500
I mean, yeah, I totally get your
example and all, but still.

42
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,708
It's a cliché.

43
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,916
Not that every single story

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,833
has to reinvent the
wheel, obviously.

45
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,125
It wouldn't get used
if it never happened.

46
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,958
Well, sure. I guess so.

47
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,291
[CHIAKI]
But either way,

48
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,875
I think it's an
unfair plot device

49
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,333
to play up surprises like that.

50
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,791
Like, whatever she's
feeling, it isn't real,

51
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,958
it's just her heartstrings
getting tugged out of the blue.

52
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,916
Who're we talking about?
I'm trying to keep up.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,708
[CHIAKI]
Focus!

54
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,291
It's me, okay?

55
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,708
But I should totally stick to my
guns and keep hating him, right?

56
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,125
It doesn't matter what nice
stuff he's said or done,

57
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,916
I can't suddenly like him!

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,541
Can I?!

59
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,500
[KONOHA]
Uh...

60
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,875
Well, I think,

61
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,291
whatever you've been doing,
just keep doing that.

62
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,541
You think so?

63
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,625
[KONOHA]
Mh-hm.

64
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,916
So who's this guy you hate

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,500
but you're kind of
falling for, too?

66
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,833
He goes by Yama.

67
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,000
Whatta jerk.

68
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,416
I betcha he's toying
with your emotions,

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
but he's the same old
butt-head undernea--

70
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,916
[CHIAKI]
What is wrong with you, huh?

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,625
Don't you talk about
Yama like that!

72
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,625
He's my most supportive fan.
Take it back, Konoha.

73
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,333
Right! I'm sorry! My bad!

74
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,666
That Yama, he's a real quality
person, no doubt about it!

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,166
That's better.

Right, I almost forgot.

I can do for ya?

You feeling okay?

00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,833
You're panting pretty hard for
just hanging out in your room.

And your face is so red!

I figured I'd get some
exercise in, that's all!

Nothing worth going
into detail about!

What were you
knocking for, anyway?

00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,916
Oh. Right. I forgot.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,375
I'm going to the
convenience store,

94
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,500
is there anything that you'd
like me to grab for you?

95
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,250
[KONOHA] Picking up your
game magazine, right?

mind if I borrow your
computer for a bit?

Uh, that's fine, but how come?

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,125
There's something
I wanna watch,

101
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,250
but my video card is
too much of a dinosaur

Yeah! <i>Total Arrow</i> !

some really high system specs!

It's not my fault they
sell 'em in pairs.

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,958
I'm... sorry I went off on you.

161
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,375
[CHIAKI]
Now that I think about it,

162
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,458
I might've seen your pass
case lying around.

163
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,958
Really? That's a relief.

164
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,458
Sorry about just coming
over. I did try to call.

165
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,791
Hey, no worries.

166
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,666
But what do you even need
your transit pass for?

167
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,916
I figured you'd be gaming
all summer break.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,666
Yeah, that was my plan.

169
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,958
But now I think I'm in for
a much different vacation

170
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,750
than what I'm accustomed to.

171
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,208
[CHIAKI
"Much different" how?

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,958
Well, it's not like we have
any specific date ideas

173
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,083
in the books just yet,

174
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,916
so I guess I might
be jumping the gun.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,125
So awkward. I wonder what
that girl sees in you.

176
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,958
"So awkward"? Gee, thanks.

177
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,416
It's true. I don't need the
transit pass right this second.

178
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,125
And me showing up at your house

179
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,625
is pretty far out
of my comfort zone.

180
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,750
But I wanted to try
being courageous,

181
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:06,125
so I'm doing whatever I can to
challenge myself a little bit,

182
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,000
and find my backbone.

183
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,000
Be brave for her.

184
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,666
[KEITA]
But I'm babbling!

185
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,500
I do tend to do that, y'know.

186
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,125
I feel like I have
to justify things,

187
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,708
instead of just doing them.

188
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,208
Honestly, even I give
myself grief about it.

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,125
Come to think of it,

190
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,791
I guess I was feeling
pretty courageous

191
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:31,083
the day I first
talked to you, huh?

192
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,583
[CHIAKI]
Courageous and awkward.

193
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,166
You're nothing if
not consistent.

194
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,208
[KEITA] You know how tough it
is talking to the opposite sex

195
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,500
when you've had no practice?

196
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,875
That's boss level stuff!

197
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,333
[CHIAKI]
Oh, I bet.

198
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,833
I'd go AFK in a heartbeat
if I'd been faced with that.

199
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,416
Thank you.

200
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,625
Though I think luck was with me
when I walked up to your desk.

201
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,291
I noticed how much
fun you were having

202
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,041
playing <i>Aegis Eight</i> that day.

203
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,041
In that moment,
I forgot to be nervous.

204
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,958
It was such a shot
in the arm for me.

205
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,041
I felt like I'd found
a really solid friend.

206
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,416
Then again,

207
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,208
that game was probably also
our ultimate undoing.

208
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,208
You comin'?

209
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,625
[gasps]

210
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,916
Yeah. You know, I had a
different take on that moment.

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,666
I was sitting there,
minding my own business,

212
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,250
when this random creeper comes
up and starts talkin' away!

213
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,500
[grunts]

214
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,750
You just had to strike
down my victory, huh?

215
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,083
Cue the "You Died" screen.

216
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,666
Of course, my
meeting you did lead

217
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,291
to my getting to
meet Uehara, too,

218
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,916
so I suppose I can
cut you some slack.

219
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,208
Uh, sorry to intrude.

220
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,750
Make yourself at home.

221
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,833
No, that's okay.
I'll just grab the pass.

222
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,500
Don't be dumb,
you came all this w--

223
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,166
Why don't you have a cup of tea
before you head back out?

224
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,583
[KEITA]
Okay, then. If you want me to.

225
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,583
[CHIAKI] Have a seat on the
couch and I'll bring it to you!

226
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,458
[CHIAKI gasps]

227
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,291
Pervert! Who said you
could stare at my panties?

228
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,458
I'm sorry! Y'know what?
I think I'm gonna go.

229
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,666
I've had a change of heart!
Stare at 'em all you want!

230
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,958
That doesn't make any
sense! It's a trap!

231
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,500
[growls]

232
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,791
[Hey! You know!

233
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,500
I think I'm gonna go
to my room real quick

234
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,791
so I can charge my
cellphone for a second!

235
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,208
I was about to leave anyway.

236
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,208
Wait!

237
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,458
I promise I'll be
back in no time.

238
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,708
Just stay there!

239
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,458
Keita.

240
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,041
[KEITA]
Chiaki?

241
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,958
[CHIAKI]
Yes?

242
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,208
It started raining a bit.

243
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,250
You probably wanna bring
your laundry inside.

244
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,291
Great. I'll get right
on that. Thanks.

245
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,416
[screams]

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
[screams]

247
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,958
[KEITA]
Whoa, are you okay?

248
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,541
[gasps]

249
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,083
Oh, no! Don't look
at my cellphone!

250
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,750
And definitely don't
look at my computer!

251
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,541
Why don't you want
me looking at it?

252
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,333
[CHIAKI]
No reason!

253
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,875
Uh?

254
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,291
Nobe?

255
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,000
[KEITA]
And Mono?

256
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,791
So be it!

257
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,708
Wait. What's going on?

258
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,583
[CHIAKI] The thing that I'm
about to reveal to you now

259
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,666
is a secret that I had intended
to take to the grave.

260
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,583
Uh. 'Kay?

261
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,125
[CHIAKI] However much I tried
to keep the truth from you,

262
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,041
Fate has brought us here!

263
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,125
As you can see, Nobe's
development site's on my PC,

264
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,791
and Mono's profile
is on my phone,

265
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,708
and the reason for that is....

266
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,583
...they're both--!

267
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,708
Ah, man.

268
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,875
What a great nap!

269
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,791
Konoha?

270
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,916
[KONOHA]
Sorry, Sis.

271
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,541
I flopped here with
the laptop, and--

272
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,875
Uh! It's you!

273
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,041
There you have it!

274
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,916
Nobe and Mono are one person!

275
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,666
And that person is my adorable
little sister, Konoha!

276
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,125
[KEITA, KONOHA]
Huh?

277
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,500
[TASUKU] You're saying Nobe and
Mono are Hoshinomori's sister?

278
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,041
Guess so. It really hit
me outta left field.

279
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,666
That's so random, it almost
doesn't feel real, y'know?

280
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,750
Wait! How are you so chill?

281
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,541
[TASUKU] I spend the past few
days trying to figure out

282
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,791
if I should play Cupid
for her instead of Tendo,

283
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,250
and now he tells me this?

284
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,416
Classic Amano.

285
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,666
[KEITA]
Looking back on it,

286
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,500
Konoha's reaction was
kind of weird, though.

287
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,833
It was almost like she didn't
know what was going on.

288
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,250
[TASUKU]
Gee, ya think?

289
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,166
You both got
clotheslined with it.

290
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,750
So what happened
after the big reveal?

291
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,458
Nothing much.

292
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,875
Don't you dare leave
the living room!

293
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,375
Just sit right
there on the couch.

294
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,875
Uh, okay.

295
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,500
But I really should
be going home soon.

296
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,250
You can leave when I tell you!

297
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,000
[KEITA] I don't know why,
but she was adamant

298
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,875
that I stick around
for a little while.

299
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,791
[TASUKU]
Huh. Weird.

300
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,708
[KEITA] Ten minutes later,
they both came back out.

301
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,500
All right. Let me
officially introduce you.

302
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,583
This is my little
sister, Konoha.

303
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,750
I'm Nobe and Mono.
Nice to finally meet you.

304
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,083
Yama and Tsucchie, right?

305
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,666
Uh, thanks a lot.

306
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,875
[CHIAKI] I only figured out the
link between you two recently,

307
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,250
and I wanted to bring it up
when the time was right.

308
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,958
If I seemed nervous today,
that's totally the reason why.

309
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,666
Yeah, what she said!

310
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,750
[KEITA] It's like I was talking
to dating-sim characters.

311
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,208
But not, like,
a good dating-sim.

312
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,125
So we both said our hellos,

313
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,625
and then Chiaki
finally let me go home.

314
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,375
Something about it still
seems fishy, though.

315
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,583
[TASUKU]
You're tellin' me.

316
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,291
It blows my mind in the good way

317
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,666
that Nobe and Mono turned
out to be the same.

318
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,708
What're the odds of that, right?

319
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,833
What I can't wrap my
brain around is the idea

320
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,166
that they're both
actually Konoha.

321
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,041
When I look at her, I don't see
a programmer or my raid buddy,

322
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,958
I just see some girl.

323
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,125
Ugh!

324
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,541
I know I'm being contrary and
dumb and sexist about it.

325
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,125
I finally get to
meet this person

326
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,666
who's friendship has been solid,
and I just don't know anymore.

327
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,625
[TASUKU] Of course you can't
wrap your brain around it.

328
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,125
The whole thing is BS.

329
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,583
Connect the damn dots, Amano!

330
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,625
I wanna drop some
knowledge so bad,

331
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,291
but it's not my place to go
nuts with the truth-bombs.

332
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,250
Hoshinomori made her
own dumbass decision,

333
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,750
and I gotta respect it.

334
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,875
Don't go tryin' to
be a hero, Tasuku.

335
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,583
This ain't your battle to fight.

336
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:56,416
Seriously, though.
Something's gotta give.

337
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,458
Even if things work out
great for you an' Tendo,

338
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,166
I can't be happy about it.

Nothing! I'm mumbling,
that's all!

Uhh... Bye?

00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,166
[TASUKU] What the hell, brain?
He was sitting right there!

344
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,583
It's true, though. I'm rooting
for Hoshinomori all the way.

345
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:24,333
But I can't work around
that lie she fed him.

346

Even if things work out
great for you an' Tendo,

I can't be happy about it.

348
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,833
Aw, man. So Uehara does
have a thing for Tendo.

349
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:37,791
I don't wanna believe it, but
what other explanation is there?

350
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,166
[KEITA] Maybe there's
some other girl out there

351
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,458
who likes me, too?

352
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,916
And Uehara meant he
supports that pairing

353
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,458
instead of me and Tendo.

354
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,875
Crazy, right?

355
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,375
As if.

356
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:55,333
Let's just stick to reality,
and do the best we can.

Says the guy who goes running
to the dating-sims aisle!

358
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,625
Forgive me, Tendo! Forgive me!

I am loving this illustration!

The colors and the title really
compliment each other!

Konoha's pretty mad,

but Nobe always seemed
so even-tempered online.

Oh, crap!

That wasn't me yelling at you
as Nobe or Mono or anybody!

Just as Konoha! So don't take
it to heart or whatever!

00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,833
[sighs]

472
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,666
Well, I think I'll
call it a day.

473
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,666
Oh, okay.

474
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,708
Maybe I'll see you around
sometime. I guess.

475
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,291
Huh?

476
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,958
Yeah, okay then. That's cool.

477
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,291
See ya later.

478
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,625
Wait! What does that even
mean? I don't get it!

479
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,458
Hello? Uehara? Are you there?

480
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,125
What's wrong, Sis?

481
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,916
That was Uehara.

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,791
He blurted something out in like
a super-serious tone of voice,

483
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:24,708
and then hung up.

484
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,833
[KEITA]
What'd he say?

485
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,958
I think that he said,

486
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:32,500
"I'm choosing you, so just
deal with it, all right?"

487
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,083
[KEITA] But... doesn't
that sound like....

488
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,250
[KEITA, CHIAKI, KONOHA]
...he just confessed his love?!
