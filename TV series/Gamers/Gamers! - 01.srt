your cartridges, loser.

163
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,500
You'll never land a girl
as hot as this one.

164
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,750
Game over.

165
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,041
[KAREN]
There wasn't one,

166
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,750
so I filled out all the
paperwork and started one up.

167
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,333
But I haven't really gone
on a big recruiting push yet.

168
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,083
[KEITA]
Well, you are a busy person.

169
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,125
You, too?

170
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,208
[KEITA]
Uh...?

171
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,958
It's kind of a thing.

172
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,250
People bending over
backwards to indulge me

173
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,708
whenever I talk to 'em.

174
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,458
So, uh, that happens a lot?

175
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,125
Yup. Even my teachers
are super understanding

176
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,375
when I forget my homework.

177
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,708
[KEITA laughs]

178
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,875
Heck, King Koopa rolled
out all the stops for me,

179
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,708
and I was only there
to jump on his head!

180
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,208
Whoa! Uh!

181
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,166
Hold on a sec!
I know a lie when I hear it!

182
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,750
I wish! It was awkward.

183
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,666
That might've been
a bug, you know.

184
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,916
Yeah, ya think?!

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,666
How did you get King Koopa
to make small talk

186
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,833
and serve you tea?!

187
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,541
I had pulled three
all-nighters in a row

188
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,333
trying to turn in a
world-record speed-run.

189
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,291
The Koopa thing was a dream!

190
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,250
I should have guessed
as much from the start!

191
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,666
You're the one who glitched out,
Tendo, not him!

192
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,875
[laughs]

193
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,833
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,500
Kinda went off on a tangent.

195
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,875
That's fine.

196
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,125
I'm just surprised that you
liking gaming so much.

197
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,541
You're really into it.

198
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,458
[KAREN] My friends don't
know this side of me,

199
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,833
for the most part.

200
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,458
Believe it or not, the whole
reason I came to Otobuki

201
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,875
is 'cause it had this
god-tier game club.

202
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:20,916
[KEITA]
Huh?

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,833
It fell apart
before we enrolled,

204
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,791
so they took it off the list.

205
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,833
Oh. I never would've guessed.

206
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,041
[KAREN]
Yeah.

207
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,583
That's why...

208
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,708
...I gave it my all behind
the scenes last year to

209
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,416
breathe life back into the game
club which is why this year,

210
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,750
it became an official
student group again!

211
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,916
Uh! Congrats on
pulling that off.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,833
Oh, stop it.

213
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,708
So, then what exactly
does a game club do, anyway?

214
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:51,791
[laughs] You know,
you can probably guess.

215
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,250
We play as a group.

216
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,708
But we can get serious,
too, believe me.

217
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,166
When it's time to
bring our A-game,

218
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,000
we bring it and then some.

219
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,083
[KEITA]
Oh. That's cool.

220
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,541
[KAREN]
It is!

221
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,375
That's why I've been looking
to enlist some new blood.

222
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,041
That rare student who is
a gamer through and through.

223
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:12,041
Maybe someone like...
Keita Amano.

224
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,666
[KAREN]
Whaddya say?

225
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,125
You don't mind stopping
by our club room sometime

226
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,833
just to give it a look, right?

227
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,041
What's up, Amano?

228
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,625
[phone vibrates]

229
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,583
[KAREN]
Oh, no! It's my mom!

230
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,208
I gotta go! She flips out
when I'm home too late.

231
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,250
Anyway, give it some thought!

232
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,458
G'night, then!

233
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,291
Wait for me in class
after school lets out.

234
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll come get ya!

235
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,500
Uh... Okay.

236
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,458
Have a good night.

00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,125
[laughs] Game club.

238
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,875
Ahh! Who'd have thought
fate would drop something

239
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,458
as amazing as this in my lap?

240
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,708
This isn't a dream, right?

241
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,625
No, of course not!
It's better than a dream!

242
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,875
Uh?!

243
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,666
Uh... Oh, good. It's just Mono.

244
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,583
False alarm.

while to get here.

249
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,916
Oh, no, it's fine!

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I was just killing
some time with this!

251
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,333
Huh. So you play mobile
games, too, Amano?

252
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,541
[KEITA]
So... very close!

253
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,875
Uh...

[KEITA]
Oh my god!

It doesn't matter what
I'm playing on my phone!

256
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,750
Let's just go check out
the club room already, okay?

257
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,250
Huh? Ah!

258
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,916
Good idea. Then, follow me!

[KEITA]
Forgive me, Mono.

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,875
The dating-sim gods have chosen
me, and I must heed the call!

Why, hello there.

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,583
I'm Eiichi Misumi.

[KEITA]
Uh, Tendo? What's going on?

265
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,541
Oh, yeah.
Guess I didn't tell you.

266
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,750
You're not the first person I've
invited to join the game club.

267
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,750
Misumi? This is Keita
Amano from Class F.

268

[KEITA]
Uh! It's a pleasure to meet you!

He was glued to one of
those arcade puzzle games

270
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,166
first time I met him.

271
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,125
Huh? Please don't
tell people about that!

272
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,750
It's kind of embarrassing.

273
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,583
You're kidding, right? But you
were playing it so masterfully!

274
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,583
Be proud!

275
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,291
Nah. I'm average.

[EIICHI]
Amano.

278
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,291
Um. I don't have many companions
to speak of, honestly.

279
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,833
So I...

280
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,541
Well, it would mean
the world to me

281
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,375
if you and I could be friends.

282
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,916
Thank you! That'd be awesome!

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,833
No. Thank you. Really.

[STUDENTS chattering, laughing]

286
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,333
[EIICHI]
I'm not complaining,

287
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,791
but I'm surprised the
school approved

288
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,208
of a game club to begin with.

289
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,791
[KAREN]
I know, right?

290
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,375
But we're a lot less slap-dash
than you guys might be thinking.

291
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,375
I do run a pretty tight ship.

[KEITA]
How so?

It's easier if I show you.

thing to tell them.

of a bout, so, yeah...

know it to look at him,

00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,958
Oh, wow! That's <i>COS</i> , huh!

321
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,791
My goodness. I've never
seen a game like this one.

322
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,166
Uh! Have you really never
seen an FPS, Misumi?

323
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,875
Well, if it isn't a puzzle game,
then I don't have a clue.

324
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,000
Wow. Specific.

325
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,125
[KEITA]
Another headshot!

326
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,000
All the equipment in this room
was purchased with prize money

327
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,833
from the game
competitions we've won!

328
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,375
Prize money?!

329
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,083
[EIICHI] I'm starting to get
what you meant when you told us

330
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,916
you run a pretty tight ship.

331
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,291
All right!

332
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,166
Now that I've given you
the grand tour of the club,

333
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,375
grab a controller!

334
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,083
[gasps]

335
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,208
Let's see what you've got.

336
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,625
Ha, ha!

337
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,208
Oh, man! That was
a lot of fun, huh.

338
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,375
[GAKUTO]
Next match.

339
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,875
[KEITA]
Huh...?

340
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,208
[sighs] I'm a little wiped out.

341
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,375
I think I'm gonna take a break.

342
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,666
[GAKUTO]
Breaks are for noobs.

343
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,208
Get ready.

344
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,625
Good teamwork, everyone.

345
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,541
I'm just gonna call it a day!

346
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,083
[GAKUTO]
We're waiting on you.

347
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,958
Choose your load-out.

348
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,000
[KEITA groans]

349
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,791
[KAREN]
It's his first time here, Kase,

350
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,083
you should go easy on him!

351
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,791
But what's the point
of coddling them?

352
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,833
It's just going to get them
killed down the line.

353
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,833
[KAREN]
You're always such a sourpuss.

354
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,458
Our guests are gonna run
off and never look back!

355
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,333
[KEITA]
That was unbelievable.

356
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,250
You dominated every map.

357
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,958
Even with the bots all
turned up like crazy hard!

358
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,416
The bots were all set
on novice mode.

359
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,916
You, though.

360
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,666
Was today really your
first time playing <i>COS</i> ?

361
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,625
I've never had a noob
take me out three times

362
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,250
in a single match before.

363
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,958
[KEITA, KAREN gasp]

364
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,916
Just beginner's luck, I guess.

365
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,083
I tried to imitate whatever
I saw you doing

366
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,458
when I would look over.

367
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,166
That's incredible, Misumi!

368
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,208
And you're sure you've never
picked this up before?

369
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,500
[EIICHI]
Not once.

370
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,500
This was my first FPS.

371
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,000
Turns out they're pretty fun!

372
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,500
I guess you're natural! Bravo!

373
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,208
[EIICHI]
Uh... Heh. It was nothing.

374
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,500
I see a spark of
potential within you.

375
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,750
Having the presence of mind

376
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,458
to copy techniques
from other players

377
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:21,166
is legit one of the best ways
to work on your FPS chops.

378
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,125
Oh, wow. Thanks so much.

379
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,583
[GAKUTO]
Back to the scrub...

380
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,833
--Huh?
--[GAKUTO] Yes, you!

381
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,583
[screams] Sir!

382
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,833
[GAKUTO] Why the hell were
you jumping up and down

383
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,166
like you had a damn death-wish?!

384
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,541
Oh! It's because

385
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,500
I was kinda curious about
what sort of scenery

386
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,375
might be on the
other side of that wall.

387
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,458
[GAKUTO sighs]
What are you, a tourist?!

388
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,208
You're supposed to
help your teammates!

389
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,250
[KEITA]
Uh...

390
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,833
[gasps]

391
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,333
Don't let it bug you!

392
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,666
He's just really passionate
about first-person shooters.

393
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,208
I'm sorry, Amano.

394
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,458
It's fine.

395
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,583
[GAKUTO]
Hmph.

396
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,500
Don't wanna get a blood-clot!

397
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,208
How 'bout we all take a break?

398
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,583
[laughs]

399
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,250
This breeze is heavenly.

400
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,000
[KEITA]
Look at the two of them go.

401
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,666
They're not stopping
for anything!

402
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,958
What can I tell you?

403
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,166
They're both gamers
right down to their core.

404
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,541
They'd starve to death if I
didn't remind them to eat.

405
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,875
[KEITA]
Uh-huh... Hm.

406
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,416
I meant to ask before,
but what made the two of you

407
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,000
take up gaming in
the first place?

408
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,458
Uh, like, a reason?

409
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,708
[KAREN] Mm-hm. Can you think
back to anything specific?

410
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,250
What do you mean?

411
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,625
For example, Kasay's dad
is a mercenary,

412
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,541
and he trained him in the
family business as a kid,

413
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,708
so of course he's crazy
good at shooters.

414
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,083
Meanwhile, Oiso's trying
to bring her best friend

415
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,333
back from the dark side,
which will probably involve

416
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,458
defeating her in
one-on-one combat.

417
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,375
[KEITA]
Who are these people?!

418
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,541
[KEITA]
I guess I play 'cause...

419
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:55,375
...'cause games are fun
and I like playing 'em?

420
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,041
[KEITA]
That was not the right answer...

421
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,250
Oh! Right on!

422
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,500
As generic reasons go,
that one's a winner!

423
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,916
Uh! Your turn, Misumi.

424
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,625
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

425
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,500
You want to know
why I play games?

426
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,708
I guess my reason isn't
that compelling, either.

427
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,625
[sighs]

428
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,958
[KEITA]
Thank goodness.

429
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,291
I lost my memory,
and the only link to my past

430
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,000
seems to be my skill
at block puzzles.

431
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,833
Uh... I'm sorry.

432
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,083
It's a conversation-killer.

433
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,875
[KEITA]
Misumi, you traitor!

434
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,333
[clears throat] So,
in a nutshell, that's us!

435
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,750
After this meeting, do you
guys have a pretty good idea

436
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,875
of what our club is all about?

437
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,166
--[EIICHI] Uh-huh.
--[KEITA] Uh. Yeah.

438
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,083
I know our charter members
can be a little intimidating,

439
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,541
but their hearts are
in the right place,

440
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,791
so don't let them spook you.

441
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,500
And please, don't feel like you
have to be the best gamer ever

442
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,958
to be welcomed into our ranks.

443
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,625
Everyone's got room
for improvement,

444
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,583
no matter where they're
at when they join us.

445
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,541
It's our mission to foster that.

446
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,958
We work hard and we play hard,
every day.

447
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,083
And if you're still interested
in coming aboard,

448
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,416
just say the word!

449
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,208
I am! I had so much
fun this afternoon.

450
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,833
I would be honored
to join the club!

451
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,208
Why, thank you!

452
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,125
What do you say, Amano?

453
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,083
Will you be in the
game club with me?

454
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,125
I'd love to have you!

455
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,166
[KEITA]
Tendo...

456
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,791
Misumi...

457
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,583
You're gonna need help.

458
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:17,625
But stick with us and I'll have
you up to snuff in no time, kid.

459
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,083
Thanks, you guys.

460
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,333
[KEITA]
They'd be my friends.

461
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,000
The first ones I've
ever made here.

462
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,916
Yeah, they've got their quirks,
but really, don't we all?

463
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,375
And then, there's Tendo's smile.

464
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,166
[KAREN laughs]

465
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,666
[KEITA] Games and friendship
in one place.

466
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,083
I feel like I should
pinch myself.

467
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,916
This is one of those chances
you wait your whole life for!

468
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,583
[KEITA]
Nah. I think I'm gonna pass.

469
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,250
It doesn't look like
this club plays

470
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,125
the sort of games I'm into.

471
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,666
[KAREN, EIICHI, GAKUTO]
Huh...?

472
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,833
[KEITA]
You idiot!

473
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,916
Why?! Why did you tell her no?!

474
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,750
Wasn't that literally
the best possible thing

475
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,000
anyone could ever
have offered you?!

476

Wh-Why are you here?

[laughs] You still chuggin'
away at that mobile game?

00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,833
Okay. Anyway.

483
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,833
Amano. I still want
you to join our club.

484

So, are you game?

00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,708
I admit, I'm pretty
interested in you!

I had missed it.

Ah! Tendo!

I'm so sorry. You were talking!

No problem!

I am sorry, though.

I know you want me to join the
game club, but I can't, Tendo.

Are... Are you worried
that you might not be able


502
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,458
to keep up with the rest of us?

Because that's not a problem!

getting everyone up to speed!

[KEITA]
It's like I told you yesterday.


509
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,750
The whole reason I
play games is for fun.


510
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,708
Once you add competition
to the mix,


511

I don't have a very good time.

Listen, Tendo.

The game club is a
great bunch of people.

It's not you, it's me!

I really mean that!


516

But, I just wanna keep playing
games the way I always have!

I...

518
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,041
I feel so rejected right now.

519
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,500
Uh! Yeah! But thanks
for the invitation,


520
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:29,916
it's cool that you
thought of me.

You're nothing to me, Amano!


523
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,375
And you, you suck at games!


524

It's not like I enjoyed spending
time with you or anything!

So, there!

Keep up the good work with
the game club, Tendo,
