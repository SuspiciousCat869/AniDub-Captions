1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,958
[EIICHI] This town is
full of ordinary people,

2
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,083
living out their ordinary lives.

3
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,250
Must be nice.

4
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,250
I wouldn't know.

5
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,125
Three years ago...

6
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,875
...I suddenly came to, playing
a puzzle game at the arcade,

7
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,000
stark naked, and no
memory of who I was.

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,750
I was roaming the mean streets,
when out of nowhere...

9
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,125
[RIKI screams]

10
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,666
Stop it! Let go of me!

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,291
[EIICHI yells]

12
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:58,875
[EIICHI]
I don't know why those two thugs

13
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,208
were trying to nab the girl,

14
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,750
but I sent 'em packin'.

15
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,875
Her parents were thrilled
that she was safe,

16
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,166
and adopted me by
way of a reward.

17
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,125
Can't say who I was before,

18
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,833
but I was Misumi Eiichi
from that day onward.

19
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,250
Don't get the wrong idea.

20
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,833
Just because I had a new family
and a roof over my head,

21
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,791
I wasn't living on Easy Street.

22
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,666
That covert organization
was still gunning for Riki,

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,291
and I think I vaguely
remember them

24
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,208
messing with me somehow.

25
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,958
Speaking of Riki,
she blows her top

26
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,125
whenever I mention
the girls at school.

27
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,500
On the bright side,

28
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,541
I recently joined the gaming
club at my new school,

29
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,875
and they're good people.

30
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,166
The training regimen is
tough, but it's paid off.

31
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,958
Encouraged by my
recent improvement,

32
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,333
I signed up for
this year's TVGT,

33
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,083
or Total Video Game Tournament,

34
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,125
to see how far I could get.

35
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:46,916
One by one, my opponents
fell before me.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,333
If I can win this match,
I'll be in the finals.

37
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,333
[GIRL]
Sorry, not today.

38
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,041
Nice winning streak
you've got there.

39
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,333
A shame if something
happened to it!

40
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,916
Hope you're
ready to lose, Eiichi!

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,791
[gasps]

42
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,250
My own sister? But why?

43
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,750
[RIKI]
Curious!

44
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,416
No sign of that Tendo girl
you're always rambling on about.

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,083
[EIICHI] That's right. Tendo
had a prior engagement today.

46
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,250
What made you think to
even bring her up, Riki?

47
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,791
[RIKI]
Huh? I just-- No reason at all!

48
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,416
When it comes to video games,
I don't pull any punches.

49
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,708
Not even for you!

50
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,333
I'd expect nothing less.

51
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,208
Hope you can forgive the
beating you're about to get!

52
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,208
[EIICHI] I wonder if Tendo
and Amano are on the bus

53
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,083
at this very moment.

54
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,875
I hope they have as
much fun as I'm about to!

55
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,625
[yells]

56
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,041
As I've told you all before now,

57
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,333
the boys and girls
will be sleeping

58
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,500
in separate rooms on this trip.

59
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,000
Our parents are putting a
lot of faith in us, y'know?

60
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,000
And that means we will all
be on our best behavior

61
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,708
until we're home again.

62
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,333
There will be no
flirting allowed!

63
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,791
Uh, right.

64
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,791
What?

65
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:26,958
Why'm I'm going
out to this place

66
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,166
if I can't even get
cuddly with Tasuku?

67
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,333
It's a training retreat for
the gamer meet-up group.

68
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,916
I knew you were gonna play,

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,125
but I didn't think you were
gonna play the whole time!

70
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,458
That is so boring!

71
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,875
[KAREN] Hey! It's not
boring. It's useful!

72
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,000
[CHIAKI] You said it! We're
gonna have a great time!

73
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,666
I'm a little worried about
this trip, to tell the truth.

74
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,166
[TASUKU chuckles nervously]

75
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,833
[TASUKU] At least Hoshinomori
won't be the odd one out,

76
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,958
since Tendo's putting the kibosh
on the lovey-dovey stuff.

77
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,750
Just gotta say, though,

78
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,500
for a trip where there's
no flirting allowed,

79
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,708
you're pretty dolled up.

80
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,291
What on earth are
you getting at?

81
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,875
It's called accessorizing, and
it's something girls do, okay?

82
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,708
[ALL gasp]

83
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,083
[KEITA]
Too hot!

Oww...

00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,750
Aw, what's the matter?

86
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,250
Is the water too hot for your
delicate wittle baby toes?

87
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,500
Hey! The water's way
hotter on this side!

88
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,083
Check it out!

89
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,208
Splash war!

[BOTH laughing]

00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,000
[TASUKU]
Ahem!

92
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,250
Hey, Amano.

93
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,875
Is it true you bought
another random game

94
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,416
that doesn't have
much going for it?

95
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,208
That's basically what I did.

96
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,250
I thought I had stumbled
onto a hidden gem,

97
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,708
but I guess I grabbed a copy
of <i>Elders Hunt</i> by mistake.

98
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,791
I don't think I've heard
of that title before!

99
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,416
Wha'd'ya buy?

100
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,791
[TASUKU] Dude, that game's got
a reputation for being crappy.

101
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,166
[KEITA]
Yeah.

102
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,000
And they won't take it back,
even with the receipt.

103
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,041
That's 6,000 yen down the drain.

104
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,083
[KAREN]
Every gamer has known that pain.

105
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,375
I don't understand.

106
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,333
Why do you pay so much
for all these games?

107
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,458
It seems like a big waste.

108
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,875
[ALL]
Gulp.

109
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:03,500
I mean, 6,000 does sound
steep when you think about it,

110
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,791
but I know you've
got clothes that are

111
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,500
way more expensive than that.

112
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,625
Well, yeah.

113
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,625
'Cause clothes are
one of those things

114
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,083
you end up using
every single day.

115
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,208
Not the same thing.

116
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,291
You don't need video
games to live.

117
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,000
Thousands of yen,
just flying away.

118
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,083
[KEITA, KAREN, CHIAKI]
No-no-no-no!

119
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,666
Wait a minute!

120
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,208
There are plenty of things that
aren't necessary for survival

121
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,583
that are still tons of fun!

122
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,416
Going to the movies while
you're out on a date,

123
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,375
hitting up the bowling alley,

124
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,166
slowly undressing
Amano with your eyes

125
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,708
while he talks about stuff!

126
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,875
Useless, but you wouldn't get
rid of them, now would you?

127
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,833
I don't wanna see Amano
without his clothes,

128
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,375
so that's out.

129
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,333
Games aren't fun like
bowling and movies are,

130
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,541
so what's your point?

131
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,458
Why the hell would we
bother playing them

132
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,583
if we weren't having fun?

133
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,583
Try to calm down.

134
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,708
Even if games aren't
your own cup of tea,

135
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,083
they're definitely fun for
people who like them.

136
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,083
So you see, in the
traditional sense,

137
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,125
it doesn't matter
if they're useful.

138
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,541
And, yeah, I like
to stare at Tendo

139
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,291
while she's talking
about stuff, too,

140
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,666
but without the naked part.

141
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,500
Hope that's okay.

142
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,333
Oh, Amano.

143
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,500
Way to rock the whole
"no flirting" thing.

144
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,875
[AGURI]
Movies are like two hours,

145
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,958
unless they're about those
little hairy-feet guys.

146
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,958
And bowling is kinda
like working out.

147
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,125
But games go on forever.

148
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,875
You all just sit there,
bleep-blooping your life away.

149
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,291
Those bleeps and bloops weave
a tapestry of high adventure!

150
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,750
Tell 'er, Tendo!

151
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,166
Young people are adrift in
a sea of post-modern dread.

152
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,833
Sure, they're long, but without
games to act as a life-raft

153
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,708
for those born after
the death of truth,

154
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,375
there's nothing left to hold
the soul-crushing ennui at bay!

--That was awesome!
--Way to go!

[AGURI]
Hmm...

00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,166
Yeah, but if it's all that
great junk you said,

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,291
shouldn't you look happy the
whole time you're playing?

00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,541
I mean, leveling up
or whatever's

160
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,833
a pain in the butt, right?

161
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,083
[ALL gasp]

162
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,833
[CHIAKI] Um! Games are
fun across the board!

163
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,625
So since leveling up is part
of the gameplay experience,

164
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,083
it's gotta be fun!

165
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,250
But if that's true, then why
is it that people pass out

166
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,916
while they're playing sometimes,
right in the middle of the game?

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,875
Either it's so boring
they can't stay awake,

168
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,750
or it's so brutal that
it kicks their butt.

169
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,458
[ALL]
Headshot!

170
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,250
[AGURI] Doing the same
thing over and over again

171
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,000
just to get more experience
points sounds pretty blah.

172
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,083
What could ever
be fun about that?

173
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,125
[CHIAKI chuckles]

174
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,583
[CHIAKI]
Oh, but you see,

175
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,083
there are different ways to
multitask when you grind,

176
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,208
and if you do it right,
the time flies by!

177
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,541
[AGURI] Wow! You can do
something else while you play?

178
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,458
Gamers must be pretty
smart to pull that off!

179
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,708
[CHIAKI chuckles]

180
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,083
[CHIAKI] Well, it's a
very specific skill-set.

181
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,208
But it means I'm right.

182
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,708
If leveling up weren't boring,

183
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,625
you wouldn't want something
else to do while you do it.

184
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,666
[TASUKU]
Um, speaking of leveling up,

185
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,708
I think we're way under-leveled
for this nice of a room.

186
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,916
I can't believe we
really get to stay here!

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,416
You picked a winner, Tendo!

188
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,083
No kidding! So what
do we do now?

189
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,333
[KAREN laughs]

190
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,666
We came all this way on
a gamers meet-up trip.

191
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,250
There's only one thing to do.

192
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,875
Plug in the ol' PZ4!

193
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,750
I'm so glad you brought that!

194
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,916
They came all this way to do
the stuff they do at home?

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,666
[TASUKU]
Woo! Ha-ha.

196
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,833
I am stuffed!

197
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,416
[AGURI]
Hmm...

198
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,916
Looks like new games are pretty
much 6,000 across the board.

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,375
Wait! Says this one goes for
10,000! Are you kidding me?

200
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,083
I guess it's got a
book of concept art

201
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,666
and a download code
for launch-day DLC.

202
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,541
Hey, guys, what's DLC
stand for, huh?

203
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,916
It's "downloadable
content" abbreviated.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,750
Launch-day DLC could be costumes

205
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,416
for your characters
to wear in the game.

206
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,666
That is a popular one.

207
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,000
People give 'em real money

208
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,750
so they can play dress-up
with their characters

209
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,333
in some video game?

210
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:21,916
That's lame.

211
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,750
[BOTH gasp]

212
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,166
Hey! Don't look at me!

213
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,291
That kind of DLC doesn't
interest me in the slightest!

214
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,750
Yeah! I would never!

215
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,291
[AGURI]
Tendo said "that kind,"

216
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,458
meaning you like other
kinds of it, don't'cha?

217
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,708
[BOTH]
If there's a bikini pack,

218
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,250
you better believe
I'm buying it.

219
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,250
[GIRLS]
Huh?

220
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,083
[KEITA, TASUKU]
I regret nothing.

221
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,666
[AGURI] Earlier today, when I
said games were too expensive,

222
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,958
you brought up how real-life
clothes can be even worse.

223
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,625
But if it turns out
you're spending money

224
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,833
on clothes either way,

225
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,833
why not just get 'em
for your own self?

226
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,625
Uh, the characters you control

227
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,166
end up being kind of an
extension of yourself.

228
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,791
So if I buy them a cool outfit,

229
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,916
I'm still expressing
my individuality.

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,208
--Uh-huh!
--[KATSUKU, KAREN] Mh-hm!

231
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,291
If you say so.

232
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,750
I'm still not convinced
of this whole

233
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,916
"buying clothes I get
nothing out of" thing.

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,500
But! You do get
something out of 'em!

235
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,000
How do I put it?

236
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,333
Ah!

237
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,166
What would you say if
Uehara here surprised you

238
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,041
with the gift of a
really nice ring?

239
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:13,875
[TASUKU]
Huh?

240
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,250
Huh? If he bought me a ring?

241
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,041
I'd be freaking
overjoyed, of course!

242
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:17,958
[TASUKU]
Uh.

243
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,458
[KEITA]
So now that you have it,

244
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,875
do you equip it or
leave it in the box?

245
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,166
Your call.

246
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,833
How do I equip it? Do you
mean, like, wear it?

247
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,875
'Cause if they mean the
same thing, then you bet.

248
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,875
[KEITA] And would your love
for Uehara get stronger

249
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,916
as a result of that?

250
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,041
Yeah, I guess I'd love
him even more then.

251
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,791
Not that that's possible,
so whatever, you know?

252
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,958
There.

253
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,541
Then I welcome you to
the ranks of those

254
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,791
who accept the idea of DLC.

255
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,125
Oh, yeah, I get it now.
When you put it like that--

256
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,625
Hey, wait! That's totally
apples and oranges!

257
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,541
[KEITA]
Allow me to clarify, then.

258
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,750
In that example,
Uehara buys you an item

259
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,916
that raises your love
stat when equipped,

260
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and he does it with real money!

261
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,250
Hey! Watch your mouth!

262
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,291
It sounds all weird when
you say it like that!

263
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,416
I understand.

264
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,458
If Tasuku got trapped
in a video game,

265
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,708
and it was impossible
to pull him back out,

266
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,916
I could buy these digital
items you're talking about

267
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,791
to doll him up.

268
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,375
Whoa, time out!

269
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,958
Why are you so chill about me
getting trapped inside a game

270
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,083
in the first place, Aguri?

271
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,500
[KEITA]
That's not all.

272
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,041
You could also change your
player-character's outfits

273
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,000
and then see Uehara's
reaction to them.

274
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,500
Maybe he'd start
blushing, or acting shy.

275
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,458
The sky's the limit with DLC!

276
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,208
Aw! I want costume DLC!
Where do I get it?

277
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,541
Cut it out!

278
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,833
I am not getting stuck in
a damn video game, okay?

279
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,666
As for you!

280
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,125
You don't have to change
what you're wearing

281
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,458
in order to make me all bashful.

282
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,250
[AGURI]
Oh, Tasuku.

283
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,500
Buy a loot box for the
chance to win this snapshot

284
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,666
of teenage love for
a mere 300 yen!

285
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,166
I can win this? I'll
take a hundred boxes!

286
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,333
Right away, ma'am.

287
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,583
Damn it all!

288
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,125
Don't use me as a prop
for in-game purchases!

289
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,541
[laughing]

290
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,250
Hey! Thirty thousand yen to buy
Tasuku's tender moments?

291
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,750
Shut up and take
my money already!

292
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,791
Snap out of the
DLC-madness, Aguri!

293
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,041
Save your money.

294
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,333
They're just catering
to the gatcha addiction!

295
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,125
There's nothing in those boxes

296
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,750
I can't give you for free.

297
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,041
[AGURI]
Tasuku.

298
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,208
Though the odds are 5,000 to 1.

299
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,750
And that's how the free-game
industry stays afloat.

300
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, it makes sense.
You're very informative.

301
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,291
Oh, stop. It was nothing.

302
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,791
Hey, you guys! I think I
understand video games!

303
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,500
[ALL gasp]

304
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,708
[AGURI]
Mh-hm!

305
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,250
It's so clear!

306
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,791
Games are bull[beep]!
Am I right?

307
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,333
[OTHERS screaming]

308
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,458
[KEITA]
So much for that.

309
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,708
[AGURI]
I was thinking about it more.

310
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,375
Is it true that there are games

311
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,416
where you pay however
much it costs up front,

312
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,458
and then you don't even get
to play the whole thing

313
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,375
without buying something else?

314
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,750
Yeah! People are
talking about it.

315
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,458
"The pay-to-win model
is such a load of crap.

316
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,333
Paid players are unbeatable
in multiplayer mode.

317
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,125
Sometimes the single-player
story isn't even finished.

318
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,416
They rip off the
end of the game,

319
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
and then they sell it
back to us as DLC."

320
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,583
[TASUKU] Well, it's not every
studio is greedy like that.

321
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,375
[AGURI] But it says here
that big franchises

322
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,708
do it all the time.

323
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,541
So doesn't that mean
the video game industry

324
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,500
is in some pretty bad trouble?

325
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:20,333
Uh, not every piece of
DLC is inherently bad.

326
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,791
Aren't you glad
when a show you like

327
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,375
comes out with a bonus episode?

328
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,958
Just a little something
after the plot wraps up?

329
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,166
Yeah. I guess.

330
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,500
[TASUKU]
Amano's right.

331
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,708
Sometimes the players ask
for more content as DLC,

332
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,000
so that's all good.

333
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,458
Ahh.

334
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,416
What kind of content would
you ask for as DLC, Tasuku?

335
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,166
In a perfect world, all
of the girls would get--

336
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,416
Higher difficulty!

337
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,958
That's what I want a dev
team to give me for DLC!

338
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:44,958
[AGURI sighs]

339
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,000
This hot spring
is like paradise!

340
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,083
The water's so hot,
and the view!

341
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,375
It's out of this world, right?

342
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,833
So right!

343
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,958
But harder difficulty
just means the game

344
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,250
is gonna be harder to
play your way though.

345
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,416
I'm sorry, I keep trying
to make sense of it,

346
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,958
but there's no light-bulb yet.

347
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,375
When you achieve
something tough

348
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,875
that you've put your mind to,
doesn't it feel good?

349
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,875
[AGURI] Yeah, that makes sense
to me, but it's real-life.

350
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,958
Well, when a super-tough
level in a game

351
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,958
is torturing you mercilessly,
it feels just as good

352
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,333
because you know you'll
eventually get through it!

353
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,625
[AGURI]
I'm sorry.

354
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,541
Tell me that one more time,
with fewer words.

355
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,041
Fine. What I'm saying
is pain can feel good.

356
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,291
That short enough for you?

357
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,041
[AGURI]
Wait, this is getting weird.

358
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,416
I thought we were
talking about games,

359
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,208
but I feel like now we
took this hard left turn

360
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,333
into funky sexual
stuff you're into.

361
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,583
Hey, what the hell?

362
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,541
Liking a challenge is
universal to all gamers.

363
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,333
It's nothing sexual! Right?

364
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,708
[CHIAKI]
Huh?

365
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,333
Ahem.

366
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,708
Look, call it whatever.

367
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,416
I want video games to be
more challenging in general.

368
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,041
If nothing else, at least I know

369
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,958
my fellow members of the gaming
club get where I'm coming from.

370
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,958
[AGURI] And now I know that
all four of you in the club

371
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,791
are total pain-loving
masochists.

372
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,208
I never would've suspected it,

373
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,000
but I bet ya sit around looking
at "game over" screens

374
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,083
and getting all tingly, huh?

375
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,708
That is not true!

376
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, not gonna lie, I do enjoy
a good "game over" screen.

377
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,250
[AGURI]
Seriously?

378
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,125
Then are all gamers...
pain-loving deviants?

379
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,375
Is my beloved Tasuku
some kind of weirdo?

380
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,250
No, we're not!

381
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,250
Everyone likes different stuff.

382
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,041
Personally, I'm really into
the epilogue after an RPG,

383
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,458
when I find out what happened
to the members of my party.

384
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,625
Okay. I guess there's nothing
too weird about that.

385
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,166
You know what?

386
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,916
I want an epilogue where the
hero and heroine turn into fish,

387
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,708
and everybody freaks out because
they can't change 'em back!

388
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,833
That would automatically become

389
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,291
my favorite RPG
epilogue of all time!

390
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,500
I don't wanna
burst your bubble,

391
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,000
but that sounds super creepy.

392
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,875
Uh. Sorry if I gave you
the wrong idea just then.

393
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,541
I assumed it would be at the
end of a classic fantasy title,

394
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,041
not something more modern-day.

395
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,458
[AGURI] Turning into fish is
weird no matter what, okay?

396
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,500
Why can't they be fish
from the very start?

397
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,958
How come you wanna
mess with the player

398
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,416
after they've spent
all that time with 'em?

399
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,750
[CHIAKI chuckles]

400
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,666
[CHIAKI] Don't be silly,
Aguri. That wouldn't work!

401
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,041
It's the fact that
they've been people

402
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,375
for the last 30 or 40 hours
that packs such a punch

403
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,166
when they go
fish-mode at the end!

404
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,791
The player never sees it coming!

405
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, man.

406
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,833
I've probably talked to
crazy people before,

407
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,625
but this is the first time
I've known it for sure.

408
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,125
[CHIAKI]
Excuse me?

409
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,666
Any self-respecting gamer yearns
for a fish-morphing twist

410
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,583
in the epilogue of their RPGs!

411
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,125
Right?

412
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,791
[KAREN gasps]

413
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,666
[KAREN]
Uhh...

414
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,416
[CHIAKI] I guess if they turn
into something other than fish,

415
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,750
that works, too.

416
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,125
I don't think the kind
of animal's the issue.

417
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,666
[CHIAKI]
Really, though,

418
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,250
DLC is kinda like a spin-off
of the vanilla game experience.

419
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,958
If they're not going to
push the envelope a little,

420
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,333
why even bother?

421
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,875
[AGURI]
That kind of makes sense to me,

422
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,416
but why go so crazy with it?

423
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,750
Why not?

424
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,583
If your favorite manga
had a fish version of it,

425
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,000
you'd wanna check
it out, right?

426
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,958
I like my favorite
manga the way it is!

427
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,916
Yeah, about
genetically-modified fish

428
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,833
that fight cockroach-men on Mars
in order to save the world!

429
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,833
We could call it <i>Aqua-Formars</i> !

430
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:47,875
Wouldn't that be awesome?

431
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,291
[KAREN]
Leave fish-manity alone!

432
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,458
Oh, wow! That actually sounds
like a pretty good read!

433
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,208
Hey, not to be that girl,

434
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,125
but the heroes in the fish
version of the story

435
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,875
can only survive underwater.

436
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,708
Mars is a desert planet!
Fish-manity is doomed!

437
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,250
[CHIAKI]
They'll be all right!

438
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,625
The point is, DLC should be
completely removed and crazy,

439
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,958
compared to the original story!

440
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,958
Yeah, I see the logic
in all that stuff

441
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,708
you've been going on about,

442
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,416
but I don't buy it.

443
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,583
Huh?

What'cha doin', Tendo?

I don't know what
you're talking about!

446
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,208
I'm definitely not
trying to listen in

447
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,750
on the boys' conversation
or anything!

[sighs]

449
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,208
I think I prefer epilogue DLC,
but nothing too crazy in it.

00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,375

451
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,708
[TASUKU]
Mh-hm.

452
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,666
Then again, there's something
to be said for DLC

453
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,458
that just ratchets
up the difficulty.

454
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,083
How do you live, Amano?
You're terminally vanilla.

What's it matter to you?

456
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,916
When it comes to
wacky sidekicks,

457
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,250
you kinda leave a
lot to be desired.

458
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,833
Well, it's not like I wake up in
the morning striving for that.

459
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,083
And you don't have glasses,

460
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,333
so you can't play the
straight-man, either.

461

If that's my personality,

462
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,083
why do I need specific
eyewear to qualify?

463

Why don'tcha try to win
a pair outta some loot box?

464
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,625
That kind of additional
content is boring!

I'll throw in 2,000 yen,

469
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,083
There!

470
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,291
[KEITA]
Huh?

471
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,291
[KAREN screams]

472
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,333
All right. There we go!

473
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,958
If I don't get to,
then no one does!

474
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,541
[TASUKU, AGURI whine]

475
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,458
[KEITA]
Hey, I've been thinking about

476
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,250
the DLC issue some more.

477
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,208
What do you think of one
where the hero and heroine

478
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,791
get to live happily ever after?

479
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,375
[TASUKU]
Dude, where's the gameplay?

480
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,166
Sounds like a light novel.

481
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,625
Oh, that's fair.

482
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,333
But after they've already
survived the events

483
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,541
of the main story,

484
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,625
I'd feel bad tossing
them into more danger

485
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,125
just to give me something to do

486
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,208
when they could be
tending sheep or whatever.

487
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,583
Maybe they want to turn into
fish and tend those sheep.

488
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,000
[KAREN chuckles]

489
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,250
My Amano's too much of a
cinnamon roll for his own good.

490
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,541
[KEITO chuckles nervously]

491
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,958
Okay, I think I understand
how DLC works now.

492
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,541
It's like getting extra toppings
on a pizza you ordered,

493
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,750
or buying dessert after
a really tasty meal.

494
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,208
Well, yeah! That's a pretty
good way to put it.

495
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,333
Then, when people hate the DLC,

496
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,833
it's because the
pizza was crappy,

497
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,083
and they had to pay an
extra 300 yen for sauce,

498
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,875
so they get salty
and go online,

499
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,916
and complain because the
pizza already cost a ton,

500
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,541
so what the heck?

501
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,000
I learned a bunch,

502
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,291
but I still feel like games
are too expensive, y'know?

503
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,583
Something about it just
rubs me the wrong way.

504
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,541
If I shell out 6,000 yen,
I wanna get everything.

505
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,833
Don't hit me up for
more cash after the fact.

506
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,125
Real talk? Nobody likes a mooch.

507
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,250
[OTHERS groan]

508
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,875
Hey, don't be like that!

509
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,250
I'm not trying to hate on this
thing you guys love so much,

510
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,541
but I guess I did.

511
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,875
No, it's fine.

512
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,625
It does hurt to hear all that,

513
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,916
but when games are such an
important part of your life,

514
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,166
it comes with the territory.

515
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,458
Sounds like you guys
are masochistic after all,

516
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,083
like Tendo had said
in the hot spring.

517
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,458
There's a wide spectrum,
and she's at the far end of it.

518
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,791
Here's a hint!

519
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,500
That was the perfect
opportunity for you to say,

520
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,458
"My girlfriend is not a
masochist. That's crazy talk!"

521
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,916
Some of us are,

522
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,041
but if you're looking for
something that we all do,

523
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,666
I think gamers put more time
into our hobby than we mean to.

524
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,875
Sounds like a bad thing,

525
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,250
so how come you look
so nostalgic about it?

526
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,083
[KEITA]
Well, there's this game.

527
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,916
My parents bought
a copy of it for me

528
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,333
way back when I was
in elementary school.

529
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,750
It was over-priced, and the
older game it ripped off

530
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,625
did everything better
for a lot less.

531
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,291
[AGURI]
Jeez, what a waste!

532
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,583
Tell me about it!

533
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,833
They had picked up the
wrong game by mistake.

534
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,708
I didn't have the heart to
tell them they messed up.

535
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,625
Mistaken-identity stories
hit close to home!

536
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,166
[KEITA]
But once I started playing

537
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,416
that crappy, overpriced game,
I actually came to enjoy it.

538
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,375
I played it on and
off for three years,

539
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,916
even though at its best
it was just mediocre.

540
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,333
That's a cute memory,
I'm not gonna lie.

541
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,083
But couldn't you have
had the same experience

542
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,666
with a movie or a
book just as easy?

543
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,291
[KEITA sighs]

544
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,708
[KEITA] I think it only stuck
with me the way it has

545
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,625
because it was a game.

546
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,250
When you play,

547
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,958
you're in charge of the time
and effort you put in.

548
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,583
You can get as emotionally
involved as you want to.

549
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:00,916
[KEITA]
Honestly?

550
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,583
I can't say if games
are "worth it"

551
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,166
in a technical money-type
sense, y'know?

552
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,708
And you buy some where they're
objectively terrible,

553
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,583
and you're stuck.

554
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,916
But that's the risk you take.

555
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,333
That's why, as a gamer,

556
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,875
all I can do is play every
game I come across,

557
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,458
however I feel like!

558
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,291
Even if nobody else feels that
way or sees my point of view!

559
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,541
That.

560
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,958
Plus, it's always fun
to see how other people

561
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,333
rip into bad games in
their reviews online,

562
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,291
or is it just me?

563
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,875
We all do that.

564
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,791
But every now and then, those
are the ones that stick with us.

565
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,916
We end up having such a
memorable time with them,

566
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,750
it's as if they're worth
their weight in gold.

567
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,833
That's right!

568
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,666
And sometimes it's like
a badge of honor

569
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,416
to have made your way through
a really horrendous game.

570
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,833
It's hard to put a price-tag
on a thing like that.

571
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,875
At the very least, that
crappy game has value to me.

572
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,416
It's worth way more than
what my parents paid for it.

573
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,625
After all we've been through, I
wouldn't sell it for the world.

574
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:57,166
So after all that, do you
understand a little better now

575
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,041
why they cost so much?

576
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,333
Yeah, I get it.

577
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,583
An' I'm gonna do my best

578
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,791
not to say that they're
overpriced anymore.

579
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,875
It's not about that.

580
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,625
[chuckles]

581
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,333
We're on the same page!

582
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:15,750
[BOTH chuckle]

583
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,458
Okay!

584
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,041
Now that we all agree,

585
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,541
I think it's time we dive into a
game that puts all those values

586
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,500
we were just talking
about into practice!

587
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,708
I think the five of us are ready

588
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,666
to leave our presumptions
at the door,

589
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,333
and see if <i>Elders Hunt</i> is
as crappy as they say!

590
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,583
[OTHERS] G'night! We gotta
get up early tomorrow!

591
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,000
Aww.

592
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,583
Pretty please?
