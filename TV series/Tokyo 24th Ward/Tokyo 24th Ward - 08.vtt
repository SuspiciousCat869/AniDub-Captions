- It's very nice to meet you,
Shuta Aoi.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.726 position:50% align:center
My name is Zeroth.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:21.354 position:50% align:center
I've returned to set
the 24th ward right.

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
- So you're Zeroth?
You're Ran's mentor.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
Are you the one, Carneades?

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
- I am not.
Believe me.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.947 position:50% align:center
Although I do know them.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center

That makes things easy.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
Then take me to meet Carneades.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
- Hmm.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry but I don't think you
would be granted an audience.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.584 position:50% align:center
- You may have very little
to do with this

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50% align:center
but for the last six months
he's been toying

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:48.048 position:50% align:center
with my friends and I.
Besides,

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
this has something to do
with my childhood friend

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
who's supposed to be dead.

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.428 position:50% align:center
- Hmm.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.263 position:50% align:center
That is a strange tale.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:58.892 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:03.521 position:50% align:center
Carneades is currently on
the highest floor

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.023 position:50% align:center
of the Cornucopia Building.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center
- Why is he up there?
[gasps]

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.695 position:50% align:center
He'll make us choose
another future.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
- The clouds are getting dark.

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:16.493 position:50% align:center
Wait, how do you know Carneades?

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:18.328 position:50% align:center
- You should get there quick.

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.205 position:50% align:center
Or else you'll miss them.

Hold up, Zeroth!

Gimmie your cPhone number
so I can call you!

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.587 position:50% align:center
- You can ask Ran later on.

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.839 position:50% align:center
- He's hiding out
and not answering his phone.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
SARG wants him because
of Kunai.

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:34.969 position:50% align:center

Very well, then.

- Atop the Cornucopia,

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
control of the cranes will

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
be lost after
a lightning strike,

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center
and they will collapse.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
The falling tower cranes
will be responsible

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
for many casualties.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
The only one who can stop this

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
is the one person atop
the tower,

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
but right after connecting
the cables...

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
That individual will be struck
by a bolt of lightning and die.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
If you warn that person about
the risk of a lightning strike

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
with a call
from the command room,

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.652 position:50% align:center
that person's life
will be spared.

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
Will you drop the cranes
and sacrifice many people

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
or sacrifice the one atop
the tower?

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
- I'll ask everything
to his face!

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
That should explain all of it!

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.399 position:50% align:center
- I can't believe it.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
Now of all times.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center

Teacher.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
So it was you that instigated
the graffiti war?

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
- You've become good
at creating art with a message.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
- Why'd you do that
to Mr. Kaba's picture?

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
It really was one
of my masterpieces.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:20.672 position:50% align:center
- Because it was a masterpiece
with such emotion packed in,

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50% align:center
it was worth overriding.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
Its worth rises because
it's gone.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
The agitative effect increased.

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:29.264 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, but that piece of art--

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
- Do you think you have
the right to be upset?

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
- [scoffs]

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
- I won't deny it.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
I used the fame of Carneades

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
in order
to overwrite your graffiti

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center
and therefore arouse
the people's anger.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
I hired a news site
to instigate conflict

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
by posting
the graffiti war article.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
They have no idea the trouble
is created by

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
the one who resolves it.

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:54.456 position:50% align:center
DoRed has more enemies now

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.875 position:50% align:center
but it gained
many more followers.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
You're getting
far more donations now.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:04.215 position:50% align:center
You also utilized Carneades
for your own activities,

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
or am I mistaken about that?

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
And then if the artist known
as Carneades were to fade away,

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
we could head into
the referendum

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.476 position:50% align:center
with people
paying close attention.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% align:center
- Listen closely.

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center

is a double-edged sword.

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
It is highly convenient

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
but it is also filled
with danger!

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.445 position:50% align:center
The KANAE System is a threat
that could destroy humanity.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
That which makes humans human.

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
There will no longer be a place
for the weak.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.410 position:50% align:center
This story is on
a whole other level.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
This system
is tech that steps into

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
a realm which should not
be trespassed by humans.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.710 position:50% align:center
What is the origin of the power
that they're resting upon?

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
Ran, you told me
that your powers

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
are enhanced whenever
Asumi calls you.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
That's an adaptation
of military tech

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.387 position:50% align:center
at the KANAE System's
foundation.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.472 position:50% align:center
The tech is called cipher.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
- Cipher?

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:58.228 position:50% align:center
- It shares technological roots
with Kunai's Di-VA and Drug-D.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.021 position:50% align:center
We don't have any time left,

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
and art simply isn't enough.

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
We have to caress the body
of the ward

while we're touching its heart!

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.530 position:50% align:center
I have a favor to ask.

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
Something that only you can do.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center

are you gonna make me do?

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.705 position:50% align:center

What Asumi wished for as well.

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.433 position:50% align:center
- Tsuzuragawa,
thank goodness.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
Leave immediately.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.436 position:50% align:center
The tower cranes are about
to fall down

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
from a lightning strike.
- Huh?

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
- I see.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
[phone clicks]
- [gasps]

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait!
Tsuzuragawa!

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
- There will be a...
- Hey, I'm back.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
- Hi, honey.
- Oh!

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
It's the return
of our poster girl!

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
- There's a rumor going around

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
that you married
the guy next door.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:56.661 position:50% align:center
- She's right.

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
Haven't seen you at all.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.789 position:50% align:center
This old man's been lonely!
- Huh? What's with that?

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.500 position:50% align:center
Small communities
can be so scary.

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
- How is it between you and Shu?

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
- There's no question about it.

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:10.342 position:50% align:center
Shu Aoi is such an idiot.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
- We gotta postpone
any further work!

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
[both grunting]

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
- Do any direct lines
call up there?

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
[warning sirens blaring]
[all gasping]

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
- A lightning warning?

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
[rain pattering]

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
- [breathing heavily]

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
Huh?
Ran?

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50% align:center
You're here.
- Check it out.

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
- Huh?

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
It's him!

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, it might be.

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
- I don't know what kind
of device that is.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
But if he stops the cranes
from breaking,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
I won't complain.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.170 position:50% align:center
- Hey, stop it.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50% align:center
You might be thinking
heroes need to save everybody,

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
but you really need
to start making choices, Shu.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
I'll choose the future where
the cranes won't topple.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.641 position:50% align:center
We can still evacuate.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.560 position:50% align:center
- I won't choose
a pre-decided future.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
I'll save Carneades as well.

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
I'll ask him why
and he'll tell me

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
or I'll punch him right in
the face!

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
I'll accept nothing less!

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
Pick up.
Come on, answer!

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
Hurry up!

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
Goddamn it!

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.461 position:50% align:center
He's not answering!

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
- The vision showed us that
a direct phone call to him

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
would switch the rails
of the trolley.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
So why is he not answering?

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
Gotta worry about that later.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.766 position:50% align:center
I have my own job to fulfill.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
[rain pattering]

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.689 position:50% align:center
- Koki.
You, too?

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
Choose the future that saves
the most people?

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.862 position:50% align:center
Well, I won't do it!

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be the type of hero
who doesn't give up on anyone!

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
I promised that to Asumi!

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.620 position:50% align:center
[breathing heavily]

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
Koki.

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:15.342 position:50% align:center
[siren blaring]
[gasps]

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
- Fire alert.
This is a fire alert.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
Everyone inside
the Inner Section,

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
please immediately evacuate
to the Outer Section.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.019 position:50% align:center
All security guards,

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
please move
to the Outer Section

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center
immediately after guiding all
other occupants.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:33.193 position:50% align:center
I repeat,
this is a fire alert.

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
No system exists without
any holes,

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
but Cornucopia's system
is close to perfect.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
If there's a moment
I could dive in,

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
it'd be this one.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:45.497 position:50% align:center
Right now while my abilities
are being boosted.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
[lock beeps and clicks]

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center
- Ran, we're on point
on our end.

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
- Just like we planned.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.759 position:50% align:center
- Yamamori, secure shelter
and transport.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.011 position:50% align:center
Lucky, you divert by making
a fire.

00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:01.388 position:50% align:center
- Copy.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
- So, here goes nothing,
I guess.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
Gonna have some clean up!

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
- Well, this is a bit scary.
[grunts]

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.023 position:50% align:center
- Hmm, all right.
I'll head over as backup.

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
- Did something happen?

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
- Apparently there's a fire
right in front of the building

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
so I'm gonna go lend
a hand guiding evacuees

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
from the area.
- Got it.

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
- Second thoughts?

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
- We're on a different level
from graffiti now.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
Can't make excuses for it.

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
Even if it is
to save Shantytown.

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
Would Asumi approve of this?

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
- That sort of kindness
is what killed Kunai.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.225 position:50% align:center
- [shouting]

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
- [grunting]

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
I have to make it!

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
[electric sparking]

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
- The tower cranes have
electronic controls

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
to prevent accidents,

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
but the lightning strike
made them malfunction.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
If things go like in
that vision,

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
the cranes will topple,

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
unless we can exchange
the cables now.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
- Sheesh, one-way communication
security systems

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
can be all the more troublesome.

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
Still, though,

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
since I've already come
this far,

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.323 position:50% align:center
I might as well make it
all mine now.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:45.325 position:50% align:center
So let's do it.

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
See how determined little old me
can really be.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
[electronic whooshing]

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:56.586 position:50% align:center
Expect nothing less
from Miss Tsuzuragawa.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
She's done a good job
at hiding the contents.

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
Too bad for her...

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
At this point in time,

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
little old me can even rewrite
the laws of physics.

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
Mm.

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
There are records
of various sensors,

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
social media histories--

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
just a hodgepodge
of accumulated data.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
Is it even worth stealing?

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
Oh, so that's what this
is about.

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
If they were to end up winning
the referendum vote,

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
then this would be...

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
- [grunting]

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:40.422 position:50% align:center
[breathing heavily]

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
[snarls]

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
Carneades!

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.139 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
[shouting]

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
Make a run for it!

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
The lightning!
It's coming!

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
[electronic booming]

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.079 position:50% align:center
[breathing heavily]

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
Hey, Carneades!

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
Please, wake up!

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
Don't di--

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
- [crying]

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.187 position:50% align:center
Tsuzuragawa.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.938 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
- The KANAE System is in danger.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
There will come a time
when I may not be able

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
to protect Asumi's secret.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
- Can't protect Asumi?

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
But that would mean--

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
- I will tell you now.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.996 position:50% align:center
The real Carneades is me.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
- This disturbs me quite a bit.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
But I suppose it all
makes sense now.

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
What is your objective?

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
- The KANAE System possesses
a critical bug

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.927 position:50% align:center
which I can't ever allow
Mr. Gori to find out about.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
That is why I had
to play that role.

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.557 position:50% align:center
He's deceived.

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
He believes the bug
was the direct result

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center
of Carneades's hacking.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
- Wait a minute.

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
Does that mean the futures shown
to us three were actually...

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
- So it really is true, then.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
You've all been shown
the future.

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
The logs implied as much
but I'm reassured

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
my speculations were correct.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
