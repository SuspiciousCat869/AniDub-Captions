00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:13.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
[beeping]

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:15.140 position:50% align:center line:84%
- More errors!

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center line:84%
- It's happening during
information scanning inside

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
the system core!

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Forward me details of each
of the errors immediately.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:23.106 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll organize them
then distribute

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.482 position:50% align:center line:84%
the information to Hazard Cast.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's too much for one human
to process,

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.448 position:50% align:center line:84%
and looking at each case,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.824 position:50% align:center line:84%
these aren't things Asumi
would want

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center line:84%
to make decisions about.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.036 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm almost certain now.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.955 position:50% align:center line:84%
Asumi's consciousness
has awoken within

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.081 position:50% align:center line:84%
the KANAE System.

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:46.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I'm going to rescue Asumi?

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center line:84%
So then I can return her
to the life she used to have?

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Like I told you earlier,

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:56.639 position:50% align:center line:84%
Asumi's body
has already passed away.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.850 position:50% align:center line:84%
It can't hold her anymore.
- [gasps]

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.894 position:50% align:center line:84%
[exhales]
- You must choose

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.438 position:50% align:center line:84%
to delete Miss Asumi
from the system

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:08.193 position:50% align:center line:84%
or put her into
an eternal slumber within KANAE.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:10.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which do you think
will be best for her?

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:13.615 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Another trolley dilemma?

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I can't make that decision.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Listen to me.

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
You must make a choice.
There's no other way.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.290 position:50% align:center line:84%
[knocking]
[both exhale]

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.668 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Mind if I enter?
- Chikuwa.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Hey, Sakiko.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.631 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sleeping Beauty's finally awake.
What a relief.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I'm truly sorry
to have worried you.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Shuta.
- Huh?

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.804 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Hold still a second.
- Hey!

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
What?
- Shuta Aoi,

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're under arrest
for suspicion of terrorism.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.851 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Wait, no way.
But that's insane!

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Look here.
- Huh?

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.355 position:50% align:center line:84%
- You've been identified
as a terrorist.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.107 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Wh--What's up with that?

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.650 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Calm down and don't resist.
- [grunts]

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Wait, Chikuwa.
This has to be a joke.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.696 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I'm afraid not.
- [grunts]

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Take him away, Shindo,
and keep an eye on him.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:55.990 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Hey, Chikuwa,
I'm really not getting

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.367 position:50% align:center line:84%
the point of all this!

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.827 position:50% align:center line:84%
- We'll talk at the station.
- Hey, take these off!

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Shuta designated a terrorist?

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.624 position:50% align:center line:84%
The KANAE System
is truly running out of control.

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:07.293 position:50% align:center line:84%
Chikuwa, there
was one item missing

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50% align:center line:84%
from my belongings at the time
of my hospitalization.

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.173 position:50% align:center line:84%
- A CMD hard drive?

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:13.758 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, I'm holding onto it.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.344 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I suspected as much.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:18.847 position:50% align:center line:84%
What will you do with it?

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.266 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Now, that is a heavy question.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.352 position:50% align:center line:84%
What to do
with the KANAE System?

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think it'd be a good idea
to entrust it to someone noble.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.525 position:50% align:center line:84%
A hero.
But what do you think?

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.318 position:50% align:center line:84%
- [exhales]
I think that's a good idea,

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
especially coming from you.
- [chuckles]

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:35.613 position:50% align:center line:84%
Isn't it?
[phone vibrates]

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hmm?

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center line:84%
- 17 people arrested
for terrorism?

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.247 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is Hazard Cast buggin' out
right now or what?

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.750 position:50% align:center line:84%
- With the riot happening across
the ward,

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
the KANAE System
is running beyond

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:50.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
its normal capacity.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
The brain is starting to lose
its ability to make decisions.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
- So Gori doesn't know
about this?

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.888 position:50% align:center line:84%
He has no idea Asumi's
in agony inside of that thing?

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Help me, Ran!
- [gasps]

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
He has to be told!

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shove the truth in his face!

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center line:84%
- How are you going
to make someone

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.938 position:50% align:center line:84%
who's never seen
a vision believe all of this?

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Easy.
I'll force him to--

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
- He won't accept it.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.319 position:50% align:center line:84%
Scratch that.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
He can't afford
to accept what's happening.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.200 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we can prove
Asumi's consciousness,

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center line:84%
we might be able
to persuade Gori Suido

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.204 position:50% align:center line:84%
to shut down the system.

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center line:84%
In order to do that,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.209 position:50% align:center line:84%
we would need the CMD
that Sakiko just downloaded,

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center line:84%
and I haven't a clue where
that might be right now.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:33.880 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I see.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was afraid of that.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.384 position:50% align:center line:84%
It did disappear like I thought.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay, come to the office,
but please don't push yourself.

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, Tsuzuragawa
doesn't know where

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center line:84%
the CMD is, either.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't save Asumi without it.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:53.650 position:50% align:center line:84%
[booming]
- Another fire!

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center line:84%
Damn them!
- Put it out, put it out!

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center line:84%
- You should have been
driven out long before!

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come out and give up,
you street trash!

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
all: Safety and security
from the KANAE System!

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.538 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Vote yes or get the hell out
of the 24th ward!

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Burn 'em down
and rise from the ashes!

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center line:84%
[tense music]

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
[phone trilling]

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center line:84%
- [exhales]

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center line:84%
- With all of the protests
in Shantytown...

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Hey, Mrs. Aoi?

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.219 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Oh, Mari.
What is it?

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:23.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
- My phone calls to Shu haven't
been going through at all.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have you heard from him?

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Not a single peep.

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center line:84%
I haven't gotten any texts,
either.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center line:84%
I just hope he's not out there
doing anything dangerous again.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center line:84%
- You know what?

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Nanba Seika owner was asked

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center line:84%
to voluntarily go
to the police station.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Well, that's absurd!

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Apparently Hazard Cast
thought he

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
was a dangerous individual.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Dangerous?

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Nanba boy wouldn't hurt
a fly.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Shu.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
Where have you run off to
at a time like this?

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
- This is some kind of mistake.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.585 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let me go home.

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
I would never commit terrorism!

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Yeah, yeah.
I know all of that.

00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is kind
of like police protection.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center line:84%
Imagine if someone else
brought you in first.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't actually believe you've
been out there devising plots

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center line:84%
for terrorism, Mr. 24.
- [grunts]

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't appreciate your mocking.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I'm not mocking you, Shu.

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center line:84%
You saved Sakiko's life,

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.774 position:50% align:center line:84%
so take some pride in how lousy
you are at giving up on things.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center line:84%
- This isn't giving up.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't do this out
of stubborn pride, Chikuwa.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Then why do you do it?

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:24.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Well, I--I don't know.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center line:84%
When someone in front
of you is in trouble,

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
you--you feel like you
gotta help them be safe.

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
You don't wanna give up on them.

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center line:84%
- You can't save everyone, Shu.
- Huh?

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center line:84%
- It's impossible to do.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center line:84%
You can't win 'em all,

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center line:84%
and it sounds
to me like you're running

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
from something painful.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
Like you're sick.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or is there a reason
you keep running

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
in circles without growing up?

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I'm confused.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:41.978 position:50% align:center line:84%

That hurt, Ko!

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm moving forward
no matter what it takes!

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't afford
to let you hold me back--

[both grunting]
[blow lands]

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Like I'd let you!

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center line:84%
A future built
on sacrificing someone

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center line:84%
isn't progress, Koki.

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.208 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll break everything
like that apart!

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's the future little old me
is choosing.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.170 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Are you prepared for that?

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Huh?
What are you talking a--

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Aren't you guys hesitating
as well?

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center line:84%
You put lids on your feelings
so she doesn't become

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center line:84%
a thing of the past, right?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
- That's not my problem.
- Well, it's my problem!

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center line:84%
- [gasps]

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I think that the fire
on that day was caused

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
by a cord
I watched rats chew through.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center line:84%
I knew that my inaction
to stop them

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center line:84%
had killed Asumi.

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:32.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
But then when she called
all our cPhones,

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center line:84%
I had hope.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:36.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
I let myself believe she
was still alive.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because if I didn't...

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then I feared that my connection

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center line:84%
with Asumi would
just go away again.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center line:84%
Like she would truly
be gone forever.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center line:84%
And so I don't know what future
would be best for Asumi!

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center line:84%
- After all that's happened,
you're still being selfish!

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
Asumi inherited
our mom's feelings

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center line:84%
and wanted
everyone's happiness more

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:01.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
than anyone else!

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center line:84%
Asumi would give her life
to protect the ward,

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center line:84%
so we should use that CMD
to put her

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
to sleep without
any further delay!

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:09.816 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Shut up!
- [grunts]

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
- A cheap shot, Ran!
You've been nothing but--

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center line:84%
- That's your ego talking, Ko!

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center line:84%
Asumi is in agony right now!

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
The errors in Hazard Cast
prove that without a doubt!

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
The best thing to do
at this point?

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center line:84%
Destroy the whole damn system!
- [grunts]

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
- And kill Asumi?

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center line:84%
We selfishly trapped
poor Asumi inside

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
of that system--

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center line:84%
forced images
of the future on her--

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:31.046 position:50% align:center line:84%
and now we're talking
about how she

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center line:84%
should be put
to sleep or destroyed?

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is it that selfish of us?

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Why can you grow up
and be an adult?

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I don't wanna become someone
like that!

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
- No one does,
you idiot,

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
but everyone's gotta
grow up sometime!

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center line:84%
We all grow up,
fall in love,

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
maybe have kids,
and then we die!

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center line:84%
[both groaning]

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Yeah, that's right!

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's what I'd do
if Asumi were here!

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.989 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure that right now--
- Shut up!

00:19:58.073 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am Asumi's older brother!

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
When I wake up,
when I'm eating meals,

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center line:84%
when I go back home,
she's not there anymore!

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's not anywhere!
She's gone!

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
- You're not
the only victim here, Ko.

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center line:84%
You took Kunai's life away
from him!

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center line:84%

I didn't wanna kill Kunai!

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center line:84%
I didn't wanna do any
of those things!

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
For my ideals,

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center line:84%

You in agony now, Ko?

That's simply your ego speaking!

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
You don't force self-sacrifice
upon others!

You claim to help Shantytown,

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
to sit here and take this
from you!

- Zeroth gave me
Di-VA's program data.

00:23:18.148 --> 00:23:21.359 position:50% align:center line:84%
The cipher was based
on the same cPhone technology.

00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:23.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
With the right amount
of computational power--

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I see.

The KANAE System is able
to do calculations

by dispersed computing

00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:32.370 position:50% align:center line:84%
from all over the 24th ward.
With my authorization--

- Hey,
what are you talking about?

00:23:33.997 --> 00:23:36.082 position:50% align:center line:84%
- We're planning for a miracle.

So can we go see Asumi, then?

00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:41.421 position:50% align:center line:84%
- The probability
of it is almost none.

00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:43.465 position:50% align:center line:84%
- But not zero, right?
- That's right.

00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:50.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
- No, Shu.
You can't.

00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:52.057 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't handle seeing all
of you.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please, don't come here!

- Good timing.
She expect us?

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:09.908 position:50% align:center line:84%
- She's watching right now.

00:24:09.991 --> 00:24:11.618 position:50% align:center line:84%
all: Asumi.
