Stop right there or I'll shoot!

- Order me to stop all you want!

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center line:84%

to take that order!

Please, spare me any more agony!

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:31.159 position:50% align:center line:84%

I've been monitoring you.
- Of course you are.

If humans created it,

[tires squealing]
I see it!

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:11.866 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you go down
the elevator shaft

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center line:84%
that's under construction
then open and pass through

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center line:84%
the trash disposal chute
that starts at the base

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.706 position:50% align:center line:84%
of the elevator,

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
you will end up
at the underground materials

import corridor.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center line:84%
From that corridor,

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.546 position:50% align:center line:84%
take the ventilation ducts

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center line:84%

- Come on!

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
- [grunts]
They're so reckless.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I suppose heroes
must do reckless things.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
- The garbage disposal chute
should be directly below

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center line:84%
where we're jumping.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50% align:center line:84%
- All right,
we're all in?

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
all: Let's go!

[thuds]

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Now, the ventilation
ducts beyond

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
the import air shaft?

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
- That's right.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center line:84%
[all breathing heavily]

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Why can't you
just quietly choose

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
a future for me?

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
[all grunting]
- I don't want any false hope!

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.389 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because I've learned that
a future where everyone is happy

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
is just a silly dream!

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
- [grunts]
Asumi.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're the one who taught
this Shantytown brat

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
that he had the potential
to be anything he wanted to be.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center line:84%
You want us to choose only
from the tracks set before us?

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's not who we are!

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even if it looks impossible,

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
if we face each other,
talk it out,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center line:84%
and pool our wisdom,
we can solve this.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
So please meet with us
and let us hear what you want!

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center line:84%
[all grunting]

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center line:84%
- But I have
to give up something, don't I?

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's what it means
to become an adult, right?

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center line:84%
[thuds]

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.054 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Another door?

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center line:84%
- The KANAE System's core
is directly ahead.

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
- All right,
I'm gonna break it open!

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center line:84%
[shouting]

[grunts]
Ah, man!

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center line:84%
- So reckless.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center line:84%
However...

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
- [grunts]
Asumi!

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're watching, right?

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center line:84%
We won't turn back until
we see you!

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
- You got that right.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
This probably goes
without sayin',

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center line:84%
but little old me can't finish
my art without you,

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.329 position:50% align:center line:84%
so let us in!

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Asumi, you're scared
of facing us three fair

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
and square,
aren't you?

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then let me tell you,
little sister.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
You have a duty to face
these foolish RGB boys

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.673 position:50% align:center line:84%
whose lives you've affected!

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center line:84%
We all need this to move forward
and help you!

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center line:84%
- You promised me when we
were kids.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm your hero,
right, Asumi?

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.100 position:50% align:center line:84%
[groans]
Whenever you're in pain

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center line:84%
or whenever you're crying,

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will always rush to help you
no matter how far away I am!

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.024 position:50% align:center line:84%
[all groaning]

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
- About time.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center line:84%
Finally gave up, huh?

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center line:84%
- [gasps]

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
Asumi.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
What did they do to you?

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
[both breathing heavily]

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center line:84%
[beeping and whirring]

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
- I'm in.
- Let's do this.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Uh, right.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center line:84%

[all shouting]

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Gori Suido, come on stage
and talk with me!

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center line:84%
- What the hell?

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you trying
to destroy the ward?

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center line:84%
- This destruction is in order
to create.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is not the world Ms. Kanae
wished for!

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Damn you, Zeroth!
- Still playing the hero?

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Come and find out!

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mr. Mayor,

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
please come down and speak
with the demonstrators.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
At this rate there may
be casualties

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center line:84%
that could be avoided.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.719 position:50% align:center line:84%
- If that happens,

00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center line:84%
it will be good
for the referendum.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
- [gasps]

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center line:84%
You can't be--

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center line:84%
you weren't like this
when Mrs. Kanae was still alive!

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center line:84%
- [snarls]
How dare you say that to me?

[all phones chiming]

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center line:84%

[cell phone beeping]

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Miss Asumi.

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:36.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
- If left alone,

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center line:84%
the KANAE System will run
completely out of control.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:43.388 position:50% align:center line:84%
I must let go and sleep
or move on from here.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't linger around forever.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have to say goodbye.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
- That's not what we--
- There is no other way, Koki!

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is there, right?

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
- That's right.

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center line:84%
- That may be true
but we don't--

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Stop it now!
- [gasps]

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
- No more of this!
Don't torment me any longer!

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center line:84%
Accept it or destroy it.

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center line:84%
The future is one of these two.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center line:84%
No matter which future
you choose,

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't stay here with everyone!

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am no longer a human being.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am now the KANAE System
itself.

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:20.925 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's happened in our city
in the past,

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center line:84%
what's happening right now,

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center line:84%
what will happen in the future--
