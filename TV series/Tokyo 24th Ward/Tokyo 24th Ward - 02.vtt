isn't it a bit sloppy
to group us three together?

I mean, when you,

Shu,

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center

Cool, right?

It's been six months since

- Also, they opened up all
the same types of shops as us.

- Almost like they're trying
to put us out of business.

competing against
our okonomiyaki place.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
- But our ward's okonomiyaki
has a totally different origin

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
from inland Tokyo's,

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50% align:center

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
I can give you the details
in the weekly report.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm already aware
of all that.

 in the morning

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
 and the moment I saw it,

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.424 position:50% align:center
 I knew it had to be Zeroth!

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50% align:center
- I can't believe his identity
is still a mystery.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
- His art,
it's heartfelt.

Hmm?

 Ow.

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
- Jeez, are you even listening
to me right now?

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
What?
Do you have muscle cramps?

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, my body's feeling
really heavy ever since

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
that thing happened
two days ago.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
- Shu, you already have
monstrous athletic skill,

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
but on that train track,

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
you looked like a super hero
from a comic!

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
What are you talkin' about?

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
All that happened
when I received a call

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
on my phone from Asumi,
and after that call,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
I don't know why,
but I could really move.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
- What do you mean, Shu?
A phone call from Asumi?

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
- I really don't understand it
at all, either,

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
and yet that was without
any doubt truly her voice.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
At least, I think.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
- Do you understand what
you're telling me right now?

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:50.577 position:50% align:center
You think you got a call
from a dead person.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
- I know it's crazy.

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
However, when I picked up
that phone call,

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
these images popped into
my head somehow.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:01.421 position:50% align:center
 An image of you being run over
 by the Kizuna train.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
Oh, and don't repeat this stuff
to anyone.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
I seriously don't understand it.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
- You don't have to tell me.
Such a story.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
Oh, but this means I
was rescued thanks

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
to all of that.

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:17.562 position:50% align:center
So, did you try
to call her back later?

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
- I did,
so many times.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.192 position:50% align:center
But it goes
to voicemail every time.

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50% align:center
- This is a lot.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
It's hard to make sense
of all my feelings.

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center
- Same here.

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.536 position:50% align:center
And I can't help
but think about it.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
 - [exhales]

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
This is no time to be creating
a new menu item.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center
You need to smooth things over
with both Ran and Koki sometime.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
By the way,

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
I think it was simply
a prank call.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
See ya.
- [stammers]

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
Why exactly do you know about
the argument we had?

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
- When it concerns Asumi,

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
you really stop thinking
about anything else.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
Can't you see that Asumi's
no longer with us?

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
- What?
Even you, Mari?

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50% align:center
If Asumi is actually still alive
then it's something

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.570 position:50% align:center
to be genuinely happy about.
[grunts]

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
- Where you wanna eat?

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
- Itadaki should do.

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]
Mari has--

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.292 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Team practice today.

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
So there's no Mari special.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.005 position:50% align:center
- Ah, really?
That's too bad.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.173 position:50% align:center
- Mr. 24, you've gotta help me!
- Huh?

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.634 position:50% align:center
- I need the powers
of a super hero!

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.094 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50% align:center
- [grunting]

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
- Way to go, goal keeper!

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Asumi,

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
this isn't exactly what
a hero does.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
- And yet you do it.
[laughs]

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
- I mean, yeah, you can't have

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
a soccer game without
a goal keeper.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.817 position:50% align:center
- [laughing]

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]
- [giggles]

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center
- [grunting]

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
- Hooray, I knew it!
Mr. 24!

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
[all laughing]
- That's a dirty trick,

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
you guys!
- What are you doing, Mari?

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
Come on!
Let's get going!

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.581 position:50% align:center
- Okay!

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
 [upbeat music]

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.544 position:50% align:center
It's Asumi?
- Eh?

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center
Asumi's my motif.
So, how's it look?

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.008 position:50% align:center
- It's good.
It definitely looks like her.

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
But she looks kind of mature.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50% align:center
- That's what I was going for,
actually.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
- I see.

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:18.433 position:50% align:center
A souvenir.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
They're bread crusts
from the Aoi Bakery.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
[beeps]

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
- Since you're already here,
come on in.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.150 position:50% align:center
[all muttering]

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50% align:center
- Uh, hi, everybody.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.197 position:50% align:center
- Hey there, Mari.
It's good to see you.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
- Kinako!
It's been a while.

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.368 position:50% align:center
This place is pretty amazing.

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50% align:center
- Is this your first time being
in the DoRed hideout?

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, it really feels like
a secret base.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
- That's the point.
S.A.R.G. has eyes on us.

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
Our members are anonymous
and never show their faces.

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.174 position:50% align:center
Not to mention everyone living
in Shantytown is on our side.

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
So they shouldn't find out who
we are that easily.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
[chomps]

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
- Hey, were you okay
the other day?

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
S.A.R.G. totally reprimanded
you afterwards, didn't they?

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
- Yeah.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
Like, they wanted to know who
it was that saved me

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
and what my relationship
to DoRed is.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
- Did you tell 'em anything
about Shu?

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.776 position:50% align:center
- No way.
Shu asked me not to.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
- Well anyway,

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
I'm really glad
that you're all right.

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:15.657 position:50% align:center
 - But what in the world
 was that strange vision?

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
 It looked like Asumi
 and it told me to choose one

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
 of two futures.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
 So does that mean we changed
 the future back there?

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.250 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Ran.
- Hmm?

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry.
It's nothin'.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
I just zoned out.
- Ran,

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
your expression's kind
of erotic.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
- Cut that out.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.383 position:50% align:center
- Oh, heads up!

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
It's almost time
for us to start!

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
- Oh?
Time to start what?

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
both: We're about to begin
a live painting stream.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.808 position:50% align:center
- There's already
30,000 people waiting.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
- Ooh.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
Well then,
I'll get going.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
Good luck with your stream!

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
- Thank you!

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.773 position:50% align:center
See ya later.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
[door opens and closes]
Mm?

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
All right, then, Kinako,

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
let's get this show started.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
- Yeah!

00:10:58.616 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
- Listen.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
I don't know if little old me
is suited for this.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
- But you look like
you're havin' fun.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, you're totally on
a roll.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
- Wh--are you kidding me?
Not at all!

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:11.171 position:50% align:center
True art only happens when
you're expressing your attitude.

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
If you're drawing
on some legal wall,

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
that's not cool or daring.

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
- That's totally missing
the point.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
What really matters
is that your art echoes

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center
with people's hearts whether
or not it's legal.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.141 position:50% align:center
I think more people should get
to look at it.

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
- Those words echo within
my own heart even louder.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
Here, finished!

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:32.817 position:50% align:center
- Uh, can I, you know, like,
take a picture, maybe?

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
- Hmm?
Okay.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
Take as many as you want.

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.655 position:50% align:center
- Wow, thank you so much!

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
Um, if you don't mind,

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
can I take a video
at some point?

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
- A video?
- Yeah, like a live painting!

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
- Wonderful!

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
- Cool!
Sounds good!

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
That's perfect!
- [groans]

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
[knocking]
- Uh?

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:55.882 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi, Mari.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
- Hey, there.

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.218 position:50% align:center
Studying for classes?

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
- I'm sorry.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
I only allow emergency
notifications

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
when I'm doing my homework.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you found me here.

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:08.311 position:50% align:center
- I called the Suido house
and Miss Tsuzuragawa.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:10.814 position:50% align:center
- I see.
So, what's up?

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
Is it something really urgent?

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:15.235 position:50% align:center
- I heard you had an argument
with Shu two days ago.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
Mr. Shirakaba's
pretty concerned.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
- So that's what this is about.
You came here to mediate.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
- Have you decided what
to order?

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
- Oh, one blend coffee, please.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
- One blend coffee.
Will that be all for you?

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.622 position:50% align:center
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center
Hang tight.
It'll be just a moment.

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:32.210 position:50% align:center
- Anyway, it's not really why
I came here.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
I've got a question for you.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
How do I put it?

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
How much do you know about that
Mon Jungle place

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.218 position:50% align:center
in the Takara Mall?
- Hmm?

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're asking me about
their flagship restaurant?

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50% align:center
- That's right.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
Apparently we two
are considered

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.017 position:50% align:center
the favorites to win
the Gourmet Festival.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
 - Gourmet Festival.

Yabusame owns and operates it,

Don't you think that it's a bit
too much money

- The past couple years,

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
they've been making money
in shady ways as land sharks

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center

then nothing is impossible.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
- Mr. Shirakaba,

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
some of our students created
a movement seeking

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
to overturn
a government decision.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
Did you know anything
about this?

00:18:58.221 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
- It's been reported
on network news,

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
and we've been getting
heavy pressure from the PTA.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
- How'd this happen,
Mr. Shirakaba?

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
- Those are students
in your homeroom class, correct?

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:08.314 position:50% align:center
- Two months back,

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
I directly advised three
of those students

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
to stay away from that school.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
But now I regret that
I told them to do this.

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
They've shown that
the old school is important.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
It surpasses the conveniences
of adults.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
The place matters
to the 24th ward.

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:24.706 position:50% align:center

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
Can you help?

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
Could you convince
the government

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
to acknowledge that
the Takara Elementary School

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
is culturally worth preserving?

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
Well, Mr. Shirakaba,

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
I must say I'm thankful
that you buy so much into

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
the success of both my children.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
However,
considering my position,

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
I must present
several conditions.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center

I just got off
the phone with them!

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.814 position:50% align:center
- But if I don't go in right now
we can't save everybody!

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center
- Well, then I'll go in.
- Mari, please!

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center

00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
All right.
I'll wait.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.531 position:50% align:center
Let's get ready to guide
the fire truck.

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
- And get onlookers out

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center

- Uh, right.

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center

Asumi!
- I'm sorry,

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
but we won't be able
to save everybody

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
if we wait for the firefighters!

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
- Please, no!

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
Don't do this!

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
You're not Shu, you know!

00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
You'll die.

You were always claiming it
was for everybody's sake.

We kept saying it over and over

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:47.956 position:50% align:center
and we kept acting
as if it were true.

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center

to die for it?

I can't do this.

I'm home.

meeting without you.

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:38.506 position:50% align:center
- What's the deal?

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
Why did you ask Ran
and Koki here, too?

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.135 position:50% align:center
I alone should be plenty.

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:43.636 position:50% align:center
- Are you insane?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.598 position:50% align:center

You are just afterthoughts.

00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
