00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
Can you teach me how
to do it, too?

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, sure thing.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
I thought this'd be my weapon

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.877 position:50% align:center
so that I could remain
as Ran's equal.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.463 position:50% align:center
My hacking skills were

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center
the only thing I had going
for me.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
But he surpassed me in no time.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.682 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzing]
[grunts]

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
Ran.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.981 position:50% align:center
I don't have the right
to be here any longer.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
At least I can draw
the line with something I

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
am capable of doing.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
- I don't think he'll be here,
but...

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.200 position:50% align:center
- Yes, give me a minute.
Be right there.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.413 position:50% align:center
Hello?
Oh, welcome home, Kunai.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
- Hi, Grandma Kunai.
S'been a little while.

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.626 position:50% align:center
- Did you go out
on another walk again?

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
I was worried sick because you
were outside so late at night.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
- Grandma Kunai's dementia.
- [humming]

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
- It's gotten worse.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.095 position:50% align:center
Dammit, I can't find them
through computer searches.

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:35.348 position:50% align:center
Kunai, where in the hell
are you right now?

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.018 position:50% align:center
A bomb isn't how you do things,
right?

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
An uncovered hard drive.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:42.605 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
This paper.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
"I am a sinful criminal."

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center
A criminal?
- Kunai.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
This thing you gave me--
- Hmm?

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.492 position:50% align:center
- It's really helpful.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
When I'm listening to it,
my foot pain is gone.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
It just goes away
and I feel a whole lot better.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
It's so marvelous.
- [gasps]

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
Grandma, could I borrow that
for one second?

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
[keyboard clacking]

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
This is Di-VA,
the music app Kunai developed.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
If I recall right,
it used a biometric sensor.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.721 position:50% align:center
Bingo!
It's in the code.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:16.097 position:50% align:center
The data that's in
the current release

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
has been modified.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:21.936 position:50% align:center
Criminal, sinful, Di-VA.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50% align:center
Di-VA.
D...

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
D!

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
So that's what this
is all about?

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
But why would Kunai be behind
the creation of Drug D?

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Wait.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
The distributors of Di-Va!

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
Kaburaya Corporation.
I know them!

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50% align:center
It's Tarki!

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.416 position:50% align:center
[gulping]

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.086 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
It's all comin' together now.

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.380 position:50% align:center
- Welcome aboard the WINNER'S.

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
Today is a momentous occasion.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center
This new casino project
will redevelop Shantytown.

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
The venture will create
ample jobs

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.641 position:50% align:center
and stimulate a revitalization
of the area.

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
Now, let's all begin
with a celebration together.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
Cheers!

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.563 position:50% align:center
all: Cheers!

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
- This guy
has really sketchy vibes.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50% align:center
- Shuta.
- Huh?

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
- I've learned that 500 grams
of C4 explosive

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
was recently stolen
from an army warehouse.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
That amount is consistent
to the scale

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.700 position:50% align:center
of the blast we saw
in the vision.

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing that's the bomb.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.619 position:50% align:center
I sent you an image.

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
- Oh, I've seen this stuff
in movies.

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
It's like those red
or blue wire ones.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
- Shu,
you said Tarki was there, right?

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.965 position:50% align:center
Could you check to see
if he's carrying a hard drive?

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.883 position:50% align:center
- A hard drive?
[gasps]

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50% align:center
He had a box that size.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
- Bingo!

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
That must be the bomb.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
- For real?
- Here you go.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
- How do you know that?
- You can have it back.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
- Is the perpetrator Tarki?
- Have you had enough?

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
- No, it's not Tarki.

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.438 position:50% align:center
I don't know who the perp is.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
We don't got any time left, Ko.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
Haul ass to the station.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
- Nihama Station
for the monorails, correct?

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
- That's right.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
- Kunai,
are you heading out again?

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, I'll be right back.

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure
to bring Kunai home.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
- Ms. Shishido,
may I ask a favor?

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.540 position:50% align:center
- Wh--What is it?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:06.875 position:50% align:center
You don't need to bow.

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.127 position:50% align:center
- Beating around
the bush won't work.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.795 position:50% align:center
Follow my lead,

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
and you can prevent
that terrorist attack

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:13.506 position:50% align:center
from a criminal threat.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
- What did you just say?
- Koki,

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.760 position:50% align:center
what are you talking about?
- The boss is out right now,

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
which means this
is a tough call,

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
but time is running out,
so let's hear it.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
- It was under my nose
the whole time!

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.479 position:50% align:center
A shell company,
easy to ditch.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
- Now that I think of it,

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen Kunai
in a while.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.526 position:50% align:center
- The spike in crime rates
in Shantytown.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.904 position:50% align:center
- No pills, no powders,
no plants, no liquids.

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:37.405 position:50% align:center
Nothing's stashed here.

00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
- The Di-VA updates.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
Huh?
The elevator moves now?

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
When'd this old piece
of junk get fixed?

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
The large deposits
to Kunai's account.

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.249 position:50% align:center
No.

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.417 position:50% align:center
Even without that--

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
- It's nothing.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
Just same old,
same old.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.174 position:50% align:center
- The answer was right before
my eyes!

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:57.550 position:50% align:center
Kunai!

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.302 position:50% align:center
You aren't a sinful criminal
at all.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
You're just a victim
of filthy adults!

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Kunai.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
What app are you developing
this time?

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
- Di-VA.
- Di-VA?

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
- It's a new automatic
music generation application.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
Uses cPhone biometrics.
- Oh? Wow.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.616 position:50% align:center
- A sensor takes in
the user's physical reactions

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
and creates healing music...
- That sounds pretty amazing.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
- Most fit
for their current biorhythm.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
- But I don't really
understand it.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.372 position:50% align:center
- It's available
for download now.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
- Are you serious?
- Well, let's see.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.291 position:50% align:center
- Kunai, you should have
let us know about it sooner.

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
- Oh, it's super highly rated.

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.795 position:50% align:center
- I'm gonna download it
right now.

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
- I'll download it, too.
- Isn't that kinda dangerous?

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:37.215 position:50% align:center
- How?

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
- 'Cause if you can heal people
with it,

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
can't you hurt 'em
with the music, too?

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.471 position:50% align:center
- Th--That data analysis
is impossible,

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
considering
the cPhone's current levels

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
of processing power.
- [humming]

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.230 position:50% align:center
So quick.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
Ran truly hit the nail right
on its head so quickly.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
[buzzing]
But Ran was exactly right.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
This is dangerous depending
on how you use it.

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
Should I stop
distributing Di-VA?

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:07.078 position:50% align:center
- Very nice to meet you.

00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
You must be the Naito Kudo,

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:11.750 position:50% align:center
genius programmer
and designer of Di-VA.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
- [groans]
- Here's my card.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:14.919 position:50% align:center
This is who I am.

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
Di-VA is a profoundly
wonderful cPhone application.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
It takes full advantage
of cPhone's biometric sensor.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
In my opinion,
it's a form of art.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]
- My company also

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
has business dealings
with the Suido Corporation.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
We've been thinking
about having Di-VA as one

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
of the default applications
for cPhone.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]
- And in order to do that,

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
I would like
to officially purchase

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
the rights for it.
Of course,

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.028 position:50% align:center
we will pay you an
appropriate sum of money for it.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.614 position:50% align:center
- My app's gonna be on
every single cPhone out there?

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
No, but wait, it's--
- By the way,

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:46.534 position:50% align:center
I heard that your grandmother
is suffering
