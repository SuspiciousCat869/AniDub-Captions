But not when Hazard Cast deals
with certain people.

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:25.266 position:50% align:center line:84%
If Asumi's acquaintances
are involved,

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
the dispersed
consciousness becomes

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center line:84%
a single point of focus.

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
- That means Asumi
was seeking us out for help

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the moment she returned
to being herself?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center line:84%
- The visions are screams.

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
Asumi became part
of the KANAE System

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
to help us but keeps
seeing nightmares

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center line:84%
of what may happen
in the 24th ward.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center line:84%
When she knows that one
of the futures

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center line:84%
has to come true,

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:51.084 position:50% align:center line:84%
she can't hold it in any longer,

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
so Asumi wakes up and seeks help
from you three

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center line:84%
by presenting trolley dilemmas.

00:20:57.507 --> 00:21:00.218 position:50% align:center line:84%
- She was in agony.
Poor Asumi.

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:02.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
She was turning to us three
for help.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Each time she calls for help,

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:08.268 position:50% align:center line:84%
the KANAE System racks up
more bugs.

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:10.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was afraid that
Miss Asumi's consciousness

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
would soon race out of control,

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:16.192 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I decided to put her
in eternal slumber.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I get enough data
through observation,

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can forcefully disperse
her consciousness right before

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
she wakes up from a nightmare.

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center line:84%
Theoretically,
that is possible to achieve.

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center line:84%
- But that doesn't change
the fact that she

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:30.999 position:50% align:center line:84%
will keep suffering through

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:33.001 position:50% align:center line:84%
these nightmares every time,
right?

00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:35.420 position:50% align:center line:84%
You would put Asumi through
that much agony?

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:37.422 position:50% align:center line:84%

Asumi has passed away.

00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:49.100 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's merely a digital residue

if I've allowed Asumi...

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.319 position:50% align:center line:84%
- Ms. Tsuzuragawa.

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:02.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
- When I found out I was on
the tracks of destiny atop

the Cornucopia during the storm,

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd already made up my mind.

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:09.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
I had committed a mortal sin

00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:12.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
and I made Miss Asumi shoulder
the burden.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.420 position:50% align:center line:84%
Death was a punishment
which suited my terrible crime.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.466 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I was supposed
to die up there

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:22.926 position:50% align:center line:84%
yet I'm still alive.

00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:26.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was only because
you saved me.

00:22:27.055 --> 00:22:29.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because you didn't give up
on hope.

00:22:29.474 --> 00:22:31.017 position:50% align:center line:84%

were a bunch of nonsense.

00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:40.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
But from you I feel
there's something similar

00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:42.946 position:50% align:center line:84%
to Ms. Kanae and Miss Asumi.
