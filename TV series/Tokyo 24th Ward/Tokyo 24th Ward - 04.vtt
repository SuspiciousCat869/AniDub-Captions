to be a fun holiday event.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.395 position:50% align:center

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
- What are your thoughts
on this tragedy?

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.094 position:50% align:center

the Hazard Cast
warning notification

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:56.931 position:50% align:center

Is this true?

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.851 position:50% align:center
- This was simply due
to a lack of cumulative data,

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.771 position:50% align:center
so we will be taking measures
to gather even more data.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.689 position:50% align:center

as possible.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.332 position:50% align:center
- Correct,
and as a result,

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center

it was merely a prank

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.543 position:50% align:center

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.631 position:50% align:center
- Mm, dude's in no condition
to be questioned.

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
- When's this guy gonna
be coming back to sanity, then?

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.386 position:50% align:center
- Probably not for a while.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.930 position:50% align:center
- I'm not seeing anything in
this box that looks like a drug.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
- No pills, no powders,
no plants, no liquids.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center
Nothing's stashed here.

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
- A mysterious drug
that can't be found?

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
Great.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
- Ran.
- Hmm?

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
- It's S.A.R.G.
[distant sirens blaring]

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
We should try to avoid 'em.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
- Hey, should we be taking
that junkie with us?

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
- No, this is one case
where we can't--

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
- Drug D.
- Yeah.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.328 position:50% align:center
- How has it spread so much
in such a short time?

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
Feels like someone must
be pullin' strings

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
in the background.

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50% align:center
- [groans]
Drug D.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
I won't tolerate it.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
- Hey, what gives, Ran?

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
- Where are you going?

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
The elevator moves now?

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.885 position:50% align:center
When this old piece
of junk get fixed?

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
- Sometime this month,
I think.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center
- Why after so long, though?

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:54.349 position:50% align:center
Somebody's whimsical,
I see.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
Kunai's grandma has a bad leg

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
so I suppose
it helps her out a ton.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:03.608 position:50% align:center
- Now that I think of it,
I haven't seen Kunai in a while.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
- Yeah.

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
Apparently he's been developing

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
a new type of mobile app.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
We still text now and then.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
He's always been the type
that doesn't show up

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
for a while once he bunks down.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center
- I'm going out now.
- Huh?

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
Oh, you take care, then.

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.089 position:50% align:center
Please make sure
to hurry home before

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.133 position:50% align:center
it gets too dark out,
all right?

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
- Yeah.
I'll be back soon.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.263 position:50% align:center
- Shuta, get ready
to close up shop!

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, yeah.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Mari.
You, too?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.269 position:50% align:center
Yeah.
Mom's stepping out,

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
so we're closing shop for today.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
- I see.
[grunts]

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that Kozue?

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.235 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, that's Kozue.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
I've heard she's been going out
at night lately.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
- Ah?
From who?

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
- From Shirakaba's wife.

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
I bumped into her the other day.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50% align:center
- [groans]

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
Mrs. Kaba, huh?
How's she doing?

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
- She's lost a lot of weight,

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
but it seems like she
was getting by.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.255 position:50% align:center
- I see.

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.674 position:50% align:center
- Well, I'm worried,
so I'm gonna go after her.

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
- Wait a sec!
- Uh?

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
What?
- You would be in danger, too.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
- Uh, but...

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
Fine, then you can go instead
of me, Shu.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
- Uh--
[groans]

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.853 position:50% align:center
Fine.
I'll go.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:26.649 position:50% align:center
Kozue!
- [gasps]

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
- Where are you going?

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous to go out alone.
- You're right.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center
A suspicious person
is following me as we speak.

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
Who, me?

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
- I will scream, Shu.
- What?

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
I'm just worried about you,
Kozue.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.039 position:50% align:center
If you're going somewhere,
I'll come with.

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.291 position:50% align:center
- Leave me alone!
- Oh, hey!

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
[groans]
Come on.

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
There's no way
I can leave her alone.

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
[distant car horn honking]

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Kozue,
I said I'd tag along,

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
but this place is sketchy.

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
[dogs snarling]

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
Really, Kozue.
It's not for kids.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
This place is bad news.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.102 position:50% align:center
Shantytown is no joke.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
- Then feel free to go home
by yourself, Shu.

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]
- I have something to do here.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50% align:center
- Something to do?
Does it have to be right now?

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.569 position:50% align:center
- Hey, mister.
Up for some fun?

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
- Oh, no, thank you.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
- Don't come onto guys
with kids.

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:17.325 position:50% align:center
- Oh, by the way,
would you like a rusk?

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
- What's with that?
- I thought I'd offer 'cause

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:20.787 position:50% align:center
you like rusks, right?

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
- I'm not a kid anymore,
so why are you baiting me?

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.877 position:50% align:center
What is with you tonight?

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
Why have you been stalking me?

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
- Oh, well, I thought,
you know--

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
- Is it atonement?

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.929 position:50% align:center
- No, it's not...

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
- You didn't need to swoop in
to save me.

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]
Kozue.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.814 position:50% align:center
What did you just say?

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
- I should have been
the one to die instead,

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
not him!
- Hey, wait!

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
Huh?
Where did she go?

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
[exhales]
Dammit.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
- [shouting growing closer]
- [gasps]

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.665 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you all right?
- Hey, mister!

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:07.542 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]
- Yes, you, down there!

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
Pin that guy down till we
can come and cuff him!

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
You're that Shuta Aoi kid!

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:15.425 position:50% align:center
- She's from S.A.R.G.
[both grunting]

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.093 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]
Don't let him get away!

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
He's a drug dealer!
- What?

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
- [grunting]

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
- Dammit!
This is insane!

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:25.894 position:50% align:center
Why do I have to do this?

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
- [panting]

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
- [screams]
- Hey!

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
- [panting]

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.442 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait up!

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.778 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
- [shouting]
Out of the way!

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
[shouting]

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
[thuds]
[groans]

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
- [panting]
What?

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
Koki?
- Shu?

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
Why are you chasing after
this guy?

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
- [groaning]

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
- I don't know.
That's how things ended up.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
The scary S.A.R.G. lady told me
to do it.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
That guy, he's a drug dealer,
isn't he?

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
- Yes, that's right.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.759 position:50% align:center
This man sells
the mysterious Drug D.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
- Drug D?

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
- It's an illicit drug
that's highly addictive.

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
What it is is still a mystery,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
but its users lose their sense
of judgment and become violent.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
Due to this,

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.771 position:50% align:center
the crime rate in Shantytown
has been skyrocketing

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
for the past month.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
- Well, that isn't good.
Oh, wait.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
That might be
what Kozue's here for.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.655 position:50% align:center
She's been wandering
around Shantytown recently.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm here.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
I followed her tonight
and then--

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
- You lost sight of her?

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.911 position:50% align:center
- Yeah.
- Let's find her.

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center
You take the north side.

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50% align:center
- What?
S--Sure.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Mr. Shindo?

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
Regardless of Drug D,

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.295 position:50% align:center
Shantytown isn't
a place she should

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.089 position:50% align:center
be wandering around alone.

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
Hazard Cast doesn't work
in this part of the ward.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
- Huh?

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
- Hazard Cast
calculates predictions

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
of crime scenes
automatically based

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center
on data collected within
the city.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
Shantytown--
with so many old buildings--

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
has few surveillance cameras,

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
and cPhones
with sensors aren't given

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
to illegal immigrants.
