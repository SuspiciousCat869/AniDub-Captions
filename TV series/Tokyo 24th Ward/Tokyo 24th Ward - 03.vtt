00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.519 position:50% align:center
You have only one chance
to call for an evacuation.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
You have two choices.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.068 position:50% align:center
If you lead an escape over
the bridge before

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
it's blocked by the tornado...

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
The weak will be left behind.

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
If you protect the weak inside
a cargo container...

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.746 position:50% align:center
The courageous
will be sacrificed.

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.042 position:50% align:center
No matter which option
you choose,

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
you cannot avoid
suffering casualties.

00:13:57.587 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
Guide the future.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.640 position:50% align:center
- Hey.
- Yeah, I already know.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:09.641 position:50% align:center
- Me, too.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
A phone call from Asumi.

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:16.564 position:50% align:center
Once more,
it's a trolley dilemma.

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
- So a tornado?

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
Even if our abilities
are enhanced,

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
how do we deal
with a natural phenomenon?

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
[whirring]

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.240 position:50% align:center
- It's the same as last time.

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.325 position:50% align:center
Need to ignore
the binary choice.

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
- Create our own future somehow.

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
- The bottleneck
for the evacuation

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
is the traffic jam
of cars on top of the bridge.

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
- In order to avoid a tragedy,

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
we need to clear out the top
of the bridge.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
Hey Shu.
- Shuta.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
Move all--
- Can you move all--

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.090 position:50% align:center
both: Of the vehicles off
of the bridge?

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
- Uh, sure.
You guys have some sort of plan?

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.386 position:50% align:center
[indistinct chatter]

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
- Mr. Chikushi,
do you have a moment?

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
- The security detail.

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
They're asking
about controlling traffic.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.561 position:50% align:center
- Okay.
Here I come.

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
- This is surprisingly rowdy.

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
- Oh, that was just a hero

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
of justice punishing
the villains.

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.027 position:50% align:center
- Yes.
Right, then.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
- Mr. Shirakaba!
- Mm?

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up?
- Sir!

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
A tornado's on its way.
It'll be here soon.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
- Tornado?
I don't see anything like that!

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
- Hazard Cast malfunctioned.
We need an evacuation order.

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.791 position:50% align:center
- But Koki--

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:18.835 position:50% align:center
- Being sincere
is the fastest way

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
of getting through
to Mr. Shirakaba.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
I can't do it again.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.383 position:50% align:center
I can't repeat
the Takara Elementary Tragedy.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
I beg you.

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
All right.
I get it.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
- I'll rescue many people

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
by having them evacuate over
the bridge.

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
I will save more people
than in that vision.

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
- Kinako!
- Hello?

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi, Ran.
Is somethin' wrong?

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center
- There's a tornado on the way!

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
Gather everyone around you!

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:48.823 position:50% align:center
Hide inside a cargo container!

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
- A cargo container?
Is this a prank?

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
- Please, just do it!

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:56.414 position:50% align:center
If people evacuate inside
the food trucks,

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:58.083 position:50% align:center
they'll be saved,

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:00.126 position:50% align:center
but there aren't
many trucks here,

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center
and there are few other places
to evacuate to.

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:06.549 position:50% align:center
That means I need to access
the traffic system,

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center
find all the trucks
with empty cargo trailers

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:11.179 position:50% align:center
currently in operation,
and gather them

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:12.305 position:50% align:center
to this parking lot.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.226 position:50% align:center
I'll create an evacuation
with my art!

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
Inability to protect
the weak ain't allowed!

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
- [gasping]

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
I wonder where Dad is?

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:26.945 position:50% align:center
- Old-fashioned,
French cruller,

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
long John,
strawberry custard,

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
honey-dipped,
sugar-glazed,

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:29.948 position:50% align:center
chocolate with sprinkle--
[beeping]

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:38.581 position:50% align:center
[cell phone vibrating]

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
[clicks]
Tsuzuragawa.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
Perfect timing.
I was about to call you.

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
- By any chance,

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
is there some anomaly going on

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
over there, Mr. Koki?

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.049 position:50% align:center
- Is Hazard Cast
showing something?

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
- Yes, something like that.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:52.595 position:50% align:center
- Send as many ambulances
as possible.

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.472 position:50% align:center
We may have a catastrophe
to deal with.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
- Copy that.

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
- [grunting]

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.896 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Right.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
Everybody, please,
get out of your vehicles!

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
- What?
What the hell?

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
- This
is surveillance camera footage.

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
- Both of you,
listen up!

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:12.824 position:50% align:center
We're moving out
to the bridge now!

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
both: Okay!
[speakers squeal]

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
- Um, everyone,
please calm down and listen.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
Hazard Cast is having
some trouble

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
and the notification
is delayed,

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
but a tornado's coming,
and it'll be here shortly.

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
Everyone please begin
your evacuations.

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
Please, distance yourself
from this island.

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
- A tornado?

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:32.761 position:50% align:center
- Do you think it's really going
to come?

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center
- Why hasn't Hazard Cast
alerted us?

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
- They won't start moving
right away,

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
but they feel uneasy.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
One more push.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
Hey, look!

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:43.104 position:50% align:center
The S.A.R.G.
is already evacuating!

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
- Wait, calling for S.A.R.G.?

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
- Shut up and run!
- Fine, I'm with you!

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:48.818 position:50% align:center
- Run!
[all gasping]

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:50.362 position:50% align:center
Run!
- Hold up!

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
Wait for me!
- Yeah, let's go.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
[tense music]

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
- The truck's cargo trailers
aren't quite heavy enough.

00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:00.038 position:50% align:center
They'll get carried away
in a tornado.

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
I need a way
to counter the wind.

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
- Hey, stop!
What are you doing?

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
- The bridge is going
to get clogged up because there

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
are cars parked here
and that's going

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
to create a big mess!
- What?

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center
- Oh, you don't get it.
- 'Cause you make no sense!

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]
Chikushi.

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
This guy's no good.
Let's arrest him!

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
- Hana!
- Hold on a second, Hana

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.688 position:50% align:center
Calm down!
- Let me go, Shuta!

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
We can't let something
like this run rampant!

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
- This is good.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
We'll be able to rescue
far more people this way.

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
[engine revving]

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
- I'll hear you out,
but let's go to security HQ.

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
- Lock him up!
- You've got to listen to me!

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
[all gasping]

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
- Why'd you bring
the Fes attendees to the bridge?

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:43.873 position:50% align:center
That truck's gonna crash.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center

[all screaming]

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
The tornado.

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
- What the hell
do you think you're doing?

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
- I should be asking you
that question!

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
Why did you do this?
- Huh?

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:30.128 position:50% align:center
Ko, people will be left behind
if you run!

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
The right answer
is to bring over cargo trailers

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
and evacuate inside them!

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
- That'd be irresponsible to do.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
I can't guarantee it's safe.

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
Maximizing the number
of escapees--

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:40.597 position:50% align:center
that's my priority!

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
- Hey, stop it, you guys!
- [grunts]

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
- It's no time to be arguing!

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
- Is this commotion
all your doing, RGB?

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center

Link the trailers together

There's no way she--

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:13.982 position:50% align:center

Unfortunately,
the festival has been canceled.

- Tragedy suddenly befell
a holiday event.

A tornado quickly formed
and tore through the venue

and over 130 seriously wounded.

According
to the Meteorological Bureau,

00:23:19.232 --> 00:23:20.400 position:50% align:center
the large tornado that formed--

00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:22.068 position:50% align:center
- I'm sure it was because
we didn't choose.

00:23:22.152 --> 00:23:23.653 position:50% align:center
- Huh?

00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:27.365 position:50% align:center
- Run on the bridge
or hide in containers.

00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:29.159 position:50% align:center
We had a choice.

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:32.620 position:50% align:center
- Should have chosen to take
the path that was more certain.

00:23:32.704 --> 00:23:34.831 position:50% align:center
- No way!
We should have been a team,

00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:36.458 position:50% align:center
and forged a new future.

00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:38.752 position:50% align:center
- How'd that work out for Kaba?
- [gasps]

00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:41.338 position:50% align:center
- It was us.

00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:44.049 position:50% align:center
We're the reason
Mr. Kaba's dead.

[static hissing]

00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:02.067 position:50% align:center
I wonder,

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.611 position:50% align:center
how did you enjoy
that little tornado show?

00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:07.364 position:50% align:center
My name is Carneades.

00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:09.657 position:50% align:center
I am the one who
will thrust choices

00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:11.951 position:50% align:center
for the future at the world.
