who's watching this,

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.768 position:50% align:center
I beg you, please,

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.438 position:50% align:center
find a way to support
my friends over at DoRed.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Ran.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
Don't move an inch.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.287 position:50% align:center
- Miss Shishido,
I got this.

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.789 position:50% align:center
- So, you knew who I was?

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.916 position:50% align:center
- I know you're not
this guy's accomplice.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.626 position:50% align:center
- You just let me run free?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.378 position:50% align:center
- You're the one
that deceived me.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center

How dare you kill--
[blow lands]

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.925 position:50% align:center
- Are you all right, Koki?
- Yeah.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
Let's take him in.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.847 position:50% align:center
[both gasping]

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center

- Who is that?

[all grunting]
- What the hell?

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:00.310 position:50% align:center
- Sorry about this!
- [grunts]

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
[both grunting]
- Koki!

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.855 position:50% align:center
After them!

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.024 position:50% align:center
They're outside, Kaoru!
- Okay!

[roller skates rolling]

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:08.943 position:50% align:center
- See ya!

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
- Those must be
his DoRed friends.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
Naito Kudo,
also known as Kunai.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.621 position:50% align:center
Born in Shantytown.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
Lives in Pylon Apartment.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.624 position:50% align:center
[keyboard clacking]

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.793 position:50% align:center
Kunai
was one year older compared

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:28.755 position:50% align:center
to me and Ran,
and he was Ran's best friend.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
I vaguely recall seeing Kunai.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.717 position:50% align:center
- Well done.
- [gasps]

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.886 position:50% align:center
- I'm proud of you, Koki.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
You stopped a terrorist attack.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:38.723 position:50% align:center
Smile a bit more.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.809 position:50% align:center
- I can't be complacent.

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:42.977 position:50% align:center
We haven't figured out
his motives yet.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.729 position:50% align:center
- Hmm.

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:48.608 position:50% align:center
That guy who got away,
it was Ran Akagi?

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.985 position:50% align:center
Was he somehow connected
with our perpetrator?

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.487 position:50% align:center
- Sounds forced.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.573 position:50% align:center
I don't think
the evidence suggests

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:57.033 position:50% align:center
he's a likely accomplice.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.994 position:50% align:center
- Then why'd he choose
to escape?

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.788 position:50% align:center
- To protect DoRed.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.415 position:50% align:center
It's clear that there's
a connection

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:05.166 position:50% align:center
between Naito and Ran.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.211 position:50% align:center
DoRed always violates
the anti-nuisance ordinance.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.089 position:50% align:center
S.A.R.G. would not hesitate
to crush the entire group.

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:14.092 position:50% align:center
- Still, at any rate,
it's attempted terrorism.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:16.177 position:50% align:center
We have to hear it
from his side.

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.846 position:50% align:center
Can you help us somehow?
Uh--

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.265 position:50% align:center
- I'll take a look, okay?

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
- Hmm.

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center
- You're under arrest
for illegal drug use!

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
- [groans]
- [shuddering]

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center
No, give it back!

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.152 position:50% align:center
I can't come down without
my phone!

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.279 position:50% align:center
- Shut it, scumbag!
[blow lands]

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.906 position:50% align:center
- You have the right
to remain silent.

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.784 position:50% align:center
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.786 position:50% align:center
- It's all over the news,
so I know that you know.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.621 position:50% align:center
- You have the right to--
- Now don't play dumb.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.582 position:50% align:center
Give us info on
this guy's buddies, DoRed.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.208 position:50% align:center
Now speak up!

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:49.878 position:50% align:center
They might be involved
in creating and selling Drug D!

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:53.089 position:50% align:center
Tell us now,
or you will be accomplices!

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.216 position:50% align:center
[drone blades humming]

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
- Seems things
are getting real now.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.055 position:50% align:center
Shantytown's filled
with S.A.R.G.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
- They're coming after us, huh?

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50% align:center
- But Kunai
was simply being used,

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50% align:center
wasn't he?

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.520 position:50% align:center
So shouldn't DoRed explain
everything we know about

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50% align:center
the attack to S.A.R.G.?
- A waste of time.

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:11.149 position:50% align:center
- Hmm?
- Oh, Ran!

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.109 position:50% align:center
- How you feelin'?
- Dammit, Ran.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.987 position:50% align:center
You called us all out there
with a scary text.

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.323 position:50% align:center
You take too many chances.

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:20.825 position:50% align:center
- You guys seriously saved
my ass,

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
but honestly,
it's still touch and go.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.455 position:50% align:center
- How did things get
to the point

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center
of Kunai getting shot to death?
- [exhales]

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.709 position:50% align:center
Why terrorism?
- [whimpers]

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
- Kunai was set up to become
the developer of Drug D...

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
By those guys who wanna
make Shantytown a casino.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
- That must be why Kunai
went after Howard's boat.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
- Revenge out of desperation,
I guess.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
- [shudders]
- Though,

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:48.228 position:50% align:center
could have been for us.
- Dammit, Kunai.

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
- Why didn't he come talk
to us and see some advice?

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
- I don't know.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center

[gasps]
No way!

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:03.993 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50% align:center
- Ran, what's wrong?

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
- Hey, so, Mrs. Kudo,

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
could you please tell us

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.835 position:50% align:center
a little bit about
your grandson Naito?

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
- Why, yes.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
Kunai is such a wonderful,
good-hearted boy.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
He's always been kind
ever since he was a child,

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
and good with machines.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
Wait, excuse me.
Where is my grandson right now?

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50% align:center
- Mrs. Kudo, I told you
that Naito...

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
- That vision had no future
where we could save Kunai.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
I made the correct decision.

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
I don't know how it works,

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
but the visions
are all very similar

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
to Hazard Cast.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
I should make
a direct inquiry about this.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
- Calls from Asumi?

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
- Yes, it started back
around May,

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
preceding nearby incidents.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
I kept getting phone calls
from her.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.629 position:50% align:center
- I see.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.632 position:50% align:center
- Father, do you possess
any knowledge about this?

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
Is this related to Haz--
- Koki!

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center
- You are someone who
will someday follow

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.850 position:50% align:center
in my footsteps
and govern the 24th ward.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50% align:center
Embrace reality.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50% align:center
Leave the past behind.

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
Enter the future.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
Can you?

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
- I can.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
- By the way,

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
I heard the reports
about last night.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
You played a part
in preventing terrorism?

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
Well done.
- [gasps]

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]
Thank you.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.871 position:50% align:center
- Mayor Suido's office.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
[phone trilling]
- [groans]

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
Why are neither Ran
or Koki picking up their cPhones

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
when I call them?

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
- You have an argument
or something?

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.633 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
Oh, Mari.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
No, it's not that.
[groaning]

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
- What's wrong?
Are you okay?

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
- Oh, it's just muscle cramps.
- [exhales]

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
You been working out again?

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
Hey, is it true that DoRed
had something to do

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50% align:center
with the attempted
terrorist attack two nights ago?

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.942 position:50% align:center
Uh, are Ran and Kinako okay?

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:00.527 position:50% align:center
- Who knows?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
I'd like to know myself.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]
- Hey, both of you!

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
Come inside!
Hurry!

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
- Hmm?
- Mom, why are you making such

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
a fuss?
- It's on the TV!

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
- I repeat, we have a statement
from the perpetrator

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
of the attempted bombing
two nights ago.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50% align:center
The bomber had arranged
for a video

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
to be released today at noon.

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
We will be broadcasting it live
starting immediately.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.593 position:50% align:center
- Uh, already?

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50% align:center
[tense music]

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
- This video has been set
for a scheduled release.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
The fact it's been broadcast
means S.A.R.G. has arrested me

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.650 position:50% align:center
or that I'm no longer alive.

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
My real name is Naito Kudo,

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.698 position:50% align:center
but everybody simply
calls me Kunai.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
Drug D has been getting popular
recently in Shantytown.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
I made Drug D.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
Or rather,
I created Di-VA,

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
the app which became the base
for Drug D.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
cPhones possess powerful
biometric sensors built into

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
their hardware.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
Their performance extends
way beyond personal use.

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:07.719 position:50% align:center
I used that to make an app--

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
one that is capable of having
a positive effect on the mind.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
That is Di-VA,
the music app which I created.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
However, somebody bought
the rights to it

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.814 position:50% align:center
and modified
the app work directly on

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
the human brain which made
people act and behave strangely.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
- That is the truth
behind Drug D.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
Howard Win the casino king
was on the WINNER'S--

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center
the boat that I targeted.

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
It was him--
Mr. Howard Win--

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
who had pushed
for the distribution of Drug D.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.625 position:50% align:center
He did this in order
to intentionally ruin

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
the peace and order
of Shantytown.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
I have no way of knowing yet

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
if my attack will succeed
or fail.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
However, I do not believe

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50% align:center
I'm doing anything
morally wrong.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.681 position:50% align:center
I'm sure information
will be available soon anyways.

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.974 position:50% align:center
So allow me
to make one confession.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
I used to be a part
of the group DoRed.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center
So I'm pretty sure S.A.R.G.
will try to keep DoRed

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
under their control.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
But this was something
I did alone.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
This incident had nothing
to do at all with DoRed.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
If you think the ward's politics
are a bit too pushy,

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
if you also desire
to help protect Shantytown,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
to everybody
who's watching this,

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.458 position:50% align:center
I beg you, please.
- [whimpering]

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
- Find a way to support
my friends over at DoRed.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:29.384 position:50% align:center
- You are an artist, Ran.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50% align:center
- Message received, Kunai.

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
So is everyone ready?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.139 position:50% align:center
- Uh-huh.
- Indeed.

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.515 position:50% align:center
- Bet.
- We'll do everything

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
but violence.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
It's time to go to war, DoRed!

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.187 position:50% align:center
- Was that really the bomber?
- We have just broadcast...

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center
- Said so himself.
So why wouldn't he be?

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:44.524 position:50% align:center
- DoRed.
- Huh?

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
- That's what's goin' on.
- It's true the ward's policies

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.193 position:50% align:center
are a bit aggressive

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
but can we believe this?
- [gasps]

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
[door bell jingles]
- Oh, welcome!

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
- Sorry, Kiriko,
but I'm done for today.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
- What?

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.492 position:50% align:center
You were goofing off earlier,
though!

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
I want to go eat lunch, too,
you know!

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
- Shu!

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center
Here!
- Hmm?

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
[both grunting]

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
- A souvenir.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.129 position:50% align:center
You're gonna need it, right?

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
- [scoffs]
Yeah.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
You're so right.
Thank you!

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:15.805 position:50% align:center
- He turned it against us.
Now S.A.R.G. is the villain.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
- Cancel my afternoon plans.
- [gasps]

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.268 position:50% align:center
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Father?

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:21.811 position:50% align:center
- Come with me, Koki.

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
I'm going to show you
the future of Tokyo's 24th ward.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
Could the destination be...

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
- Information collection spire.
The Cornucopia.

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
Once complete,

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
it will become
a monument symbolic

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
of the 24th ward.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
No, all of Japan.

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:49.089 position:50% align:center
[tense music]

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.469 position:50% align:center
This is the Special
Administrative Region

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:55.970 position:50% align:center
Central Information center.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.932 position:50% align:center
- So the lowest floor is also
the core of Hazard Cast?

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
- Even in the 24th ward,

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.144 position:50% align:center
only a few are aware
of its whereabouts.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
It's top secret.
[buzzing]

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
[doors hissing]

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
- Welcome, sirs.

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
- Tsuzuragawa.

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50% align:center
- This is the location
of Hazard Cast's roots.

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
Sensors within the 24th ward
are mainly surveillance cameras.

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
You may already be aware
of that,

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
but we gather and analyze
an immense amount

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
of data from them.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
This lets us broadcast
Hazard Cast

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
to people's cPhones
for their safety.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
This system uses a Next Gen
Macroscopic Complex Computer.

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
We call it KANAE.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
- Did you say KANAE?
- That's right.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
The system's named after
your mother, Mrs. Kanae.

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
Before she left for her new post
at Takara Elementary School,

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
she had been doing research
about smart cities.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.452 position:50% align:center
The foundation
of the KANAE System

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
was developed by Mrs. Kanae.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
Her last wish was to guard
the current safety

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
of the 24th ward.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
- The upkeep of peace and order
will usher in a new generation

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
by incorporating information
from cPhones distributed

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
to the ward residents.

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
Koki, I will show you
the special brain

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
that's at the root--
or rather at the heart--

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
of the KANAE System.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
- A special brain?
I don't...

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.687 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
[mechanical whirring]

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
[gears clicking]

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.528 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
No!

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.405 position:50% align:center
Can that be?

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
- High-performance sensors
so good,

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
even the military uses 'em.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
Powerful security chip.
Ay dios mio.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50% align:center
Saying it's below cost
doesn't even cut it.

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
You simply must
be hiding some kind

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.836 position:50% align:center
of secret, huh, Gori Suido?
[buzzing]

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
- Hey, open up!
Ran, hello?

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center
- Hola.
- Don't you  hola  me.

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.762 position:50% align:center
Why aren't you answering
your phone?

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:03.556 position:50% align:center
- Oh, time slipped away from me.
- Huh?

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
Hey, are cPhones really bad?

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
D actually is spread because
of this?

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
- So Shu,
you see Kunai's broadcast?

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
- Yeah.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center
Kunai did look vaguely familiar.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.533 position:50% align:center
- You met him a few times
in the past.

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:25.995 position:50% align:center
- Hey, you think there's
any chance Carneades

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
is framing us?

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
- Maybe he's forcing us

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
to make choices where
there's always a casualty just

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
to toy with us.
- What?

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.133 position:50% align:center
Like he's also predicting
our future behavior?

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
Then how is Asumi involved?

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
Weren't you the one who said it
was Asumi calling us for help?

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
- That--that would be...

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
- Don't come by here anymore.
- Huh?

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
- Kunai said all that stuff
in his video earlier

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
but it'll give S.A.R.G. just
the right excuse

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center
to come after DoRed anyway.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
And Ko knows about this place.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
What are you talking about?

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
Are you saying Koki
will sell you out?

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
- Probably.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:06.411 position:50% align:center
- But we're RGB when all three

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
of us are together.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
If we're split up like this,

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:10.790 position:50% align:center
what are we gonna tell Asumi
or Kaba?

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.334 position:50% align:center
Fix that phone.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
I'll make Koki call you

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:14.753 position:50% align:center
and promise to never betray us.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.087 position:50% align:center
I'm out.

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:17.756 position:50% align:center
You can eat that
and get in better spirits.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.802 position:50% align:center
[door opens and closes]

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
- Ko's gonna do it.
Sell us out.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
[mystical music]

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
- Thanks for your patronage.
- [laughs]

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
- I've got some good stuff.
Look around.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
- Oh, the one I bought

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
the other day
was super delicious.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
