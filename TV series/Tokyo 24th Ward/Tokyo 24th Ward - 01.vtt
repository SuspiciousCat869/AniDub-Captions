00:31:10.161 --> 00:31:11.830 position:50% align:center
far from the station
to begin with?

00:31:12.372 --> 00:31:13.415 position:50% align:center
What in the world?

00:31:16.084 --> 00:31:18.336 position:50% align:center
That's Daisy!
[both gasping]

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.880 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Ran, you can hack into
a transmitter, right?

00:31:20.964 --> 00:31:22.674 position:50% align:center
- Depends on the model
and its parameters.

00:31:22.757 --> 00:31:24.217 position:50% align:center
- The model.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.178 position:50% align:center
The model number is--
it's GP-257S.

00:31:27.262 --> 00:31:29.264 position:50% align:center
- Wow, Ko.
You're such an enthusiast.

00:31:29.347 --> 00:31:31.391 position:50% align:center
Military model
from Toki Electrics.

00:31:31.474 --> 00:31:33.601 position:50% align:center
If I remember correctly,
it has a security hole.

00:31:33.685 --> 00:31:35.020 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:31:35.103 --> 00:31:37.272 position:50% align:center
I'm feelin' pretty good today.

00:31:37.355 --> 00:31:39.107 position:50% align:center
'Kay, I should be able
to make it in.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.900 position:50% align:center
So all I need now is--
- Don't worry.

00:31:40.984 --> 00:31:42.694 position:50% align:center
I've got you.
The username is Tsuzuragawa,

00:31:42.777 --> 00:31:44.029 position:50% align:center
and the password is...

00:31:46.322 --> 00:31:47.490 position:50% align:center
Password is...

00:31:47.574 --> 00:31:49.117 position:50% align:center
both: Berliner Pfannkuchen.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.202 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]
- Eh?

00:31:51.286 --> 00:31:53.121 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:31:53.204 --> 00:31:54.372 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:31:54.456 --> 00:31:57.000 position:50% align:center
- Shuta, Nijimi Station.
- I got it.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.171 position:50% align:center
- Oh, wow.
What is going on here?

00:32:01.254 --> 00:32:03.423 position:50% align:center
Looks like some kind
of protest.

00:32:03.506 --> 00:32:04.883 position:50% align:center
They're so hyped up about it.

00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:06.509 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's Koki's dad.

00:32:06.593 --> 00:32:08.011 position:50% align:center
[all shouting]
- Make way!

00:32:08.094 --> 00:32:09.804 position:50% align:center
Ask us your questions later!
- Please!

00:32:09.888 --> 00:32:10.805 position:50% align:center
Let us through!

00:32:11.931 --> 00:32:13.975 position:50% align:center
- Hello.
Welcome, Mayor Suido.

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:15.685 position:50% align:center
- Thank you.
We're under your care for today.

00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:16.978 position:50% align:center
- Sir, wait.
- [grunts]

00:32:17.062 --> 00:32:18.813 position:50% align:center
- The protesters have made
their way inside.

00:32:18.897 --> 00:32:20.648 position:50% align:center
- Abolish Hazard Cast!
- [grunting]

00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:22.901 position:50% align:center
- I got him!
- Hold him down!

00:32:22.984 --> 00:32:25.820 position:50% align:center
- Looks like he got too excited
and ran out of control.

00:32:25.904 --> 00:32:27.655 position:50% align:center
- Violence rarely achieves
anything good.

00:32:27.739 --> 00:32:30.075 position:50% align:center
- Why do we tolerate idiots
like that?

00:32:30.158 --> 00:32:31.618 position:50% align:center
- I suppose we'll have
to call attention

00:32:31.701 --> 00:32:33.495 position:50% align:center
to this within DoRed
soon enough.

00:32:33.578 --> 00:32:34.871 position:50% align:center
- Uh, hi.
It's Mari.

00:32:34.954 --> 00:32:36.039 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Mari.
Where are you?

00:32:36.122 --> 00:32:38.667 position:50% align:center
- Uh, Nijimi Station.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.585 position:50% align:center
- All right, listen to me.
[dog barks]

00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:42.295 position:50% align:center
Mari, what happened?

00:32:42.379 --> 00:32:44.422 position:50% align:center
- Daisy, wait!
Come back here!

00:32:44.506 --> 00:32:46.174 position:50% align:center
[dog barking]
No, don't go that way!

00:32:46.257 --> 00:32:47.384 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'll talk to you later!

00:32:47.467 --> 00:32:49.719 position:50% align:center
Daisy!
[dog barking]

00:32:51.137 --> 00:32:52.514 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Mari!
Mari!

00:32:52.597 --> 00:32:54.265 position:50% align:center
Dammit!
[grunts]

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.394 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:32:57.477 --> 00:32:59.312 position:50% align:center
I don't understand it very well,

00:32:59.396 --> 00:33:00.980 position:50% align:center
but if that vision became
a reality...

00:33:02.023 --> 00:33:03.900 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
No way in hell!

00:33:03.983 --> 00:33:05.819 position:50% align:center
- Shu!
Take this and put it on!

00:33:05.902 --> 00:33:07.278 position:50% align:center
- [grunting]

00:33:07.362 --> 00:33:08.488 position:50% align:center
- It's part of a pair!

00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:10.031 position:50% align:center
- Okay!
- Shuta!

00:33:10.115 --> 00:33:11.574 position:50% align:center
What do you think you're doing?
- Ko?

00:33:11.658 --> 00:33:13.159 position:50% align:center
- Don't worry.
I know.

00:33:13.243 --> 00:33:14.369 position:50% align:center
Dammit.
[inhales sharply]

00:33:14.452 --> 00:33:16.246 position:50% align:center
Why did we see such
a terrible vision?

00:33:16.329 --> 00:33:17.956 position:50% align:center
- I was thinkin' the same thing.

00:33:19.165 --> 00:33:20.125 position:50% align:center
- What is going on?

00:33:20.208 --> 00:33:21.334 position:50% align:center
My body feels so light.

00:33:24.504 --> 00:33:26.172 position:50% align:center
I'm so confused.
- Hello.

00:33:26.256 --> 00:33:28.091 position:50% align:center
- So many things
I don't understand at all.

00:33:28.174 --> 00:33:30.176 position:50% align:center
I would!
- You're connected.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.803 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Shu.
- That you, Ran?

00:33:31.886 --> 00:33:33.763 position:50% align:center
- We're connected now.
- [grunts]

00:33:33.847 --> 00:33:36.057 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Shuta.
You also saw it, didn't you?

00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:37.600 position:50% align:center
- [gasps]
Then--

00:33:37.684 --> 00:33:39.394 position:50% align:center
- Looks like
it's no coincidence.

00:33:39.477 --> 00:33:41.312 position:50% align:center
- Nothing more than
a possibility for now.

00:33:41.396 --> 00:33:42.856 position:50% align:center
- I don't think that's true.

00:33:42.939 --> 00:33:45.191 position:50% align:center
One of those two images
will become reality.

00:33:45.275 --> 00:33:47.861 position:50% align:center
[tense music]

00:33:47.944 --> 00:33:49.237 position:50% align:center
- [panting]
- The mayor has arrived.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.780 position:50% align:center
- Okay, we should check
the microphone

00:33:50.864 --> 00:33:51.865 position:50% align:center
and the ornamental ball.

00:33:54.534 --> 00:33:55.452 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]

00:33:55.535 --> 00:33:57.537 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.913 position:50% align:center
This is not good!

00:33:58.997 --> 00:34:00.999 position:50% align:center
Come on, Daisy!

00:34:01.082 --> 00:34:03.418 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
You hear something just now?

00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:06.004 position:50% align:center
- I mean, the group is gonna
be coming down in a moment.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.922 position:50% align:center
- [panting]

00:34:08.006 --> 00:34:08.923 position:50% align:center
I still have time before

00:34:09.007 --> 00:34:10.425 position:50% align:center
the train arrives, right?

00:34:10.967 --> 00:34:12.677 position:50% align:center
- Can't let it happen.

00:34:12.761 --> 00:34:15.263 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:34:15.347 --> 00:34:17.515 position:50% align:center
Can't let a future like that
become reality!

00:34:18.933 --> 00:34:24.898 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:34:29.027 --> 00:34:30.111 position:50% align:center
[both grunting]

00:34:30.195 --> 00:34:31.363 position:50% align:center
- What's this?

00:34:31.446 --> 00:34:33.031 position:50% align:center
My body is strangely light.

00:34:33.114 --> 00:34:34.240 position:50% align:center
- You feel that, too, Ko?

00:34:34.324 --> 00:34:35.742 position:50% align:center
- I do.

00:34:35.825 --> 00:34:37.619 position:50% align:center
- Strange feeling.
Wonder what's going on?

00:34:37.702 --> 00:34:39.412 position:50% align:center
- Whoa, take a look at Shu.

00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:40.872 position:50% align:center
He's on a whole different level
from us.

00:34:40.955 --> 00:34:42.874 position:50% align:center
- [breathing heavily]

00:34:42.957 --> 00:34:44.876 position:50% align:center
- I can't catch up to that.

00:34:44.959 --> 00:34:46.878 position:50% align:center
- That's beyond
what humans can do.

00:34:46.961 --> 00:34:48.880 position:50% align:center
I'll head over to the station.
- Huh?

00:34:48.963 --> 00:34:50.590 position:50% align:center
- What about you?
- Uh, oh,

00:34:50.674 --> 00:34:51.966 position:50% align:center
I've already arrived.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.468 position:50% align:center
Little old me was making his way
to this place.

00:34:53.551 --> 00:34:54.761 position:50% align:center
This building right here.

00:34:54.844 --> 00:34:56.888 position:50% align:center
I have a light-speed
road just

00:34:56.971 --> 00:34:58.348 position:50% align:center
for me waiting up on the roof.

00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:00.308 position:50% align:center
- Most interesting.

00:35:00.392 --> 00:35:02.894 position:50% align:center
Tsuzuragawa!
[engine revving]

00:35:02.977 --> 00:35:04.854 position:50% align:center
So, you did put one on me.

00:35:04.938 --> 00:35:07.273 position:50% align:center
- Mr. Koki,
please use this.

00:35:07.357 --> 00:35:08.358 position:50% align:center
- Thanks a lot.

00:35:09.567 --> 00:35:11.069 position:50% align:center
Hmm.
Where was it?

00:35:11.152 --> 00:35:13.071 position:50% align:center
- Ah, behind your collar.

00:35:13.154 --> 00:35:15.240 position:50% align:center
- [grunting]

00:35:15.323 --> 00:35:16.866 position:50% align:center
I told you not
to put one on me.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.326 position:50% align:center
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.496 position:50% align:center
[engine revving]

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.251 position:50% align:center
- Hey, Kinako.
Can you hear me?

00:35:27.293 --> 00:35:29.045 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
Ran.

00:35:29.129 --> 00:35:30.714 position:50% align:center
You're earlier than we planned.

00:35:30.797 --> 00:35:32.841 position:50% align:center
- You ready?
- It's perfection.

00:35:32.924 --> 00:35:34.592 position:50% align:center
With the speed of the train--
- Hey,

00:35:34.676 --> 00:35:36.469 position:50% align:center
is there anyone on the tracks?
- Huh?

00:35:36.553 --> 00:35:37.971 position:50% align:center
On the tracks?

00:35:38.054 --> 00:35:39.389 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:35:39.472 --> 00:35:41.516 position:50% align:center
- Daisy!
Stop running!

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:43.685 position:50% align:center
- This won't end
with a simple scolding!

00:35:43.768 --> 00:35:45.603 position:50% align:center
She's in so much trouble!
[dog barks]

00:35:45.687 --> 00:35:47.689 position:50% align:center
Daisy!
[dog grunting]

00:35:47.772 --> 00:35:50.692 position:50% align:center
[breathing heavily]

00:35:50.775 --> 00:35:52.318 position:50% align:center
Daisy, you okay?
Huh?

00:35:52.402 --> 00:35:53.445 position:50% align:center
[dog whimpering]

00:35:53.528 --> 00:35:54.779 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
[snapping]

00:35:54.863 --> 00:35:55.989 position:50% align:center
That hurts.

[gasps]

00:35:57.407 --> 00:35:58.575 position:50% align:center
What?

00:35:58.658 --> 00:36:00.577 position:50% align:center
Crap, what do I do?
My foot is stuck!

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.870 position:50% align:center
- This is a disaster!

00:36:01.953 --> 00:36:03.371 position:50% align:center
There is someone out on
the tracks!

00:36:03.455 --> 00:36:05.081 position:50% align:center
Wait just a sec.
It's Mari?

00:36:05.165 --> 00:36:06.833 position:50% align:center
[shouting]

00:36:08.793 --> 00:36:10.295 position:50% align:center
What should we do?

00:36:10.378 --> 00:36:11.880 position:50% align:center
- [groans]
- We have to go save her!

00:36:11.963 --> 00:36:13.381 position:50% align:center
- You won't get to her
in time from there.

00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:14.341 position:50% align:center
I have an idea.
[beeps]

[gasps]

00:36:15.383 --> 00:36:16.760 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:36:16.843 --> 00:36:18.970 position:50% align:center
What?
A stand-alone?

00:36:19.054 --> 00:36:21.765 position:50% align:center
The train's sales pitch was that
it was auto piloted, right?

00:36:21.848 --> 00:36:23.558 position:50% align:center
I can't believe this!

00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:25.643 position:50% align:center
It's like they want
to have an accident happen!

00:36:26.519 --> 00:36:28.730 position:50% align:center
- The rumor that
the Kizuna train's construction

00:36:28.813 --> 00:36:31.232 position:50% align:center
was shoddy because
they hurried completion seems

00:36:31.316 --> 00:36:32.359 position:50% align:center
to be true.

00:36:32.442 --> 00:36:33.651 position:50% align:center
- [groans]

00:36:33.735 --> 00:36:35.111 position:50% align:center
- Is equipped with the latest...

00:36:35.195 --> 00:36:37.364 position:50% align:center
- Well, we're gonna do
the same thing in the end.

00:36:37.447 --> 00:36:38.948 position:50% align:center
What about the drone?

00:36:39.032 --> 00:36:40.408 position:50% align:center
- It's set up at the station.

00:36:40.492 --> 00:36:41.826 position:50% align:center
We can go at any time.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:43.912 position:50% align:center
- I'm gonna borrow your PC.
- Okay.

00:36:43.995 --> 00:36:45.038 position:50% align:center
I'm confirming
the hub connection.

[mechanics whirring]

00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:49.292 position:50% align:center
- I have to operate it
while rewriting

00:36:49.376 --> 00:36:51.044 position:50% align:center
the program I prepared.

00:36:51.127 --> 00:36:52.796 position:50% align:center
The endorphins
are through the roof.

[grunting]

00:36:55.465 --> 00:36:56.383 position:50% align:center
Jeez.

[groaning]

00:37:02.222 --> 00:37:05.016 position:50% align:center
Helping out the vulnerable
is what my art is all about!

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.518 position:50% align:center
Take off!
[buzzing]

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.231 position:50% align:center
[all gasping]
- What's that over there?

00:37:11.314 --> 00:37:13.191 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's that drone--
- Is that a terrorist?

00:37:13.274 --> 00:37:14.818 position:50% align:center
- That's a drone from DoRed!

00:37:14.901 --> 00:37:16.653 position:50% align:center
- Exactly whose drone is this?
- Attention autocratic

00:37:16.736 --> 00:37:18.655 position:50% align:center
Ward Mayor Gori Suido.

00:37:18.738 --> 00:37:20.949 position:50% align:center
You need to deploy a rescue team
to to tracks which

00:37:21.032 --> 00:37:22.659 position:50% align:center
the Kizuna train is running on.

00:37:22.742 --> 00:37:25.412 position:50% align:center
About 3,000 feet before
the junction to the depot,

00:37:25.495 --> 00:37:28.206 position:50% align:center
there's a girl and
a dog immobilized at that spot.

00:37:28.289 --> 00:37:29.916 position:50% align:center
Save them.
- This guy is a con job.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.585 position:50% align:center
- Or they'll be run over by
the Kizuna train and die.

00:37:32.669 --> 00:37:33.878 position:50% align:center
[all gasping]
- [snarls]

00:37:33.962 --> 00:37:35.130 position:50% align:center
I'll shoot it down!

00:37:35.213 --> 00:37:36.381 position:50% align:center
- Wait! Hana, calm down.
- Don't make a scene.

00:37:36.464 --> 00:37:38.383 position:50% align:center
Let's be cool.
[drone buzzing]

00:37:39.134 --> 00:37:41.094 position:50% align:center
- [grunting]
- Do you think the accident

00:37:41.177 --> 00:37:42.387 position:50% align:center
we saw in that image
will really happen?

00:37:43.596 --> 00:37:45.181 position:50% align:center
- No way I would know.

00:37:45.265 --> 00:37:47.517 position:50% align:center
However, considering
the circumstantial evidence...

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.852 position:50% align:center
- [grunting]
I don't get it!

00:37:48.935 --> 00:37:50.353 position:50% align:center
Why is my body so light?

00:37:50.437 --> 00:37:52.063 position:50% align:center
Is is because of that call
from Asumi?

00:37:52.147 --> 00:37:53.648 position:50% align:center
- There's no possible way
we received

00:37:53.732 --> 00:37:54.983 position:50% align:center
a call from the dead.

00:37:55.066 --> 00:37:57.569 position:50% align:center
However, it felt like my brain
was hacked

00:37:57.652 --> 00:37:58.611 position:50% align:center
and the image
was planted directly

00:37:58.695 --> 00:37:59.946 position:50% align:center
into my head.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:01.364 position:50% align:center
- Even little old me
doesn't know

00:38:01.448 --> 00:38:03.450 position:50% align:center
any technology
that can do stuff like that.

00:38:03.533 --> 00:38:06.244 position:50% align:center
We hackers aren't magicians,
after all.

00:38:06.327 --> 00:38:08.830 position:50% align:center
- Be easy to understand if it
was all magic!

00:38:08.913 --> 00:38:11.124 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm literally leaping
over tall buildings

00:38:11.207 --> 00:38:12.584 position:50% align:center
at this moment!

00:38:12.667 --> 00:38:14.169 position:50% align:center
- Seems we have urban legends

00:38:14.252 --> 00:38:16.087 position:50% align:center
and the occult happening one
after another.

00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:17.714 position:50% align:center
[gulping]

00:38:17.797 --> 00:38:19.257 position:50% align:center
[exhales sharply]
But,

00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:21.384 position:50% align:center
it's also true we have
to go along with it.

00:38:21.468 --> 00:38:23.553 position:50% align:center
- Yeah, I don't want
those visions to come true!

00:38:23.636 --> 00:38:26.222 position:50% align:center
Both of those futures were
the worst results possible!

00:38:26.765 --> 00:38:29.184 position:50% align:center
I am certain that Asumi
is telling us

00:38:29.267 --> 00:38:30.518 position:50% align:center
to save the two of them.

00:38:32.145 --> 00:38:35.648 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:38:35.732 --> 00:38:37.525 position:50% align:center
- Please,
do not lean over the railing!

00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:39.361 position:50% align:center
Everyone please listen.
You all need to calm down.

00:38:39.444 --> 00:38:40.612 position:50% align:center
- What?
No way.

00:38:40.695 --> 00:38:42.530 position:50% align:center
- Huh?
- You've gotta be kidding me.

00:38:42.614 --> 00:38:44.449 position:50% align:center
- What is it?
- Take a look at this here.

00:38:44.908 --> 00:38:47.619 position:50% align:center
Approximately one half mile
beyond the drone.

00:38:47.702 --> 00:38:50.497 position:50% align:center
There really is a woman and
a dog stuck down on the tracks!

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.499 position:50% align:center
- What am I gonna do?
- What?

00:38:52.582 --> 00:38:55.418 position:50% align:center
Hey, chief, there is a woman
and a dog out there!

00:38:55.502 --> 00:38:57.629 position:50% align:center
- No way!
- Listen, chief.

00:38:57.712 --> 00:38:59.297 position:50% align:center
- Yes, sending
a rescue unit right away.

00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:00.298 position:50% align:center
- Negative.
First you need

00:39:00.382 --> 00:39:01.758 position:50% align:center
to contact the control room.

00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:03.843 position:50% align:center
Step one is activate
remote control

00:39:03.927 --> 00:39:05.428 position:50% align:center
and have the train come
to a stop.

00:39:05.512 --> 00:39:06.846 position:50% align:center
- Uh, yes, sir.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.431 position:50% align:center
[tires squealing]

00:39:08.515 --> 00:39:09.557 position:50% align:center
- Hold up!

00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:10.642 position:50% align:center
You're not allowed
to come in here!

00:39:10.725 --> 00:39:11.935 position:50% align:center
- I'm S.A.R.G.!

00:39:12.018 --> 00:39:14.437 position:50% align:center
- It won't accept our emergency
stop signal?

00:39:14.521 --> 00:39:16.356 position:50% align:center
- Wha--but how did the train
end up like this?

00:39:16.439 --> 00:39:18.149 position:50% align:center
- You're the ones
who made us work fast

00:39:18.233 --> 00:39:19.693 position:50% align:center
so we would finish on time!

00:39:19.776 --> 00:39:21.528 position:50% align:center
We didn't have enough time
to test things!

00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:23.321 position:50% align:center
This sort of thing
was bound to happen!

00:39:23.655 --> 00:39:25.073 position:50% align:center
We're trying
to make something of this,

00:39:25.156 --> 00:39:26.574 position:50% align:center
but we simply
don't have enough time!

00:39:26.658 --> 00:39:28.618 position:50% align:center
- I--I'm sorry but frankly
we can't accept that.

00:39:28.702 --> 00:39:29.619 position:50% align:center
- Impossible!
- [grunts]

00:39:29.703 --> 00:39:31.246 position:50% align:center
- The Kizuna train won't stop

00:39:31.329 --> 00:39:32.706 position:50% align:center
until it arrives at the station!

00:39:32.789 --> 00:39:35.166 position:50% align:center
- Oh, no.
- I'm so sorry.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.210 position:50% align:center
This is a miscommunication
on my end.

00:39:37.293 --> 00:39:39.004 position:50% align:center
- For now just focus
on the train.

00:39:39.087 --> 00:39:41.673 position:50% align:center
We must rescue
that innocent woman somehow.

00:39:41.756 --> 00:39:43.842 position:50% align:center
- Heading over right away!
- Good idea.

00:39:43.925 --> 00:39:45.093 position:50% align:center
- But can she make it?

00:39:45.176 --> 00:39:46.594 position:50% align:center
- It's less
than two minutes before

00:39:46.678 --> 00:39:49.222 position:50% align:center
the Kizuna arrives.
It seems a bit tight.

00:39:49.305 --> 00:39:50.724 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]
- We don't know what's going

00:39:50.807 --> 00:39:53.101 position:50% align:center
to happen so some one needs
to be close regardless.

00:39:53.184 --> 00:39:54.477 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]

00:39:54.561 --> 00:39:56.021 position:50% align:center
- Can you switch rails
at that junction

00:39:56.104 --> 00:39:57.188 position:50% align:center
the drone was talking about?

00:39:57.272 --> 00:39:59.524 position:50% align:center
- It's possible,
but at that speed,

00:39:59.607 --> 00:40:01.401 position:50% align:center
it will very likely derail.

00:40:01.484 --> 00:40:03.194 position:50% align:center
- If we choose
to do nothing then

00:40:03.278 --> 00:40:04.988 position:50% align:center
the woman will definitely get
run over, right?

00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:06.781 position:50% align:center
- Well, that is true, yes.

00:40:06.865 --> 00:40:09.367 position:50% align:center
- This is exactly like that
infamous trolley dilemma.

00:40:09.451 --> 00:40:11.411 position:50% align:center
- If I didn't attempt to save
a woman who would have been

00:40:11.494 --> 00:40:12.704 position:50% align:center
run over for certain,

00:40:12.787 --> 00:40:14.205 position:50% align:center
the public
would never forgive me

00:40:14.289 --> 00:40:15.749 position:50% align:center
for allowing such a travesty.

00:40:15.832 --> 00:40:16.875 position:50% align:center
- Don't do it!
[all gasping]

00:40:16.958 --> 00:40:18.877 position:50% align:center
- [panting]
- Koki!

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.337 position:50% align:center
- If you switch the tracks,

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.256 position:50% align:center
the Kizuna train will derail
and more people will die.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.300 position:50% align:center
- Son, that's why you burst in?

00:40:25.383 --> 00:40:26.885 position:50% align:center
Kids should stay quiet.

00:40:26.968 --> 00:40:29.471 position:50% align:center
- Sorry, sir,
but I just can't do that.

00:40:29.554 --> 00:40:33.183 position:50% align:center
[whooshing]

00:40:33.266 --> 00:40:34.976 position:50% align:center
He's still indecisive.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.770 position:50% align:center
In order to save everyone,

00:40:36.853 --> 00:40:39.356 position:50% align:center
I have to mobilize
my own father.

00:40:39.439 --> 00:40:41.816 position:50% align:center
For some reason I have
a feeling about what I

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.193 position:50% align:center
should say
to make him do something.

00:40:43.276 --> 00:40:45.278 position:50% align:center
But worst case scenario,

00:40:45.362 --> 00:40:47.947 position:50% align:center
this decision could leave Mari
to die.

00:40:48.031 --> 00:40:49.866 position:50% align:center
What will you do,
Koki Suido?

00:40:49.949 --> 00:40:51.493 position:50% align:center
- Understood.
- [grunts]

00:40:51.576 --> 00:40:53.995 position:50% align:center
- Mayor--no, father.
Listen to me.

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:56.706 position:50% align:center
Mother and Asumi
have shown me something...

00:40:57.582 --> 00:40:58.541 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.171 position:50% align:center
Chief, hold on.
- [grunts]

00:41:03.254 --> 00:41:04.172 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:41:04.798 --> 00:41:05.715 position:50% align:center
- [grunts]

00:41:07.509 --> 00:41:09.135 position:50% align:center
- Don't switch over
to the other rail.

00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:11.304 position:50% align:center
Stop that train
at any cost necessary.

00:41:11.388 --> 00:41:12.430 position:50% align:center
- Uh, yes, sir!

00:41:12.514 --> 00:41:13.973 position:50% align:center
Calling all hands!

00:41:14.057 --> 00:41:16.017 position:50% align:center
We will not switch the rails
of the Kizuna!

00:41:16.101 --> 00:41:17.519 position:50% align:center
We won't switch them!

00:41:17.602 --> 00:41:19.896 position:50% align:center
- Now, Ran.
It's your turn next.

00:41:19.979 --> 00:41:22.148 position:50% align:center
You're up.
- [gulping]

00:41:22.232 --> 00:41:23.358 position:50% align:center
[exhales sharply]

00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:25.026 position:50% align:center
I'm fully aware of that fact!

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.153 position:50% align:center
If ringing somebody's phone
doesn't work,

00:41:27.237 --> 00:41:29.239 position:50% align:center
then you gotta knock
on their front door!

00:41:29.322 --> 00:41:31.366 position:50% align:center
Even if it does possess
a stand-alone,

00:41:31.449 --> 00:41:33.576 position:50% align:center
the Kizuna train would need
to operate under Japan's

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.745 position:50% align:center
600-meter clause.
Therefore,

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:37.956 position:50% align:center
if we can get
the emergency brakes to engage,

00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:40.750 position:50% align:center
it should come to a stop
within 600 meters.

00:41:40.834 --> 00:41:41.960 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:41:42.043 --> 00:41:43.878 position:50% align:center
I'll engage
those emergency brakes

00:41:43.962 --> 00:41:45.880 position:50% align:center
as far away from Mari
as possible.

00:41:45.964 --> 00:41:46.840 position:50% align:center
[whooshing]

00:41:46.923 --> 00:41:48.591 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:41:48.675 --> 00:41:51.344 position:50% align:center
[tracks squealing]

00:41:51.428 --> 00:41:52.762 position:50% align:center
- Brakes!

00:41:54.055 --> 00:41:55.515 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap.

00:41:55.598 --> 00:41:57.225 position:50% align:center
The train's not stopping!

00:41:57.308 --> 00:41:58.351 position:50% align:center
Daisy, no!

00:41:58.435 --> 00:42:00.270 position:50% align:center
If you stay here,
you'll die, too!

00:42:00.353 --> 00:42:01.980 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
No, you have to go!

00:42:02.063 --> 00:42:03.982 position:50% align:center
[dog barking]
[whimpering]

00:42:04.065 --> 00:42:06.526 position:50% align:center
You're so dumb,
you stupid dog!

00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:08.737 position:50% align:center
- Well, that was about
everything little old me

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.488 position:50% align:center
is capable of contributing
right now.

00:42:10.572 --> 00:42:12.407 position:50% align:center
- It's all up to you.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:15.035 position:50% align:center
