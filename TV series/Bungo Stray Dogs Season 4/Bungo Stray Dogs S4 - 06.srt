1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,340
[TONAN]
In solemn recognition

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,300
of the Armed Detective Agency's
considerable contributions

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,720
during the White Whale Incident

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,230
as they worked to protect
the safety of the city

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,640
and the citizens of Yokohama,

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,020
we award the Futsuma
Shikyu Award.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,820
[TONAN] Your Agency is
the pride of our nation.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,200
[MAN A] I don't think
that a private company

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,580
has ever been awarded
the Shikyu Award.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,540
[MAN B]
It's easy to see why.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,290
They captured Pushkin and Fyodor

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,420
after the European authorities
failed to do so.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,000
Rumor has it the Detective
Agency's been tapped

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,550
as special advisers to the
municipal police combat squad.

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,720
If that's true, the Special
Investigation Department

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,260
has fresh mud on its face.

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,600
[TONAN] They have no
reason to be ashamed.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,510
That's just an example
of how capable

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,680
the Armed Detective
Agency truly is.

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,140
[MAN A] Well, hello,
Assistant Senior Attorney.

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,690
This is all unofficial,

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,110
but it was the Detective
Agency that was responsible

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,320
for preventing the crash
of the whale airship.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,150
[MAN B]
That's impressive.

25
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,820
I believe the Armed
Detective Agency

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,410
will soon be carrying
the full weight

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,160
of this nation's
center of power.

28
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,920
[yelling]

29
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,130
[DOPPO] I told you,
stop attacking head-on.

30
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,300
Yeah, but--

31
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,180
[DOPPO] Don't let your
power control you.

32
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,680
It's whenever you start drowning
in the tiger's river of power

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
that you always seem
to lose the fight.

34
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,810
To put it quite bluntly,
the tiger is strong,

35
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,060
but you're weak.

36
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,520
[gasps]

37
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,860
[DOPPO]
It's time for work. Let's go.

38
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,530
[AKIKO]
A murder society?

39
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,070
Yes, this is an urgent
request from the government.

40
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,950
A photo of the first victim.

41
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,240
Terrible.

42
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,750
[DOPPO] The victim was
a young Diet member.

43
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,080
As you can see, he had the skin
of his upper body torn off.

44
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,000
And was forced to
wear it inside out.

45
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,290
The killer's got interesting
taste, doesn't he?

46
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,000
[DOPPO] There have been
four such incidents

47
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,680
in the past week
by the same culprit.

48
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,590
The vice commander
of the Coast Guard--

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,060
killed by a powerful corrosive
being poured on his head.

50
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,260
The Ministry of Defense's

51
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,310
External Defense Department
Chief Secretary

52
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,520
was injected with high-density
air using an air compressor,

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,610
leading to expulsion of
all blood from his pores.

54
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,940
Lastly, a top military envoy.

55
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,780
A pain-inducing plant
from South America

56
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,860
known as the suicide weed was
implanted in his armpit.

57
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,120
He was then locked in a room

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,570
where he slammed his own
head against the wall,

59
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,370
causing a deadly
cerebral contusion.

60
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,040
This must be the
Decay of Angels.

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a message
from the murderer.

62
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,830
The Decay of Angels?

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,630
[YUKICHI]
The Decay of Angels.

64
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,000
It refers to the five
signs that angels,

65
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,460
at the pinnacle of the
sixth path of existence,

66
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,130
exhibit before their death.

67
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,590
[DOPPO]
President.

68
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,180
[YUKICHI] The robe becomes
stained with grime and oils.

69
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,770
The crown wilts and rots.

70
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,600
The body becomes
dirty and odorous.

71
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,610
Sweat pours out of the armpits.

72
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,900
It's a serial murder making a
deliberate display of brutality.

73
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,400
Just a second, please.

74
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,120
There have only been
four murders so far.

75
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,120
Of the five omens,

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,540
dissatisfaction
and apathy remain.

77
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,660
Therefore, there's gonna
be one more murder.

78
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,040
Not true.

79
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,460
We are going to stop the
murder before it happens.

80
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,130
Each of us will commit
to putting an end

81
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,210
to this villain's twisted ploy.

82
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,090
I disagree.

83
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,050
[OTHERS]
Hm?

84
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,970
Why, Rampo? Care to explain?

85
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,930
My friend gave me
a warning about this.

86
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,760
[OGURI] The Detective Agency is
about to get a huge job offer!

87
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,930
Don't accept it!

88
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,890
If you do, it'll be the
end of the Agency!

89
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,980
[gunshots]

90
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,810
I think we should
turn this job down.

91
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,020
Have you seen the Futsuma
Shikyu Award in my office?

92
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,570
It's the honor of the century

93
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,030
for those of us
who protect people.

94
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,280
[RAMPO] You're telling
me to take the job

95
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,860
because we got a bow?

96
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,870
[YUKICHI]
No! Of course not.

97
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,700
That's nothing but
a piece of wood.

98
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,580
Awards and accolades add up to
little more than set dressing.

99
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,420
Even if we were honorless
thieves in a basement,

100
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,920
we would still risk our lives to
stop this attempted murder!

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,210
[RAMPO] Fine! Do what
you wanna do, then!

102
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Rampo, wait!

103
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,130
[YUKICHI]
Don't stop him, Kunikida.

104
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,640
The Agency will pursue
the murderer as planned.

105
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,060
And Rampo will pursue the facts

106
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,720
behind the Agency's
potential demise.

107
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,560
A dual investigation.

108
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,400
Rampo knows full well that's
the most optimal solution.

109
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,490
"Apathy and dissatisfaction are
part of the five death omens."

110
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,650
--Huh.
--[phone rings]

111
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,530
Yes?

112
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,410
[ANGO] This is Sakaguchi of the
Special Operations Division.

113
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,160
I've been unable
to contact Dazai.

114
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,000
Do you happen to know
his whereabouts?

115
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,330
[ATSUSHI]
No.

116
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,710
Then please convey a message
to the Agency staff.

117
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,380
It's in regard to the
serial murder victims.

118
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,050
There is evidence that the
victims' bodyguard rosters,

119
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,300
along with their itineraries,
were tampered with

120
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,470
and modified by certain
government figures.

121
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,680
Huh?

122
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,310
[ANGO] It may be that
the Decay of Angels

123
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,060
is the alternate identity
of a government body.

124
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,020
Please be careful.

125
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,190
[TONAN]
Hello, there.

126
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,780
Oh, you're from the
Department of Justice.

127
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,240
Thank you for your service.

128
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,740
You're a newcomer at the
Detective Agency, right?

129
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,870
How's the investigation
coming so far?

130
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,320
We're going through
all our files

131
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,790
of dangerous Gifted suspects,
but nothing yet.

132
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,660
Who were you on the
phone with just now?

133
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,500
[ATSUSHI]
Oh, that was--

134
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,710
[ANGO] There's evidence
they were tampered with

135
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,090
by certain government figures.

136
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,340
Hm?

137
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,880
[ATSUSHI]
Oh!

138
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,010
I was just asked to run a few
more errands. Never mind me.

139
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,180
What brings you to
this part of town, sir?

140
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,350
Actually, I just
happened to spot you

141
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,020
as I was enjoying
a cup of coffee.

142
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,480
My favorite coffee shop
is right over there.

143
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,610
[ATSUSHI] I can use my
tiger's sense of smell.

144
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,440
[ATSUSHI] I don't detect any
scent of coffee on him.

145
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,320
Something the matter?

146
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,030
No! Nothing at all!

147
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,700
But I have to be off now

148
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,870
to go feed the boss's pet
chameleon and stuff!

149
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,580
Pardon me!

150
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,160
[chuckles]

151
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,580
Very good.

152
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,290
The Armed Detective Agency
is doomed to destruction.

153
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,170
The decision has
already been made.

154
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,930
[JOUNO] Mind telling me
which horse came in first?

155
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,390
Huh?

156
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,560
[OSAMU]
I see. He's blind.

157
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,810
The number nine horse.

158
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,140
Thanks so much.

159
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,860
You picked the winner,
didn't you?

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,270
You mean you can
tell that I won?

161
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,730
Yes.

162
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,650
By your sweat, temperature,
the sound of your muscles.

163
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,570
I can see a whole lot
more than I used to

164
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,160
now that I've lost my sight.

165
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,120
The fact is, I can even predict
what tomorrow will bring you.

166
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,540
Because you're not gonna
have a tomorrow.

167
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,330
Former Port Mafia Executive,
Osamu Dazai.

168
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,920
One hundred and thirty-eight
counts of aggravated murder.

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,090
Three hundred and twelve
counts of intimidation.

170
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,010
A total of six hundred
and twenty-five charges,

171
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,680
including fraud, for
which I'm arresting you.

172
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,050
[TONAN] Gentlemen,
the Hunting Dogs have arrested

173
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,760
one of the members
of the Agency.

174
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,680
[AGENT A]
Ah!

175
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,010
[AGENT B]
It's about time.

176
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,230
[TONAN] Sheltering the
killer of 35 people,

177
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,270
known associations
with the Mafia.

178
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,360
A doctor suspected of murdering
one of her patients.

179
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,520
We'll expose those hypocrites
for these crimes

180
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,150
and dismantle the Detective
Agency once and for all.

181
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,860
It's what we've
been waiting for.

182
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,320
[door opens]

183
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,580
[SECRETARY]
Attorney Tonan, sir.

184
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,120
I've gathered the documents.

185
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,710
Orders sent to Fukuzawa to
assassinate pro-war individuals

186
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,170
at the end of the conflict.

187
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,170
[TONAN] The Armed Detective
Agency won't survive

188
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,500
the publication of
this information.

189
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,420
And the list of targets
for assassination?

190
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,340
Right here, sir.

191
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,060
[TONAN Father, I can finally
avenge you for what they did.

192
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,270
I must thank the people
who provided this to us.

193
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,900
Though I'm still unclear how
they managed to get their hands

194
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,030
on such highly
classified information.

195
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,650
I ought to meet with them
in person, don't you think?

196
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,320
[SECRETARY] I've already
arranged for the interview

197
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,490
to take place.

198
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,450
Oh? When is that?

199
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,750
Why, right now, sir.

200
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,040
Huh?

201
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,290
[TONAN screams]

202
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,000
Thank you for all
you've done for me

203
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,010
these past six months, sir.

204
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,170
Now then, quiz time!

205
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,470
Why did I keep you alive instead
of killing you just now, huh?

206
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,220
The answer is because you're
going to hate going back

207
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,390
to your own station
before you die!

208
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,730
[OSAMU]
You got me then.

209
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,610
I knew I was being tracked,

210
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,690
but I guess hiding in
a big crowd was no use

211
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,530
against the Hunting Dogs.

212
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,280
You going to take me out
along with all these people?

213
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,950
[JOUNO] It's so clear.
I can hear your rage.

214
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,910
Soon it'll turn into fear
of being punished

215
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,370
for all of your crimes.

216
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,790
I really can't wait for
that moment to happen.

217
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,330
[OSAMU] I can see we're
going to get along great.

218
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,130
Just tell me one thing, though.

219
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,210
What specifically made
you come arrest me now?

220
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,590
[JOUNO] Fingerprints,
recordings, photos.

221
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,180
All manner of evidence
seemed to suddenly reemerge

222
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,800
out of thin air.

223
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,390
As though a switch
had just been thrown.

224
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,150
[OGURI] It was about my special
ability from the beginning.

225
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,690
You wanted to reverse
a perfect murder

226
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,530
and restore guilt to
those who deserved it.

227
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,570
That's why you lured me in.

228
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
[NIKOLAI]
Hi! What's upsy-daisy?

229
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,870
So, Armed Detective Agency,

230
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,370
I'm going to give you four
pieces of information.

231
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,370
First piece!

232
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,460
I restrained government
bigwigs with fun machines.

233
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,550
It's the chainsaw human
disassembly show.

234
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,090
As soon as it's time,
he'll be cut in two!

235
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,760
Apathy and dissatisfaction.

236
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,260
[NIKOLAI]
Second!

237
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,760
If someone not a member of the
Detective Agency comes in,

238
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,270
the chainsaw will
activate automatically.

239
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,440
And third, the chainsaw will
activate at exactly 6 PM!

240
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,570
And finally, my fourth piece!

241
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,860
Damn it! I just realized
I don't have a fourth one!

242
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,950
What do I do now?
Hey, you, you got any ideas?

243
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,950
Crap, an on-air oopsie!
Stop the camera! I can't go on!

244
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,790
Thirty minutes till 6PM.

245
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,920
Yes, I understand.

246
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,420
Be careful.

247
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,170
Given he's demanding that an
Agency member enters first,

248
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,090
you'd be crazy not
to suspect a trap.

249
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,220
[DOPPO] Do you have any idea
what they're supposedly after?

250
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,550
[RAMPO]
I got this.

251
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm standing in front
of the clue now.

252
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,940
I smell blood.

253
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,570
[RAMPO]
Chief Taneda!

254
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,990
It's Fukuzawa's detective kid.

255
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,030
I know what the--

256
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,410
I know what the Decay
of Angels is after.

257
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,670
For all of us to arrive
there in time,

258
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,840
it'll take us at
least ten minutes.

259
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,970
You're to go in first
and stop the timer device.

260
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,430
[ATSUSHI] It might be dangerous
to charge in from the front.

261
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,390
Instead, I think
I'll have to use

262
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,100
the underground escape route.

263
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,360
[NIKOLAI]
You're even more nimble

264
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,400
than you're rumored
to be, tiger boy.

265
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,990
My name is Nikolai Gogol!

266
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,540
Okies, quiz time!
What is my special ability?

267
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,910
[ATSUSHI] His hand in the cape
shows up somewhere else!

268
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,420
You have a matter
teleportation ability!

269
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Bingo!

270
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,590
My special ability lets
me connect my cape

271
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,380
with a point somewhere
else in space.

272
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,880
I have a range of roughly
30 meters or so.

273
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,680
[ATSUSHI] So even if I hide,
he'll still shoot me.

274
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,060
Fine!

275
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,600
Oh, dear!

276
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,180
Huh?

277
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,850
Tiger fangs?

278
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,440
You're mine!

279
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,990
I went and dropped a utility
pole from the surface.

280
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,530
[TANEDA]
Decay of Angels

281
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,370
is a criminal organization
comprised of five people.

282
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,330
Jester Nikolai. Demon Fyodor.

283
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,790
And three more special rank,

284
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,170
very dangerous
Gifted individuals.

285
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,050
We'll wipe out the Gifted
rotting this country's values.

286
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,420
Starting with you,
if you don't get smart fast!

287
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,090
Okay, now I see.

288
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,800
V is an organization of Gifted
individuals brought together

289
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,810
to drive out other
Gifted individuals.

290
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,350
[RAMPO]
V as in five.

291
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,310
The five death
omens of an angel.

292
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,020
[TANEDA] And one of them
has the special ability

293
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,230
to exchange information
that the others want.

294
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,650
That's the one who wounded me.

295
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,700
So...

296
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,570
[TANEDA]
They stole information.

297
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,330
From inside here.

298
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,660
But on the plus side,

299
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,790
when they were in my head,
I learned their goal.

300
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,960
Good. I'll contact the Agency.
You need to see a doctor, fast.

301
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,170
[TANEDA]
Wait!

302
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,920
They're attempting
to use my memories

303
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,630
in order to steal
a page from a book.

304
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,130
What page?

305
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,720
[TANEDA]
From a blank novel

306
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,930
that makes anything written
in it become reality.

307
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,640
It's a page from that book,
torn out to use for research.

308
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,600
[ATSUSHI] His special ability
is strong. Very strong.

309
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,270
Well, it's just about
that time for me

310
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,190
to go ahead and restrain you.

311
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,690
[yells]

312
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,660
[ATSUSHI] It's not just
powerful in combat.

313
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,280
This ability could be used
for raids, burglary,

314
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,700
eavesdropping, abduction--
he could do anything.

315
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,250
He's the one who killed
the government officials.

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,080
[laughs]

317
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,670
[ATSUSHI]
Why?

318
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,710
Why do you kill people?

319
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,510
And why do you kill
them so horribly?

320
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,930
The four that I killed
asked me the same question

321
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,180
before they died.

322
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,720
And I have two answers.
First, because it's fun!

323
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,980
It's so damn fun and
it gets me so excited!

324
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,020
Sounds like a plausible
answer if you ask me;

325
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,900
doesn't that sound fun to you?

326
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,070
Just think about it
for a moment.

327
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,950
You're killed by a monster
without a speck of humanity.

328
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,650
Unfair, but easy to understand.

329
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,030
You can die with
a sense of closure.

330
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,030
But you aren't going to
be some monster's victim

331
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,370
when I murder you.

332
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,910
So I'll tell you the second
and real reason why.

333
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,790
Sorry to fool you,
but I'm perfectly sane.

334
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,250
I understand how evil
killing truly is,

335
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,970
and I feel as much
guilt as anyone.

336
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,260
Do you happen to like birds?

337
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,140
I love little birdies.

338
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,730
They fly, unbound whatsoever
by gravity with total freedom.

339
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,270
That's the feeling
that I wish for.

340
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,310
That's why I joined
the Decay of Angels.

341
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,110
[TANEDA]
That empty page that was stolen

342
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,110
by the Decay of Angels,

343
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,820
it has the same special power
as the entire book itself.

344
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,240
But I know that there's
a rule to using the book.

345
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,490
What's written in the book
in any of its pages

346
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,710
must have the causal consistency
of an actual novel.

347
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,790
For some reason,

348
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,540
a narrative-like
logical consistency

349
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,340
is required to
overwrite reality.

350
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,880
Someone who had such an ability

351
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,720
must have been the
one who created it.

352
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,590
Though I suppose
it's a good rule

353
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,140
since you can't just write,

354
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,980
"One day, humanity was doomed,"
and expect it to come true.

355
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,440
Chief Taneda!

356
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,600
[TANEDA]
Abandon the mission and run!

357

Their intentions are
to use the Agency

358
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,190
as the ultimate
catalyst for doom.

359

[ATSUSHI]
The freedom of a bird?

360
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240

you're killing for?

00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,950
I don't understand you at all!

[NIKOLAI]
I'm sure you don't.

And it's quiz time again!

365
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:25,130
At what point did I start lying
in what I just told you?

366
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,630
[NIKOLAI laughs]

367
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,170
Did I fool you?

Don't you know you should
never lend your ear to a jester?

You'll have trouble
getting to sleep at night.

you your leg back.
