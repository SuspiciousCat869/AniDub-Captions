1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,260
[POLICEMAN] This is Kanagawa
Traffic Police Unit 205.

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,270
Arrest made at scene.
Middle-aged male.

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,640
Requesting identity check.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,230
[RAMPO] Hey, officer,
are we there yet?

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,940
Very soon, sir.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,110
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,530
[MITAMURA]
That was impressive back there.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,450
I've never met such a great
little detective before.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,160
You and the bodyguard would make
an excellent detective duo

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,490
if you decided to
team up for good.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,040
Don't you think so?

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,450
I don't think that guy has any
interest in working with me.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,870
[MITAMURA]
Oh. Why would you say that?

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,840
If you ask me, that bodyguard
is afraid of strangers.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,090
[MITAMURA]
You've only just met him

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,550
and yet you seem to know
him so well already.

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,670
I guess you truly are Gifted.

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,010
From what I understand,

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,800
you have the ability to
see the truth, don't you?

20
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,470
You may say that,

21
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,640
but you don't actually
believe any of it.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,980
I mean, you really gave
yourself away just now

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,360
when you said I'd only
recently met him.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,730
That told me that
you had checked in

25
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,190
with your headquarters about me

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,400
and they'd informed you
that I only met Fukuzawa

27
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,950
after the president's
assassination.

28
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,330
And now you're testing my
abilities to see the truth.

29
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,660
Very impressive, indeed.

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,460
Shucks. I underestimated you.

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,290
I hate that you still doubt
that I'm a great detective.

32
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,380
Would you like me to prove it
to you that I'm actually Gifted?

33
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,250
[MITAMURA]
It would be quite an honor!

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,920
To get a front-row seat to
a Gifted detective at work

35
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,550
is a rare privilege.

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,890
All right, then.

37
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,140
This car isn't headed to
the police station, is it?

38
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,520
I'm sorry, I guess I
should've told you sooner.

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,060
I won't make that mistake again.

40
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,310
I received a dispatch
just before we left.

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,860
There's been an incident.

42
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,860
Headquarters wants me to
take the expert detective

43
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,230
to the scene right away.

44
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,780
Oh, I see.

45
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,070
But I don't think you needed
to use your special abilities

46
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,450
to figure out which way
we're driving, did you?

47
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,830
The police station's back there
near the train station.

48
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,120
Doesn't take much to realize
we're going the wrong way.

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,710
[RAMPO]
Let's do something else.

50
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,120
You can test me out again.

51
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,130
Ask me anything about
the last incident.

52
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,500
If I can't answer your questions
to your satisfaction,

53
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,670
then you win.

54
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,510
If you run out of
questions, then I win.

55
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,550
How's that?

56
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,470
Makes sense to me.

57
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,090
Okay, my first question is one

58
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,220
that I'm sure is
on everyone's mind.

59
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,560
You know the
gentleman in the suit

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,140
who was tied up and
arrested on stage?

61
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,020
How do you think he was
taken from his seat,

62
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,310
tied up, and placed
on the stage?

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
The answer to the
question is a rug.

64
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,730
[MITAMURA]
A rug?

65
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,240
That's right.

66
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,240
Remember the rugs that covered
the theater's lobby floor?

67
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,410
One of them went missing

68
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,950
as soon as the audience
started to panic.

69
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,580
Also, in the empty spot where
the rug was supposed to be,

70
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,750
I detected a faint odor
I couldn't quite place.

71
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,540
It was something like that
weird-smelling stuff they use

72
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,340
to make paint and plastics
and things like that.

73
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,500
[MITAMURA]
Organic solvent?

74
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,300
[RAMPO]
Yeah, that's it!

75
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,840
I caught a whiff
of the same smell

76
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,090
when I discovered the
gentleman in the suit.

77
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,840
Which means the attacker must
have wrapped him up in the rug

78
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,180
and taken him to the stage

79
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,560
while the police interviewed
people in the lobby.

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,390
The attacker used the organic
solvent to knock him out first

81
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,440
before wrapping the
man up in the rug.

82
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,730
[MITAMURA] There was certainly
a lot of commotion at the scene,

83
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,650
with the actors,
the audience, and the police.

84
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,360
A man in work clothes moving
a rug around the theater,

85
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,870
I guess it might not have drawn
that much attention from anyone.

86
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,780
Still, I suppose we're certain
the attacker was the playwright,

87
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,200
acting as the leading
man's accomplice?

88
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,580
[RAMPO]
It wasn't the playwright.

89
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,460
I think he was probably
murdered by someone

90
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,130
who didn't want him
talking to the police

91
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,590
before the performance
even began tonight.

92
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,630
Everyone else in this
world, besides me,

93
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,300
is thoroughly stupid, but
still worthy of compassion,

94
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,130
so I wish that I could have
saved the playwright,

95
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,840
but there wasn't much
I could do for someone

96
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,140
who was dead long before I ever
knew anything about the case.

97
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,560
But what still bothers me is,

98
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,770
why would they do all that
just to abduct one person

99
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,230
out of the whole audience?

100
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,310
You think that it
was an abduction?

101
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,020
[RAMPO] There's no other
way to describe it.

102
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,070
The whole project was
just an elaborate set up

103
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,490
to specifically abduct
the gentleman in the suit.

104
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,660
He was the attacker's only
target the entire time.

105
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,780
The playwright and the
leading man, Murakami,

106
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,330
were just pawns for the attacker
to use as a distraction.

107
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,500
Well? Did I prove to you

108
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,210
that I'm the world's most
Gifted detective, or what?

109
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,550
So come on, give.
I answered your questions,

110
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,840
so why don't you tell me where
this car is really going,

111
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,100
Mister So-Called Police Officer
who reeks of organic solvent?

112
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,440
[YUKICHI] Why can't you
get in touch with them?

113
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,900
We still don't have
any confirmation

114
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,690
that they arrived
at the station yet.

115
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,030
Nor can we connect to the
police radio in the vehicle.

116
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,700
[YUKICHI]
The playwright was murdered.

117
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,630
[YUKICHI] Judging from what
Rampo told Joshi Egawa,

118
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,460
this case isn't over yet.

119
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,430
The fact is, this crime involves
two completely different acts.

120
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,760
You could think of it like
a sea bream and a shrimp.

121
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,300
[YUKICHI] The real perpetrator's
still on the loose.

122
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,970
You could be satisfied
with the shrimp,

123
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,230
which is much easier to
catch than the sea bream.

124
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,060
[YUKICHI] He must be talking
about the actor, Murakami.

125
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,650
But if you decide you want
to catch the sea bream,

126
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,480
well then, you're going
to have to use the shrimp

127
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,400
you caught as bait.

128
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,990
[YUKICHI] So the true
perpetrator is plotting

129
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,700
an even larger crime.

130
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,070
Using the actor, Murakami,
and the playwright, Kurahashi.

131
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,410
Rampo is intent on
exposing that perpetrator.

132
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,790
[YUKICHI]
What was the name of the officer

133
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,460
who went to the
station with Rampo?

134
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,460
[DETECTIVE]
Senior Officer Mitamura.

135
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,420
We tried calling him. His
phone's been switched off.

136
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,630
[YUKICHI] What in the world
has happened to Rampo?

137
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,270
[YUKICHI]
Where could he have taken him?

138
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,980
[YUKICHI sighs]

139
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,230
[YUKICHI]
Hmm?

140
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,200
[YUKICHI]
My card?

141
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,330
[RAMPO] I will see you later
for sure! Yes, yes, yes!

142
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,670
[RAMPO laughing]

143
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,840
That must be when he put...

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,170
[gasps]

145
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,720
[MITAMURA] Unbelievable.
Truly unbelievable!

146
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,430
To think that we didn't have
a single bit of information

147
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,010
on such an exceptional
Gifted on our research list.

148
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,310
Officially, this place is an
office for a shipbuilding firm.

149
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,360
But in reality, it's what people
refer to as a shell company.

150
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,240
[MITAMURA]
Anyway, have a seat.

151
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,780
[RAMPO]
A gun, huh?

152
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,200
[MITAMURA] Oh. Don't worry,
I have no intention of using it.

153
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,450
As long as you behave
and do as I say.

154
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,550
[YUKICHI]
Hm?

155
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,680
Is that the man's cane?

156
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,770
Could be a concealed weapon.

157
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,610
[YUKICHI]
Hmm...

158
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,530
[YUKICHI]
Damn.

159
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,160
That was some gentleman.

160
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,130
[OCHI]
Have you changed your mind?

161
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,920
No, but I do have a request.

162
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,890
[RAMPO]
Well?

163
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,010
Where are we exactly?

164
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
I already told you.

165
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,640
This is one of our outposts--
it's a convenient place to chat.

166
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,190
"Our" outposts?

167
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,940
[MITAMURA] I don't mean the
municipal police, of course.

168
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,360
[RAMPO] There are four
career soldiers with guns

169
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,700
standing guard outside.

170
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,200
No. There are five guards.

171
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,620
[MITAMURA] Magnificent!
How did you know that?

172
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,460
[RAMPO] Because that's
my special ability.

173
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,250
[MITAMURA] Listen,
those men don't have

174
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,460
the slightest intention
of harming you.

175
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,590
I didn't even bring
them here to guard you,

176
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,510
to be perfectly honest.

177
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,170
Those men were assigned
to keep an eye

178
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,220
on my original target.

179
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,600
The gentleman with the cane

180
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,310
who you managed
to reveal on stage.

181
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,060
[RAMPO] And the gentleman
who managed to get away.

182
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,650
So then, why did
you bring me here?

183
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,020
[MITAMURA]
I'm sure you'll agree

184
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,570
that the plot at the theater
was pretty elaborate.

185
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,820
The brass is furious that their
deep investment has been ruined.

186
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,780
They're insisting
I catch the guy

187
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,660
who messed up all
their careful plans.

188
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,910
Make him tell me how he
saw through the scheme

189
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,410
and explain where he got
his information from.

190
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,170
Otherwise, we'll be forced to
follow our orders to hurt you,

191
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,250
even though I disagree
with that kind of decision.

192
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,590
You wouldn't want that
either, would you?

193
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,550
So I have a proposal for you,

194
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,720
Mister World's Greatest
Gifted Detective.

195
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,560
How would you like to work
with us instead of against us?

196
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,730
We have a vision
for our country.

197
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,310
A plan to rid this nation of
evil people once and for all.

198
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,270
An excellent Gifted
such as yourself

199
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,030
would be more than
welcome to join us.

200
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,820
What do you think?

201
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,780
[RAMPO]
Oh, sorry.

202
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,330
You were rambling for
so long I tuned out.

203
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,000
I guess I stopped listening.

204
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,210
[YUKICHI]
How do you like your jail cell?

205
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,880
[SAKUNOSUKE] Not bad.
There's air conditioning.

206
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,890
I told them I was bored, so they
gave me this book to read.

207
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,010
I guess it's their way
of telling me to repent.

208
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,980
[YUKICHI]
I'm here with a question.

209
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,980
Would you mind looking at this?

210
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,980
This is a memory device employed
by a certain government agency.

211
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,320
A device used by those in the
witness protection program.

212
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,490
It allows participants to
communicate with their agents.

213
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,450
Only high-priority people
targeted by crime organizations

214
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,950
would have one.

215
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,620
They would also have one
other thing in common:

216
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,920
They're all Gifted.

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,290
I'm sure someone
as capable as you

218
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,250
would've taken on external
clients from time to time.

219
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,430
Have you accepted any requests
to capture a Gifted recently?

220
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,850
You know well that I can't
talk about my clients.

221
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,810
[YUKICHI] Then let's forget
I used that word.

222
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,470
Have you heard
anything recently?

223
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,350
Perhaps you may have come
across some talk about

224
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,690
a contract regarding a Gifted
being captured alive.

225
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,730
The request may have been made
by someone who calls themself V.

226
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,320
[SAKUNOSUKE] I really don't
want to talk about them.

227
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,990
Do you know why
they're doing it?

228
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,200
No.

229
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,580
For their cause.

230
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,460
Killing for money or
killing out of spite,

231
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,000
those reasons make sense to me.

232
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,840
But to them, the killing
itself is their great cause.

233
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,130
I don't wanna get
involved with those types.

234
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,890
If you're killing
people for a cause,

235
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,850
it doesn't matter who you kill,

236
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,020
only the act itself
is important.

237
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,310
The kill is the ultimate
achievement.

238
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,770
[YUKICHI gasps]

239
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,000
[YUKICHI] I'm not asking you
or ordering you to fight them.

240
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,660
But they abducted an
acquaintance of mine.

241
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,000
Do you know where they
might be holding him?

242
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,540
I don't have any
reason to tell you.

243
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,130
[YUKICHI]
You're absolutely right.

244
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,630
if you do tell me,
I'll testify in open court

245
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,800
that you fired the
gun in self-defense.

246
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,550
And that you killed
him by accident.

247
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,390
That the secretary was the
one who attacked you first.

248
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,770
[OCHI]
Huh?

249
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,690
[YUKICHI] They'll let you
out of jail immediately.

250
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,410
[SAKUNOSUKE] I'm surprised.
You don't look the type.

251
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,530
You don't fit the description
of the kind of person

252
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,700
who would readily sell out on
the justice system like that.

253
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,040
[YUKICHI]
I didn't think I was, either.

254
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,380
[SAKUNOSUKE]
Let me tell you something.

255
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,630
As a hired killer,

256
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,710
I always thought it was
best to work on my own.

257
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,170
I've never wanted any
coworkers or superiors.

258
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,680
But if a skilled martial
artist such as yourself

259
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,180
would go against your principles
just to save your subordinate,

260
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,930
he's lucky to have you as
a superior and coworker.

261
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,850
I actually envy him a little.

262
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,940
[YUKICHI]
No. He isn't a subordinate.

263
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,860
[SAKUNOSUKE] I've heard rumors
about several buildings

264
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,490
they like to use for
their transactions.

265
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,990
Do we have
an agreement or not?

266
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,330
I could escape out of here
at any point if I wanted to.

267
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,120
The reward you're promising
isn't quite worth it to me.

268
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,750
However, the food at this
facility is god-awful.

269
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,630
If you happen to have
any sway around here

270
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,750
with the kitchen staff,

271
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,460
would you mind talking
to them for me?

272
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,010
Have any special requests?

273
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,430
[SAKUNOSUKE]
Curry rice.

274
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,890
[MITAMURA]
Listen up, great detective.

275
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,230
Our organization is
formidable and flawless.

276
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,980
It would be far more
rewarding to join us

277
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,530
than to team up with that dumb
bodyguard boss of yours.

278
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,610
[RAMPO]
Moo.

279
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,070
[MITAMURA]
Hm?

280
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,990
[RAMPO] Look, pal, I have
a hard time paying attention

281
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,950
to things I have
no interest in.

282
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,870
It just sounds to me like
cattle mooing all the time.

283
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,250
Moo! Moo! See?

284
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,750
[MITAMURA]
You're extremely fortunate

285
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,380
that I'm the one you're
negotiating with.

286
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,760
Anyone else might've
started sawing you apart

287
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,220
from your toenails up
to your eyebrows by now.

288
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,850
[RAMPO]
He's mooing again. Moo! Moo!

289
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,390
[MITAMURA] Looks like
we'll have to use this

290
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,480
to move the
conversation forward.

291
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,020
You can use your gift to see
through the truth, big deal.

292
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,320
You're still too feeble
to stop a single bulle

293
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,070
from going through you.

294
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,780
I only gave you my precious time

295
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,820
for the sake of our
organization's grand objective.

296
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,700
We'll wipe out the Gifted
rotting this country's values.

297
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,080
Starting with you,
if you don't get smart fast.

298
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,750
Okay, now I see.

299
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,460
V is an organization of Gifted
individuals brought together

300
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,290
to drive out other
Gifted individuals.

301
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,510
Wait! Give a guy a
second, would ya?

302
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,090
By my calculations...

303
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,090
...you have three seconds.

[YUKICHI] I took out one
of the guards outside.

310
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,030
Just how many more are there?

311
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,650
Four more!

312
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,170
That leaves one more guard.

313
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,980
Freaks!

314
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,700
[YUKICHI]
Are you all right?

315
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,490
[RAMPO]
Yeah, sure!

316
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,540
Wow, that went better
than I expected.

317
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,750
You arrived just
in time, just as I--

318
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Screw you!

319
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,810
To hell with your
damn calculations!

320
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,480
When I got here, there was a gun
pointed right at your face!

321
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,940
That happened only because
I knew you'd save me!

322
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,980
[YUKICHI] Showing off
your abilities is fine.

323
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,280
Using your intellect against
powerful enemies is good.

324
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,450
But I want you to stop
wagering your own life

325
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,870
on your stupid risky gambles!

326
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,250
You're still just a child.
With a lot more to learn.

327
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,720
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,140
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

329
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

330
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,940
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

331
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,650
[sighs]

332
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,160
[YUKICHI] Looks like Officer
Mitamura was murdered

333
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,830
while in custody.

334
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,750
It seems he's been silenced.

335
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,050
So I guess the plot continues
for this complicated crime.

336
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,590
But who is the perpetrator
of the last incident?

337
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,890
I mean, V has to be
behind this, right?

338
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,060
[FYODOR chuckles]

339
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,770
Except it's not "V." It is five.
Remember your Roman numerals.

340
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,900
[RAMPO]
Oh.

341
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,030
[YUKICHI]
Hmm?

342
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,360
[YUKICHI]
What is it?

343
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,780
Oh... I was just thinking
about the cityscape.

344
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,410
How it looks different
than it did yesterday.

345
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,120
Do you think so, too?

346
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,910
It's because you
understand now.

347
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,250
[RAMPO]
Hm?

348
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,420
You mean I understand now
about how I'm Gifted?

349
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,800
No, not that.

350
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,470
You understand what's
important, right?

351
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,260
[chuckles]

352
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,180
[SAKUNOSUKE]
Curry.

353
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,690
[SAKUNOSUKE]
Spicy! But so good.

354
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,160
[YUKICHI]
Is this it?

355
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,750
[RAMPO]
Should be.

356
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,600
[NATSUME]
Welcome to Bankoudou.

357
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,060
Oh.

358
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,310
Why, there's my cane.
I thought I'd lost it.

359
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,310
[YUKICHI]
I happened to hear about you,

360
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,190
so I decided to take the
liberty of coming here

361
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,030
for us to discuss a
proposal in person.

362
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,320
[NATSUME]
Don't be so formal about it.

363
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,740
Please, have a seat.

364
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,320
[YUKICHI]
Thank you.

365
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,990
[RAMPO]
No way.

366
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,410
I didn't notice at the time,
but this man really--

367
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,210
[NATSUME] It seems that
I owe you one, boy.

368
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,540
[RAMPO]
Right.

369
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,460
You saw through their trap
from the very beginning,

370
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,010
before the play started.

371
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,970
But even still, you decided to
let them capture you anyway.

372
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,720
You flushed out the enemy

373
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,770
so that we would catch them
instead of the municipal police.

374
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,640
Though the sea bream
seems to have gotten away.

375
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,400
I have come here with
a request for you, sir.

376
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,900
As I'm sure you're aware,

377
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,690
Rampo Edogawa here is building
a reputation for himself

378
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,650
as a Gifted detective.

379
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,030
But it's taboo.

380
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,820
A Gifted is forbidden to
promote themselves publicly,

381
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,660
which Rampo's already done.

382
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,290
That's why I came here
to ask you for your help.

383
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,250
You want to acquire a
Gifted Business Permit.

384
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,340
So you intend to start your own
agency with him by your side.

385
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,840
Yes.

386
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,840
In order for me to obtain
a special permit of this kind

387
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,170
from the Gifted
Operations Division,

388
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,970
I require your vast knowledge
in that area, Master Natsume.

389
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,440
It will not be
an easy path for you.

390
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,980
But still, I think you can
make it happen if you try.

391
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,440
If anyone can,
it will be you two.
