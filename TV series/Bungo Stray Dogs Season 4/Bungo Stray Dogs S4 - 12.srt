[MICHIZOU gasps]

2
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,940
I'd better take
this off for today.

3
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,780
[TERUKO crying]

4
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,570
Huh? Hmm?

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,160
You idiot! What are you
looking at? I'll kill you!

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,290
[JOUNO] Hello, Tachihara.
Nice seeing you here.

7
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,670
It turns out Teruko managed to
get Gilette to finally confess.

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,210
What? Jack Gilette of the
Seventeen Worldly Evils?

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,960
I thought he'd never break!

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,510
Me, too.

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,300
I thought he would be a chew toy
that would never fall apart,

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,840
but he finally broke.

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,100
And it only took about
half a year to do it!

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,720
[MICHIZOU]
I sympathize.

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,350
[MICHIZOU]
Sympathize with Gilette.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,350
[JOUNO]
Anyway, Tachihara.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,770
Thank you for all your hard work
on the infiltration mission.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,230
And now I have a new
assignment for you.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,980
Deal with that problem.

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,910
Carry me! On piggyback!

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,160
[TERUKO laughs]

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,830
I'll start by summarizing
my investigation.

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,620
Following the hostage
crisis four days ago,

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,160
we've determined that the
infamous Decay of Angels

25
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,290
was, in fact, the Armed
Detective Agency.

26
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,420
[TETCHOU]
Really?

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,000
What are their goals? Any intel?

28
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,340
[MICHIZOU] Their last sighting
was at the bank break-in,

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,220
and that was two days ago.

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,810
[TETCHOU] To think they'd
raid a bank. Despicable.

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,020
[JOUNO] No training in
the middle of a meeting!

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,140
[TETCHOU]
You're a perfect weight.

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,350
[MICHIZOU]
Why do you think we haven't had

34
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
any further sightings?

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,940
[TERUKO] They must've already
gotten what they wanted.

36
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,780
And we all know what
a criminal on the run

37
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,650
would want more than
anything, right?

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,870
A base and a command post.

39
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,280
The main objective of
our mission is to prevent

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,290
any terrorist attacks
prior to the other side

41
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,290
of the page being filled in,
as well as recovering said page.

42
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,750
But as wanted criminals, the
Agency can't act in plain sight.

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,710
That's where her special
ability comes in.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,130
[chuckles]

45
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,800
[ANGO] Lucy will place the
two of you in Anne's Room,

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,140
which you will be
able to infiltrate

47
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,640
completely undetected.

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,560
Therefore, Lucy
will be considered

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,060
the heart of our operation.

50
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,850
Well, you heard him,
didn't you?

51
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,390
Right, tiger kitty?

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,100
I believe this ear is
saying that it wants you

53
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,940
to say thank you.

54
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,980
[ATSUSHI]
Sorry.

55
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,150
Hm? Why are you apologizing?

56
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,240
For getting you
mixed up in this.

57
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,530
Cooperating with us right now
is the crime of aiding

58
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,780
and abetting fugitives.

59
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,660
I don't think we can ever
repay you enough for your help.

60
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,000
Why not?

61
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,040
If I'm not mistaken,
I think I'm the one repaying

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,130
an impossibly huge debt
right now, aren't I?

63
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,040
[ATSUSHI, LUCY]
Huh?

64
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,010
[LUCY] Nothing, nothing, never
mind, forget I said anything.

65
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,430
I'm begging you to forget
this whole thing!

66
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,300
It's time to go.

67
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,180
[clears throat]

68
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,560
Well, it's time to go.

69
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,950
Take me to the airport
bus stop, please.

70
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,450
[BOTH gasp]

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,670
[OCHI] Don't let anyone
in until I say so.

72
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,290
[GUARD A, GUARD B]
Sir!

73
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,800
[OCHI] I trust that you
are ready, Fukuzawa.

74
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,680
[YUKICHI]
Yes.

75
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,680
[laughs]

76
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,060
Why would our reunion be

77
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,060
anything other than a drinking
contest between us?

78
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,440
You haven't changed
at all, Genichiro.

79
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,650
[OCHI]
What?

80
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,570
How is it you still
haven't gotten married?

81
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,360
[YUKICHI]
I've been busy with work.

82
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,700
[OCHI]
You stuck-up loner.

83
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,950
Heh. I never would've thought
you'd be the Agency president.

84
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,590
[OCHI] But now that you are,
you have responsibilities.

85
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,010
Make your men surrender
to the police.

86
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,210
That way, the case will fall

87
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,010
under the jurisdiction
of the prosecution,

88
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,010
and they will no longer be
targeted by the Hunting Dogs.

89
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Because the Hunting
Dogs will never relent,

90
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,310
or stop trying to
tear you apart.

91
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,270
I appreciate the concern,
but not the advice.

92
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,100
[OCHI sighs]

93
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,230
Well, I suppose I might enjoy
duking it out with you again

94
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,360
just like the old times.

95
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,240
What's making you stop?

96
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,120
[OCHI]
You aren't fooling me, Fukuzawa.

97
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,620
You were going to make me
cut off your handcuffs.

98
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,550
And then you'd swipe my
own sword away from me.

99
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,500
[YUKICHI]
You got me.

100
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,220
[OCHI]
Fukuzawa, let's make a deal.

101
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,050
I assume that you want
to know what happened

102
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,890
to your Kunikida, don't you?

103
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,970
He fell out of a helicopter
and blew himself up.

104
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,060
But I happen to
know where he went.

105
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,860
[YUKICHI]
Don't bother.

106
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,570
I know Kunikida is alive.

107
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,190
If he were actually dead,

108
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,410
I would've sensed it the very
moment that it happened.

109
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,790
[OCHI]
Hm.

110
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,370
Well then, shit.

111
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,960
The lone wolf sure has
changed over the years.

112
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,670
[JOUNO] There's no way you
could possibly be the greatest.

113
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,380
Welcome to the cafe.

114
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,800
[JOUNO]
At the end of the day,

115
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,590
your strength is the kind
that screams to the world,

116
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,890
"Hey everyone, look at me, I can
beat up a ton of wild boars."

117
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,970
But the Hunting Dogs' job

118
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,260
is about investigating
and arresting.

119
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,140
So what?

120
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,390
So based on that criteria,

121
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,640
I am the greatest
Hunting Dog there is.

122
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,940
Seriously?

123
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,770
[TETCHOU chuckles]

124
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,440
I want to kill you so badly!

125
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,770
What can I get you two?

126
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,730
Caffe latte.

127
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,240
Soy sauce latte.

128
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,860
Very good, gentlemen.
Soy sauce?

129
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,070
Just give him the
same thing as me.

130
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,660
Let's you and I make a bet.

131
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,490
Whichever of us finds
the Detective Agency's

132
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,500
whereabouts first wins.

133
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,250
Okay, you're on.

134
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,380
So are you two with
the police department?

135
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,500
[JOUNO] Yes. We're
investigating a case right now.

136
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,260
Oh, speaking of which,

137
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,630
the heinous terrorist
organization,

138
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,390
the Armed Detective Agency,

139
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,100
had offices right above
this cafe, did it not?

140
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,730
[OWNER] Yes. I saw them here
on occasion now and then.

141
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,190
It's all so terrifying.

142
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,190
Here you go.

143
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,940
[JOUNO] This woman's a
waitress here, isn't she?

144
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,700
[OWNER] Yes. Today happens
to be her day off.

145
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,990
Do you need something from her?

146
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,660
[JOUNO]
According to our information,

147
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,540
she's very close with
the Detective Agency.

148
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,460
We have reason to suspect
she's aiding their escape.

149
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,880
They wouldn't get very far

150
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
depending on a lowly
waitress for their chance

151
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,090
at getting away from the police.

152
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,670
Fantastic.

153
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,090
I have true admiration for
people who can make good coffee.

154
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,630
I almost want you to come work

155
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,800
at the commercial
facility I own.

156
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,850
Sadly though, there's
only one problem.

157
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,480
At my place, I don't like to
hire dirty stinking liars.

158
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,900
Me?

159
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,560
[JOUNO] I can tell from the
sound of your breathing.

160
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,860
You just told me that the
Detective Agency

161
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,780
wouldn't get far depending
on a lowly waitress.

162
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,740
But that was a lie, wasn't it?

163
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,660
You know all about her
special ability, don't you?

164
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,660
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

165
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,870
I understand you buy

166
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,540
half a year's worth of
coffee beans at a time.

167
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,790
Despite you doing that,

168
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,710
this coffee still has
such a nice fresh aroma.

169
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,300
How is that?

170
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,130
It's because you stock your
inventory in her room,

171
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,130
where time can be slowed in
a special ability space.

172
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,760
That way you can keep
a large quantity

173
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,390
of beans fresh all the time.

174
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,100
Hmmm? Would you
like me to continue?

175
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,690
You also told me that
today just happens to be

176
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,650
Lucy's day off from work.

177
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,190
That's also a lie.

178
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,570
In fact, she's taken
an indefinite break.

179
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,740
She doesn't know if she
can come back at all.

180
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,160
Yet you still let her ignore
her job, because you understood

181
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,120
that she's the only one who
can save the Detective Agency.

182
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,540
Now, here's the problem.

183
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,170
You are now an accessory
to an act of terrorism.

184
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,500
If you still refuse to
give up her location,

185
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,260
I'll make sure that you'll never
be able to make coffee again.

186
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,430
[JOUNO yelps]

187
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,220
Why did you stab my foot?!

188
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,260
[TETCHOU] You have a bad
habit of tormenting people

189
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,390
and taking pleasure in
seeing them squirm.

190
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,980
[JOUNO]
Hmph!

191
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,600
[TETCHOU]
Boss.

192
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,230
Is it wrong to want
to repay someone

193
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,070
you're dearly indebted to?

194
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,490
I promise you,

195
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,990
if you tell us where Lucy
is at this very moment,

196
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,990
she will not be questioned
for any crimes.

197
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,410
We have the authority
to make that so.

198
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,710
And a world in which a girl's
honest intentions are rewarded

199
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,880
is one that we ought to protect.

200
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,840
My problem is that Lucy
isn't the only one

201
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm trying to protect right now.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,550
The Detective Agency?

203
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,840
All I can promise you is that
they'll be given a fair trial

204
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,970
under the laws of the land.

205
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,390
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

206
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,350
I just knew that this
was going to happen.

207
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,850
[TETCHOU]
I promise on my sword

208
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,440
that if my promise is broken,
I will cut open my gut.

209
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,480
Please.

210
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,530
[OWNER]
Lucy told me something.

211
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,030
She said she wouldn't regret

212
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,780
ruining the remainder
of her life.

213
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,330
But what I'm asking you to do
is please save her future.

214
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,380
This I promise.

215
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,090
She went to the Sky Casino.
That's where she'll be.

216
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,300
[TERUKO] What a ridiculous
construction this is.

217
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,630
[MICHIZOU]
Most people believe

218
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,760
the civilian entertainment
facility's just a front,

219
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,810
and that it was really built
by the winners of the war

220
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,970
for surveillance
and intimidation.

221
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,310
[TERUKO]
It would be both a physical

222
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,350
and political catastrophe
if this place

223
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,820
were to be attacked
by terrorists or something?

224
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,030
[EMPLOYEE A]
Sir, we have a problem.

225
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,330
[SIGMA]
Terrorists?

226
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,910
[TERUKO]
That's right.

227
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,290
We have reason to believe there
are terrorists in this facility.

228
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,620
[TERUKO]
And we have proof.

229
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,330
What kind of proof?

230
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,630
Sir, look here.

231
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,050
[TERUKO] That woman is
one of the terrorists.

232
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,800
She used her pocket
dimension ability

233
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,760
to bring them all in here.

234
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,760
Then send a search team
to scour the casino.

235
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,220
It's no use.

236
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,810
She can hide with them
in the pocket dimension.

237
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,600
[SIGMA]
What do we do, then?

238
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,180
[TERUKO]
We close the casino.

239
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,100
Unacceptable.

240
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,480
What did you just say?

241
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,230
Bastard! Do you have any
idea how serious this is?

242
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,990
What a silly thing
of you to ask.

243
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,820
[SIGMA] You're surrounded
by directed resonance guns.

244
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,580
They were made specifically
to combat Gifted.

245
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,370
The sound waves
affect the brain,

246
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,870
causing loss of consciousness
within one second

247
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
and death within ten.

248

Do either of you
care to try them out?

249
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,300
You dare to defy the government?

250
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,880
[SIGMA]
The government?

251
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,300
Under international law,
this casino is outside

252
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,970
the jurisdiction of
any country's police.

253
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,890
It's effectively an
independent nation.

254
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,310
Therefore, I am the law.

255
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,230
If you want to spend your
money here and then leave,

I'm delighted.

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,810
Otherwise, just get lost!

No.

I guess no one's gonna be able
to get out of this casino now!

We're gonna split up

Wow.

he was the perfect choice

[SIGMA] This couldn't
have gone any worse.

292
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,940
I should've kicked
the Hunting Dogs out.

293
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,240
They must be the ones
behind the explosion.

294
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,200
Which means they're going
to investigate the casino.

295
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,410
If they find out what this
casino really is in actuality...

296
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,830
...I will have to kill them.

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,890
A gold coin?

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,020
[MICHIZOU]
The Detective Agency.

301
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,520
They must all be hiding
inside of that room.

302
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,450
I don't sense anyone in here.

303
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,700
They must have noticed me coming

304
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,450
and escaped to the
pocket dimension.

305

[MICHIZOU]
The carpet has been cut.

306
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,040
There's something here
under the floor.

307
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,340
A safe?

How? How did they know?

00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,280
How could the Hunting
Dogs have found it?

313
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,530
Impossible.

314
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,780
Did he just manage
to stumble into

315
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,370
that particular
room by accident?

316
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,500
Okay, stay calm.

317
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,790
Their communication
devices and weapons,

318
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,960
they were confiscated along
with the other customers.

319
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,210
Which means that if
I kill them both now,

320
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,300
I can still protect the secret.

321
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,930
[FYODOR]
Sigma.

322
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,100
I'll give you a word of
advice, as a colleague.

323
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,970
If you're ever found out
by the Hunting Dogs

324
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,770
in the middle of one
of their missions,

325
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,690
then abandon everything
and run away.

326
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,020
Believe me, you won't stand
a chance against them.

327
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,530
[SIGMA]
Abandon everything? The casino?

328
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,070
It's very odd.

329
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,530
Are all of these coins
completely hollow?

330
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,700
No. There's something
inside of them.

331
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,450
Some kind of impurity
in the metal structure.

332
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,750
I'm so sorry.

333
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,970
It's over.

334
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,850
From that distance,
he has to be dead.

335
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,720
A high-precision explosive
disguised as a coin.

336
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,350
It's the savage weapon at the
center of the Decay of Angels'

337
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,850
next worldwide terrorist attack.

338
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,060
Now that one has seen it,

339
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,230
I just can't send either
of them home alive.

340
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,070
[MICHIZOU] Whew! That was
a close one for sure.

341
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,490
[SIGMA]
What?

342
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,740
I managed to stop the shrapnel
with my special ability,

343
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,410
but the blast was still
able to knock me down.

344
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,740
Hang on for a second,

345
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,080
are all the coins in this
safe miniature bombs?

346
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,500
I didn't finish him!
Now what do I do?

347
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,840
Wait, I still have my
last resort available.

348
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,920
However, using it will cause
severe damage to the casino.

349
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,430
Believe me, you won't stand
a chance against them.

350
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,560
Maybe everything
he said was right.

351
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,020
When I think of
the Decay of Angels

352
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,020
and all the superhuman members,

353
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,060
I'm the one who has the
least combat ability.

354
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,230
If I'm not part of this casino,
I'm nothing at all.

[SECURITY C]
Wow.

356
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,320
I heard he memorizes
all of his clients' names

357
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,360
and characteristics instantly.

he was the perfect choice

Everyone's got it all wrong.

I don't have the talent
they think I do.

362
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,380
I have to sacrifice sleep
to memorize things.

363
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,840
I obsessively study client
profiles and the casino layout.

364
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,720
I don't wanna lose the casino.

365
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,600

What an exhilarating
display of evil.

387
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,470
[MICHIZOU] The customers take
the coins out of the casino.

388
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,020
Then once they've been
traded around the world,

389
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,650
they'll all be triggered
at the same exact time.

This casino is actually
a terrorist itself.

That's why that manager was in
such a hurry to kick us out,

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,660
before we looked around
and found something.

393

This casino is where the trigger
signal is transmitted from.

A signal from such
a high altitude

would reach across

The Hunting Dogs

[ANGO] And that is the Decay
of Angels' next plan.

406
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,690
A global act of terrorism,
targeting all of humanity.

407
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,570
But their true aspiration is
the panic that will ensue.

408
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,330
Currency, the basis of a
state's trust, will kill people.

Never mind a great depression.

410
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,040
It could very possibly
trigger the next world war.

411
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,590
This is it.

412
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,050
The worldwide terrorism that
the Decay of Angels will perform

413
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,470
before they fill in the
other side of that page.

414
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,800
[ATSUSHI] As the first step in
stopping this terrorist attack,

415
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,930
we'll have the Hunting Dogs
discover the coin bombs,

416
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,010
and while they're busy,

417
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,810
we'll take control
of the comms room.

418
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,810
By working with the Hunting Dogs
to stop a terrorist attack,

419
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,940
we'll prove once and for all

420
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,900
that we couldn't
be the terrorists.

421
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,270
And we capture Sigma,

422
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,400
who's a member of
the Decay of Angels

423
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,780
and knows where the page is.

424
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,910
That's exactly how Dazai's
plan will work.

425
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,870
[SIGMA] This is the Hunting
Dogs' combat power?

426
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,500
This is what it means to
be in a different league.

427
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,500
But us nothings have
our own way of fighting

did you choose Sigma

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,840
to protect the casino?

[FYODOR]
What are you talking about?

433
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,850
[OSAMU]
Are you really gonna play dumb?

434
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,760
I discovered
something interesting

435
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,430
when I looked up
the Sigma character

436
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,100
you put so much faith in.

437
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,730
His life began rather recently
when he was arrested

438
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,730
by European police
three years ago.

439
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,400
He has no past to speak of.

440
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,280
He's sort of like a
novel that doesn't begin

441
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,910
until halfway through the story.

442
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,490
All I learned was
his special ability.

443
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,450
The ability to trade,
with anyone he touches,

444
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,250
the information each
person wants most.

445
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,670
He used that ability to steal
the location of the page

446
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,550
from Chief Taneda.

447
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,300
But you only needed
him for that instant.

448
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,340
So why did you leave
him to run the casino?

449
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,800
Why do you think
I left him in charge?

450
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,140
[OSAMU] First of all, I don't
think he's even close

451
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,520
to being a terrorist.

452
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,640
It's said that the Sky
Casino was built

453
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,560
following a secret meeting
of the victors of the war

454
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,110
13 years ago.

455
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,780
But no intelligence organization
had information about it.

456
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,700
That's when I realized.

457
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,120
The Sky Casino wasn't
built 13 years ago

458
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,330
like the rumors suggest.

459
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,790
It was built eight days ago.

460
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,250
It was then that it
emerged instantaneously,

461
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,420
having been written
about on the page.

462
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,880
Along with 13 years'
worth of history.

463
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,260
Now, I'll go back
to my first question.

464
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,010
Why did you assign
Sigma to the casino?

465
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,590
[FYODOR] Because he's
the most powerful of all.

466
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,760
[OSAMU]
Powerful?

467
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,350
In your opinion,
who would you say

468
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,600
is the strongest
person in the world?

469
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,440
A Gifted? A political leader?
Anyone you chose is wrong.

470
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,480
The most powerful one is the one
who has nothing else to lose.

471
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,570
[FYODOR] You see,
Sigma doesn't have a past.

472
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,910
In fact, he has amnesia.

473
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,580
[MICHIZOU] Sorry,
but guns don't work on me.

474
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,710
[SECURITY F]
Fall back! Retreat!

475
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,500
[TERUKO coughing]

476
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,050
[MICHIZOU]
Teruko! Are you all right?

477
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,970
[TERUKO]
Tachihara.

478
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,600
The heroes of justice are
gonna go save the world

479
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,390
while coughing up blood.

480
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,520
Don't you think that paints
an exhilarating picture?

481
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,730
[MICHIZOU] She got injured
when she stopped the plane.

482
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,270
[door opens]

483
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,690
[CUSTOMER B]
What was all that noise?

484
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,400
[CUSTOMER A] The security
guards are on the ground.

485
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,780
Oh, shit.

486
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,900
[WIFE] Is there something
wrong out here?

487
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,410
[MICHIZOU] Not to worry.
I'm with the police.

488
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,990
We're currently investigating
some terrorists.

489
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,290
This floor is now
completely safe.

490
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,250
[WIFE]
Oh. I'm glad to hear it.

491
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,420
[MICHIZOU groans]

492
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,040
[MICHIZOU]
What?

493
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,510
Tachihara!

494
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,670
[HUSBAND] Now we don't have
to pay for our losses!

495
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,300
[WIFE]
That's right, honey!

496
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,390
[SIGMA]
Attack! I repeat.

497
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,720
Attack these two
terrorists on sight.

498
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,390
I repeat. Attack!

499
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,770
You won't be accused
of any crime,

500
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,860
and your gambling
losses will be erased.

501
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,400
Plus ten grand for an injury.
One million if you kill them.

502
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,280
[FYODOR]
Unsure of who he was,

503
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,950
Sigma went looking
for a place to be.

504
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,450
That place was the casino.

505
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,950
This is why I have no doubt

506
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,500
that he'll torch
the Hunting Dogs

507
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,130
with hellish tenacity in order
to protect the casino.

508
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,670
The most terrifying thing that
ever existed on this planet

509
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,010
is a mediocre man
who is desperate.
