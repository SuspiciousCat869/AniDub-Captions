1
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,620
[phone ringing]

2
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,630
[OCHI]
It's me.

3
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,130
So are you ready to join
the military police?

4
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,920
We're the only ones who can
make use of your powers.

5
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,760
Get over here!

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,720
From this point on,

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,970
I've decided I'm going
to start working alone.

8
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,730
[WOMAN A]
Oh, God.

9
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,070
[MAN B]
Did they jump?

10
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,190
[MAN C] No, apparently
it was a murder.

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Shoved out a window.

12
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,880
[knocking]

13
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,880
The door is open.

14
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,170
My condolences and sympathy.

15
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,970
He was a good and
honorable man.

16
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,470
Thank you for coming
on short notice, Fukuzawa.

17
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,890
I appreciate it.

18
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,430
Do you mind telling
me what you're doing

19
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,890
with those with papers?

20
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,640
[SECRETARY]
I am organizing them.

21
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,060
[YUKICHI]
Why?

22
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,230
[SECRETARY] I suspect that
the murderer had intended

23
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,610
to either steal these
specific documents

24
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,780
or had intended to destroy them.

25
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,700
In order to confirm that,
I'm arranging all the papers

26
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,370
according to any
potential patterns.

27
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,990
I believe the motivation for the
attack might be discovered

28
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,910
somewhere in this room.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,080
It's a catalog of clues.

30
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,500
[YUKICHI] I was told that he was
pushed out of this window.

31
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,880
The president...

32
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,050
He took me in as a secretary
and I'm indebted to him.

33
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,590
Solving the nature of
the crime would be

34
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,260
the best farewell gift
I can offer him.

35
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,470
But fortunately, the assassin
has already been captured.

36
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,350
Huh?

37
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,810
After murdering the president,

38
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,600
he was apprehended by
guards on the first floor,

39
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,480
He's now being held next door.

40
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,650
What?

41
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,440
The ten fingerprints
the police recovered

42
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,990
from the back of the
president's clothes

43
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,700
is apparently a perfect
match to the perpetrator.

44
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,660
Is the murderer still next door?

45
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,780
He seems to have
surrendered himself quietly

46
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,120
and without any fuss.

47
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,790
I'd like to have a look
at this assassin

48
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,120
if you don't mind.

49
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,710
[SECRETARY]
Be my guest.

50
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,840
But please, don't touch any of
the documents as you walk by.

51
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,840
[gasps]

52
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,480
[YUKICHI] He's quite an
accomplished assassin.

53
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,900
Reddish hair and dual pistols.

54
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,990
Which means he must be

55
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,200
the famous underground
child assassin.

56
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,160
But if this boy truly
is Sakunosuke Oda,

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,210
how could he be captured
by mere security guards?

58
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,330
[SECRETARY]
As you can see,

59
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,710
the killer is maintaining
his silence.

60
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,670
The municipal police should be
here soon to take him away.

61
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,010
As for you--

62
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,470
[RAMPO]
Hey, there!

63
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,010
[SECRETARY]
Huh?

64
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,810
[RAMPO] It's so damn
windy outside today, huh?

65
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,730
So, uh, anyway...

66
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,100
Is there any chance we
can relocate this company

67
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,690
or something?

68
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,360
The hills are a pain, and the
directions are so complicated.

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,690
Pardon?

70
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,780
But our main concern is,
I'm getting hungry.

71
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
D'you have any food?

72
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,370
Pardon?!

73
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,450
Here we go again,

74
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,870
lookin' down on me
like I'm some kid.

75
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,040
Fine, never mind the food,
just give me the permit.

76
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,170
Wait a minute, have you lost
it in all these documents?

77
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,380
Dammit! You're the secretary,
you'd better find it!

78
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,000
And don't bore me about finding
any fingerprints in this room,

79
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,420
I haven't the
slightest interest.

80
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,340
What is your major malfunction?

81
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,720
Regardless of the circumstances,
this is the president's office.

82
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,970
Unless you're authorized,

83
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,720
you don't have any
permission to be in here.

84
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,640
Yeah, but I am
authorized, though.

85
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm here for an interview
today, you see.

86
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,940
The president did mention to me
that he would be interviewing

87
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,940
an administrative trainee today.

88
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,650
Anyway, I just came here
for the working permit

89
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,860
that I'm supposed to
get at the interview.

90
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,700
Once I have that, I can get some
funding from the government.

91
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,700
You mind if I move some
of these useless papers?

92
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,000
You may not!

93
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,250
The arrangements of these
documents is a catalog

94
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,170
for determining the
assassin's motivations

95
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,670
for taking the president's life!

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Come on, I've never heard
such nonsense in my life.

97
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,710
Forget it. I'll find it myself.

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,010
And don't you worry,
I'll be done quick.

99
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,510
[YUKICHI]
Boy.

100
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,300
There's a mountain of
documents on the floor,

101
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,430
how are you planning
to find yours?

102
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,770
What do you know,
the old man speaks.

103
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,440
Unlike all these loose papers,

104
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,850
mine's got a heavy stamp
on the front of it.

105
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,150
Plus it's printed on thicker
paper than the rest of them.

106
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,650
No, don't!

107
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,490
[RAMPO]
Found it.

108
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,710
[SECRETARY]
How could you?

109
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,000
Now I have to check every sheet
and arrange it all over again.

110
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,920
And I still have to report
on the missing documents

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,920
within 48 hours.

112
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,630
[RAMPO]
Why bother?

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,970
Nothing's missing,
they're all still right here.

114
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,930
None of the documents
have been stolen,

115
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,770
and the assassin you
have in the other room

116
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,940
didn't kill the president.

117
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,230
Like, you're the
murderer anyway.

118
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,520
Right, Secretary?

119
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,150
You're just arranging documents
to keep people away

120
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,490
so that you can come
up with an alibi.

121
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,990
I mean, it would be suspicious
if there were fingerprints

122
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,790
on the president's clothes,
but nowhere else in the room.

123
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,410
It seems like the
obviously guilty secretary

124
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,000
and the obviously innocent
assassin are both right here.

125
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,460
And you're just standing
there like nothing's wrong.

126
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,130
Come on, mister, you're
slackin' on the job.

127
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,380
[SECRETARY]
Fukuzawa.

128
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,970
Please do me a favor and
kick that kid out now.

129
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,470
I can't have him in here
making even more of a mess!

130
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,890
The fact is,

131
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,690
the assassin's matching
fingerprints were indeed found

132
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,810
on the back of the
president's clothes.

133
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,020
Safe to assume it's from
when he was shoved.

134
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,980
[RAMPO] There's no way
even the best assassin

135
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,650
could get close to the president
without being noticed.

136
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,570
Just look. The door is
right in view of his desk.

137
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,280
And if the president
resisted being pushed,

138
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,410
the fingerprints
would have meant

139
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,160
the president was thrown out of
the window and not pushed out.

140
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,920
If you ask me, the secretary's
story has a lotta holes.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,670
You're not factoring
in that the president

142
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,050
may have happened to be
looking out the window.

143
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,170
Looking out an open
window by himself?

144
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,260
On such a windy day?

145
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,470
[YUKICHI]
He's right.

146
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,640
Which means, it must have
been someone close.

147
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,140
It was someone close to him,

148
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,230
yet the assassin's fingerprints
turned up on the clothes,

149
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,980
so those prints were faked.

150
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,440
I heard it's pretty easy to fake
fingerprints if you wanted to.

151
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,150
You just need to make
molds of the fingers

152
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,530
using putty or something.

153
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,900
Every cop knows how to do it.

154
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,950
Come to think of it,
weren't you a police officer

155
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,490
before this job,
Mister Secretary?

156
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,120
[SECRETARY]
This is ridiculous!

157
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,240
How would I have taken

158
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,500
the assassin's
fingerprints beforehand?!

159
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,750
Fukuzawa! Just get this brat

You were able to get the
assassin's fingerprints

161
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,170
because you were the one
who hired the assassin

--in the first place.
--[SECRETARY] Shut up!

Since you hired him,

164
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,670
you could easily entrap
a top-tier assassin.

165

Even got the security guards
to catch him afterwards.

If I had to bet money on it,

167
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,970
I don't think the
assassin over there

168
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,640
ever had a clue he
was being entrapped.

I'm sure he'd talk if he
found out he's been fooled.

It's not sweet enough

[RAMPO]
From the beginning.

The secretary was
wearin' a coat, right?

191
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,120
When have you ever seen
anyone wearing a coat

Your sleeves would
get in the way.

fingerprints.

Pretty smart, boy.

You'd better
remember that.

What about school?

200
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,470
[RAMPO] I was enrolled
at the police academy,

201
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,050
living in the dorms.

202
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,890
I had an argument with
the dorm supervisor,

203
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,720
so I exposed all of their past
affairs and I got kicked out.

from place to place.

206
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,810
I was a live-in worker at a
garrison, till I got kicked out.

207
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,320
They caught me blabbing
about the head chief

They were both killed.

up for a job, too?

to the municipal police

281

is because you want him to
keep an eye on the police.

282
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,850
And have the police keep
an eye on him as well.

In other words, you don't
trust anyone, do you?

If it's all right with you,

to me right before the show?

[RAMPO] Hey, what's this
play about, anyway?

317
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,190
You were sent the
scripts, weren't you?

318
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,230
Yeah, but that thing
was so boring.

319
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,570
I gave up after the first page
before falling asleep.

320
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,270
[YUKICHI]
Boy.

321
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,610
[RAMPO]
Huh?

322
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,070
[TOKIO]
So I see.

323
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,490
[RAMPO]
Hm?

324
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,070
If you think that
the script is boring,

325
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,490
then I guess it must be boring.

326
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,460
But usually it's the audience
that gets to decide that.

327
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,630
Have you met Murakami?

328
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,300
This play's practically a
one-man show for his character.

329
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,930
If you want to find out more,

330
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,270
he's been meeting a lot with
the playwright, Kurahashi.

331
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,810
I mean, no one
here really believes

332
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,520
there's going to be an actual
murder tonight, do they?

333
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,070
But if someone is
going to get hit,

334
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,610
it'll probably be Murakami.

335
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,940
He's got a lot of women
chasing after him.

336
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,780
Me? I only have a minor role,
that no one cares about.

337
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,160
Can you imagine,
an actor so insignificant

338
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,040
that I'm not even worth
threatening to kill?

339
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,830
Know why this happened?

340
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,880
No, tell me.

341
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,340
Some love affair.

342
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Maybe someone in the cast

343
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,590
decided to sleep
with a crazed fan.

344
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,180
Or they broke up and
decided to quit the play.

345
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,100
I'm sure there's a cast member
or two someone wants to kill.

346
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,270
[sighs]

347
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,190
[RAMPO]
Look! They have potato chips!

348
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,980
And the chocolates
I missed out on!

349
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Hey, mister, I'm gettin'
hungry over here.

350
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,410
Ugh! Are you listening
to what I'm saying?

351
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,200
[sighs]

352
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,830
I'm dying of starvation.

353
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,080
And there's no chance in hell
I'm gettin' that job either.

354
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,540
Whatever.

355
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,250
Yup, someone's gonna die soon

356
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,540
and this theater's gonna
get shut down right quick.

357
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,710
[YUKICHI] I won't let
the murder happen.

358
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,880
Huh?

359
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,380
[YUKICHI]
That's why I was called here.

360
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,380
Neither the theater
nor the municipal police

361
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,550
are taking the threat seriously.

362
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,890
Regardless of the motivation
of the person or people

363
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,180
behind the threat.

364
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,430
[RAMPO]
It's not a threat.

365
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,180
[YUKICHI]
Hm?

366
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,890
[RAMPO]
It's a warning.

367
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,980
A threat always
offers two options,

368
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,530
and this one doesn't offer any.

369
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,860
A threat is, "You better
do ABC for me,

370
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,530
or I'm going to do XYZ to you."

371
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,320
But right now, all we have
is a warning, saying,

372
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,580
"We're going to kill one of
the performers in your play."

373
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,870
So it's not a threat so much
as it's really a declaration.

374
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,910
From the very beginning
the attacker has not made

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,040
a single demand of the theater.

376
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,420
When did you come to
that realization?

377
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,550
[RAMPO] When I heard
what the letter said.

378
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,130
[gasps]

379
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,760
[YUKICHI] When did you
realize the secretary

380
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,550
was the murderer?

381
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,260
From the beginning.

382
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,220
[YUKICHI]
This boy is interesting.

383
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,600
He's able to see
the truth in things.

384
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,610
If you knew right away,
why didn't you say anything?

385
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,020
It simply never occurred to me

386
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,900
that a savvy person
like yourself

387
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,610
would ever misinterpret
the warning as a threat.

388
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,570
Are you under the assumption
that everyone else

389
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,660
has the same superior powers
of observation that you do?

390
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,490
You notice everything.

391
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,540
[RAMPO] None of the documents
have been stolen,

392
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,330
and the assassin you
have in the other room

393
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,130
didn't kill the president.

394
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,960
The real reason why you
aren't introducing him

395
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,380
to the municipal police

396
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,800
is because you want him to
keep an eye on the police.

397
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,970
[YUKICHI] This boy--
he doesn't understand

398
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,640
that no one else knows
anything compared to him.

399
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,560
He's convinced that everyone
else already knows the truth.

400
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,770
And that most people
are simply pretending

401
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,940
that they don't know.

402
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,070
Tell me, boy, what do
you notice about me?

403
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,440
[RAMPO]
Huh?

404
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,950
You said that you have
nowhere to stay tonight.

405
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,120
I don't.

406
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,330
All right, for the time being,

407
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,290
you can spend the
night at my place.

408
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,620
You mean at your home?

409
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,210
Yeah, but first you
have to tell me,

410
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,880
what things have you
noticed about me so far?

411
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,300
Gee, grown-ups sure do love
their quid pro quos, don't they?

412
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,590
I've only just met you,

413
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,760
so there's not much
I can tell about you yet.

414
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,340
But I'd say that you're
in your early 30s.

415
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,430
You told me you're a bodyguard.

416
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,970
A master of martial arts.
Very single.

417
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,350
You have no coworkers.
You're right-handed.

418
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,520
You chose a seat by the
wall at the restaurant,

419
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,560
so you must be a
swordsman as well.

420
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,980
And just a guess,

421
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,900
the reason you don't use your
katana for work anymore

422
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,820
is because you're ashamed
of your last job.

423
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,820
What job involving swordplay
could you'd be ashamed of?

424
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,870
Come to think of it,
there was some buzz

425
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,700
about an incident
a few years ago.

426
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,370
During the peace treaty debates,

427
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,630
pro-war bureaucrats and
overseas military factions

428
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,000
were suddenly found dead,
one after another.

429
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,630
And back at the gift shop,
you were grimacing a little bit

430
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,010
as you noticed the
headline in the newspaper.

431
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,510
Should I keep going, mister?

432
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,970
[YUKICHI]
Silence!

433
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,980
[gasps]

434
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,520
[YUKICHI]
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

435
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,660
Uh. Yeah.
Just startled, is all.

436
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,990
[YUKICHI] This boy is
absolutely the real deal.

437
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,790
[YUKICHI]
Boy, help me with this job.

438
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,380
If we manage to do well,

439
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,380
I'll introduce you to work
you're more suited for.

440
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,550
Well?

441
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,510
Sounds good to me.
I'll do what I can.

442
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,220
[buzzer]

443
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,180
[ANNOUNCER]
The doors will now open.

444
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,720
Please make your way inside the
theater and take your seats.

445
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,450
[YUKICHI]
What the hell am I doing?

446
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:08,910
I had already made my decision,
and I'd decided I'd work alone.

447
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,460
Let's go.
