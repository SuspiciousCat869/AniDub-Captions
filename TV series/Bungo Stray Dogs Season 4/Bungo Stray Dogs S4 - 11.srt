00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,010
[OGURI]
Dear Master Yokomizo.

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,680
How is it in the afterlife?

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,600
Knowing you, I suspect that
you're looking for ways

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,350
to manipulate divine powers
into allowing you an escape.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,400
I bet if you saw me right now,

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,860
you'd be very jealous of my
current lavish lifestyle.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,490
I'm not exaggerating.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,860
The meals are extravagant
and exquisite.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,620
[GUARD]
Meal time!

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,330
Thank you for this meal.

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,540
[OGURI] Even the Celtic
god Ruad Rofhessa

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,580
would envy my bounty
of reading material.

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,290
[OGURI]
You, guard.

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,500
[GUARD]
Hmm?

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,090
[OGURI] I wish to read
books on occultism.

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,510
Take me to the library.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,130
You know you're not
allowed to leave.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,220
[OGURI] Well, at least lend
me something to read.

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,760
If the rinse cycle
does not occur

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,770
during the washing process,
please see page 8 for more.

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,480
[OGURI] I get to read books
that I rarely do otherwise.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,480
As a matter of fact, I never
even think about you

23
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,900
and that you no longer
exist in this world.

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,420
[OGURI yells]

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,920
[OGURI]
Oh, Yokomizo.

26
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,840
Unlike the fool that you are,

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,760
I am able to maintain
my composure

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,430
and grace during this crisis.

29
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,430
[OGURI yelling]

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,060
[screams]

31
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,060
[ATSUSHI]
We're here to help you.

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,480
We're from the Armed
Detective Agency.

33
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,830
Here's what happened.

34
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,750
The Decay of Angels framed
the Detective Agency.

35
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,380
While you were trying to
warn us about their trap,

36
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,670
the enemy captured you.

37
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,300
We used the Eyes of
God to find you

38
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,680
so that we can get
you out of here.

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,350
Kyouka, have you dealt
with the guards?

40
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,680
[KYOUKA] Demon Snow
knocked them out cold.

41
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,730
Well, Mushitaro,
it's time we all escaped.

42
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,730
[OGURI]
I refuse.

43
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,810
Huh?

44
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,310
You just want me because
of my knowledge

45
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,650
of the Decay of Angels,
isn't that right?

46
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,490
But I have no need for you
or your Agency at all.

47
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,620
But still, don't you wanna
get out of this prison?

48
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,450
I'm quite familiar with
being locked up by now.

49
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,120
Besides, there's nothing
for me anymore.

50
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,870
Not in the outside
world, anyway.

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,040
Even if I leave,
he's still not...

52
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,670
The manuscript.

53
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,220
Rampo told me that you wouldn't
be able to resist that word,

54
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,220
and it looks like he was right.

55
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,640
[RAMPO] It would be enough just
to publicize the true story

56
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,010
behind this manuscript.

57
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,730
[OGURI]
Is that a threat?

58
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,190
You've become a true criminal
organization now, haven't you?

59
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,020
That may be how it looks,

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,440
but I'll become anything,
and do anything as well

61
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,320
in order to save the Agency.

62
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,700
[growls]

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,200
I see.

64
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,240
Then you must be aware that
what you're doing right now

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,830
will be conceived as being
tantamount to bank robbery.

66
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,500
After all, we're inside
a government bank.

67
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,830
Breaking in alone
is a serious crime.

68
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,420
[OGURI]
Oh, whatever.

69
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,800
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

70
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,720
I will do as you want me to.

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,510
You really mean it? Thank you!

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,520
[KYOUKA]
The escape route is this way.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,020
[OGURI]
The manuscript!

74
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,360
[OGURI] That was the last
remnant of Yokomizo's life

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,190
with which he entrusted me!

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,110
How dare they use it against me!

77
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,660
Wretched bastards!

78
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,200
I ought to let the
guards take them out.

79
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,160
Which means, I need to make
us as noticeable as possible.

80
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,460
Ah! My stomach is killing me!

81
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,830
[ATSUSHI]
Are you all right?

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,960
[OGURI] Not at all!
I'm afraid I might be a goner!

83
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,090
[KYOUKA]
Okay, fine.

84
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,680
I know of an acupuncture point
that works on stomach pain,

85
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,810
and all it takes is a good
jab three centimeters

86
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,850
above the hipbone.

87
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,180
[OGURI]
Oh, I'm all better!

88
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,020
It works so well, you feel
better before you get jabbed!

89
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,310
[KYOUKA]
Glad to hear it.

90
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,900
[OGURI] Oh, you little brat!
I'm not done yet.

91
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,280
This way is bad!

92
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,150
This hallway is aligned
with the Kabbalistic

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,700
astrology sign Taurus!

94
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,320
Do not tread this evil path,
you foolish normies!

95
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,580
I know an acupuncture point
that works on Kabbala.

96
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,540
The alignment's all better now!

97
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,580
Such a powerful
acupuncture point.

98
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,960
[KYOUKA]
Glad to hear it.

99
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,790
[GUARD A]
Yes, this is Group C.

100
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,090
Yes. Yes. Understood.
On our way.

101
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,340
What's going on?

102
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,510
The guards are leaving.

103
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,100
What the--?

104
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,020
[MANAGER]
P-Please, no, detective.

105
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,310
[ANGO]
Manager, sir.

106
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,650
There's a wanted man hiding
somewhere within this building.

107
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,980
Please cease operations
immediately.

108
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,610
And grant us blanketed
access security authority.

109
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,610
[MILITARY POLICE A] Sir, the
bank has been surrounded.

110
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,910
Good work.

111
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,620
We've assessed the targets'
special abilities.

112
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,450
Now hunt them down.

113
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,750
[OGURI]
What's the problem?

114
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,000
The Special Operations
Division surrounded us.

115
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,630
[OGURI]
Uh! It's him!

116
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,710
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
What is he doing here?

117
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,130
Who is that guy?

118
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,470
Ango Sakaguchi.

119
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,970
If that man manages to catch us,
we're all doomed for sure.

120
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,520
Are you aware of an organization
called the Seventh Agency?

121
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,360
They specialize in
cleaning up crime

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,900
and engaging in cover-ups.

123
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,400
I've heard of it.

124
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,400
When Fyodor was able to rescue
you from your confinement

125
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,780
and he demanded cooperation

126
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,120
during the Cannibalism
in return.

127
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,910
[OGURI]
Ango Sakaguchi

128
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,580
is the leader of that
crime organization.

129
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,830
That's impossible!

130
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,870
Ango Sakaguchi works
for the government!

131
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,460
Do you still not understand?

132
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,630
The government is the one who
created the crime organization!

133
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,340
The Seventh Agency is the
government's shadow.

134
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,630
There were documents on
political crime cover-ups,

135
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,550
using illegal tactics removing
any damaging rumors,

136
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,390
and it was my job to
delete the evidence

137
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,680
on all of these things.

138
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,480
There's no doubt if captured,

139
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,860
I will be held in captivity
until the day that I die.

140
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,980
And you two will
be erased forever.

141
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,070
[KYOUKA] If that's true,
then this trap will be brutal.

142
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,030
The Special Operations
Division team

143
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,530
focuses on dealing with Gifted,

144
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,570
and even the Port
Mafia fears them.

145
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,120
If found, they'll bombard us
with poison gas and explosives,

146
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,500
and that'll be it.

147
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,790
[OGURI] So then we just need
to avoid being found.

148
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,540
Huh?

149
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,380
You don't really know
who I am, do you?

150
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,590
[OGURI]
Walk with pride in your step!

151
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,350
[GUARD B]
Hm?

152
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,430
[GUARD C]
Somethin' wrong?

153
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,140
[GUARD B]
No, nothing.

154
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,600
Impressed?

155
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,100
If we walk with stolen goods
and use my special ability

156
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,860
to erase evidence of crime,

157
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,650
we magically vanish from any
kind of surveillance video

158
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,110
that's recording us.

159
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,610
That's cool.

160
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,610
[ATSUSHI] No wonder Rampo
struggled against this ability.

161
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,570
[gasps]

162
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,530
[OGURI yells]

163
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,240
[ATSUSHI]
Kyouka, hide!

164
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,760
The targets we're looking
for are in this area.

165
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,380
There are Gifted who can
dismantle walls and ceilings.

166
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,930
Secure the perimeter
with caution.

167
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,680
It's Ango Sakaguchi.

168
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,600
But how? My ability is
perfect at hiding us!

169
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,900
Well, this is not good.

170
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,520
The hallway ahead is a dead
end filled with vaults.

171
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,150
There's nowhere to run.

172
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,490
Wait, wh-what if we hide
in one of the vaults?

173
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,530
Too dangerous.
We'd be trapped like rats.

174
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,120
They're coming!

175
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,500
[OGURI]
There's no time.

176
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,120
If they find us, we're doomed.
What do we do?

177
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,040
[SEISHI] It's like you're
trapped in a room.

178
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,590
[OGURI gasps]

179
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,010
[SEISHI] One without an exit.
Just like a locked room.

180
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,550
It'd make for an
entertaining mystery

181
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,220
if the criminal somehow
vanished from here.

182
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,430
What do you think, Mushitaro?
Don't you agree?

183
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,980
[OGURI]
You two.

184
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,530
[ATSUSHI, KYOUKA]
Hm?

185
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,360
[OGURI]
Come with me.

186
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,740
[MILITARY POLICE B]
Targets acquired!

187
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,160
They're escaping into a vault!

188
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,090
Neutralize the enemy!
Gifted Combat Squad, advance!

189
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,590
[MILITARY POLICE A]
Explosives planted.

190
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,340
Breach charges set.

191
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,930
Detonate!

192
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,560
[MILITARY POLICE A]
Breach!

193
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,350
[MILITARY POLICE A gasps]

194
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,270
[MILITARY POLICE A]
Command, there's no one here.

195
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,940
The targets have vanished.

196
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,730
What do you mean?

197
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,700
[ANGO] There's no sign they've
dug through the walls or ground.

198
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,410
How can this be?

199
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,790
There isn't even a sign
they've used special abilities.

200
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,380
They've vanished
without a trace.

201
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,130
[OGURI laughs]

202
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,970
[OGURI]
See that, Special Operations?

203
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,010
[ATSUSHI]
Are you okay?

204
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,550
[OGURI]
That was nothing,

205
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,680
just the classic vanishing act
that I perfected years ago.

206
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,560
What they saw was the
moment Demon Snow

207
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,640
closed the vault door.

208
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,810
We were, in fact, hiding in an
open vault closer to the exit.

209
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,480
[ATSUSHI]
And in the moment of the attack,

210
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,770
Kyouka released Demon
Snow and we escaped.

211
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,400
It's psychological trickery,

212
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,070
taking advantage
of the expectation

213
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,620
that only a bunch of fools would
actually hide in an open vault.

214
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,200
The smarter you are, the more
likely you are to fall for it.

215
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,580
That was amazing.

216
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,870
How'd you come up with that
under so much pressure?

217
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,830
[OGURI]
Oh, well...

218
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,250
I didn't come up with it.

219
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,170
Years ago, someone
explained it to me.

220
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,550
Who was that?

221
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,090
[OGURI]
Hide in the room next door?

222
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,010
Ridiculous. Would it
even count as a trick?

223
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,470
[SEISHI laughs]

224
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,310
You couldn't figure it out,
could you, Mushitaro?

225
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,940
[OGURI] We debated thousands
upon thousands of times.

226
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,070
It seeped into the very
fiber of my being.

227
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:21,280
[OGURI] Yokomizo, were you
actually always there?

228
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,120
Can I always meet you in
a closed room somewhere?

229
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,540
[SEISHI] Life seems exciting
and fun around you these days.

230
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,590
I'm sure that this is much
better for your well-being.

231
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,760
Better than writing
dull letters.

232
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,340
Shut up, you lousy sell-out.

233
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,970
You okay, Mushitaro?

234
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,890
Now we just need to steal
a car and go on the run.

235
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,600
Of course, before we run,
we have to erase the evidence

236
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,230
of having stolen a car
using my ability.

237
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,360
That way, the footage
from the security cameras

238
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,230
placed throughout the city
will make any video

239
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,400
of us stealing a car
vanish into thin air.

240
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,950
You sure are somethin' else.

241
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,740
[KYOUKA] This sewer line will
take us to a parking lot

242
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,990
far away from where the
guards are stationed.

243
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,750
[ATSUSHI]
I'll handle it.

244
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,710
[ATSUSHI] I'm gonna go in first
and check it out to make su--

245
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,010
[OGURI]
Hey!

246
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,010
[KYOUKA]
A dummy grenade?

247
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,100
[ANGO]
Unacceptable.

248
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,770
I can't have you thinking you
can deceive me that easily.

249
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,600
[OGURI]
Impossible! How did you find us?

250
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,270
[ATSUSHI]
Ango, please listen.

251
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,730
The Armed Detective
Agency is innocent.

252
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,860
The real enemy is
the Decay of Angels.

253
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,530
I need you to understand.
Believe me!

254
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,160
[ANGO]
There, there. I understand.

255
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,710
I have special abilities, too.

256
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,750
My special ability allows
me to extract memories

257
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,130
residing in objects.

258
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,880
I used this bundle
of stacked bills

259
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,420
to determine your escape route.

260
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,600
My ability helps me learn
about the crime scene.

261
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,180
Therefore, I can be certain
the Detective Agency is guilty.

262
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,480
And a member stabbed
Chief Taneda!

263
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,690
[KYOUKA] Rampo said the
government has a Gifted

264
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,980
who has the ability to read
the memories of an object.

265
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,320
He also said if we're captured,
we're bound to be executed.

266
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,530
You'd really beg a secret
government organization

267
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,870
to believe you?

268
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,580
The Agency's jokes have
never struck me as funny.

269
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,920
[ATSUSHI] I underestimated the
Special Operations Division.

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,130
[gunshots]

271
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,850
[ATSUSHI groans]

272
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,520
Huh?

273
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,360
[MILITARY POLICE A] Commander,
where are the targets?

274
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,940
[ANGO]
They got away.

275
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,110
They escaped
through the manhole.

276
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,150
They're using the
tiger's special ability

277
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,360
to navigate west.

278
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,370
Secure the whole area.

279
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,120
[MILITARY POLICE A]
Yes, sir.

280
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,910
[ANGO]
This will convince Fyodor

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,870
that we are, in fact,
actual enemies.

282
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,670
So you believe me that the
Detective Agency is innocent?

283
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,670
Because you really
seem to hide it well.

284
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,130
Let me put it this way,
you saw Dazai's message

285
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,680
back when you were
in Francis' office.

286
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,300
I was actually the one
who sent that message.

287
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,850
[ATSUSHI]
Huh? So, then--

288
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,060
Osamu Dazai and I have
been cooperating

289
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,730
since the very beginning.

290
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,770
I'm Dazai's messenger while he's
in a European detention center.

291
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,020
But if he's locked up,

292
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,190
how's Dazai communicating
with the outside?

293
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,700
All of the prisoners at
the Mersault Detention Center

294
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,700
are implanted with
a vital signs monitor

295
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,910
in order to prevent escape.

296
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,370
We have a system.

297
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,660
Dazai has the ability
to encode his messages

298
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,250
within his heart rate,

299
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,920
which I then use my government
access to retrieve and decode.

300
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,840
You're saying he can control
how fast his heart beats?

301
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,630
It's the type of party
trick Dazai's so good at.

302
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,510
No one would suspect a thing.

303
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,050
[OGURI] I don't believe you.
You're an enemy.

304
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,850
What was the point
of your little charade

305
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,600
back at the bank anyway?

306
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,890
There's no telling where
Fyodor has his eyes watching.

307
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,650
With my ability to read
the memories of objects,

308
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,270
I can pursue any escapee that
leaves something behind.

309
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,450
If I lost you, the enemy
would be suspicious.

310
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,610
The enemy?

311
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,280
The cunning Seventh Agency
is afraid of an unseen enemy?

312
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,120
[ANGO]
That's the thing, Mushitaro.

313
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,250
I'm guessing you've been told
I'm part of the Seventh Agency,

314
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,040
or perhaps even that
I'm their leader.

315
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,590
And what if I have?

316
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,420
[ANGO]
It's simple.

317
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,970
I have absolutely nothing to do
with the Seventh Agency at all.

318
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,430
You don't?

319
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:55,060
[ANGO] Fyodor lied. In order
to keep you away from me.

320
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,730
That's how afraid he is
of you and I talking.

321
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,270
Let's continue this
conversation elsewhere.

322
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,650
I know a place we can go.
We'll be safe there.

323
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,730
What's wrong with you?!

324
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,690
Are you out of your mind
or something?

325
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,200
What do you mean
you're "wanted"?

326
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,160
What type of trouble did
you bring to my door?

327
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,330
Are you sure that this
place is really safe?

328
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,910
Only those that she decides
to invite inside can enter.

329
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,660
It's the safest place on earth.

330
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,870
[ATSUSHI]
Wait, Lucy.

331
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,880
Why are you suddenly
working with Ango now?

332
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,630
I... really don't think
that's any of your business.

333
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,800
[ANGO]
I'm protecting her.

334
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,340
[LUCY]
Hey!

335
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,760
[ANGO] One day, she barged into
investigation headquarters.

336
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,010
"Atsushi's not evil!
There's no way he's a murderer,"

337
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,470
she said maniacally.

338
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,730
[LUCY] Stop it!
Don't tell him what I said!

339
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,810
[ATSUSHI]
Wow, that's very kind of you.

340
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,270
Thank you, Lucy.

341
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,900
Can we put aside all
that for a moment?

342
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,110
As you might know, Ango,

343
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,280
I was once captured
by an organization

344
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,530
that forced me to help
cover up their crimes.

345
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,250
That evil organization was
called the Seventh Agency.

346
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,410
With that in mind,
can you honestly say

347
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,540
that you're not
currently with them?

348
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,090
I'm not.

349
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,550
All right.

350
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,010
Have you ever made use of their
services for any reason?

351
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,720
Yes, I have.

352
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,730
[OGURI] Then I have no reason to
cooperate with you any further.

353
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,980
Don't go. It was only once.

354
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,190
Four years ago,
in order to solidify a way

355
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,740
for Dazai to live
outside the Port Mafia,

356
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,370
I needed to erase
his past crimes.

357
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,460
Why just once?
Your hands were already dirty.

358
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,590
I tried to make amends

359
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,140
for a dear friend who
is now long gone.

360
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,060
For a dear friend long
gone, huh? Yeah.

361
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,030
Mushitaro, you are
absolutely correct.

362
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,280
The Seventh Veil Agency is evil.

363
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,280
Their scope, their members,

364
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,070
their hierarchy,
everything is unknown.

365
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,450
Even I had to go through
four levels of middlemen

366
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,160
to work with that government
crime organization.

367
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,580
I believe you.

368
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,960
So I'm guessing
that's the reason

369
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,460
why you prefer working
independently.

370
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,920
That's right.

371
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,920
What is all of this about?

372
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,470
The man in front of you

373
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,340
suspects that there's a spy
working inside the government.

374
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,510
[ALL gasp]

375
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,850
I can't trust anyone anymore.

376
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:46,060
I'm the only one capable
of avenging Chief Taneda.

377
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,400
So to that end,
I need to hear about

378
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,150
everything that you know.

379
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,690
The knowledge that Fyodor tried
so hard to hide from me.

380
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,740
I ask on his behalf as well.

381
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,450
I know you have no
reason to tell us,

382
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,320
but I'm asking anyway.

383
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,740
[KYOUKA]
Please, help us.

384
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,250
[OGURI]
Where do I start?

385
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,500
But just so you know,

386
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,380
in about five minutes
you'll be regretting it.

387
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,880
Anything you ask me,

388
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,090
all of my answers will
absolutely ruin your day.

389
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,300
[ANGO]
In that case,

390
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,760
I'll ask the most important
question first.

391
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,010
The Decay of Angels,
just what is it?

392
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,600
[OGURI] The terrorist
organization Decay of Angels

393
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,640
is comprised of five members.

394
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,480
The demonic Fyodor
and jester Nikolai,

395
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,770
as well as two more extremely
talented Gifted.

396
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,990
And then one founding member
who manages them all.

397
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,780
You mean there's
someone above Fyodor?

398
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,330
[OGURI] I don't know what
their ultimate goal is,

399
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,660
but I do know what
their current plan is.

400
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm one step ahead of it.

401
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,790
The erasure of the state itself.

402
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,130
The erasure?
Don't you mean overturning?

403
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,340
That's impossible!
They could never pull it off!

404
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,340
Don't forget that
they have the page.

405
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,470
Yeah, but there's only one page,

406
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,220
and they used it when
they framed the Agency

407
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,680
in the murder of Tonan
and the other officials.

408
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,930
That was the first time.
They get one more go.

409
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,980
He's right. The other
side of the page.

410
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,440
[OGURI]
Exactly.

411
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,320
The page that makes
anything written on it

412
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,150
become a reality is activated
the moment it's written upon.

413
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,280
The page is blank on both sides,

414
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,370
and they've already
written on one.

415
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,410
They can use the other side
whenever they're ready.

416
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,000
So they have the power to
recreate that tragedy at will.

417
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,210
What are they waiting for?

418
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,210
Why don't they use
it right away, then?

419
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,380
In order for the page
to be activated,

420
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,920
a rule must be followed.

421
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,340
It needs to have a narrative-
like causal consistency

422
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,760
like one might read
in a novel, right?

423
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,010
[OGURI]
Correct.

424
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,010
And because of that rule,
a grand conspiracy

425
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,680
undoubtedly requires many
lines of text to complete.

426
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,190
So they'll only write the
important details onto the page.

427
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,690
They'll deal with the trivial
details themselves separately.

428
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,730
They won't waste space on that.

429
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,860
This is the current phase
of execution for their plan.

430
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,240
For the next step, they'll
engage in global terrorism

431
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,740
before using the blank
side of the page.

432
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,580
And then the state will
be erased. Is that it?

433
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,290
[OGURI] The other side of
the page will be written

434
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,590
on the night of the
next full moon.

435
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,640
Ten days from now.

436
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,220
Oh, shit.

437
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,890
You're right. I feel like
garbage after hearing that.

438
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,860
For now, let me escort
you out of here.

439
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,610
And then I will relay
this information to Dazai.

440
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,080
Hey, will you be all right?

441
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,290
You bet I will!
We actually did it, Kyouka!

442
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,460
Yeah.

443
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,590
[LUCY] Huh?
Wh-What has gotten into you?

444
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,420
Ten days until the other side
of the page is written.

445
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,220
In other words, they can't
write anything until then.

446
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,220
That's right.

447
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,260
It'll take them at
least ten days

448
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,600
to prepare their final step,

449
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,520
which gives us ten days to
try and stop their plan.

450
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,640
[ATSUSHI] The Detective Agency's
been made criminals

451
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,520
because of the page's
reality-altering effect.

452
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,820
We can't undo that.
Or so I thought.

453
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
But now that's not true.

454
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,990
We'll take the page back
and write that the Agency

455
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,740
is innocent of all these crimes.

456
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,660
And that'll finally
fix everything.

457
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,240
We'll track down
the Decay of Angels

458
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:35,040
within ten days and defeat them,
then take the page back.

459
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,670
Simple as that.
That's all we need to do.

460
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,300
Kyouka, let's do it.

461
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,010
We still have some hope.
