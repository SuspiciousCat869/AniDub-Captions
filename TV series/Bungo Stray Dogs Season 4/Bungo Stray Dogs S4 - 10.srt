1
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,060
[JUNICHIRO] The transaction's
supposed to happen

2
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,310
just up ahead.

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,350
We have to hurry, before
the Port Mafia notices

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,560
that we're gone.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,110
[MICHIZOU]
Dammit, you old geezer, why?

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,150
Just kill the
freaking detectives.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,820
[AKIKO]
They got here ahead of us.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,700
Just remember what
the boss said.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,610
Francis might be with
the military police,

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,870
so make sure you don't
go near their business.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,660
Even though they ignored
the boss's orders

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,040
and went off on their own.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,540
I can't believe how they're
disrespecting the boss!

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,500
Still not giving up your old
gangster habits, Tachihara?

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,340
The Port Mafia's actions
are not determined

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,250
by whether or not
it's disrespected.

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,880
But instead, whether or
not they're faithful

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,670
to the boss's wishes.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,720
Don't let anyone
hurt the Agency.

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,640
Protect them with your
life if necessary.

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,270
That is the order we were given,
and we will follow.

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,600
To put it another way,
the boss knew very well

23
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,980
that they were about to engage
in dangerous business.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,020
[AKIKO]
Mister Mori knew that?

25
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,900
There you have it, detectives.
Have you heard quite enough yet?

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,200
[AKIKO] Mister Mori sure
is a worrywart, isn't he?

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,860
Well, he doesn't need to worry.

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,490
Your deal with Francis
isn't a trap

29
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,200
like he suspects it might be.

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,910
[HIROTSU]
Oh? How are you so sure?

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,920
Because I know Atsushi
believes him.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,920
Atsushi fought with Francis

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,960
when they were both
aboard the Moby Dick.

34
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,050
Once you bare your
soul to someone

35
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,140
by trading mortal
blows with them,

36
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,060
they won't be fooled
by your lies anymore.

37
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,520
[KYOUKA] We're almost
at the transaction site.

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,020
Yeah. Let's get ready to go.

39
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,570
You know, we might actually be
able to save the Agency now.

40
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,150
I feel hopeful.

41
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,700
The Agency always shows its real
strength when it's together,

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,860
not when it's spread out.

43
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,500
I can't wait to be
with everybody again.

44
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,170
[KENJI]
Their ambulance is here!

45
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,670
We've been waiting
for you, Atsushi!

46
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,130
[ALL gasp]

47
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,590
Kenji!

48
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,590
Do not move!

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,140
Targets surrounded!
Capturing the suspects now!

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,060
[AKIKO] Shit. I hope this
isn't what I think it is.

51
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,650
[JUNICHIRO]
Kenji!

52
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,030
[JUNICHIRO] What the hell?
An enemy's ability?

53
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,490
The ornamentation on that saber.

54
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,780
The Hunting Dogs!

55
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,580
Everyone, run now!
The transaction was a trap!

56
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,700
Francis has sided
with the enemy!

57
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,370
Damn it.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,720
[ALCOTT] Lord Francis,
may I ask you something, please?

59
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,140
[FITZGERALD]
What is it?

60
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,350
[ALCOTT] Well, of the 78
strategy proposals I wrote,

61
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,680
74 of them involved
selling the location

62
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,690
of the Detective Agency
members to the government.

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,980
It seems to me like that would
be a good opportunity for us--

64
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,900
a way to make up for the
Moby Dick having crashed.

65
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,110
So my question is,
why didn't you make a deal

66
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,650
with the military police?

67
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,320
[FITZGERALD]
Louisa.

68
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,620
Do you remember the time when
we were reunited on the streets?

69
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,950
[ALCOTT]
I would never forget.

70
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,500
[FITZGERALD]
Me, neither.

71
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,830
Everything I ate
tasted just like sand.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,340
Even breathing was strenuous.

73
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,260
Despair takes away
a person's ability

74
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,010
to get back up on their feet.

75
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,550
For the several months
until you came along,

76
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,930
I hadn't even thought of
rebuilding the organization.

77
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,140
But the Agency got
back up within an hour.

78
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,650
And now, they're fighting
for their lives.

79
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,520
I always side with the winners.

80
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,110
And in this fight,
the Detective Agency will win.

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,000
Therefore, I will side
with the Detective Agency.

82
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,040
[MILITARY POLICE yells]

83
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,210
Damn, the MPs are
all over the place!

84
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,210
[MILITARY POLICE A]
Squads A and B, advance!

85
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,260
Squad C, deploy thermal scopes.

86
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,800
Don't let the one with the
illusion ability escape!

87
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,640
[AKIKO]
Kenji!

88
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,810
I'm all right. This is nothing.

89
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,520
[AKIKO] A raincoat?
It's not even raining.

90
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,940
Something about this
suddenly feels off.

91
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,280
Kenji!

92
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,160
[screams]

93
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,000
Kenji!

94
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,710
I can't get the sword out!

95
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,170
[HIROTSU]
Move!

96
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,510
[yells]

97
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,600
[HIROTSU]
Listen up, everyone!

98
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,190
We're heading to a secret
Port Mafia escape route.

99
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,400
Let's go.

100
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,310
[JOUNO]
Understood.

101
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,990
[JOUNO] The squads on the ground
have requested that we move out.

102
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,040
[chuckles] Then let's move.

103
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,680
Let me see him!
I can fix him right up.

104
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,300
[MICHIZOU] Didn't I tell you? It
was all a trap from the start.

105
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,930
You were right, and I was wrong.

106
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,150
[AKIKO]
But something still seems off.

107
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,940
[KENJI]
Yosano.

108
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,110
I can't thank you enough.
You just saved my life.

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,450
The Port Mafia's armed forces
are returning fire now.

110
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,740
But their defenses are
falling apart quickly.

111
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,660
If the five Hunting Dogs
are called in, too,

112
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,870
then the first thing they'll do
is destroy this escape route.

113
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,130
[AKIKO] No. I suspect one
of them is already here.

114
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,550
That saber--it belonged
to the Hunting Dogs.

115
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,340
I'm told that they have
uncanny physical prowess.

116
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,430
Not to mention they possess
exceptionally powerful

117
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,720
special abilities for Gifted.

118
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,060
Each one of them has
the military power

119
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,690
of a thousand special
forces soldiers.

120
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,770
A thousand?
They're a bunch of super freaks!

121
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,480
And there are five of them, too!

122
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,120
[AKIKO] Tanizaki, Kenji.
We need to talk.

123
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,530
We should split up and run.

124
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,790
Huh?

125
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,080
We can't, Yosano.
We have to stick together!

126
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,580
I know we should.

127
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,920
But right now, only one of
the Hunting Dogs is after us.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,880
If we split up, then two of
us have a chance to survive.

129
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,880
Mister Mori mentioned a hideout

130
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,590
as well as designated
vehicles for reaching it.

131
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,090
Whoever's still alive
will rendezvous there.

132
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,970
Have they been
prepared for us yet?

133
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,930
Both the hideout
and the vehicles.

134
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,980
[AKIKO]
Good. Make me a promise.

135
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,310
Whoever survives this escape

136
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,070
will put their lives on the line
to rebuild the Agency again.

137
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,940
Of course we will.

138
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,320
You have our word.

139
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,500
[HIROTSU] You're about
to enter a complex maze.

140
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,920
Follow this map meticulously
to reach your escape vehicles.

141
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,970
Please stop the ambulance!

142
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,140
[KYOUKA]
What's wrong?

143
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,480
There's fighting outside.

144
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,940
Lots of gunshots and combat
boots on the ground.

145
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,360
Also I hear familiar
footsteps from underground.

146
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,860
Wasn't there supposed to be
a secret Port Mafia passage

147
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,080
in this area somewhere?

148
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,670
Atsushi? Kyouka!

149
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,630
It's Yosano!

150
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,840
[AKIKO]
Special Ability.

151
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,850
Thou Shalt Not Die.

152
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,270
[ATSUSHI] I can't believe
Francis betrayed us.

153
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,060
[AKIKO]
The transaction was a trap.

154
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,110
I thought that you
two were both dead.

155
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,400
That you got blown up
in the explosion.

156
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,190
It couldn't be a trap.

157
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,610
Francis is arrogant, but he
looks after his employees.

158
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,280
Even if he was gonna frame the
Agency, he would only do it

159
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,910
after Margaret received
your treatment.

160
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,370
[AKIKO]
Good point.

161
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,410
So how did the military
police find out

162
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,120
where the transaction
was taking place?

163
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,500
[ATSUSHI] I think we should
get outta here now.

164
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,460
Listen, driver, we're gonna--

165
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,500
[gasps]

166
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,760
It's an ambush!
Everybody, get out!

167
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,970
[AKIKO]
It's him.

168
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,600
Go, Atsushi. I'm going to
deal with this guy by myself.

169
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,020
Don't do it.

170
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,440
The three of us together
might stand a better chance

171
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,940
of beating him than just you.

172
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,110
Winning isn't what's
important right now.

173
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,240
What's important is
protecting Margaret.

174
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,990
I already treated her.

175
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,200
Deliver her to Francis
before the military police

176
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,910
have a chance to
close the roads.

177
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,290
That's our only hope
for reviving

178
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,080
the Armed Detective Agency.

179
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,460
Believe me.

180
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,710
Get in. I'm gonna drive.

181
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,960
[AKIKO]
Don't worry about me.

182
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,800
I've never been
very good at dying.

183
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,010
Yosano. Please be careful.

184
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,560
Now then, for starters,

185
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,140
may I get a look at the face
of the person I'm fighting?

186
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:40,620
[SOLDIER] But your ability...
the truth of it...

187
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,740
...has taught me--

188
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,130
[MICHIZOU]
Stay back, you dumb shits!

189
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,930
Freaking hell,
that sword's tough.

190
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,470
[AKIKO]
What are you two doing here?

191
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,390
[MICHIZOU]
The boss's orders are absolute.

192
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,900
Old man, look out!

193
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,650
[HIROTSU] My life of evil is
little more than a clown show.

194
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,780
Thus I have no intention
of making way

195
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,660
for your pretense of justice.

196
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,540
Special Ability.
Falling Camellia.

197
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,970
Wow.

198
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,220
The escape boat is in the
underground drain ahead.

199
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,470
[gasps]

200
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,890
[HIROTSU]
Go!

201
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,690
I can't hold him off
for much longer.

202
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,480
[AKIKO]
But I can--

203
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,400
Go!

204
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,950
We gotta go!

205
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,200
Whatever happens, we can't
let his efforts go to waste!

206
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,080
[HIROTSU]
May my immortal soul

207
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,380
be as one with the Port
Mafia till the end of time.

208
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,150
[AKIKO]
The character for "true."

209
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,960
We're safe. Only the Port Mafia
can unlock this blast door.

210
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,790
I'm not so sure about that.

211
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,500
You're not, huh?

212
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,010
You seem to know an awful lot
about that Gifted we faced.

213
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,970
[AKIKO] The Hunting Dogs
are military veterans.

214
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,140
And that ability to
manipulate metal--

215
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,390
[JOUNO] Besides,
she's an angel of death.

216
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,310
The world is going to be
much better off without her.

217
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,640
[AKIKO]
If that man is a Hunting Dog,

218
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,560
it would make sense that
they knew about the name.

219
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,530
"Angel of death."

220
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,610
But that man was most
certainly dead.

221
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,080
[AKIKO]
I know better than anyone.

222
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,910
I tried so many times
to bring him back.

223
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
[MICHIZOU]
That should do it.

224
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,090
Even if the enemy uses a special
ability to open the door,

225
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,840
this proximity bomb will
blow their heads off.

226
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,220
Even a Hunting Dog
would be dead instantly.

227
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,260
[GIN] I've checked the
waterway bulkheads as well.

228
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,980
[GIN]
We're safe here.

229
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,980
[AKIKO]
You two take the boat to escape.

230
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,020
I'm gonna stick around
here a while longer.

231
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,400
[MICHIZOU]
What?

232
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,190
[AKIKO] That man is only
trying to get revenge on me.

233
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,780
I can't let any
more lives be lost

234
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,610
because of things
I've done in the past.

235
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,830
[MICHIZOU] Are you trying
to diss us or something?

236
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,330
I hope you understand that we
wouldn't be in the Port Mafia

237
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,870
if we were a couple of wimps.

238
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,590
I have a bad-ass older brother.

239
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,380
I used to hate being compared
to him all the time.

240
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,760
I turned to crime so I could
become his opposite.

241
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,800
No dice.

242
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,300
'Cause fightin' and
doin' bad shit

243
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,680
never relieved me of this
indescribable agony.

244
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,640
Then, one day,

245
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,770
I was caught breaking into the
safe of some serious crooks.

246
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,770
They told me they'd spare
my life, but in exchange,

247
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,730
I'd have to become
a grunt for them.

248
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
Work was fun, as strange
as that sounds.

249
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,280
When I was fighting
as part of something,

250
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,030
a powerful organization who
had my back and I had theirs,

251
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,700
I was neither my brother
nor his opposite,

252
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,080
but someone else entirely.

253
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,710
The boss's orders
made me who I am.

254
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,920
So if the boss's orders
wind up killing me today,

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,800
then I'd die having
no regrets whatsoever.

256
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,510
[GIN]
Tachihara.

257
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,180
[MICHIZOU]
Hm? What is it, Gin?

258
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,800
Did my story strike a chord?

259
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,390
[AKIKO]
Hey!

260
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,940
[GIN]
Run!

261
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,860
I can't control it!
I can't control the sword!

262
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,360
[AKIKO gasps]

263
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,660
[AKIKO]
Impossible.

264
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,710
The door was never opened
and the bomb never went off.

265
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,540
How then?

266
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,050
You finally became
someone you liked

267
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,140
when you joined an organization.

268
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,430
Well... I understand you.

269
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,890
Come on! You wretched
ghost of the past.

270
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,230
I, Akiko Yosano,

271
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,070
will make you regret
coming back to life!

272
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,440
[FYODOR]
Do you know who the fifth member

273
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,280
of the Hunting Dogs is?

274
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,570
That question certainly
came outta nowhere.

275
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,280
My answer is no.

276
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,910
I couldn't find anything about
him, no matter how hard I tried.

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,370
[FYODOR] The fifth member
of the Hunting Dogs,

278
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,130
master of metals and
executioner of the shadows,

279
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,510
is a man who has an old
and fateful connection

280
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,590
with the Armed Detective Agency.

281
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,840
How many of the Agency
members do you think

282
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,470
will survive against him?

283
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,530
[AKIKO]
Did he just stop the bullets?

284
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,080
His ability to control metals
is way more powerful

285
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,620
than it used to be.

286
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,500
Whether it's a gun or a sword,
all weapons are his to control.

287
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,130
I have no way of attacking him.

288
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,210
[rumbling]

289
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,680
[AKIKO screams]

290
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,150
[AKIKO chuckles]

291
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,400
[AKIKO]
Today's a good day.

292
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,120
President and Rampo both forgave
me despite knowing my sins.

293
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,120
I was the one who
couldn't forgive myself.

294
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,620
But today, you came to
take revenge on me.

295
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,590
And thanks to you,
I'm no longer lonely!

296
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,680
That won't work!

297
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,310
[AKIKO yells]

298
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,650
[AKIKO] I get the feeling that
you can't stop an explosion

299
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,860
with your ability, can you?

300
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,190
I'm gonna save the Agency!

301
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,610
And accept my punishment
at the same time!

302
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,250
Huh?

303
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,130
What in the world?
It's not a bomb!

304
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,510
[AKIKO]
A metal mannequin?

305
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,300
Was the enemy never even here?

306
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,470
No. He couldn't have
fought that way.

307
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,850
Not without seeing me.

308
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,480
So the enemy's been watching
from close by the whole time.

309
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,520
Hold on a second.

310
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,270
I remember this mannequin
from somewhere.

311
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,280
It's the one I saw
in the window.

312
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,940
[thud]

313
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,740
[screams]

314
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,840
[JOUNO]
Excellent work.

315
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,850
[AKIKO]
Hunting Dogs!

316
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,060
[AKIKO]
Suddenly, I understand.

317
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,350
Now I know how they were able
to follow me so accurately

318
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,980
through the underground
Port Mafia maze.

319
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,070
And how the enemy passed
through the door.

320
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,820
And why the bomb was fake.

321
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,660
There can be only
one possible answer.

322
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,710
As a former medic
in the Gifted War,

323
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,130
who knew better than you that
your superior, Ougai Mori,

324
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,540
was a dangerous man?

325
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,750
I never would've expected
that the undercover agent

326
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,630
we sent to watch over him

327
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,050
would prove to be
so useful to us.

328
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,510
You know, when you
told me earlier

329
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,600
that you had to work as a grunt
for some serious crooks,

330
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,350
I guess I just simply assumed
that the powerful organization

331
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,690
you were talking about
was the Port Mafia.

332
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,810
[MICHIZOU]
No.

333
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,400
I am the fifth Hunting Dog.

334
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,030
Undercover agent
Michizou Tachihara.

335
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,330
And the soldier you
killed 14 years ago

336
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,660
was my older brother.

337
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,700
[gasps]

338
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,080
That was your older brother?

339
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,880
You see, if it weren't for you,

340
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,250
I never would've had the chance

341
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,630
to see my little brother
or my parents ever again.

342
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,590
[MICHIZOU] When Sakaguchi,
the previous agent, left,

343
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,010
the military police decided
to send another agent

344
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,430
into the Port Mafia.

345
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,810
But I asked for this
assignment specifically.

346
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,430
I was sure that I could
get close to you

347
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,060
if I became a member
of the Port Mafia.

348
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,900
Revenge for your brother.

349
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:02,030
I see. Today truly
is a good day.

350
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,700
Do to me as you wish.

351
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,460
