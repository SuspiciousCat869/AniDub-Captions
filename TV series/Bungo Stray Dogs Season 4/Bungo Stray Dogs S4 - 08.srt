Hypersonic countermeasures?

00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,850
But how? I didn't
hear any gunfire.

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,520
[CHUUYA] You've fucked up,
Detective Agency!

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,570
I'm here to save your asses
on the boss's orders.

00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,240
Okay, time for a gunfight!

Gravity manipulation!

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,540
Grab on to it!

9
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,670
It's impossible.

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,220
When did he become a Detective
Agency collaborator?

11
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,570
To think that one day we'd
be saved by the Port Mafia.

12
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,940
[CHUUYA]
Saved? Idiot.

13
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,440
The only thing that
happened was your boss

14
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,360
made a deal with my boss.

15
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,700
The price for your rescue

16
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,910
is the transfer of an Agency
member to the Mafia.

17
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,290
We've always got room for Gifted
criminals with useful abilities.

[DOPPO]
The president did that?

19
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,330
He couldn't. Could he?

20
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,750
But if not, we all
would've gotten arrested.

21
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,540
And Yosano would've been killed.

22
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,960
[DOPPO]
You're correct.

23
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,430
The president knows that ideals
alone can't save lives.

24
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,180
We need to be
practical about this.

[ALL gasp]

[AKIKO] You think Kunikida
hit his head or something?

27
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,390
Maybe it's because his
core got all chopped up.

28
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,230
His core? Oh,
you mean his notebook.

29
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,810
[JOUNO]
You have an interesting pulse.

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,610
You're relieved right now.

31
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,570
You've lived in fear of
when that day would come.

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,940
[DOPPO]
Is he right?

33
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,660
If my colleagues die,
do my ideals die with them?

34
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,240
Am I just waiting for that day?

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,500
[TETCHOU]
Get back here.

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,590
Seriously, dude? Come on!

Shit, he's outside the chopper!

00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,200
from this small height.

47
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,620
I'll just extend my sword again
and chase the chopper.

[DOPPO]
You're the real fool here.

I won't allow anyone
to mess up my schedule!

50
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,460
[JOUNO] Your ideals are as lofty
and large as a hot-air balloon.

51
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,960
But a hot-air balloon
inevitably runs out of fuel

52
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,970
and returns to the ground.

53
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,760
My name is Doppo Kunikida.
My ideals will not fail.

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,930
I will fuel them with my life so

Just tired, that's all.

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,180
Of course you are.

59
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,560
We've been sitting
here for two days

60
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,060
without anything
to eat or drink.

61
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,060
I'm going to go look
for food and water.

62
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,690
[ATSUSHI]
I wonder if it's true.

63
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,400
I heard the inspectors
speaking about it

64
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,320
while we were hiding up there.

65
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,650
They said the president
was arrested.

66
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,570
And Kunikida blew himself
up during his escape.

67
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,030
He may not have survived.

68

[ATSUSHI]
How did everything come to this?

[KYOUKA] Survival.
That's our priority right now.

70
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,800
[CASTER]
What a terrible incident.

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,750
A government-sanctioned
detective agency

72
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,260
turning out to be a
terrorist organization.

73
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,840
It's unbelievable,

74
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,220
but there is video evidence of
the crime and many witnesses.

75
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,930
It's likely that the crimes
they've solved in the past

76
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,600
were in fact their own doing.

77
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,390
This has rocked the nation's
trust in government agencies.

[KYOUKA]
Hide your face.

00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,860
We need to secure funds
to leave the city.

80
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,940
Then we'll escape by train.

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,360
[ATSUSHI]
Escape? And then what?

82
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,030
I don't know yet.

83
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,370
The Decay of Angels
are behind all this,

84
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,910
and have an impeccable,
far-reaching plan.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,830
We don't even have a full
picture of their plot,

86
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,920
let alone any evidence to
prove they're behind it.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,920
[ATSUSHI]
She's absolutely right.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,880
If the Decay of Angels
really was behind all this,

89
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,340
then Fyodor must be involved.

90
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,260
There's no way the two
of us could take down

91
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,390
that monster alone.

[DOPPO] The tiger is strong,
but you're weak.

[ATSUSHI] The Agency has
saved me time after time.

94
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,650
But I'm not capable
of helping the Agency.

Please don't tell me that
you're giving up already.

What would Dazai do if he
were in this situation?

Wait!

101
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,170
There's one lead
that could prove

102
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,220
the Detective Agency
is innocent.

103
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,800

[ATSUSHI]
Yeah.

He warned Rampo just before
everything happened.

109
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,730
Somehow he knew about the plan.

110
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,770
He must know who the
true murderers are, too.

Maybe even how to restore
the Detective Agency

to the way it was.

[KYOUKA] But the last I heard
he'd gone missing.

114
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,120
So how are we supposed
to find him?

You think we're safe
coming here?

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,090
Francis was our enemy before.

120

He might sell us out
to the Military Police.

121

[ATSUSHI]
He's agreed to hear us out.

122

to get him to cooperate

We'll have to try
to do the same.

[ATSUSHI gasps]

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,900
I smell blood.

Are you all right?

128
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,500
[ALCOTT]
It's you.

129
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,450
I'm hurt, but it's
nothing serious.

You've got to hurry!
Go help Francis!

131

[ATSUSHI]
Stay and take care of her.

Death to my target,
for my beloved princess.

You'll pay for what
you did to her.

136
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,980
[FITZGERALD]
You're talking about Margaret.

137
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,440
How touching that you would
attempt a rescue for her.

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,570
Even though you've
lost everything.

139
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,570
But you see, the disrespect
of forgetting my face

140
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,200
is punishable by death!

He got away.

[ATSUSHI]
He's strong.

144
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,810
I see why he was the
leader of the Guild.

145
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,640
But why was an assassin here?

I hope you've been comfortable
in this Port Mafia hideout.

It ought to conceal you
from the Hunting Dogs

for at least a week or two.

Mori, sir.

Do you happen to know whether
Kunikida survived the explosion?

152
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,380
Unfortunately, the only
thing I was able to find

153
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,250
was where Dazai
had disappeared to.

154
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,710
Dazai had already been arrested
by the Hunting Dogs

prior to the hostage situation.

156
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,050
The military police transferred
him to Ministry of Justice,

157

then to Public Security.

158

His subsequent whereabouts
are currently unknown.

160
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,230
The Detective Agency
is innocent, you say?

161
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,440
[ATSUSHI]
I swear on it.

162
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,190
[FITZGERALD] What about
all that footage on TV

163
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,070
of the hostages being
murdered, then?

164
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,650
It was a complete frame-up.

165
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,530
The Decay of Angels are
the masterminds behind it.

166
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,370
Fyodor is a co-conspirator.

167
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,340
[FITZGERALD]
Even if, hypothetically,

168
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,010
you're speaking the truth,
the Detective Agency is doomed.

169
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,640
Defeating Fyodor is
utterly impossible.

170
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,930
[gasps]

171
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,060
He's in Europe being held
in a detention center.

172
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,100
The facility is called Mersault.

173
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,900
Mersault's very existence
is a national secret.

174
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,230
Its location is known only by

175
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,650
high-level European
government officials.

176
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,780
Needless to say,
it is impenetrable.

177
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,780
In fact, it's the safest
hideout in the world.

178
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,830
[FYODOR] Now, then,
it would be a little annoying

179
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,000
if Eyes of God were used
by the Detective Agency.

180
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,580
I ought to eliminate
its owner, just in case.

181
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,840
[ATSUSHI]
But if he's imprisoned,

182
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,090
he shouldn't be able to give
orders to the outside.

183
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,880
Well, he shouldn't, but that
kind of thing is his specialty.

184
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,430
[ATSUSHI]
So basically,

185
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,220
he's impossible to beat,
just as you said.

186
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,770
[FITZGERALD]
It's like a giant game of chess

187
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,730
where he's the only one allowed
to move the pieces around.

188
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,150
There's nothing to do.

189
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,820
[ATSUSHI]
Spell Bullet!

190
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,190
[ATSUSHI] He must have
left his blood behind

191
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,570
when the fountain pen hit it.

192
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,370
[FITZGERALD] I won't be able
to boost my strength in time.

193
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,240
I'm dead.

194
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,410
[FYODOR laughing]

195
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,170
And now Eyes of God are
useless to anyone but me.

196
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,420
I've devised a perfect plan.

197
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,720
But perfection is boring. Hm?

198
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,890
A new prisoner arriving?

199
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,560
[gasps]

200
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,110
[KYOUKA] I activated
the sprinkler system.

201
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,320
It was the only way
to dilute the blood.

202
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,110
[ATSUSHI]
Kyouka.

203
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,780
[FITZGERALD]
You did this?

204
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,620
Interesting. How did you
know about the blood?

205
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,910
I was under the stairwell

206
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,500
when a warning showed
up on the display.

207
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,000
[OSAMU] I've stopped your
assassination attempt,

208
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,130
Mister Demon.

209
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,880
Very well played, Dazai.

210
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,300
You let yourself be captured
in order to save the Agency.

211
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,550
The only way I can see
through your schemes

212
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,260
is by sitting here where
I can keep an eye on you.

213
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,100
[FYODOR] I'm blessed
to have a chess partner

214
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,560
in a place like this.

215
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,570
[AOKI] The Chief is expected to
awaken within the next 40 hours.

216
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,860
That is, if the procedure
is successful.

217
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,200
[YACHIYO]
Damn it.

218
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,780
Why did the chief go after
the enemy on his own?

219
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,030
This wouldn't have happened
if he followed protocol

220
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,490
and let us protect him.

221
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,210
The criminal set the conditions
for the meeting himself.

222
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,500
They were both to show
up alone, or not at all.

223
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,000
How could we fall for such
an amateur move like that?

224
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,960
[ANGO]
We needed the information.

225
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,470
The chief's Gift allows
him to learn the details

226
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,340
of any abilities
activated nearby.

227
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,470
He had stopped violent
Gifted in the past,

228
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,810
so he felt confident in his
ability to do so again.

229
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,600
Alas, the criminal
was one step ahead.

230
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,440
Please watch over the chief.
I'll give directions on-site.

231
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,150
[AOKI] Wouldn't it be best if
you stay until he awakens?

232
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,740
[ANGO] No. I was never on very
good terms with the chief.

233
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:51,580
The chief quantifies human
lives. Sacrifice 1 to save 100.

234
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,830
I couldn't stand that.

235
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,710
[TANEDA] If you discover the
Decay of Angels, kill them.

236
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,840
[ANGO]
But what of legal justice?

237
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,180
[TANEDA]
Ango.

238
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,260
What's the Special Operations
Division mission?

239
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,850
Peace.

240
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,230
It is to bless the masses with
an ignorant, peaceful existence.

241
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,480
To hell with the law when
peace is on the line.

242
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,940
And if good men have to die
for it, I'd let them die.

243
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,490
[ANGO]
I was oblivious to his intent.

244
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,070
When the said
he'd allow good men

245
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,660
to die for the sake of peace,

246
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,620
he was including
himself in that list.

247
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,290
I'll report on the case's
closure after the chief awakens.

248
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,920
And as for the murderer?
I will kill him myself.

249
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,800
Time for happy group
counseling hour!

250
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,170
[OSAMU]
Hm?

251
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,340
Hi, everybody. I'm your host,
Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

252
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,050
[OSAMU] Okay, hold up,
stop right there!

253
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,470
What's the problem?

254
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,810
Exactly. What?

255
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,310
Exactly, what, what?

256
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,480
Ohh... Life counseling.

257
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,940
[FYODOR] Thank you for
your prompt understanding.

258
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,610
Due to our high levels
of intelligence,

259
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,570
we have the unique ability
to read each other's minds.

260
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,110
Although because of that,

261
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,490
we are not able to provide life
counseling to other people.

262
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,370
Unless they have our level
of intelligence, that is.

263
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,160
Which is why this opportunity

264
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,420
will be used to discuss life's
troubles with each other.

265
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,040
[OSAMU]
Sure. You go first.

266
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,290
[FYODOR]
All right.

267
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,420
My subordinates just wait
on my instructions

268
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,010
and lack their own initiative.

269
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,090
How might I get them to
become more autonomous

270
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,890
and effective without me?

271
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,930
[OSAMU]
Just sit around all day

272
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,720
and stop giving
out instructions.

273
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,680
Some of them will realize
things have to change

274
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,810
and take it upon
themselves to act.

275
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,850
Very good advice.

276
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,270
[OSAMU]
Okay, my turn.

277
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,560
[FYODOR]
Go ahead.

278
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,440
The waitress at my favorite
cafe won't respond

279
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,360
to my romantic advances.

280
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,610
How can I get her
to accept me?

281
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,530
[FYODOR] Initiate a way
for her to lose her job

282
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,740
and trick her family
into disowning her.

283
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,910
That ought to convince her to
turn to you out of desperation.

284
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,040
How I get you.

285
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,420
[FYODOR, OSAMU laughing]

286
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,170
Now we should both try asking
a question at the same time.

287
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,050
Okay, good idea.

288
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,920
[BOTH]
Ready, set, go.

289
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,260
Tell me how you manage to
contact the outside world.

290
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,220
[FYODOR]
I figured you'd say as much.

291
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,390
[OSAMU]
Sure you did.

292
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,970
Whichever of us learns
the other's method

293
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,770
of communication first will be
able to ask our associates

294
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,770
to terminate the other's
ability to communicate.

295
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,650
In other words... victory.

296
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,980
A pity you won't see through
my method of communication.

297
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,150
Of course I will.

298
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,950
That's why I'm here.

299
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,450
[FITZGERALD]
Indeed.

300
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,530
So the evidence you need to
prove the Agency's innocence

301
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,290
lies with this What's-His-Name.

302
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,660
Was it "Mushy Pharaoh"?

303
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,580
[ATSUSHI]
It's Mushitaro.

304
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,420
The vehicle transporting him
was found on the road.

305
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,000
Without him in it.

306
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,380
All that was found inside was
an officer who was shot dead,

307
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,340
but Mushitaro's blood wasn't
discovered on the scene.

308
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,680
The enemy must have
abducted him.

309
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,890
And you need the Eyes of God
to find him, is that right?

310
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,440
It could be arranged.
Though, naturally, for a price.

311
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,860
[ATSUSHI]
What's your price?

312
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,480
[FITZGERALD]
Well, I'd like to bring Margaret

313
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,110
back to her former self.

314
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,280
[ATSUSHI]
Margaret. Oh, your employee.

315
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,200
[FITZGERALD] You see,
Margaret is currently in a coma.

316
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,450
I want the Detective Agency's
doctor woman to revive her.

317
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,910
Your price is Yosano?

318
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,660
I've come to realize Margaret
is the only person alive

319
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,290
who can kill Nathaniel.

320
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,750
You saw the attack
earlier yourself.

321
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,380
Nathaniel has become
a pawn for the Rats.

322
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,300
But he still remembers Margaret.

323
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,260
His desire to save her
has compelled him

324
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,470
to commit incomprehensible
acts of violence.

325
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,770
We'll take advantage of that.

326
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,020
[ATSUSHI] But didn't she risk
her life to protect Nathaniel?

327
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,600
Isn't that why she was
critically wounded

328
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,100
in the first place?

329
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,190
Precisely.

330
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,730
You're going to force two people

331
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,570
who tried to save each other
once to now go kill each other?

332
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,110
And what's wrong with that?

333
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,650
I had forgotten.

334
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,780
You're the man who tried
to crash the Moby Dick

335
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,080
into the city and murder
hundreds of thousands

336
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,120
of innocent people.

337
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,740
Again, I ask your point?

338
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,120
[ATSUSHI]
I think I chose the wrong person

339
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,870
to do business with.

340
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,130
Are you sure?

341
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,000
I feel like the president
would rip me apart

342
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,880
if I actually made
a deal like this.

343
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
[FITZGERALD]
Have our negotiations failed?

344
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,300
Very well.

345
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,720
But there's something that
I would like to show you

346
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,430
before you leave this place.

347
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,270
[FITZGERALD] Allow me to
introduce you. This is Margaret.

348
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,980
[ATSUSHI]
No. Awful.

349
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,030
[FITZGERALD]
During the Guild's bankruptcy,

350
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,030
she was seen and treated by
several abhorrent doctors.

351
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,410
Her symptoms only worsened.

352
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,620
She only agreed to take on

353
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,870
many of the dangerous
duties of the Guild

354
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,920
to have the resources to
rebuild her family estate.

355
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,960
At this point, that's nothing
but a vain, delusionary dream.

356
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,130
If Margaret could somehow
speak to us right now,

357
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,720
she'd beg us to terminate
her life support

358
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,390
and send the money being
spent on treatment

359
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,310
to her ancestral home instead.

360
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,440
[ATSUSHI]
All right. I'll take your deal.

361
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,200
[KYOUKA]
Are you really sure about this?

362
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,950
[ATSUSHI]
It's hopeless.

363
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,540
Whenever I see that
someone's suffering,

364
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,250
all I see is my younger self.

365
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,130
I can't just abandon them.

366
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,020
I think that philosophy
works well for you.

367
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,400
[ATSUSHI]
Let's go.

368
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,280
[ATSUSHI] I hope Yosano
and the others are safe.

369
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,150
[AKIKO]
Don't give me that bullshit!

370
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,740
I know you can help
prove our innocence.

371
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,490
You just don't want to until
we've heard your terms.

372
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,700
[OUGAI]
Correct.

373
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,830
The agreement with
President Fukuzawa

374
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,500
was that we would only help
the Agency in exchange

375
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,460
for transferring one of its
members to the Port Mafia.

376
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,670
Transfer a member of the Agency?

377
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,630
You think you're being funny?

378
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,210
You just want me
back in the Mafia!

379
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,920
Isn't that really what's
behind all this?

380
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,960
[BOTH gasp]

381
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,300
And if that's the case,
what of it?

382
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,970
President Fukuzawa
understood that

383
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,510
when he made the
agreement with me.

384
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,970
The president would never agree
to that in a million years.

385
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,430
[OUGAI]
I accept your request

386
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,520
to protect all Detective
Agency employees.

387
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,650
Though combating
the Hunting Dogs

388
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,610
will be quite the
daring endeavor,

389
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,280
even for the Port Mafia.

390
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,650
[YUKICHI]
What are your demands?

391
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,950
[OUGAI] The transfer of one
Detective Agency member

392
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,410
to the Port Mafia.

393
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,410
[YUKICHI] That will not be
an easy price for me to pay.

394
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,790
I have one condition.
That you don't request Yosano.

395
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,840
She won't tolerate being
your assistant again.

396
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,960
[OUGAI]
So you're wrong.

397
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,460
See?

398
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,760
Fukuzawa said he would be
willing to give you up.

399
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,510
[gasps]

400
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,060
[HIROTSU]
Boss.

401
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,730
Pardon the interruption,
but something came up.

402
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,150
This radio was at the entrance.

403
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,030
[FITZGERALD] Hey, how are you
doing there, old sport?

404
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,440
I don't have time,
so I'll make it quick.

405
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,200
I sent the lycanthrope
boy your way.

406
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,870
Lycanthrope? It's Atsushi!

407
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,660
He's still alive!

408
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,200
And the reason
for his appearance?

409
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,450
A transaction.

410
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,910
You use the healing
ability for me.

411
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,750
In exchange,
I provide information

412
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,210
that will lead to the
Agency's restoration.

413
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,510
Let's meet in 20 minutes.
At Goban Street.

414
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,050
Information leading to
the Agency's restoration!

415
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,470
Now we have some hope.

416
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,140
It is odd though.

417
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,850
How did Francis
discover the location

418
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,600
of this Port Mafia hideout?

419
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,810
I suppose he must have used
his Eyes of God or whatever.

420
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,060
[OUGAI]
That's the thing.

421
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,150
If he was able to
discover this hideout,

422
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,560
he might as well
have done business

423
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,690
with the military
police instead of us.

424
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,360
It would've been
more profitable

425
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,490
to do the formidable
Hunting Dogs a favor,

426
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,110
as opposed to the weakened
Detective Agency.

427
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,120
The Francis who I know

428
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,290
will always side with the
stronger, more aggressive group.

429
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,210
This transaction might
be some kind of a trap.
