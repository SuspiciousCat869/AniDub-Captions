[ACTRESS A]
It has begun.

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,140
We angels.

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,640
We, the many wingless,

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,390
fallen angels
who are desecrated,

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,190
are about to be killed
off one by one.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,650
Killed off by the true
angels in heaven.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,440
The pure, sanctified
messengers of the Almighty!

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,660
How foolish of you!

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,280
If the executioner
were an angel,

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,950
then they would have
no trouble killing us

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,370
if they chose to do so.

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,370
They'd need only
play their trumpets.

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,500
They would have no reason
to resort to physical means.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,090
This is a serial murder meant
to look like an angel's bidding,

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,460
and it will be carried
out by someone here.

[ACTOR A]
Is that not foolish in itself?

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,100
What could be the
reason any of us have

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,690
for killing one another?

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,400
What good would it do any of us
to kill our own kind like that?

23

What say you to this,

[TOKIO] Is this
the punishment given to us?

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,040
Is this what we
fallen angels deserve?

30
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,460
Just for adoring humanity?

31
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,710
Angels have been sent
from the heavens,

32
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,170
and they have only one aim.

33
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,630
They've been sent to purge us.

34
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,220
These angels are
called "Gifted."

"Gifted"?

Hm?

Hey, what do they
mean by "Gifted"?

38
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,100
Just watch, it'll make sense.

[RAMPO]
Hey, can I ask something?

42
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,440
The people here in the audience

43
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,240
are paying good money to
watch this play, aren't they?

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,070
Why doesn't anyone get
upset at being forced

45
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,240
to sit through a show
with such an obvious ending?

He's the murderer, isn't he?

You can tell in the first
five minutes of this play.

49
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,170
Knock it off right this minute!

50
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,920
[RAMPO]
But why?

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
Why is everyone
watching this play

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,840
without complaining
about the dialogue?

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,430
It really upsets me.

I just don't get why.

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,310
There's something
everyone else gets.

There's something everyone
else gets and I just don't.

I don't get it. I'm scared.

58

It's like the world is
filled with monsters.

I don't understand.

and I'll give you the answer
that you're looking for.

70
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,510
Did your parents ever
say anything to you

71
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,970
about the special
talents you possess?

72
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,890
Special talents?

73
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,390
I only wish I had some talent,

74
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,350
then it wouldn't be so hard
for me to find work.

You're wrong.

You happen to be in possession
of a very special talent.

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,440
Huh?

78
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,820
[YUKICHI]
You were right earlier.

79
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,070
I used to carry
a sword on my waist.

80
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,410
I was known as
the Master of Swords,

81
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,950
even within the very ranks of
our country's government.

82
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,660
My sword was to bring
peace to the nation.

83
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,380
Or so I sincerely believed.

84
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,790
That's why I killed.

85
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,510
But assassination
was far too easy.

86
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,590
I only became fearful
when I noticed

87
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,220
that I was waiting
a little too eagerly

88
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,930
for my next assassination.

89
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,010
I could no longer tell
whether I was murdering

90
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,900
for my country or simply
for the moment of the kill.

91
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,110
That's when I decided I would
never wield a sword again.

92
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,150
No one else has ever learned
about my past occupation.

93
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,030
No one else even had
a clue except for you.

94
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,490
Within the first five
minutes you guessed

95
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,030
which character in
the play is the murderer.

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,080
I suspect you are the only one
who could have discovered

97
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,870
the answer as
quickly as you did.

98
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,580
I wouldn't have known either,
if I hadn't read the script.

99
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,040
Huh?

100
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,340
Have you ever had a feeling
all the people around you

101
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,670
are complete fools
compared to yourself?

102
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,380
That they're all a bunch
of idiots walking around

103
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,970
without a single clue in life?

104
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,060
All the time.

105
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,310
Then listen to me carefully
and remember this.

106
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,560
You are special, and all the
other people in the world

107
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,770
are fools compared to you.

108
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,810
And that includes me as well.

109
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,400
The reason you feel
alone in this world

110
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,770
is because you have
a special talent

111
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,610
that others only dream of.

112
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,820
Special how?

113
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,450
It's a type of ability
that needs to be controlled.

114
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,700
For years you pretended
your own talent did not exist.

115
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,160
And for years I mindlessly
wielded a sword

116
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,040
in pursuit of blood.

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,420
Understand?

118
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,290
Am I'm the only one
who's got this special talent,

119
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,210
and if so, how is
that even possible?

120
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,920
I mean, of all the
people in this city,

121
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm the only one who's special?

122
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,470
The truth is...

123
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,010
I'm waiting!

124
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,430
It's because you're Gifted.
That's what it comes down to.

125
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Huh?

126
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,020
You have talents
because you're Gifted,

127
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,230
and that makes you special.

128
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,610
Are you being serious?

129
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,780
Your special ability
is one that allows you

130
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,490
to determine the truth
at a single glance.

131
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,120
I want you to know
there are numerous people

132
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,910
with special gifts
in this world.

133
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,830
It's because of
your special ability

134
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,620
that the people around you

135
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,080
at times appear
like monsters to you.

136
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,290
That will stop once you learn

137
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,800
how to get your ability
under control.

138
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,670
I'll teach you everything
you need to know to do that.

139
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,760
With the help of
a certain individual,

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,800
you'll become able to produce
your special ability on command.

141
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,220
Interesting.

[YUKICHI]
Here.

143
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,390
I don't need glasses.

144
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,560
[YUKICHI]
These are special.

145
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,400
These glasses were
handed down to me

146
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,150
by a noble man from Kyoto.

147
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,530
When you put them on,
your ability will be activated.

148
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,860
And the truth of any situation
will come to you instantly.

149
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,450
And when you take
these glasses off,

150
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,250
you will no longer be bothered
by the foolishness of others.

151
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,670
From now on, these are yours.

152
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,170
If you ask me,

153
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,960
they just look like a really
cheap pair of ordinary glasses.

154
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,300
[YUKICHI]
Correct.

155
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,930
I was forced to buy them
at a trinket shop. But...

156
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,680
I don't see a difference
wearing them.

157
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,100
[yells]

158
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,980
Now, use those glasses
to control your special ability.

159
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,520
Control my special ability?

160
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,940
Yes. Cut open the truth
with your special ability.

161
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,570
And banish evil from the
darkness in which it lurks,

162
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,070
Gifted detective!

163
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
From this moment on, you are
the world's greatest detective.

164
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,870
Greatest detective?

165
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,960
[YUKICHI] Hasn't everything
become clear to you now?

166
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,670
The world is no longer
terrifying to you at all.

167
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,380
No one seems like
a monster to you anymore.

168
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,800
Instead they simply seem far
more foolish than you are.

169
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,300
Really, from now on?

170
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,180
You no longer feel like anyone
bears ill will toward you.

171
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,930
They're just a bunch
of stupid idiots,

172
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,060
mere children who don't know

173
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,430
how to see the world
like you do.

174
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,810
Mere children?

175
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,850
You mean everyone around me
is just a stupid idiot?

176
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
That's right.

177
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,310
Just ignorant?

178
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,190
So they actually don't
know anything at all?

179
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,530
Yes, that's right.

180
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,360
But then...

181
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,860
Rampo Edogawa!

182
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,320
[gasps]

183
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,410
The glasses have already
accepted you as their master.

184
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,450
All that's left is for you to
open your mind to the world.

185
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,160
Open my mind to the world...

186
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,710
You mean this creepy
world we're living in?

187
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:44,710
That time, that time,
that time, and that time.

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,130
All that suffering
I went through

189
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,130
wasn't because there's
something wrong with me,

190
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,050
but instead, it was because
there was something wrong

191
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,430
with all the people around me?

192
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,600
[RAMPO]
Is that what that means?

193
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,310
They are all nothing more
than clueless children.

194
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,440
Would a helpless newborn
baby have the knowledge

195
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,440
to despise someone?

196
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,030
[RAMPO]
He's right.

197
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,990
[RAMPO gasps]

198
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,290
No one ever really
despised me at all.

199
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,460
It was all in my head.

200
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,750
[chuckles]

201
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,550
[RAMPO laughing]

202
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,880
Wait!

203
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,100
[RAMPO] I see now! You're all
just a bunch of babies!

204
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,470
The world isn't really
a creepy place at all!

205
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,100
You're all just
stupid little idiots

206
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,560
who don't know any better!

207
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,270
And it's my new job to protect
all of you from now on!

208
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,570
Come with me, Rampo.

209
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,770
Hold on, there's something
I have to do first.

210
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,650
Why don't you head on
back to your seat?

211
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,820
We still might be able to stop
the murder before it happens.

212
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,320
[YUKICHI]
What?

213
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,240
[RAMPO] The murderer will follow
through with their threat

214
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,910
and commit the attack
in the second act.

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,160
We just have to take
advantage of that fact.

216
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,790
What are you going on about?

217
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,250
[RAMPO] I already see
the whole thing playing out.

218
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,250
The enemy's goals, their plans,
everything they're going to try.

219
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,840
So what I want from you is to
keep an eye on the audience

220
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,590
while I work the case outside.

221
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,220
I can do that.

222
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,100
But promise me
that you'll be careful.

223
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,430
Don't worry about me!

224
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,730
After all, you said it yourself,

225
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,730
I'm the world's
greatest detective.

226
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,860
And I am on a mission to protect
all of the world's idiots!

227
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,660
[TOKIO]
Forgive us, haloed angel of war.

228
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,660
Or show yourself here
in the human realm!

229
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,080
I do not fear you, nor do I
fear the death you bring!

230
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,840
If you must cast judgment,
first pierce my chest.

231
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,050
I know what you want.

232
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,550
You want me to
watch as my friends

233
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,260
spite one another with the
foulness common to humanity,

234
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,760
isn't that what you're after?

235
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,220
But I shall expose you!
And your sin!

236
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,730
[groans]

237
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,690
[ALL gasp]

238
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,660
So real.

239
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,530
[YUKICHI] It doesn't happen
like that in the script.

240
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,250
[MAN A]
Is he--?

241
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,000
[YUKICHI]
Real blood.

242
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,540
Call an ambulance!
Inform the police what happened

243
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,460
and lock the theater
down immediately!

244
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,050
--[WOMAN A] What's going on?
--[MAN A] What?

245
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,720
[YUKICHI] Is he dead?
But where's the weapon?

246
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,600
No weapon.

247
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,140
This can't be.
A murder by an angel?

248
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,180
That's impossible!

249
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,940
[ACTRESS B]
No! Takio! Takio!

250
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,940
He's actually dead!

251
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,650
[MAN E]
It's a real murder!

252
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,990
[YUKICHI]
Stay in your seats!

253
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,490
If you any of you
attempt to flee,

254
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,370
you could become
a suspect for murder.

255
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,910
So what I want from you

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,330
is to keep an eye
on the audience

257
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,170
while I work the case outside.

258
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,750
[YUKICHI] So the one who tries
to flee is the murderer.

259
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,220
[YUKICHI] Where has
Rampo disappeared to?

260
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,430
[MITAMURA] Captain, a member of
the audience has disappeared.

261
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,890
[YUKICHI]
What?

262
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,600
[YUKICHI]
Pardon me.

263
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,150
[MITAMURA] Hello, sir.
I didn't know you were here.

264
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,650
Thank you for your service.

265
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,610
[YUKICHI] I overheard that
someone fled from the audience.

266
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,030
[MITAMURA]
Yes.

267
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,570
I'm sure that we handled
the lockdown of the theater

268
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,410
according to official procedure.

269
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,870
But it seems someone's vanished.

270
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,330
Right.

271
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,660
What's their description,
and which seat were they in?

272
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,330
He was seated in the front row.

273
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,710
Wearing a light brown suit
and a fedora hat.

274
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,920
A dignified-looking,
middle-aged man.

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,380
And someone mentioned
that they noticed him

276
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,460
holding a wooden cane.

277
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,460
[gasps]

278
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,920
[YUKICHI]
That's the man I saw.

279
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,630
Did anyone notice the time
that the man left his seat?

280
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,130
[MITAMURA] We have confirmation
that he was there

281
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,970
when the performance
began, but that's all.

282
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,970
[YUKICHI] I'm going to search
the entire building.

283
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,350
[MITAMURA]
W-Wait! Let us help you!

284
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,730
[YUKICHI] This is my fault.
I instigated this.

285
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,520
Rampo's just a boy.

286
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,400
He doesn't know how
to protect himself.

287
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,570
He may be a brilliant detective,
even at this level,

288
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,410
but if the murderer
attacks him in a frenzy,

289
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,950
he doesn't stand a chance.

290
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,120
He can't activate
his ability on his own.

291
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,210
I need to become his shield
and fend off evil.

292
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,000
So he's safe to engage
his powers of reasoning.

293
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,590
[YUKICHI]
A detective must be armed.

294
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,800
[MANAGER]
Mister Fukuzawa.

295
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,470
[YUKICHI]
Hm?

296
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,690
[YUKICHI]
Sorry, but please make it quick.

297
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,190
I have a message for you
from that boy Rampo.

298
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,480
What is it?

299
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,860
Rampo said there
were two murderers.

300
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,320
He said you would know
exactly what that means.

301
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,820
The fact is, this crime involves
two completely different acts.

302
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,080
You could think of it like
a sea bream and a shrimp.

303
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,620
You could be satisfied
with the shrimp,

304
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,120
which is much easier to
catch than a sea bream.

305
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
After all,
shrimp's pretty tasty.

306
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,920
But if you wanna
catch sea bream,

307
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,170
well then, you're going to
have to use the tasty shrimp

308
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,880
you just caught as bait.

309
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,420
[YUKICHI]
That's so convoluted.

310
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,090
Do you know where
Rampo is right now?

311
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,380
No clue.

312
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,850
I supposed he could be
anywhere in the building.

313
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,260
[YUKICHI]
Hmm.

314
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,930
Why talk to me when Murakami's
already been murdered?

315
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,430
Because Rampo told me the truth

316
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,440
about the special abilities
you unlocked within him.

317
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,860
Tell me, sir.
Who is that kid, anyway?

318
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,530
I have no doubt that the boy
may be an excellent a detective,

319
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,280
but is he really "Gifted"
the way he says he is?

320
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,200
Are his powers all that
unique and special?

321
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,910
Why do you want to know?

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,370
[MANAGER]
He told me he's the only one

323
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,960
who sees the whole picture.

324
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,170
He told me, "I'm going to
solve the whole thing,

325
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,000
so get your butt to a seat."

326
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,710
Just like that!

327
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,760
[RAMPO laughs]

328
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,430
[RAMPO] I am the
deus ex machina in this play!

329
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,730
And I'm here to solve the case

330
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,770
at the very end
of the second act!

331
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,980
I'll make it simpler for
all your little brains.

332
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm gifted and
a brilliant detective.

333
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,820
Anyway, let's get to the part
where it's all solved.

334
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,650
I was listening when
all of you were murmuring

335
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,660
about the murder.

336
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,620
It seems a lot of you
suspect that the angel

337
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,000
really did kill off
our leading man.

338
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,580
Just so you know...

339
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,540
...angels do exist.

340
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,040
It's you.

341
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,920
You, the audience,
are in fact the angels.

342
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,420
This murder and this play

343
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,840
are deeply connected
with each other.

344
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,680
What this play is all about
is a turning of the tides.

345
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,100
The tables turn between
the angels and humans.

346
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,770
And the executioners
are the ones executed.

347
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,270
There's an empty
seat right there.

348
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,150
The municipal police think
that the gentleman

349
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,610
who vanished from
that seat is the culprit.

350
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,780
However, this story
is about a reversal.

351
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,530
The power dynamic shifts,

352
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,620
and the victim and the attacker
swap seats with each other.

353
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,080
So the man who left his seat
wasn't the attacker.

354
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,080
He was actually the victim.

355
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,710
And the victim
has been here all along.

356
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,040
But not in the empty seat.

357
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,090
[RAMPO]
It's the turning of the tide.

358
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,340
[AUDIENCE gasps]

359
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,270
[RAMPO] And thus the attacker
has become the victim.

360
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,190
Now, police officers,
it's your turn.

361
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,860
Relax, he's just unconscious.

362
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
You don't have to be
in such a hurry.

363
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,450
Because... here's the real
elephant in the room.

364
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,410
Who is that man
from the empty seat,

365
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,290
and what reason did someone
have to abduct him?

366
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,830
Who should we ask?

367
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,790
If we knew who the attacker was,
we could obviously ask him.

368
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,000
But that's not going to help us.

369
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,210
There was never
a murder to begin with.

370
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,800
It's time to show yourself,
fallen one!

371
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,170
Emerge if you dare!

372
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,760
What?

373
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,930
When did you realize my plan?

374
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,270
[RAMPO]
From the beginning.

375
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,270
When I first met you
in the green room,

376
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,690
you looked pale to me,

377
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,570
and you couldn't stop
chugging down a ton of water.

378
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,780
That was because you had just
had quite a lot of blood drawn.

379
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,400
You had to use
your own fresh blood

380
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,070
to throw off
the security police,

381
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,490
the municipal police,
and the forensic experts.

382
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,870
To hide your own pulse,

383
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,210
you used that silicon rubber
stuff you use for plays.

384
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,250
[RAMPO] You needed the
playwright's cooperation

385
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,420
to pull off this trick,

386
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,630
otherwise someone was
bound to catch on.

387
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,840
The playwright's
your accomplice, right?

388
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,010
[TOKIO]
That's right.

389
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,260
The playwright and I
planned it together.

390
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,310
We didn't imagine a Gifted
would be in the audience,

391
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,350
especially not a detective.

392
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,430
[RAMPO] Not just any detective,
the best detective.

393
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,190
I am just...

394
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,900
Just an actor on a stage.

395
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,480
I become something
that I am not,

396
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,320
and build a life on stage
that doesn't exist in reality,

397
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,820
all to carry out my job
as an artist of exposing

398
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,660
what humanity truly
is to an audience.

399
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,910
There's something unavoidable

400
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,410
when you're trying to
dramatize a way of life.

401
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,120
And that's death.

402
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,500
My ultimate task was
to play a real death.

403
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,380
To me, it means reaching
the pinnacle for an actor.

404
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,960
Something no actor before
has ever achieved.

405
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,680
I am the first ever actor to
play death this realistically.

406
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,010
My goal was to treat
this audience here

407
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,060
to something they've
never seen before.

408
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,560
I have zero regrets.

409
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,860
This is how I've chosen
to live my life.

410
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,070
[RAMPO]
I think you're amazing.

411
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,780
Not many actors could've
done what you just did.

412
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,450
But there's more to it.

413
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,410
Take a good look
at your audience.

414
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,580
Look at their faces.

415
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,160
Every single person here
in this theater today

416
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,290
has two things in common.

417
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:29,420
One is that they all came here
specifically to see your play.

418
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,880
And the second, is that they
feel they've witnessed

419
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,670
a person's actual
death up close.

420
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,180
I'm not really sure,

421
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,930
but does forcing an audience
to express so much terror...

422
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,350
[gasps]

423
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,270
...really count as you finally
reaching the pinnacle

424
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,640
of the acting profession?

425
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,360
[TOKIO]
I see.

426
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:01,950
I was doing all this not for
the audience, but for myself.

427
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,170
[YUKICHI]
Rampo.

428
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,550
[RAMPO]
These glasses are awesome!

429
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,170
Thanks for giving them to me!

430
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,300
Yeah, well,
about those glasses--

431
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,470
With these glasses,

432
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,060
combined with all
my special abilities,

433
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,810
I'm going to be unstoppable
as a detective!

434
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,310
[MITAMURA]
Thank you, sirs! Exemplary work!

435
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,640
[RAMPO]
Hm?

436
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,150
Ever since I saw you today,
security policeman,

437
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,480
I was convinced right away

438
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,650
that you would solve
the case eventually.

439
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,490
However, I never
would've thought

440
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,780
that you'd have such a
secret weapon by your side.

441
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,370
[YUKICHI]
Yeah, well, about that.

442
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,870
It would be a real thrill to me

443
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,370
and the rest of
the municipal police

444
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,330
to have you explain
the resolution of the case

445
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,830
down at our station.

446
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,160
[RAMPO] Sure, but could you
write it on my work permit?

447
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,380
"It's all thanks to
my special abilities!

448
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,090
Without them we never
would've solved the case

449
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,130
by our stupid selves!"

450
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:54,880
[YUKICHI sighs]

451
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,170
You mean you're Gifted?

452
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,340
Just like they talked
about in the play?

453
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,970
Amazing! Our young
detective is Gifted?

454
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,850
[RAMPO]
You bet your baby brain!

455
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,890
I'm the best Gifted
crime-solver ever.

456
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,520
Detective Rampo Edogawa,
at your service!

457
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,730
Just hold on a second!

458
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,310
I'll come down
to the station shortly

459
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,110
and handle the police
debriefing myself, Mitamura.

460
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,150
Rampo is exhausted from
his Gifted detective work.

461
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,240
Huh? What are you
talking about? I'm fine.

462
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,400
The way you solved this case

463
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,110
was through simple
detection of the truth

464
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,780
through observation
and deduction.

465
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,870
You never used any
Gifted special ability.

466
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,370
That's obviously bogus.
You're the one who went on about

467
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,290
how I was Gifted
in the first place.

468
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,620
I'm taking it back.

469
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,210
Right... Come on, do you
seriously think I could've

470
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,550
instantly seen through
the case if I wasn't Gifted?

471
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,010
I don't think it could
have been possible!

472
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,470
[RAMPO laughs]

473
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,800
If the police are
sucking up to me,

474
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,220
I know I must be
Gifted for real!

475
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,020
The ability to solve crimes
so thoroughly in an instant

476
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
is a godly power that
can threaten the jobs

477
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,520
of policemen everywhere!

478
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
[MITAMURA]
Sir!

479
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,060
Hey, when we ride
in the police car,

480
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,610
can we put the siren on?

481
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,230
It seems like you still have
a lot of cleaning up to do here,

482
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,490
so I'll see you at
the police station later.

483
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,490
[YUKICHI]
All right, fine.

484
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm going to discuss the cleanup
tasks with the manager.

485
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,660
I'll see you at the station.

486
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,000
Mitamura, take care of Rampo.

487
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,710
[MITAMURA]
Understood, sir! Let's go.

488
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,260
[RAMPO]
Mister Fukuzawa!

489
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,470
[YUKICHI]
Hm?

490
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,220
I will see you later
for sure! Yes, yes, yes!

491
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,270
[RAMPO laughing]

492
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,310
He called me mister. Huh.

493
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,110
[YUKICHI]
Do you have a moment?

494
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,110
[MANAGER]
Of course, sir.

495
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,230
[YUKICHI]
May I ask you something?

496
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,490
Who was the man that was
tied up and unconscious?

497
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,650
From the empty seat.

498
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,610
[TOKIO]
Oh.

499
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,320
If I can believe
what I was told,

500
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,830
then that gentleman was
the other aim of this project.

501
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,200
You were told by who?

502
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,910
I planned this project
with the playwright, Kurahashi,

503
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,460
but I realized that he seemed
to have his own ideas

504
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,090
about how this endeavor
would play out.

505
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,760
I was told the gentleman in the
suit rarely appears in public.

506
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,220
Apparently, capturing him was
one of the project's objectives.

507
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,260
[gasps]

508
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,810
[DETECTIVE]
Mister Fukuzawa, sir!

509
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,310
Excuse me. Has the victim
been here the whole time?

510
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,430
[YUKICHI]
What's wrong?

511
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,890
The playwright has been found.

512
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,480
He's been murdered
in his own home!

513
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,480
What? When?

514
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,020
Oh, no!

515
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,320
[DETECTIVE] There doesn't
seem to be any sign

516
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,110
of a struggle at the scene.

517
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,780
He was impaled from behind
in his own locked room.

518
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,240
Just like the play he wrote.

519
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,370
[MANAGER]
Uh! A murder in a locked room?

520
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,370
There's much more to this
than meets the eye.

521
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,460
[RAMPO]
Hey, officer, are we there yet?

522
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,800
Very soon, sir.

523
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,470
[RAMPO]
Hmm?
