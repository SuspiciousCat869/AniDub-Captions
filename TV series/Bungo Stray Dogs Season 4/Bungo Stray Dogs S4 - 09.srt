1
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,020
A transaction. You use
the healing ability for me.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,730
In exchange,
I provide information

3
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,480
that will lead to the
Agency's restoration.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,480
Let's meet in 20 minutes.
At Goban Street.

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,070
Information leading to
the Agency's restoration!

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,530
Now we have some hope.

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,200
It is odd, though.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,910
How did Francis
discover the location

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,490
of this Port Mafia hideout?

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,620
I suppose he must have used
his Eyes of God or whatever.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,910
[OUGAI]
That's the thing.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,000
If he was able to
discover this hideout,

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,410
he might as well
have done business

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,420
with the military police
instead of us.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,040
It would have been
more profitable

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,170
to do the formidable
Hunting Dogs a favor,

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,720
as opposed to the weakened
Detective Agency.

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,680
The Francis who I know
will always side

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,720
with the stronger,
more aggressive group.

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,480
This transaction might
be some kind of a trap.

21
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,580
[JUNICHIRO]
Yosano, where are you going?

22
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,000
To complete that transaction?

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,250
You think it might
be a trap, right?

24
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,800
Is that the reason you
won't join the Port Mafia?

25
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,840
[AKIKO]
Don't give me that bullshit!

26
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,470
I know you can help
prove our innocence.

27
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,260
You just don't want to
until we've heard your terms.

28
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,430
[OUGAI]
Correct.

29
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,600
The agreement with
President Fukuzawa

30
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,230
was that we would only help
the Agency in exchange

31
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,150
for transferring one of its
members to the Port Mafia.

32
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,440
Transfer a member of the Agency?

33
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,360
You think you're being funny?

34
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,990
You just want me
back in the Mafia!

35
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,740
Isn't that really what's
behind all this?

36
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,620
[JUNICHIRO] I can go.
I'll join the Mafia instead.

37
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,330
My ability of Light Snow
ought to be useful enough

38
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,920
to satisfy them.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,210
But please tell me
what's going on.

40
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,460
What happened between you
and the Mafia boss?

41
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,260
Does it have to do with
the "Angel of Death"

42
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,930
that the Hunting Dogs
were talking about?

43
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,680
[AKIKO sighs]

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,850
All right then. I guess you
two deserve an explanation.

45
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,560
Fine. I'll tell you as we walk.

46
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,190
[AKIKO] A long time ago,
the boss and Mister Mori

47
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,990
were close allies in the
three-party framework.

48
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,530
As you know, they
wound up as enemies.

49
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,200
Why do you think that is?

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,500
Well, come to think of it--

51
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,340
[AKIKO]
It's because of me.

52
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,800
[AKIKO] The island Tokoyamijima
appeared out of nowhere

53
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,430
in the Pacific.

54
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,270
An unclaimed island where
it was only ever night

55
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,890
became the main battleground
at the end of the Great War.

56
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,020
Electromagnetic waves
from the aurora

57
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,940
destroyed electronic equipment,

58
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,610
resulting in pre-modern
close-quarters combat.

59
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,030
[SOLDIERs groaning]

60
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,040
[NURSE] Stay still. I have
your medicine right here.

61
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,370
I'm gonna wrap your bandage.

62
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,540
[AKIKO] Don't just lie there,
you lousy soldiers!

63
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,670
Special ability.
Thou Shalt Not Die.

64
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,600
[SOLDIER B] I can see!
Ah! My eyes are working!

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,940
It doesn't hurt!
I'm completely healed!

66
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,650
My leg. I have my leg again!

67
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,570
You get hurt
because you're weak.

68
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,940
Now stop loafing and get
back to the damn front!

69
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,330
[SOLDIERS gasping, laughing]

70
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,210
[SOLDIER D]
Amazing! It's a miracle.

71
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,290
[SOLDIER E]
You are our god!

72
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,670
[SOLDIER F]
Our savior!

73
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,630
[SOLDIER G] Let us use your
likeness as our emblem!

74
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,920
[SOLDIER H]
Please! Let us worship you!

75
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,380
[AKIKO]
Go away! Piss off!

76
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,590
[SOLDIER A gasps]

77
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,350
Are you that enamored
with my Yosano

78
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,890
that you're willing to
lose your life over her?

79
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,020
[SOLDIER C]
Ch-Chief Mori, we would never

80
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,560
disrespect her like that.

81
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,810
[SOLDIER B]
Oh, shit. He's gonna kill us!

82
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,770
[SOLDIER A] Oh, he's going
to pickle our organs.

83
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,820
Since when am I <i>your</i> Yosano?

84
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,320
Did you buy me at an auction
I wasn't aware of, Chief Mori?

85
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,820
How'd you like your
ears bitten off?

86
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,450
I'm your superior
officer, am I not?

87
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,620
I have the right to correct
your attitude and language

88
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,620
whenever I feel they
need correcting.

89
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,200
[AKIKO] I don't care
about military policy.

90
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,540
I was working at a candy
shop until last week,

91
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,750
when you dragged me out
here against my will.

92
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,800
[OUGAI] She's so strong
willed. I love it!

93
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,260
[SOLDIERS yelp]

94
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,140
[AKIKO]
Huh?

95
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,770
[AKIKO] Reading a novel?
After you nearly died?

96
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,150
No, it's not a novel.
It's a collection of poems.

97
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,780
Huh? Unbelievable.

98
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,120
I'm not telling you to thank me
with tears of joy or anything,

99
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,950
but don't you have any intention
of hurrying back to the front?

100
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,410
You know, now that
you're all better?

101
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,870
I want to thank you, for sure.

102
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,340
Which is why I'd like to
present you with this gift.

103
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,840
Hm? Is that one
of my butterflies?

104
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,430
[AKIKO]
No. It's... metal.

105
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,970
Thank you so much, my angel.

106
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,310
[AKIKO gasps]

107
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,480
A-Angel?

108
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,520
[OUGAI chuckles]

109
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,820
But how? How did you
do that just now?

110
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,820
Was that your special ability?

111
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,280
It's nothing that's
gonna change the world.

112
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,530
Certainly not in the way

113
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,950
that your ability is going
to impact people.

114
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,910
I'm going to change the world?
Your head must still be injured.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,250
There are some things you notice

116
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,630
when you're nothing
but a private.

117
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,420
The Special Ability Doctrine.

118
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,960
[AKIKO]
Hm?

119
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,300
The great powers of Europe that
first started the Gifted wars,

120
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,880
they're all changing
the very concept of war.

121
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,680
If we are to prevail as victors,

122
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,180
we must prove this
to the military brass.

123
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,970
And we have to do so
as quickly as possible.

124
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,640
That's why Chief Mori
brought you into this unit.

125
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,610
That right, Chief Mori?

126
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,150
I can see that
you've been reading

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,410
my "Immortal Regiment" paper
without the proper authority.

128
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,950
[AKIKO]
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,040
[OUGAI] I was certain that was
a classified military document.

130
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,620
I don't know what the hell
you're going on about

131
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,160
with all this immortal stuff.

132
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,170
I just came here to save as
many soldiers' lives as I can!

133
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,420
[OUGAI]
Let's go, Yosano.

134
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,800
There are more patients
waiting for your ability.

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,630
Elise, the next chart, please.

136
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,510
Yes, Master Mori.

137
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,270
[SOLDIER C]
Dammit.

138
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,440
Those assholes have
set up camp so close.

139
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,230
They don't think we're a threat.

140
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,400
I hate to agree with them,
but we aren't.

141
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,980
We don't even have weapons.

142
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,240
None that will reach
that far, anyway.

143
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,150
[SOLDIER D] We're way outgunned.
And outnumbered.

144
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,070
Unless something changes.

145
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,950
Relax, we'll take them down!

146
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,490
After all, we have
an angel on our side.

147
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,450
[SOLDIER B]
You're right.

148
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,580
[SOLDIERS laughing]

149
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,870
[SOLDIER C]
That's right, she's magic!

150
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,630
[SOLDIER B]
Pretty lucky at that, huh?

151
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,540
[SOLDIER C]
Absolutely. Heh.

152
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,470
[SOLDIER]
Shit! Get down!

153
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,850
[screams]

154
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,200
Huh? I still have my right arm.

155
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,990
[AKIKO]
Are you feeling all right?

156
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,450
[SOLDIER]
Hm?

157
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,920
Just tired, and you're looking
pretty tired yourself.

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,760
Of course I look tired.

159
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,590
I treated 80 people
all at once.

160
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,430
The worst one had half his
body blown off in battle.

161
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,680
I could heal his wounds
with my ability,

162
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,100
but I couldn't heal his mind.

163
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,520
He can't even say his
own name anymore.

164
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,020
[SOLDIER]
What about everyone else?

165
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,610
[AKIKO] The ones who didn't
die went back to the front.

166
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,740
They don't have enough men.

167
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,740
[AKIKO]
"Angel," my ass.

168
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,330
I'm basically healing them
just for them to die again.

169
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,910
[SOLDIER]
You're wrong.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,710
[AKIKO]
Huh?

171
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,670
What's that?

172
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,170
Something I'm using
to keep count.

173
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,470
It's the number of times
that you've saved my life.

174
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,930
Today makes the fifth time.

175
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,970
I like to keep tally
with this character.

176
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,930
It's the character that
stands for "true."

177
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,100
Every time I count something
and finish writing "true,"

178
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,520
I get the sense something just
was created in the world.

179
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,860
This is your impact.

180
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,740
If it weren't for you, I would
never have had a chance

181
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,990
to see my brother
and my parents again.

182
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,870
I'm glad you're here.

183
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,490
[gasps]

184
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,750
Thank you.

185
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,620
Actually, I--

186
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,630
[SENIOR OFFICER A]
Private first-class!

187
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,920
The front remains dire!

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,090
If you're better,
then get out there!

189
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,010
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,310
[AKIKO] But, as if to laugh
in the face of our efforts,

191
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,690
the situation continued
to get worse and worse.

192
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,400
I was treating soldiers
once every three days.

193
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,690
All repeat customers.

194
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,610
Then it became once a day.
Soon, three times a day.

195
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,490
It was no longer appropriate
to even call it a war.

196
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,250
We were just standing
there, being brutalized.

197
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,380
A normal unit would have given
up and retreated long ago.

198
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,590
But that never happened.

199
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,800
Because I was there.

200
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,180
[SOLDIERS groaning]

201
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,930
[SOLDIER B]
I can't fight anymore.

202
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,850
[SOLDIER C]
Spare me.

203
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,010
[SOLDIER D]
No more.

204
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,810
I don't wanna go to
the front anymore.

205
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,890
[OUGAI] That's a fracture
of the right radius.

206
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,820
Please treat him.

207
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,610
Father. Mother.
I'll be home soon.

208
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,620
[AKIKO]
I don't wanna fix them.

209
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,910
So you're just going to
abandon his wounds?

210
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,700
Yeah. That's right.

211
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,160
Let him fall back and get
treatment on his own!

212
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,880
[OUGAI]
I see.

213
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,630
You want to free him
from his obligations

214
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,420
on the battlefield as a soldier.

215
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,590
Quite the conundrum.

216
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,050
As your superior officer,

217
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,890
I'm obliged to dole
out your orders,

218
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,180
but for some reason,
I have a hard time saying no

219
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,850
to a young girl's wishes.

220
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,390
Not your wishes, though. Do it.

221
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,190
[AKIKO gasps]

222
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,940
[OUGAI] You know what happened
to the samurai, don't you?

223
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,480
They failed to understand
warfare using guns and cannons

224
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,360
and they perished.

225
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,030
In the war that followed,

226
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,490
the nation which recognized
tanks as beasts

227
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
that could ravage
enemy territory

228
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,620
was able to massacre and
completely annihilate its enemy.

229
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,170
In naval battles, the nation
which failed to realize

230
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,380
airplanes would be the masters
of the sea was the one to fall.

231
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,840
And now, special abilities
are changing war once again.

232
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,260
Your role is to
make the military

233
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,510
understand this
change is needed!

234
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,260
Do it. Or else the
nation will crumble.

235
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,770
I refuse!

236
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,430
I just wanna save the lives
of the people in front of me

237
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,230
who need it!

238
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,020
[OUGAI]
Very well.

239
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,330
There. He's dying now.

240
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,120
Fix him.

241
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,250
[AKIKO] No one could leave
the battlefield after that.

242
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,630
The soldier who drew
a picture of me...

243
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,170
The soldier who pat my head,

244
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,930
saying I reminded
him of his sister...

245
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,100
The soldier who made
me delicious coffee...

246
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,890
They all died.

247
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,440
If it weren't for me, they could
have left with mere injuries.

248
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,230
Do you know the word
"annihilation"?

249
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,520
It's used when half a
fighting unit of soldiers

250
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,490
becomes incapacitated.

251
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,360
Not when half of
the unit is dead.

252
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,990
In other words,
if half of an army is hurt,

253
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,450
it retreats,
and the battle ends.

254
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,710
But as long as I was there,
there was no retreat.

255
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,170
That's why they couldn't lose.

256
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,130
To lose is a human right,

257
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,920
but I took that right
away from them.

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,010
Deprived of that opportunity,

259
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,720
there's only one place
a military can go.

260
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,470
[SOLDIER F]
Stop him!

261
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,010
[SOLDIER G]
Take his dagger!

262
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,350
[SOLDIER H] Everyone's goin'
to die because of that bitch!

263
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,850
This isn't war!
Let me go, asshole!

264
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:58,190
Let me go! Agh!
Let me go! Let me go!

265
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,240
[AKIKO] It happened on the day
a soldier I was close to

266
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,490
tried to kill me.

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,750
[AKIKO]
My hair ornament's missing.

268
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,210
I must have dropped
it somewhere.

269
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,460
I can't lose it after
he gave it to me.

270
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,630
I have to find it.

271
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,300
[SOLDIER]
Yosano.

272
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,720
Huh?

273
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,260
[SOLDIER] I'd like to ask you
to deliver a message.

274
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,300
I know that voice.

275
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,270
[SOLDIER]
I promised I'd endure.

276
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,230
But your ability,
the truth of it,

277
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:42,070
has taught me every person
in this world has their limits.

278
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,820
Remember how I
called you an angel?

279
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,240
You're so much more than that.

280
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,780
You've descended on
the battlefield...

281
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,290
...as an angel of death.

282
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,960
Please tell my family
that I said goodbye.

283
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
[bang]

284
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,470
[screams]

285
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,510
[AKIKO]
My memory after that is vague.

286
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,760
From what I've heard,
I went crazy.

287
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,140
I was arrested for setting
off a series of explosives.

288
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,020
Something about trying to
blow up an aircraft carrier.

289
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,190
[KENJI]
Hm?

290
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,400
[AKIKO]
Even after the war,

291
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,610
I was kept in isolation
and under guard

292
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,320
in a mental facility.

293
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,700
Not that I imagine I would've
left even if the door was open.

294
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,450
[JUNICHIRO] So someone must
have rescued you from there.

295
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,370
Was it the Agency?

296
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,250
[AKIKO]
If only that were the case.

297
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,880
I was rescued by the
worst person there is.

298
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,460
It was three years after
the war had ended.

299
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,720
[OUGAI]
I finally found you.

300
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,730
[OUGAI] Come with me.
I need your ability again.

301
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,200
[YUKICHI] You would willingly
drag her back into hell again?

302
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,210
Have you decided you're
now the devil, Mori?

303
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,000
[OUGAI] She is the very pillar
of the three-part framework.

304
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,750
Of the city's peace.

305
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,880
An immortal army led by
Yosano's special ability!

306
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,340
She's the key to defeating the
formidable Port Mafia boss!

307
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,350
You really think she's the key?

308
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,850
Your reasoning lacks
all sense of humanity!

309
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,310
Humanity?

310
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,020
War is a game in which the first

311
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,730
to take humanity
into account loses!

312
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,730
[YUKICHI] In that case,
our alliance ends today!

313
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,990
No, it's your life
that ends today!

314
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,620
[RAMPO]
Ah, sheesh.

315
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,210
Grown-up fights are
always so pretentious.

316
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,210
Oh, about this?

317
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,510
I'm freeing you while my boss
is fighting your old boss.

318
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,130
That's my plan anyway.

319
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,550
Take me back.

320
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,890
[RAMPO]
Huh?

321
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,350
[AKIKO] Take me back.
I can't go outside again.

322
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,140
[RAMPO]
Why not?

323
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,230
[AKIKO] My special ability
makes it too easy to save lives.

324
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,400
I make the lives of
everyone around me

325
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,860
seem like they're
cheap and valueless.

326
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,530
Take me back. I can't be
allowed to live anymore.

327
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,990
[RAMPO]
Ah... That's so stupid.

328
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,490
I don't give a crap.

329
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,620
Why don't you give up using
your special ability, then?

330
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,420
[AKIKO]
If I could do that--

331
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,290
[RAMPO]
You're saying that you can't?

332
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,300
Why not? Because you have
a crazy healing ability?

333
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,050
Because everyone tried to take
advantage of that ability?

334
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,850
That's not it!

335
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,720
My Ultra Deduction is
the best special ability.

336
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,100
None of the others
matter at all.

337
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,190
With me on your side, I can
solve any problem you have!

338
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,530
[RAMPO] If you doubt me,
I can prove it to you.

339
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,000
[AKIKO]
It's-- But how?

340
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,540
I never told anyone about
this hair ornament before!

341
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,460
[RAMPO] I found it on
an old aircraft carrier.

342
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,590
See? I know everything.

343
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,430
Try asking me a question.
I'll answer anything.

344
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,350
[AKIKO]
Then tell me.

345
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,390
What should I do
with my life now?

346
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,270
The people I cared about
died because of me.

347
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,570
That's how it's
always going to be.

348
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,190
There will always be people
who wanna exploit

349
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,900
my special abilities
against my will!

350
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,950
There isn't one single
place in this whole world

351
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,990
where I should be
allowed to live!

352
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,580
Wrong.

353
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,500
[gasps]

354
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,830
[RAMPO]
There is one.

355
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,210
Just one place in the world
that doesn't need you.

356
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,590
That one place is the
Armed Detective Agency.

357
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,880
We don't want your
special ability.

358
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,050
We want that kindness of
yours that goes with it.

359
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,560
You didn't want anyone
to die, did you?

360
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,470
That's why you're
in so much pain.

361
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,560
I invite you to join us
because you feel that way.

362
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,020
I don't care about your ability.

363
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,820
It's your kindness
that means something.

364
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,660
[JUNICHIRO]
Yosano, what's wrong?

365
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,880
[AKIKO]
Nothing.

366
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,300
It's time to go.

367
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,220
The transaction takes
place through the door.

368
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,970
I'm saving the Agency no
matter what happens to me.

369
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,310
[RAMPO]
There is one.

370
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,770
Just one place in the world
that doesn't need you.

371
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,280
[AKIKO] The Agency is the
one place in the world

372
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,200
where I can be allowed to live.
