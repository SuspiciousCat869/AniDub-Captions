00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,010
[RAMPO] A bright red envelope
is the key to the whole thing.

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,220
So the question that
it all comes back to

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,180
is where did the perpetrator

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,640
get both the envelope
and the manuscript from?

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,230
The answer is so simple.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,020
He killed and stole it
from the author himself.

7
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,370
[MINOURA] Hey, Rampo's rival,
what are you doing now?

8
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,870
I am speed reading the
manuscript, of course.

There might be something in here

that could help Rampo
solve the crime.

11
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,750
Detective Minoura,

12
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,000
what exactly is the case of
the mystery writer murder

13
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,840
that everyone seems
to be talking about?

What, you really don't know?

15
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,050
The body was discovered
by the manager of an inn.

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,640
[OWNER]
Huh?

17
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,940

[OWNER screams]

20
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,900
[MINOURA] The doll was carrying
two dismembered human ears.

21
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,780
The author wrote exceptional
detective novels.

22
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,200
He was found
murdered at the inn

23
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,780
where he had been
staying long-term

24
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,410
to finish his latest book.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,500
The biggest mystery of this case

26
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,880
is that the conditions around
the murder resembled the murder

27
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,550
depicted in the novel he
happened to be working on.

28
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,510
And now you have the entire gist
of the current infamous case:

29
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,930
The Killing of Kindaichi.

30
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,430
[POE] Blast!
I've discovered nothing new!

31
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,060
I had thought I might find out
who had stolen the manuscript

32
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,230
if I read the last
chapter, but...

33
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,650
The murderer was an old
acquaintance of the victim's,

34
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,360
motivated by years
of pent-up anger.

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,860
It's exactly as Rampo
had deduced.

36
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,030
The word "End" on the
last page is smudged.

37
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,580
Are these water droplets?

38
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,580
No! Looking at it
more carefully,

39
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,410
it's not a handwritten
manuscript,

40
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,880
it's just a copy
of the original.

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,670
Why though?

Then why were you
freaking out about it?

48
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,730
Because I don't receive

[OGURI] The evidence
destroyer and the murderer

52

are the same person?

Don't you think that sounds
like a bit of a stretch,

my detective friend?

55
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,700
It wouldn't be hard for someone
other than the murderer

56
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,750
to obtain the manuscript
themselves.

Yes, but I have evidence.

[OGURI]
Hm?

59
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,090
This is the original manuscript.

60
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,630
[OGURI] What's he doing with
the original manuscript?

61
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,920
From the look on your face,
it seems you recognize it.

62
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,720
It was folded like this
and hidden away,

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,220
but I still managed to find it.

64
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,180
It was in the observation
deck's second floor gift shop.

65
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,350
You see, I checked inside
the bright red envelope

66
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,020
as soon as I got my hands on it.

67
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,350
And for some reason, only the
last page was a photocopy.

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,900
Why? To keep the
original themselves?

69
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,320
No, sir,

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,690
because then they would've
just copied all the pages.

71
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,690
And at that point I realized,

72
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,530
maybe they had to print
it out in a hurry,

73
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,410
right before it was
supposed to be handed off.

74
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,830
So I checked out a
stationery shop nearby.

75
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,750
And just as I expected,
it was the same exact paper.

76
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,830
So the attacker had rushed

77
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,880
to swap out the original
with the copy.

78
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,340
But why do that?

79
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,250
If the content was an issue,
just throw away that page.

80
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
But they didn't do that

81
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,010
because there was
a specific reason

82
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,140
to hand over all
the original pages.

83
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,970
And then if that's the case,

84
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,180
the last page of the manuscript
wouldn't have been thrown out.

85
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,980
But they couldn't
risk being searched,

86
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,890
so they hid it somewhere.

87
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,610
And so you found
the hidden last page

88
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,230
from the original manuscript?

89

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,280

to cause me trouble,

pay me what they owe me.

[OGURI]
So dark.

161
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,800
What just happened?

162
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,590
I can't see a thing.
Agh! I can't breathe!

163
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,100
Someone's hands
are choking me!

164
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,560
No. It's--

165
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,890
How could you just kill
me the way you did?

166
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,980
[OGURI]
Yokomizo?

167
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,770
What the hell is going on?

168
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,450
This is the inn where
Yokomizo was murdered.

169
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,950
But how is this possible?

170
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,580
[OGURI]
No, why?

171
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,500
I despise you!
I despise you so much!

172
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,710
You're not him!

173
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,130
This isn't it, Yokomizo!

174
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,420
[RAMPO]
That's correct.

175
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,960
[gasps]

176
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,300
[RAMPO]
This isn't reality.

177
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,970
Reality looks like this.

178
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,220
I see now.

179
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,480
This is all the doing of one
of the Guild's Gifted.

180
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,310
We're inside Poe's novel.

181
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,020
That's correct again.

182
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,020
I sent out a message to Poe

183
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,820
instructing him to reproduce
the scene of the murder.

184
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,570
That accounts for the phone.

185
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,950
I was wondering
what that text was.

186
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,330
[RAMPO] You said earlier:
"This isn't it, Yokomizo."

187
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,700
You seem to be well-acquainted
with the victim.

188
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,160
[OGURI]
Heh.

189
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,580
Do you really think
you've caught me

190
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,500
with such a measly trap?

191
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,590
As I said before,
what you need is evidence.

192
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,710
All your suspicions and
deductions mean nothing

193
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,300
without something definite.

194
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,760
On top of that, you've
let your guard down

195
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,050
and made quite
a critical mistake.

196
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,760
A mistake?

197
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,930
It was very sloppy.

198
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,100
I read Poe's Gifted profile.

199
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,270
His special ability allows
him to trap someone

200
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,150
in his own mystery story
until the mystery is solved.

201
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,610
But this mystery is the scene
of the Killing of Kindaichi.

202
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,030
If I declare the facts
I already know.

203
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,240
I can immediately return
to my car in the real world.

204
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,240
In other words,
you can't capture me

205
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,160
in this imagined space
using Poe's ability.

206
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,710
[RAMPO]
I imagine you're right.

207
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,790
But you still won't leave here.

208
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,840
Because once you finish hearing
what I have to say to you,

209
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,300
you'll turn yourself in.

210
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,180
[RAMPO] The Killing of
Kindaichi doesn't work

211
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,220
if the author reveals
the gimmick to anyone

212
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,970
other than the murderer.

213
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,440
That means the murderer
had to have been unique.

214
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,770
Which is why, at one point,

215
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,320
I'd deduced that the motive
was a personal grudge.

216
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,320
But this is so much
worse than that.

217
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,860
To leave your escape as an
afterthought to the murder,

218
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,240
it's practically
self-destruction.

219
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,660
There are only two motivations
for driving a person

220
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,710
to self-destruction:
Insanity and duty.

221
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,410
[OGURI]
Take your pick, Yokomizo.

222
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,920
Stabbing, poisoning,
strangling, or beating.

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,460
How would you like to die?

224
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,380
[SEISHI]
Hmm. I'd have to say stabbing.

225
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,920
Poisoning would
require the reader

226
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,430
to have a knowledge of chemistry

227
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,850
and it wouldn't be fair
to assume so much.

228
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,390
[OGURI] Sometimes I think
you're a filthy little hack.

229
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,100
No one's talking about the
murder in your new novel.

230
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,810
I'm talking about killing you.

231
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,610
[SEISHI]
Oh, come on now. Stop.

232
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,150
But seriously, give me
some new murder ideas.

233
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,150
I'm not going to make
my deadline this month.

234
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,240
[OGURI]
Here we go again.

235
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,360
Mystery novels are
just insider games

236
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,740
that are bound by external
rules imposed by the author.

237
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,870
Dying messages, various
gimmicks, enclosed spaces--

238
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,910
they're completely
detached from reality.

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You want puzzles, go solve
a math equation or something.

240
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,340
Your distaste for mystery
novels hasn't changed

241
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,550
since back when we were
in school together.

242
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,880
It's all your fault that
I hate them in the first place.

243
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,220
[SEISHI] I do understand what
you're getting at, though.

244
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,680
Meta-mysteries, anti-mysteries.

245
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,640
No matter how unique
a mystery you put out

246
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,810
into the literary world,
the next moment,

247
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,060
it's just shoved into one
category or another

248
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,520
by the bookstores.

249
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,560
I believe that the
ultimate mystery novel

250
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,070
will never come to exist.

251
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,650
Nah. Anyway.

252
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,900
It's been a long time since I've
gotten to talk shop with you,

253
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,990
and I guess I couldn't help
but spill the beans.

254
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,450
[OGURI sighs]

255
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,950
You always change the subject
before a debate is over.

256
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,790
No wonder you've never
had any real friends,

257
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,210
not even way back at school.

258
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,000
[SEISHI chuckles]

259
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,380
You're one to talk

260
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,880
when you don't even have
any real friends, either.

261
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,010
[OGURI]
That's right. I killed him.

262
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,510
I choked him to death
with these two hands.

263
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,220
Bloodlust and madness
in my mind. So what now?

264
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,600
The suspect confessed
to his crime.

265
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,560
There's nothing
you can do about it.

266
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,360
Except you never killed him.

267
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,690
In the novel's final chapter,

268
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,320
the motive was described
to be a personal grudge.

269
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,780
Now that doesn't make
sense to you, does it?

270
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,200
If you were the one
who'd killed him,

271
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,160
not only would you have
copied the plot gimmick,

272
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,490
but the motive as well.

273
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,500
It's just too perfect an ending.

274
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,540
Almost like a movie script
with no loose ends,

275
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,330
The Killing of Kindaichi
was a comedy

276
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,090
that he both wrote
and starred in.

277
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,050
The fact of the matter is,
he killed himself.

278
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,430
What a stupid ending
it turned out to be.

279
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,470
But it was highly effective.

280
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,430
Even people who don't
read mystery novels

281
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,390
became obsessed with the case
and worked to solve it.

282
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,180
A one-of-a-kind mystery novel,

283
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,190
uncategorizable to any
other book in the genre.

284
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,110
That's what he accomplished.

285
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,440
A mystery that leaks
into the real world.

286
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,860
[SEISHI] I hate having
to live with regret.

287
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,990
That's why I've always insisted
on doing everything my own way.

288
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,870
So far, I'm satisfied
with all the decisions

289
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,870
I've made in my life.

290
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,160
But now, I find that
the sands of time

291
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,000
are beginning to run out for me.

292
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,420
[OGURI]
May I ask,

293
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,000
are your stomach problems
interfering in your work?

294
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,420
[SEISHI] There's a malignant
tumor in my gut.

295
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,170
I have a year at best.

296
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Before that happens,
I'm determined to complete

297
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,010
the ultimate mystery novel.

298
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,640
I've already finished
with my preparations.

299
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,480
All except the key
piece to the puzzle.

300
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,690
And what key piece is that?

301
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,020
I need a murderer.

302
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,770
It would all be for
nothing if it gets out

303
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,440
that I'd done this
myself prematurely.

304
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,820
To avoid that, I need
a real-life murderer

305
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,030
who has actual motives
and intent behind them.

306
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,200
I would like for you
to be my murderer.

307
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:40,050
[OGURI laughing]

308
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,970
You got me red handed!

309
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,090
You nailed it this
time, detective!

310
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,850
I am indeed the role of the
unhinged murderer in the novel!

311
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,260
Of course I agreed!

312
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,060
I'd get to kill the man
I truly despised!

313
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,900
On top of that, I get the money
for selling the manuscript

314
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,020
on the underground.

315
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,480
Why would I ever refuse
such a request?

316
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,740
I'm guilty of killing
a dying man!

317
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,450
There's still one question.

318
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,910
Why'd you hide the last page
of the manuscript?

319
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,120
Not only that, but some of
the words are smudged here.

320
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,710
Including the word "End,"

321
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,460
which means it was smudged after
the manuscript was completed.

322
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,420
So who made the smudges,
and when did it occur?

323
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,840
The stain happened during
the crime or right after.

324
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,800
The smudges marked the
page in reverse order

325
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,920
of their completion.

326
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,550
What I'm telling you
is the final page

327
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,010
was placed on top
of the manuscript

328
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
and not at the bottom.

329
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
When you think of it that way,

330
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,640
everything makes
a lot more sense.

331
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,480
Stop it now.

332
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,310
There was a source of water
at the scene of the crime

333
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,100
used to smudge.

334
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,980
And the reason the attacker
frantically tried

335
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,690
to replace the original
with a copy.

336
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,150
When you put it all together,

337
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,950
there can only be
one explanation.

338
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,000
[SEISHI choking]

339
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,130
[SEISHI]
Thank you, Mushitaro.

340
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,960
For taking this on.

341
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,130
You are truly my only friend.

342
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,930
Goodbye.

343
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,350
[RAMPO]
Tears.

344
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,230
[RAMPO]
The perpetrator was crying

345
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,770
as he strangled the victim.

346
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,650
So if it wasn't motivated
by a personal grudge,

347
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,490
all the assumptions about
the gimmick are reversed.

348
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,860
If the victim was an
accomplice to the crime,

349
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,280
the act of solving the
crime is pointless.

350
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,570
It isn't even a mystery,

351
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,450
let alone the ultimate
mystery novel.

352
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,790
You realized as much just before
you delivered the manuscript.

353
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,670
That's why you replaced it
with a photocopy.

354
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,170
So you could fulfill your
friend's final wish.

355
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,420
[OGURI]
You still have no proof.

356
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,840
[RAMPO]
You're right.

357
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,050
Forensics could've determined
that they were tears,

358
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,640
but they couldn't determine
whose tears they were.

359
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,020
Still, it would be enough just
to publicize the true story

360
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,180
behind this manuscript.

361
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,400
"It might've been a suicide.
It might've been a farce.

362
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,730
It might be pointless
to try to solve it."

363
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,190
As soon as the readers would
start to think that way,

364
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,860
the value of taking on the
challenge would plummet,

365
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:16,160
and your friend's final wish
would be muddied forever.

366
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,120
The Detective Agency was
once defeated by Fyodor.

367
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,710
We won't lose again.

368
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,630
I will never allow you to hurt
anyone in the Agency.

369
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,000
[OGURI]
What is this?

370
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,800
[RAMPO] To that end,
I memorized and assimilated...

371
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,590
...the very demon himself!

372
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,800
If you don't turn yourself in,

373
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,850
I'll go public
with my hypothesis.

374
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,770
This isn't detective work.

375
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,980
I'm using a demonic
mind control method.

376
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,940
Let me introduce you
to my new weapon

377
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,570
for killing detective killers!

378
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,410
[OGURI]
No. I can't allow that.

379
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,830
Please don't make it public.

380
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,340
[OGURI]
I despise Yokomizo.

381
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,710
After what I did,
I must despise him.

382
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,050
I'll turn myself in.

383
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,140
[click]

384
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,180
[MINOURA]
Yeah. I see. All right.

385
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,190
We have evidence that
the type of grenades

386
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,730
used by the Detective Agency
were stolen in transport.

387
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,610
That makes it very likely
that they were used

388
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,530
in the murder case
of that little girl.

389
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,990
I guess he finally released
his special ability.

390
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,660
Kunikida should be released
from jail immediately.

391
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,030
[POE]
Rampo.

392
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,330
[RAMPO]
Hm?

393
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,700
About the dummy corpse
thrown from the building,

394
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,500
there wasn't any
biological activity

395
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,420
detected in his facial wound.

396
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,960
[RAMPO]
Oh.

397
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,420
I bet Fyodor gave Mushitaro
that corpse to use as a decoy.

398
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,550
I highly doubt he's ever
actually killed anyone

399
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,970
other than the mystery writer.

400
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,720
[POE]
Hm?

401
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,550
Rampo?

402
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,810
[OGURI]
Hm?

403
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,310
I don't wanna bother throwing
it out. You can have it.

404
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,230
[OGURI]
What is it?

405
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,480
You're giving me an employee ID?

406
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,690
[RAMPO]
The company's a front

407
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,820
for a secret anti-government
organization.

408
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,240
An undercover agent from the
Gifted Operations Division

409
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,570
is working there

410
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,620
and is about to have their
cover blown wide open.

411
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,240
I want you to go help them.

412
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,240
But why are you
asking me to do this?

413
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,160
[RAMPO] That undercover agent
is also in charge

414
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,500
of hiring at the Division.

415
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,000
To tell you the truth,

416
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,210
I couldn't care less what
happens to the undercover agent,

417
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,510
but if they learn about
your powerful ability,

418
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,260
they'll be obliged to
hire you on the spot.

419
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,220
Go show them what you can do.

420
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,350
But tell me first:
Rampo, what are you--?

421
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,180
I promised, didn't I?

422
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,480
Said I'd hook you up with
work if you ever needed it.

423
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,070
[SEISHI] Mushi, I bet you'd
laugh at me for this.

424
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,440
For trying to master
mystery novels,

425
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,490
even if it means
sacrificing myself.

426
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,080
But when you go down that path,

427
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,870
you realize there really is
nothing that lasts forever.

428
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,120
Huh? Where did my lighter go?

429
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,790
[SEISHI] In which case,
it's up to you to choose.

430
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,630
Choose what you consider
valuable in your life.

431
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,630
After all, the greatest luxury
afforded to a human being,

432
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,390
is the right to make the
world itself their choice.

433
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,150
What the--? An accident?

434
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,570
[COP A]
Is it an accident?

435
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,490
[NIKOLAI]
No, actually, it's a murder.

436
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,780
Who's the victim?

437
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,580
You are.

[NIKOLAI laughs]

444
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,890
[NIKOLAI]
Question one, who might I be?

445
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,060
What's that?

446
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,980
I think I heard you say
my name's Nikolai.

447
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,110
That's right!

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,610
Okay, question two!
What on earth am I doing here?

449
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,950
Here's a hint,
it's cleanup duty.

Oops! Oh! I gave
away the answer!

451
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,040
What do you mean,
cleanup duty?

452
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,700
Well, my duty is to get
rid of those individuals

453
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,370
who possess way
too much information
