Huh? A security camera?

That wasn't here before.
Reality manipulation.

[RAMPO] Without a doubt.
The power of the page.

Which means...

00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,160
...the camera's footage must
show me committing the murder,

I-I know who the perpetrator is.

just the perpetrators.

It's an illusion ability.

But they can't hide
their body heat.

deploy your thermal goggles.

on the Gifted with their altered
healing and physical strength,

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,500
so you must equip yourselves
with gas grenades.

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,710
What's the risk of

Military encryption devices
have been issued.

as members of the good guys.

the military's
counterterrorism team.

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,720
Which means they must have
us surrounded by now.

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,640
[JUNICHIRO] Let's surrender.
After all, we're innocent!

Chief Taneda received treatment

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,450
He may testify on our behalf
if he regains consciousness.

37
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,660
But I don't have much
hope that he will.

Why not?

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,000
[RAMPO] This is the work of
the reality-altering book.

The chief said the book may
have been made by Gifted,

41
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,080
but I seriously have my doubts.
It's from a higher power.

42
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,710
No Gifted is able to
create a book like that.

43
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Case in point, Mushitaro's
reality-altering ability

44
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,880
wasn't able to overwrite
people's memories.

But that's happening this time.

46
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,680
[KYOUKA]
I definitely have memories

47
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,270
of all of us abducting the
hostages and killing them.

48
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,280
So then, what happens
if we're caught?

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,190
The government has Gifted
who can read your memories.

If they catch us, we'll
be sentenced to death.

The gas should've
knocked them all out.

83
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,370
Did they bleed
themselves on purpose?

84
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,870
Lower blood pressure means
slower gas absorption?

[SQUAD A LEADER]
To think you'd all die

94
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,150
just to avoid inhaling gas.

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,660
There's no way you
could've done it

[DOPPO]
Anything I've seen once,

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
I can reproduce
with my notebook.

But I wouldn't wait too long
to do it if I were you.

All infiltration squads,
remove your masks now.

You're absolutely right about
that. It's a horrible ride.

00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,260
chopped up your arms and
legs to make fertilizer

160
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
for my personal bonsai projects.

161
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,930
[BOTH]
She's a little girl?

162
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,100
[OUCHI] You are just as rabid
as ever, my dear Teruko.

163
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,010
I'm counting on you today.

164
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,560
You got it, Captain!

165
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,680
Teruko will always put
her life on the line

166
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,810
to be your loyal dog, Captain.

167
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,440
Are you sure that they're
the Hunting Dogs?

168
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,770
[CAPTAIN]
Yep.

169
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,610
The elite five-member team
comprised of the best

170
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,110
of all the forces throughout
the entire country.

171
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,950
They're the special
suppression squad A-Team.

172
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,040
The squad's leader and living
legend, Ouchi Fukuchi.

173
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,330
The blind king,
who comprehends all

174
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,290
with his superhuman senses,
Saigiku Jouno.

175
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,260
The most capable combatant in
the squad, Tetchou Suehiro.

176
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,760
Feared by her enemies
and allies alike,

177
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,140
the queen of bloody
thorns, Teruko Okura.

178
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,890
You said five, but there
are only four here.

179
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,980
Where's the fifth
member of the team?

180
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,480
No one knows who
the fifth member is.

181
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,150
[OUCHI] He's infiltrating
another organization.

182
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,240
Are you the commander on-site?

183
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,610
[CAPTAIN]
Yes, sir!

184
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,950
It's quite an honor to meet
you, Captain Fukuchi.

185
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,700
[OUCHI] You should go have some
tea and leave this to us.

186
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,870
Huh?

187
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,370
Vicious criminals
betraying human morals

188
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,330
will be shred by fangs
of the Hunting Dogs.

189
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,250
[YUKICHI]
Yeah, thanks. Please do.

190
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,720
[YUKICHI]
Hmm...

191
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,100
[MILITARY POLICE C] Hands up,
Fukuzawa. We're arresting you.

192
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,930
You enemy of the state!

193
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,180
This is the end of the
Armed Detective Agency.

194
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,770
[DOPPO] Have we gained
some distance on them?

195
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,570
My phone isn't working out here.

196
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,400
[DOPPO]
Radio jamming.

197
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,620
They'll try to stop
us physically next.

198
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,200
Surveillance satellites,
search dogs, roadblocks,

199
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,830
military drones.

200
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,200
There's nothing the
five of us can do

201
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,160
with our special abilities.

202
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,370
[AKIKO]
It doesn't look good.

203
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,290
After all, the sheer
numbers and firepower

204
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,500
of organized militaries are
unbeatable in the modern world.

205
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,840
Damn! We can't be stuck here!

206
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,430
Right now, they might
be treating Naomi

207
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,930
like a common criminal!

208
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,560
Common criminals? Huh.

209
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,230
[KENJI]
Listen, everyone.

210
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,270
This is just like
the ten-year orchard.

211
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,860
When I was in the village,

212
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,360
we spent ten whole years
raising an orchard,

213
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,530
and then just like that,

214
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,320
it got wiped out overnight
in a big storm.

215
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,030
We never got to harvest
that orchard even once.

216
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,280
[AKIKO]
Well, that's an awful story.

217
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,080
What do you think
our village did then?

218
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,830
At first, we were dumbfounded.

219
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,580
We laughed about it
for a little while,

220
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,420
and then we planted
new seedlings.

221
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,920
We decided to rebuild
over the next ten years.

222
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,220
A storm has done really bad
things to the Detective Agency.

223
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,720
But it's okay.

224
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,430
In the end, a calamitous storm

225
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,520
and a blessed rain are
exactly the same thing.

226
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,230
Let's keep living.
Let's make it through the storm.

227
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,900
One thing we can't do

228
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,320
is decide that we don't
wanna live here anymore.

229
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
We've gotta stay on the
spinning rock we call Earth.

230
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,780
[DOPPO]
Kenji is right.

231
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,950
Let's weather the storm and
rebuild the Detective Agency.

232
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,460
And to do that, we all need to
come out of this storm alive.

233
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,420
The longer we wait, the better
equipped and staffed they'll be,

234
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,340
and the wider their
search radius.

235
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,590
From my experience, their
search radius will grow

236
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,180
by roughly 50
kilometers per hour.

237
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,550
Does that mean we
have to escape

238
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,680
at a rate of at least 50
kilometers per hour as well?

239
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,350
That's correct, which means
we're gonna need a vehicle.

240
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,060
The criminals have two options.

241
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,730
The first is the arterial
road to the south.

242
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,520
They may commandeer a vehicle
there to make their escape.

243
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,650
The second is the
station to the north.

244
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,530
They could hide among the
crowds and escape by train.

245
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,870
This special squad we
have is exemplary.

246
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,950
I could be screwing around
the base sitting on my butt

247
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,950
while the rest of you close
the case yourselves.

248
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,410
I don't appreciate your
vulgar figure of speech.

249
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
North or south,
a train or a car,

250
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,080
it's all a choice
between life and death.

251
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,460
Now then, which course will
those pathetic, starving dogs

252
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,380
finally decide to take?

253
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,550
[DOPPO]
We'll take a car.

254
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,720
[JUNICHIRO]
Why a car and not the train?

255
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,930
[DOPPO]
If they manage to somehow

256
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,970
catch up to us on the train,

257
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,140
it could get derailed and
cause a grave accident.

258
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,810
Too many innocent lives would
be lost. That's unacceptable.

259
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,230
So it's got to be a car.

260
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,980
Well, I'm onboard.

261
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,570
Good thinking, Kunikida.
Let's do it.

262
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,210
[JOUNO] So which way shall we
go? The trains or the roads?

263
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,790
[TERUKO]
Both.

264
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,460
We'll face the enemy's potential
ambush head-on and crush them.

265
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,420
That's how we do
things on this team.

266
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,260
All right then, Teruko and I
will head north to the trains,

267
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,800
and Jouno and Tetchou will
head south to the roads.

268
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,970
Above all, make sure
you don't lose them!

269
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,050
[CAPTAIN]
Captain Fukuchi,

270
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,930
the enemy has
destroyed our vehicles.

271
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,140
We only have one car left that
we can use for transportation.

272
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,100
[OUCHI]
Not a problem.

273
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,400
Huh?

274
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,150
Fail, and you will all
be punished severely.

275
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,940
I forgot, Captain, what
was the punishment, again?

276
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,070
[OUCHI] Uh, we haven't messed
up since we were formed.

277
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,660
Guess I forgot, too.

278
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,280
[JOUNO]
Well, then.

279
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,790
Huh?

280
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,090
[CAR DRIVER]
Hello, may I help you?

281
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,680
[DOPPO] Do you have
vehicle theft insurance?

282
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,640
Of course I do, why do you ask?

283
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,470
[DOPPO]
I see. Congratulations.

284
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,560
After this, you're getting
a brand-new car.

285
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,570
[TETCHOU]
We're here.

286
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,610
Tell me, Tetchou, why did
you cut down all the trees

287
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,910
instead of avoiding them?

288
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,990
Because the fastest
route to any destination

289
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,450
is a single straight line.

290
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,210
[JOUNO]
That's how an idiot would think.

291
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,170
Let's have a meal
before we start.

292
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,330
I'll have you know, Tetchou,

293
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,000
that of every single
member in our squad,

294
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,920
I most certainly
hate you the most.

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,300
[TETCHOU]
Hate? Why?

296
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,630
Because your soul is entirely
lacking in artistry!

297
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,930
You enjoy putting shichimi
spice on strawberries

298
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,100
just because you think similar
colors pair well together!

299
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,850
That also goes for
putting sugar on rice,

300
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,680
and soup base on youkan!

301
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,270
Uh! And now you're eating
a hard-boiled egg

302
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,310
with the shell on!

303
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,690
I wish you would
just die already!

304
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,190
You're completely useless
until we meet the enemy.

305
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,400
Just shut up and
don't say anything.

306
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,900
Also, your pulse and your
breathing are both annoying.

307
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,530
Please do your best to stop.

308
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,580
[JOUNO]
There.

309
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,290
Distance, 500 meters.
Four to five people on board.

310
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,130
Driving in a westward direction.

311
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,090
[ATSUSHI]
Just a little more.

312
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,430
I wonder what's happening
to the others right now. Huh?

313
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,850
Beware of any traps
set by the suspects!

314
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,270
[ATSUSHI]
Military police!

315
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,400
They've come to help
with the hostages.

316
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,110
Hey, help, I'm over here!
Help me out, please!

317
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,150
[MILITARY POLICE D]
Headquarters,

318
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,490
we've discovered
a remaining suspect.

319
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,070
Request permission to fire.

320
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,120
So now what do we do?

321
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,790
Next step is to hide out
and gather information.

322
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,160
That is, if we can find someone
who will provide shelter

323
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,580
to fugitives from
the Detective Agency.

324
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,460
I know a hideout we can go to--

325
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,840
somewhere that'll
be safe for us.

326
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,470
But I'll loathe being there.

327
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,590
[JUNICHIRO]
Really?

328
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,630
[KENJI]
Where's that?

329
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,970
[JOUNO]
I'm interested, too.

330
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,430
Please do tell us all about
this safe hiding place

331
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,140
you're going to.

332
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,680
[KENJI, JUNICHIRO gasp]

333
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,810
[JOUNO]
You're missing someone though.

334
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,520
Where's the girl in the kimono?

335
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,980
What?

336
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,820
[DOPPO]
He stopped Kenji's brute force!

337
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,320
[KENJI yells]

338
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,240
Asshole! Light Snow!

339
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,830
Go, Kunikida! Make a run for it!

340
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,670
[JOUNO]
Very impressive.

341
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,170
You erased the car and
messed up my sense of location

342
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,590
before pulling me
out along with you.

343
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,670
But Special Ability illusions
won't work on me.

344
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,470
I let you catch me on purpose.

345
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,390
We're going to finish
you two off first.

346
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,310
[TETCHOU]
Should I kill both of them?

347
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,020
Of course, you are the best
swordsman of the Hunting Dogs,

348
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,940
so at least go make
yourself useful.

349
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,650
Get ready!

350
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,330
It's not the idealist way
to leave anyone behind!

351
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,330
[MILITARY POLICE D]
Prepare to fire!

352
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,790
[ATSUSHI]
Wait!

353
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,760
[gasps]

354
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,840
[ALL gasp]

355
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,180
But, Kyouka, what--?

356
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,440
Don't worry, I only
knocked them unconscious.

357
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,860
We've been framed by an enemy.

358
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,650
The Detective Agency was labeled
a criminal organization,

359
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
so we had to escape.

360
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,240
Come on.

361
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,200
Where are we going? We have
to get outta here, don't we?

362
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,660
There's no getting
out of here now.

363
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,870
We're stuck down
here for a while.

364
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,670
Kenji! No time to
slow down! Grab on!

365
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,840
Well, that didn't go as planned.

366
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,470
We just went from bad to worse.

367
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,430
The Hunting Dogs are the
most formidable squad

368
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,270
the Military has.

369
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,850
Their bodies have been
augmented by Gifted experts.

370
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,810
They have many times
the physical capabilities

371
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,270
of the average person.

372
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,310
The next time they catch us,
they'll destroy the car,

373
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,230
and then we'll be
as good as done.

374
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,980
I can't believe it,
but you were actually

375
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,940
more useless than
ever today, Tetchou.

376
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,030
Have you considered
finding a new job?

377
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,870
I just needed a little warm up
fight to get my blood flowing.

378
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,200
[JOUNO] Ah, he's a bit pissed
about getting run over.

379
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,960
On some occasions,
evil goes unpunished.

380
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,000
Just as good can go unrewarded.

381
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,590
Without my blade,

382
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,510
one cannot wish for all things
to receive their proper justice.

383
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,680
One cannot begin to
hope for balance.

384
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,600
Plum Blossoms in the Snow!

385
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,350
[gasps]

386
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,070
[DOPPO]
What just happened to us?

387
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,620
[JOUNO] You came back
to save your comrade,

388
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,160
and you all went down.

389
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,660
It's hardly surprising when
you stop to think about it.

390
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,500
In my experience, that's just
the way life usually goes.

391
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,090
[KENJI]
Look out!

392
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,220
There is no escaping
from my sword.

393
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,930
[DOPPO] I still can't
comprehend his attack.

394
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,970
I have to do something.

395
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,640
Doppo Poet! Stun Grena--!

396
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,610
[DOPPO] I saw it!
The moment he drew his sword,

397
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,030
his saber grew far longer
than his scabbard.

398
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,990
And it turned.

399
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,330
[DOPPO] His blade, it's long
enough to catch a fleeing car.

400
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,380
There's no way we can
escape from that blade.

401
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,540
He's on another level.

402
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,670
Hunting Dogs, you're
certainly capable.

403
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,720
Now then, if you
please, Tetchou.

404
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,800
First, decapitate the doctor.

405
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,300
[ALL gasp]

406
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,560
[JOUNO] We can't have her
healing her buddies, after all.

407
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,970
Besides, she's an
angel of death.

408
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,350
[gasps]

409
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,390
The world is going to be
much better off without her.

410
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,360
No! Don't kill her!

411
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,070
All right, we'll surrender!

412
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,730
[JOUNO]
You have an interesting pulse.

413
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,150
Perhaps it's because
you're still

414
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,610
such an idealist, Kunikida.

415
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,070
You're relieved right
now, aren't you?

416
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,280
What do you mean?

417
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,910
[JOUNO]
I read up on you.

418
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,040
Your ideals are as lofty and
large as a hot air balloon.

419
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,040
But a hot air balloon
inevitably runs out of fuel

420
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,130
and returns to the ground.

421
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,260
You've lived in fear of
when that day would come.

422
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,420
Stop it.

423
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,550
[JOUNO] I'm really happy
for you, Kunikida.

424
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,720
Starting tomorrow,
you'll be free!

[CHUUYA]
Deploy Gravity Manipulation.

426
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,780
Hypersonic countermeasures?

427
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,910
But how? I didn't
hear any gunfire!

428
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,740
[CHUUYA] You've fucked up,
Detective Agency!

429
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,630
I'm here to save your asses,
on the boss's orders.
