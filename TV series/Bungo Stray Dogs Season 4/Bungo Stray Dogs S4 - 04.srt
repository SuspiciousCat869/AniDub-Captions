Death, a convulsion.

00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,770
Murder, an idol
of the powerless.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,640
I am the angel of murder.

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,900
The king of crime.

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,270
May you forever rest in peace!

[RAMPO] Listen, I'm here
to help get you out of here.

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,850
Are you listening
to me, Kunikida?

8
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,940
[DOPPO]
Don't mind me, Rampo.

9
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,600
It's only right for a
suspect to be detained.

10
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,610
Yeah, but you're a suspect
in a murder case.

11
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,820
It was the girl who set off the
grenades with her own hands.

12
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,280
That's your claim, right?

13
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,570
But there are no witnesses,

14
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,200
and all evidence was
destroyed by the enemy.

15
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,700
They even went to
the trouble of using

16
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,160
the same grenades
the Agency uses.

17
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,960
It's obvious to me
you've been framed.

18
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,170
Part of an operation
by the Rats.

19
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,800
Plus, a convenient
way to harass us.

20
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,510
But I--

21
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,880
Are you going to let
them charge you

22
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,180
because of a guilty conscience?

23
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,930
I don't care about
your inner conflict.

24
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,140
I'm here to make sure
you're found innocent.

25
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,060
The Rats must have
someone on their payroll

26
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,020
who specializes in
destroying evidence.

27
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,190
We'll find him.

28
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,320
And no one's going
to stop us either.

29
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,450
Not the Agency.
Not even the boss.

30
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,700
Rampo. Why do all this?

31
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,990
Because it's my fault.

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,250
If I'd seen through that demon
Fyodor's trap earlier,

33
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,580
the girl wouldn't have died.

[POE]
Hmm, challenging.

35
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,180
Anything that torments the grand
intellect of one such as myself

36
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,260
is someone to be
feared for sure.

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,390
Still, I shall be
the first one to solve

R-Rampo?

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,120
Whatcha doing here, anyway?

Oh, waitin' for someone, huh?

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,710
He figured me out!

48
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,380
If you must know, I recently
won something in an auction,

00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,920
and I'm here to retrieve it.

50

And what brings you here, Rampo?

51
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,100
And by the way, why are
you dressed like that?

52
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,970
Finally, I was wondering if
anyone was ever going to notice!

53
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,890
After I went against
the boss's orders

during the cannibalism incident,

55

he forced me to work as
the mascot of the company,

56
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,440
so I ran away.

seein' a friendly face here!

63
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,210
So you think this enemy
"evidence destroyer"

00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,590
will be showing up at this
observation deck any minute now.

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,130
[RAMPO]
Yup.

if you helped me spot them?

It would, but he
knows who I am.

68
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,300
And soon you'll know that
the evidence destroyer

69
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,760
is Fyodor's ally
and right-hand man.

But as always, I have a hard
time saying no to Rampo.

[RAMPO] The only info we have
on the evidence destroyer

75
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,860
is the photo I gave you.

Oh! Hm.

made you suspect

he'll show up on the observation

Oh, how about I tell
you about the mystery

91
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,690
I've been working on?

92
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,150
Everyone in town's
been obsessed with it.

93
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,270
The common theory is,
of course--

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,110
Shut up! A mystery?

95
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,570
You know what,
I'd rather go home

96
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,320
and play with the kids
in the neighborhood.

97
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,700
[POE]
Not this one.

98
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,700
This author is, in fact,
the actual murder victim.

99
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,620
And he was killed,
in the exact same way

100
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,000
he described the murder
to be in his novel.

101
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,500
[RAMPO]
Hm?

102
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,040
[POE] The first three
chapters of the novel

103
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,550
were originally published
in a magazine.

104
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,090
The author died right after
he finished the manuscript

105
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,010
for the fourth
and final chapter.

106
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,680
And then the murderer
stole that final chapter

107
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,220
and fled from the crime scene.

108
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,890
Why, do you think?

109
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,480
Well, he did it
because the truth

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,810
and trick behind the murder

111
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,940
was resolved in that
fourth chapter, right?

112
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,650
[POE] The victim was
a mystery novelist

113
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,610
using the pen name "Kindaichi."

114
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,610
He was a well-known,
talented author,

115
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,450
so his death set
the public astir.

116
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,120
Though the entire industry pored
over the first three chapters.

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,540
But the mystery continues
to be unresolved.

118
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,910
I'm working on it myself,

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but it's proving to be quite
the difficult challenge.

120
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,250
Rampo, you're here!

121
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,880
Don't you have anything
better to do than this?

122
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,170
Weren't you supposed to
wait on another floor?

123
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,340
[RAMPO]
I'm pissed he hasn't shown,

124
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,630
so I came up with a way
to blow off steam.

125
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,260
I'm going to guess who
murdered the author

126
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,380
while we wait around.

127
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,930
[POE]
Geh! What? Just like that, huh?

128
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,430
We'll know who did it
by tomorrow either way.

129
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,140
Tomorrow? But how?

130
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,930
[RAMPO]
The murderer had two motives:

131
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,390
Revenge and money.

132
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,190
The murderer was told
about what happens

133
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,860
in the fourth and final chapter.

134
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,530
Which means they were
pretty close to the victim.

135
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,650
That's what triggered
the murder.

136
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,990
So why'd he kill him right after
he finished writing the ending?

137
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,870
Because he'd been
waiting for him to.

138
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,580
The more the public
became fascinated

139
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,370
by the author's murder,

140
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,620
the more valuable
the manuscript became.

141
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,080
And he was planning
on selling it.

142
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,630
[POE] He wasn't necessarily
going to sell it.

143
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,210
Of course he was.
In fact, he already has.

144
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,130
To whom?

145
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,760
To you.

146
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,640
Your assistant who was sworn
to secrecy told me so.

147
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,850
By the way, it's dangerous
to bring a wild animal

148
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,060
to a crowded area.

149
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,430
But I guess you
had to bring him

150
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,600
so the stranger you're
meeting would recognize you.

151
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,190
You said, look for a man with
a raccoon on his shoulder.

152
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,610
Plus, you mentioned an auction.

153
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,520
The best place to sell
the stolen fourth chapter

154
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,440
would be an underground auction.

155
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,610
Do you want me to keep going?

156
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,870
I was hoping to solve
the crime all by myself!

157
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,370
But if the police
bought the manuscript,

158
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,950
the truth would come out
in the newspapers

159
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,920
before I had a
chance to solve it.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,710
Turn over that
evidence to the police

161
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,250
and they'll give you a
letter of appreciation.

162
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,710
That's what I'll do then!

163
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,800
After all, I only spent a mere
20 million to buy it.

164
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,050
[gasps]

165
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,220
Why the look of excruciating
shock, Rampo?

166
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,850
Master Architect is the
third-highest rank in the Guild.

167
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,180
By tomorrow, I won't even
remember I spent such an amount.

168
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,020
What, are you mental
or something?!

169
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,310
But I got to see your
rare, exasperated face,

170
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,020
so it was well worth the money!

171
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,980
Now then, I shall have
to finish the transaction

172
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,480
I came here for.

173
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,280
I was told it would be
given to me by someone

174
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,150
in possession of a
bright red envelope.

175
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,030
Gee, a bright red envelope, huh?

176
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,280
Like that one?

177
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,040
Oh. When did that get there?

178
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,790
[RAMPO, POE]
Ah. Huh?

179
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,850
[PEOPLE gasp]

180
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,680
Did you see that
man's face just now?

181
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,430
The evidence destroyer!

182
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,100
Well, I'll be damned.

183
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,480
How do you like that?

184
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,690
Turns out this is
a good mystery.

185
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,030
[POE]
Dead on impact.

186
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,990
Do you think it's possible
this was a suicide,

187
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,080
or was he silenced by the Rats?

188
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,830
[siren wailing]

189
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,540
[MINOURA]
Get back! Municipal police!

190
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,830
Huh? It's you two?

191
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,540
[RAMPO]
Hi!

192
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,420
Hey. Rampo?

193
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,590
[RAMPO]
Minoura!

194
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,460
[RAMPO laughing]

195
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,840
Stop tickling me! Get off
of me! I'll arrest you!

196
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,430
[RAMPO]
This is so fun!

197
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,850
Say "uncle" and I win!

198
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,310
Please! Please help Minoura
before he passes out!

199
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,850
[POE]
Hmm.

200
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,890
Why did Rampo suddenly become
so excited when you arrived?

201
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,310
I dunno!

202
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,940
Because the police arrived
so quickly after the fall.

203
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,360
In fact, the police arrived
just as we rushed to the street

204
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,860
from the observation deck above.

205
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,400
But why?

206
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,450
Because the perpetrator called
them himself. Ahead of time.

207
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,580
To have the municipal police
close off the area,

208
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,410
so I wouldn't have time to
check out the body myself.

209
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,000
[POE]
So it wasn't a suicide,

210
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,420
but something the Rats did to
silence this man from talking?

211
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,040
[RAMPO]
Actually, it's neither.

212
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,380
Look at this.

213
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,380
So what of it?
It's the victim's shoe.

214
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,300
It came off as he was
falling to the ground.

215
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,640
He had it on when we saw
him through the window.

216
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,390
You observed that in the
split second as he fell?

217
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,270
Judging by how worn
out the sole is,

218
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,390
he should've been wearing
this particular pair of shoes

219
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,810
for quite a long time.

220
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,360
It should not have come off
so easily in mid-air.

221
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
I see now!

222
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,940
Then explain it to me, would ya?

223
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,190
So you see, the shoes
the victim was wearing

224
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,780
don't actually belong to him.

225
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,990
He was just forced to put them
on right before he was pushed.

226
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,120
Rampo knew this
because he already knows

227
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,040
what the man's
footprint looks like.

228
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,210
[RAMPO] I had been to their
hideout in the abandoned mines

229
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,790
to look for leads on
the evidence destroyer.

230
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,210
Needless to say, I took note
of all of the footprints

231
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,590
on the ground.

232
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,130
So what about this shoe?

233
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,590
I saw it, too, of course.

234
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,300
So that face was
simply a forgery

235
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,590
connected to a fishing line?

236
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,760
That's right.

237
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,970
[MINOURA]
Hmm?

238
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,600
[RAMPO] They smashed
the victim's face in,

239
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,600
and then they placed the
kind of prosthetic mask

240
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,230
they use in the
movies on top of it.

241
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,020
Then they attached the fishing
line directly to the mask

242
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,820
and adjusted its length so it
would be seen on his way down.

243
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,990
Once the victim hit the ground,

244
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,620
there'd be no way of
knowing that his face

245
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,620
had been smashed
in ahead of time.

246
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,870
[POE]
So then...

247
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,080
The evidence destroyer
shoved the victim down

248
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,630
to cover his tracks.

249
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,090
And so, I just need to use these

250
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,050
to determine his whereabouts,
and it's over.

251
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,680
[OGURI] What is he,
some kind of a freak?

252
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,390
I went to that underground
auction to fund my escape

253
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,600
and throw the Detective
Agency off my trail.

254
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,770
With one shoe he blew
my whole scheme!

255
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,940
Just forging that mask
was a ton of work.

256
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,980
This situation...

257
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,400
[chuckles]

258
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,700
[OGURI]
...is exactly as I planned!

259
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,240
[OGURI chuckling]

260
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,040
[OGURI]
Behold!

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,080
Even the demon of the
north would tremble

262
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,620
at my special ability.

263
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,880
Know defeat, detective!
Your insights are inadequate!

264
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,050
Special Ability:
The Perfect Crime!

265
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,400
And now it's finally time
for the Ultra Deduction ability

266
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,320
to instantly reveal
the real truth!

267

You that younger detective's
fan boy or something?

No, I'm his rival!

269
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,550
I just don't know.

270
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,300
Huh? What'd you just say?

271
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,730
I can't figure it out at all.

272
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,640
[OGURI laughs]

273
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,860
[OGURI]
Silly detectives!

274
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,650
Nothing but wretched hyenas.

275
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,070
You'll never catch me
in a million years.

276
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,990
For my special ability
is the ability

277
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,860
to erase the evidence
of any crime,

278
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,280
especially the ones I commit.

279
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,370
The gates of Heaven are closed

280
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,620
and are never to
be opened again.

281
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,830
For I am the ultimate
detective killer!

282
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,420
His coworker's innocence
will never be proven.

283

And he'll never be able
to explain the reason

284
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:03,010
why Fyodor let me capture him.

285
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,410
[FYODOR] Pleasant greetings
to you, Mushitaro.

286
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,670
[OGURI]
And who are you supposed to be?

287
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,630
The man who's going to
free you from imprisonment.

288
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,010
A crime organization
locked you up

289
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,630
so they can continue
to make money

290
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,180
off your fantastic ability to
erase all evidence of a crime.

291
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,720
Until today, that is.

292
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,350
The cost for your freedom
is rather modest.

293
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,640
We'd like you to cooperate
with our operation

294
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,230
just this one time.

295
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,730
Between a tyrant and a demon,

296
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,770
I would rather make
a pact with the demon.

297
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,990
I guess that's simply
the way I'm wired.

298
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,870
So yes, I'll accept your offer.

299
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,200
However, I have
a few conditions.

300
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,540
Number one: No matter what,
I will never appear in public.

301
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,120
I will only use my
special ability.

302
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,880
Second: Prepare a desk
for my work.

303
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,420
Even better if you
can supply books

304
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,550
on mysticism and
ancient alchemy.

305
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,340
Thirdly: Serve my meals
on porcelain or silver.

306
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,260
And my clothes are always to
be laundered using starch.

307
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,140
That's all fine. Anything else?

308
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,350
[OGURI]
Yes.

309
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,890
And this is the most
important condition.

310
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,190
Once the operation is completed,
I'll need to flee overseas.

311
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,650
This is to ensure I
evade the Organization.

312
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,740
My escape must happen
one week later.

313
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,320
Why wait a whole week?

314
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,660
I could arrange to have
you leave a day after.

315
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,240
[OGURI] There's unfinished
business I have left.

316
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,660
A promise of death and crime.

317
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,870
There's a man I need to see.

318
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,500
And in one week's time,
after we're done...

319
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,670
...I'll kill him.

320
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,760
[OGURI laughing]

321
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,890
Poor Rampo. He hasn't
said a single word

322
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,400
since he started staring
at the victim's body.

323
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,520
Yeah.

324
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,570
He'd normally be
laughing out loud

325
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,320
and pointing out the murderer.

326
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,360
[POE]
His great ability as a detective

327
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,660
is the very backbone
of his body and soul.

328
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,490
To have that backbone broken,

329
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,580
I'm afraid he may
never walk again.

330
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,920
Rampo! Don't be so
hard on your-- Agh!

331
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,090
Time to give up!

332
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,210
Okay, I'm going back
to the office now.

333
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,550
You can deal with this mess.

334
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,760
But, Rampo, wait.

335
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,850
[OGURI chuckles]

336
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,970
[OGURI]
My victory is set in stone.

337
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,720
The photo of me the Agency has

338
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,180
is from before I changed my
face in the Organization.

339
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,150
Which means there's no way
they'll ever recognize me.

340
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,070
Killing is as easy for me as
someone else bending a finger.

341
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,570
Even the other day

342
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,990
when I killed that
feebleminded mystery writer.

343
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,580
[SEISHI]
Mushi, you know what?

344
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,120
My goal is to write the ultimate
mystery novel one day.

345
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,580
[chuckles]

346
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,670
[crack]

347
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,550
Kneel before me, detectives!
For I am the true king of crime!

348
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,850
There's no one on earth who
can force me to repent

349
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,390
or admit to any one of
my masterful crimes!

350
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,310
Hey there, got a minute?

351
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,690
[OGURI screams]

352
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,020
[OGURI]
The detective!

353
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,480
Why's he here? Is he
on to me? Impossible.

354
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,150
Do you know where I can
catch a taxi around here?

355
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,030
What? A taxi?

356
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,910
[RAMPO] Yeah, I was gonna take
a taxicab back to the office.

357
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,700
But the police blocked off
the main street for an accident.

358
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,080
And I've had no luck at all

359
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,830
finding a taxi anywhere
on these back streets.

360
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,500
And you're the only person
I've seen who I can ask.

361
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,840
[OGURI]
Does he recognize me?

362
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,630
Does he know who I really am?

363
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,460
He's not lying when he says
the main road's closed.

364
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,130
This is the only place
to find a taxi.

365
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,470
How comical!

366
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,720
The detective, on his way
back to the office

367
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,100
after giving up on a case

368
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,970
strikes up a conversation
with the perpetrator!

369
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,520
Sorry, but I can't think of
any taxi stands around here.

370
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,070
[RAMPO] Mm-hm. Fine, I'll
just wait right here, then.

371
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,820
[OGURI]
Agh! He's waiting here?

372
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,150
But I'm supposed to be
meeting my ride here!

373
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,240
He's going to end up seeing
the vehicle I drive away in.

374
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,740
For a crime to be perfect,

375
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,040
not a single loose thread
may be left untied.

376
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,500
There's a train station about
a five-minute walk from here.

377
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,750
Let me draw a map...

378
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,170
No thanks, I'm not in
the mood to walk today!

379
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,340
Okay, how 'bout this?

380
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,050
There's a bus station
right around the corner

381
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,800
that'll take you over
to the train station.

382
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Make a right at the cor--

383
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,170
No buses, no trains--
too much work!

384
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,340
Also, I've never been on one,

385
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,720
so I don't know how
to ride the trains.

386
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,760
[OGURI]
What are you, in grade school?

387
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,310
I know, since I don't wanna
walk, how about you give me

388
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,810
a piggyback ride
back to my office?

389
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,770
That's no request to make
of another human being.

390
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,440
Well, I've made the newbie at
the office do it a few times.

391
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,030
[OGURI] I'm afraid that
I've gotten involved

392
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,690
in a conversation with someone
that I really shouldn't have.

393
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,910
Hello, Mister Mushitaro.
I'll be your driver today.

394
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,130
[OGURI]
Of all the times to be early.

395
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,050
Sorry, but I have to be off now
to a business engagement.

396
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,710
Good luck finding a cab!

397
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,420
Uh. Mister...?

398
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,800
[RAMPO]
Rampo.

399
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,260
Well, Mister Rampo,
have a nice rest of your day.

400
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,400
[OGURI] He's seen my car,
just what I didn't want.

401
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,900
Well, whatever.

402
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,230
It shouldn't be a problem as
long as he doesn't realize--

403
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,900
Wh-Wh-Wh--?

404
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,200
What are you doing in here?

405
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,160
This is a company
car provided for me!

406
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,200
It's hot in here.
Turn on the AC.

407
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,290
Are you listening?

408
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,540
I have a good idea.

409
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,120
I'll pay you what
a cab ride costs

410
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,790
if you let me share
the car with you.

411
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,500
Plus, I could hook
you up with some work

412
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,290
if you ever need a job.

413
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,960
[OGURI]
No!

414
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,420
Great, thanks, appreciate it.

415
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,010
[OGURI]
What do you expect me to do?

416
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,970
It's not like I want
him here, either!

417
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,260
Alas, I can't let
this lucky detective

418
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,510
get any closer to the truth

419
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,770
just because he happened
to stumble across me!

420
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,140
Driver, please take him
to the train station.

421
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,730
I'm sure that you can find a
taxi you can take from there.

422
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,730
Yay!

423
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,900
Say, what is it you do there
at the Detective Agency?

424
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,990
Oh, well, I'm a detective.

425
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,200
[OGURI]
I see.

426
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,410
You must experience some
gruesome situations

427
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,830
in your line of work.

428
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,790
Such a foreign world to me,
as far as I'm concerned.

429
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,040
I just have one lead
on a current murderer.

430
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,630
He swapped shoes with
his recent victim,

431
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,380
so whoever he is, his shoes are
too small for him right now.

432
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,920
I only just realized
why this case

433
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,680
has been so difficult
for me to solve.

434
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,880
The murderer is Gifted,

435
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,470
with a rare ability to
alter reality of sorts.

436
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,600
[OGURI] He's already
figured out that much?

437
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,930
My skills as detective
are all about technique.

438
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,140
Because it isn't a power,
I couldn't stand a chance

439
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,310
against a reality-altering
special ability.

440
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,270
[OGURI]
Heh. Exactly.

441
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,150
But I managed to
figure it out anyway.

442
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,950
[OGURI]
No! Impossible!

443
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,700
Are you interested in how?

444
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,490
That would make for great
entertainment while we ride.

445
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,330
To think that I'd get to hear
how a detective I just met

446
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,370
solved a crime
involving a Gifted.

447
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,420
All right, I'll explain it to
you as thanks for the ride.

448
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,210
A bright red envelope is
the key to the whole thing.

449
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,880
I was chasing an
evidence destroyer

450
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,880
who wanted me to believe
that he was dead.

451
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,300
He had already taken notice
of my friend Edgar Allan Poe.

452
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,640
Poe arranged to buy the
manuscript of a dead author.

453
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,600
The instant we grabbed
the red envelope,

454
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,310
the evidence destroyer
pushed a double

455
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,730
off the roof of the building.

456
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,270
All for the purpose
of showcasing

457
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,730
that one moment to us.

458
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,320
So the question that it
all comes back to is this:

459
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,030
Where did the perpetrator get
the envelope and the manuscript?

460
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,410
The answer is so simple.

461
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,580
He killed and stole it from...

462
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,290
...the author himself.
