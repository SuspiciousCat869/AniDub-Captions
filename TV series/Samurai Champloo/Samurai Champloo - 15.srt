315
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,041
Now I see...

316
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,416
You're Jinpachi's daughter.

317
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,916
So a relative of the same clan
of ninja mercenaries

318
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,208
that brought us down before

319
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,458
thwarts the Tsuda clan again.

320
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,166
Well, no matter.

321
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,750
[Yatsuha] Thank you.

322
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,958
For the past year,
we've been working undercover

323
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,416
and secretly
investigating these guys.

324
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,708
We were finally able
to arrest them.

325
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,208
We owe it all to you.

326
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,125
[Mugen] Forget it.

327
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,583
That guy was a scum bag.

328
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,375
No thanks necessary.

329
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,791
That is so long as you
intend on keeping your promise.

330
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,291
Look! A naked woman!

331
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,291
Huh?

332
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,416
[Hankichi] Here we go.

333
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,208
Are you sure he's
gonna be okay?

334
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,791
I feel bad
just leavin' him here.

335
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,000
It appeared that he had
some traveling companions.

336
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,500
They'll come lookin'
for him sooner or later.

337
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,250
C'mon, we better get going.
It's a long way to Edo.

338
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,208
I just hope the crows
don't eat him first.

339
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,708
He'll be fine. He's not
as delicate as he looks.

340
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,125
After all, that's
the man I'm gonna marry.

341
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,166
Huh?

342
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,583
I guess I fell
in love with him.

343
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:29,583
<i>So long. Once both our journeys</i>
<i>are over, I'll come find you.</i>

344
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,958
[Hankichi] A-Are you serious?

345
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,708
I'm so hungry!

346
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,125
My back.

347
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:46,375
