<i>the samurai who</i>

308

<i>getting by in life sure is hard.</i>

312

<i>[Manzo] As a side note,</i>
<i>there's been a recent uproar</i>

316
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,166
<i>over rampant sexuality</i>
<i>in the country's youth.</i>

317
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,541
<i>However, keep in mind</i>
<i>that Japanese people</i>

318
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,375
<i>had a rather open-minded</i>
<i>view of sexuality,</i>

319
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,291
<i>And it was especially liberal</i>
<i>during the Edo Period.</i>

320
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,750
<i>They only became prudish</i>
<i>in the Meiji Era</i>

321
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,583
<i>after the influx of</i>
<i>Western culture.</i>

322
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,291
<i>So, to put this in perspective,</i>

323
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,791
<i>one could say</i>
<i>that they've merely</i>

00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,208
[Mugen] Yeah, well that

Go ahead and don't trust me.

00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,125
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

354
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,208
<i>I guess that was</i>
<i>the first time I ever</i>

355

356
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,333
[Mugen] Huh?

357
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,708
<i>I thought to myself,</i>
<i>"We're finally going to have</i>

<i>a heart to heart conversation."</i>

359
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,000
<i>But Jin kept his mouth</i>
<i>shut the whole time.</i>

360

<i>I'd always thought that</i>

00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,291
<i>guys were supposed to open up</i>
<i>and tell you all sorts of stuff.</i>

363
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,666
<i>I tried to break the ice, but</i>
<i>all I could get out of him was</i>

364
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,416
<i>a "Hmm," or an "Aah."</i>

365
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,333

<i>That's what I'd like to know.</i>

00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,125
<i>Does he hate me or something?</i>

367
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,875
<i>Or is he just shy?</i>

368
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,625
<i>I mean, after all,</i>
<i>we've been on this journey</i>

<i>he finally gets around</i>
<i>to opening up to me?</i>

00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,041
<i>It's kinda sad, really.</i>

373
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,166
<i>The end.</i>

374
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,416
Jin, man-to-man, what do you
really think of her, anyway?

375
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Hmm.

<i>for a while.</i>

<i>free room and board</i>
<i>while we're here.</i>

<i>It's more than</i>
<i>we could have hoped for.</i>

405
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,166
<i>But in return, we have to follow</i>
<i>the strict rules of the temple.</i>

406
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,666
<i>I've been working hard since</i>
<i>the crack of dawn again today.</i>

<i>Boy am I beat.</i>

408
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:30,958
Since the beginning,

409
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,791
man was born into
a state of freedom.

410
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,625
He was not born so that he might
submit to rules or to a master.

411
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,458
This thought has occurred to me.

412
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,958
My question is this: 

413
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,541
the duties of a warrior...
Does this philosophy

414
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,791
not contradict them?

415
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,625
No, because freedom cannot
be forced into existence.

416
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,208
Nor can it be won
through painful struggle.

417
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,791
Freedom cannot
be bought or sold.

418
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,583
It has nothing to do
with one's social status.

419
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,000
One's profession
is of no consequence.

420
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,125
In order for you
to accept yourself as you are

421
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,250
and live with
your soul at peace,

422
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,083
you must simply
teach yourself to let it be.

423
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,250
Only then will you
discover freedom.

424
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,208
Those idiots.

425
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,916
A lot of terrible things
happened to me lately,

426
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,083
and it's all because of them.

427
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,500
I have to wonder at times.

428
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,375
Did I pick the right two men
to go with me on this journey?

429
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,791
Ya know?

430
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,958
[Zuikou] All encounters happen
but once in a lifetime.

431
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,916
There is no right or wrong.

432
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,250
If you have met these two men
and are traveling with them now,

433
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:37,416
then that is your destiny.
For better or worse,

434
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,625
whatever the outcome
of your journey may be.

435
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,583
[Mugen] Hey, Master Chrome Dome,

436
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,541
I'm lookin' to

437
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,500
You got any brilliant ideas?

438
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,958
I wanna beat
that freaky bastard.

439
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,083
Hey, you listenin' to me, baldy?

440
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,833
How the hell am I
supposed to beat this guy?

441
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,375
Come on!
Start talkin', cue ball.

442
00:18:59,541 --> 00:18:59,958
[Zuikou] Katsu!

443
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,166
Ow!

444
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,625
Look at that moon,
it's so big tonight.

445
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,416
[Mugen] I'm headin' out
for a bit.

446
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,916
You haven't forgotten
your promise, have you?

447
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,416
Huh?

448
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,291
The samurai who smells
of sunflowers, remember?

449
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,666
Don't forget, you said
you'd help me find him.

450
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,541
I won't forget.

451
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,500
[Jin] One other thing.

452
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,666
Hmm?

453
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,166
I shall be the one
who gets to slay you.

454
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,250
<i>[Fuu] Looking back now,</i>
<i>sure a lot</i>

455
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,875
<i>of crappy stuff has happened,</i>

456
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,958
<i>but I've experienced</i>
<i>all sorts of new things, too.</i>

457
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,333
<i>If Mugen and Jin hadn't wandered</i>
<i>into the teahouse that day,</i>

458
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,583
<i>then chances are, I'd still</i>
<i>be working there right now.</i>

459
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,208
<i>When I think of it that way,</i>

460
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,875
<i>maybe it's like</i>
<i>Father Zuikou says:</i>

461
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,666
<i>It was a once in a</i>
<i>lifetime chance encounter.</i>

462
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,125
<i>I have no idea what stands</i>
<i>between here and Nagasaki</i>

463
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,541
<i>or how much longer</i>
<i>it'll take us to get there.</i>

464
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,375
<i>I just hope</i>
<i>the three of us can keep</i>

465
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,000
<i>traveling together</i>
<i>to the very end.</i>

466
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,791
<i>I'm positive that those two are</i>
<i>thinking the exact same thing.</i>

467
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,500
<i>Yep, that's the path</i>
<i>I chose to take.</i>

468
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,583
[Mugen] You don't make up
other people's minds for them.

469
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,375
Right?

470
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,541
[Jin] Hmm.

471
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,833
<i>[Fuu] Just kidding.</i>

472
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,416
<i>I figured those two</i>
<i>might try and get a peek</i>

473
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,250
<i>at my diary without asking,</i>

474
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,500
<i>so I decided to make</i>
<i>all that stuff up.</i>

475
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,958
<i>Serves you right, you jerks.</i>

476
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,833
You--

477
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,791
[Mugen screaming]
--you little bitch!
