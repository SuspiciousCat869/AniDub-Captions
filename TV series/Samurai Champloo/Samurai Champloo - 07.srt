00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,375
[O-hatsu] Who are you?

166
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,416
[Fuu] Oh! Uh, I'm sorry!

167
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,458
That's alright. So, are you
Shinsuke's girlfriend?

168
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,166
Huh? Oh, well, I, ah...

169
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,541
[O-hatsu] I see.

170
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,791
I know what happens when
a boy reaches a certain age.

171
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,416
Uh...

172
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,500
MMMmmm! It's so good!

173
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,208
[laughing, coughing]

174
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,625
[O-hatsu] I've never seen
anyone so ecstatic

175
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,583
about eating
dried sweet potatoes.

176
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,291
Hmm? Oh, sorry.

177
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,291
[O-hatsu]  If you like them that
much, please, eat all you want.

178
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,625
Thank you, ma'am!

179
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,833
You know, I'm still amazed
that Shinsuke found

180
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,041
such a nice girlfriend.

181
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,541
Oh, that. Actually--

182
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,458
You see,
his father left long ago,

183
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,666
and I've never been
in good health,

184
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,375
and that's made life
difficult for him.

185
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,333
At his age, his parents should
be taking care of him,

186
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,708
not the other way around.
Well, enough of that.

187
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,958
I'm glad he's doing things
normal for a boy his age.

188
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,416
I was wondering.

189
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,125
Has he talked to you
about what he's planning to do?

190
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,375
Huh? A-About what?

191
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,375
[O-hatsu] Oh, n-nevermind.
I-It's just that, well,

192
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,708
something seems
to be bothering him.

193
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,916
He hasn't been himself lately.

194
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,166
[Shinsuke] I give her the
medicine everyday, doctor.

195
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,000
Just the way you told me to,

196
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,541
but she doesn't ever
seem to get better.

197
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,458
[Doctor] I never said
it would cure her.

198
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,791
Considering her condition, about
the best you could hope for

199
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,833
is that it'll help her regain
some of her strength.

200
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,208
There's nothing else
I could do for her.

201
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,958
You can't afford to get anything
that would be more effective,

202
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,250
I'm afraid.

203
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,541
There are better medicines
available of course,

204
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,458
korean ginseng for example,

205
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,000
but it costs nearly
a hundred times as much

206
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,000
as the medicine
she's taking now.

207
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,166
Do you understand?

208
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,500
[Shinsuke breathing harshly]

209
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,833
I'm sorry, but I am
running a business here.

210
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,500
[people talking]

211
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,000
[Kogoro] Hey you!
Is your name Hikoichi?

212
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,583
Huh? What do you want?

213
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,708
There's a little something
I'm looking for.

214
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,458
What makes you think I got it?

215
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,166
[Kogoro] I happen
to know it's too big

216
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,583
for a small-time fence
like you to handle.

217
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,916
Yeah?

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,416
Stop playin' dumb.

219
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,041
I know who you
met with yesterday.

220
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,125
Your pal the pickpocket.

221
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,166
Huh? Who's that?

222
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,708
[menacing laughter]

223
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,208
Huh? Wh-Whaddya doin'?

224
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,541
[Kogoro laughing]

225
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,833
In a little while you're gonna
tell us everything you know.

226
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,541
I told ya, I don't
know the guy. Honest.

227
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:31,041
[screaming]
Ahhhh! No! Stop! Put it out!

228
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,625
You see? You're a lot
more talkative now.

229
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,000
Hey you!

230
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,041
Hmm?

231
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,666
Look at me.
You remember who I am?

232
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,958
Why, should I?

233
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,916
I'm the girl whose
purse you stole, you jerk.

234
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,208
You aren't going
anywhere, buddy.

235
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:53,875
Let go.

236
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,208
Ha! The hell I will.

237
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,125
Damn you.

238
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,666
[Juukichi] Hey there.

239
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:04,166
[Kogoro] You're a hard man to
find. You've been a naughty boy.

240
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,208
You should return
what doesn't belong to you.

241
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,666
[Fuu] Who the heck are you guys?

242
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,958
Be careful missy,
just stay out of my way

243
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,166
and don't even think about
screaming for help.

244
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,125
--[screaming] Help me somebody!
--Huh? You crazy bitch.

245
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,500
[Fuu screaming]
Somebody help me!

246
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,208
Boss!

247
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,791
[Kogoro] You son of a--

248
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,000
[Daikichi] Why you little...!

249
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,333
[distant whistle blowing]

250
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,166
What's going on?

251
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,791
The heat! We're outta here.

252
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,791
[whistle blowing]

253
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,791
[people gasping]

254
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,833
[Policeman 2]
What's going on here?

255
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,875
You! What's this all about?

256
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,208
[Shinsuke] Damn it.

257
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,083
Back off.

258
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,791
Don't come any closer.
If you do I'll cut her throat,

259
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,083
I swear I will!

260
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,083
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

261
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,083
[crowd talking excitedly]

262
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,666
Drop the knife
and give yourself up!

263
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,458
Kiss my ass! I'm warning you,
one step closer and she dies.

264
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,791
You got that?

265
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,041
You hear me out there?
All of you back off right now

266
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,875
or this girl is gonna bite it!

267
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,500
Oh, you're bleeding--

268
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,125
You keep quiet.

269
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,583
Yeah, but--

270
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,666
It's no big deal. Move!

271
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,291
[crowd talking]

272
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,958
What do you want us
to do now boss?

273
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,458
Should we storm the place
and grab the guy?

274
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,750
You nuts. Use your head
for once, dimwit.

275
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,291
There are too many cops around.

276
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,333
If we tried to get the stuff
back they'd spot us for sure.

277
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,333
Does it hurt much?

278
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,583
Nah, it's nuthin' all right?

279
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,333
That look on your face says
otherwise. Let me take a look.

280
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,166
You don't get it, do ya?

281
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,208
I'll kill you if I have to.
You understand what I'm sayin'?

282
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,458
By the way I met
your mother yesterday.

283
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,666
Huh?

284
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,375
I imagine it would
break her heart

285
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,958
if she knew you were a thief.

286
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,541
Didya' ...tell her
I'm a pickpocket?

287
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,291
Of course not, how could I?

288
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,583
I wouldn't want to make
a good mom like that

289
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,375
worry about her son.

290
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,291
Don't talk like you know
what I'm going through.

291
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,500
But I do.

292
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:38,791
You should be grateful
that your mother's alive.

293
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,625
[Shinsuke] Where are
your parents anyways?

294
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,541
[Fuu] My father hasn't
been around for a long time,

295
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,291
and my mother died a year ago.

296
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:57,375
When she was alive I used to
disobey her all the time.

297
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,875
Make her worry about me
all the time.

298
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,500
All the things I really
wanted to tell her,

299
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,416
that I wanted to ask her,

300
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,458
and now...
now I'll never be able to.

301
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,375
What I need is money.

302
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,958
Huh?

303
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,125
So I tried to find a job, but
none of the legitimate places

304
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,333
would hire a stupid kid like me.

305
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,166
The only people who say money
doesn't matter are the ones who

306
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,625
have more money
than they'll ever need.

307
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,208
Without money, you can't even
buy good medicine.

308
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,958
The kind that heals the sick.

309
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,958
And that's the ugly truth
of how the world works.

310
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,125
[Policeman 1, outside]
Listen, you criminal!

311
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,750
This is your final warning.

312
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,291
If you don't come out and
surrender to the authorities

313
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,916
before sundown, we'll come in
and take you by force.

314
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,958
You got that?

315
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,041
So what's the deal?

316
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,375
Well you see,

317
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,958
there's a girl who's being
held hostage in there.

318
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,666
There she is!

319
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,041
[Mugen] That little...!

320
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,333
Guess that explains why
we haven't seen her all day.

321
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,083
Look.

322
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,166
