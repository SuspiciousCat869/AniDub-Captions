00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,958
I'm a secret agent.

162
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,625
For generations I worked
for a certain feudal domain.

163
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,750
You're kidding.
So you were a ninja?

164
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,083
[Kagemaru] 'Fraid so.

165
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,916
You see, Kyushu has always
had a lotta dealings

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,583
with foreign countries.

167
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,708
So we been doing our research

168
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,000
on those countries
for generations.

169
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,750
But then the national isolation
policy went into effect

170
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,916
and our domain was
pretty much crushed.

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,500
[Fuu] Hmm...

172
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,958
[Manzou] <i>And so they learned</i>
<i>the rules of the game.</i>

173
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,250
<i>In a single night, they</i>
<i>were given a crash course</i>

174
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,250
<i>in the art of baseball.</i>

175
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,750
<i>At this point, things</i>
<i>get rather boring,</i>

176
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,916
<i>so I'll skip the details.</i>

177
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,208
Huh? Freeze!

178
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,875
Howdy.

179
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,125
[Soldier 1]
Who are you?

180
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:33,125
Who? Who-ho-ho.

181
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,625
[Soldier 2]
Who are you?

182
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,625
Oh, I'm an American.
Yankee Doodle.

183
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,750
Shut up!

184
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,750
[Manzou yells]

185
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,625
[Ichiemon]
Here it is,

186
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,875
the matchup of the
century is underway.

187
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,500
The national prestige of America
and Japan is on the line!

188
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,166
My name is Ichiemon,

189
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,791
announcing the play-by-play
for today's game.

190
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,500
Question: aren't we
a few players short?

191
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,833
That won't be a problem.
Don't worry about it.

192
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,541
[Soldier 1] Hey look.

193
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,541
They even let dogs
play baseball here?

194
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,208
Fantastic! That's the
mystical orient for ya.

195
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,208
[laughter]

196
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,041
What'd you just say?

197
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,875
Everyone here is
a full-fledged player.

198
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,875
I can't find dogs
in the rulebook.

199
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,833
It doesn't say they can't play.

200
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,583
Okay!

201
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,166
[Ichiemon]
It's the first pitch. Play ball!

202
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,750
Doubleday is on the mound,
and he lets it rip.

203
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:38,958
Bunt!

204
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,666
[Americans yell]

205
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,166
[coughing]

206
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,375
[Doubleday]
Ninja baseball...

207
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,541
[Ichiemon] The next
batter to step to the plate

208
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,083
is Jin.

209
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,333
Holy cow, he's using
a "gedan" sword stance.

210
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:59,208
Can he successfully apply
this technique to baseball?

211
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,541
He connects!
It's a shot to center field.

212
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,583
That was great, Jin! Heh, ha!

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,625
[Ichiemon]
Now Mugen steps to the plate

214
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,250
with no outs and runners
on first and second.

215
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,708
And this batter is using
a two-sword technique.

216
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,916
The pitcher goes into his
stretch, and--what's this?

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,875
They've decided to
intentionally walk him.

218
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,500
Huh?

219
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,750
Wow!

220
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:30,583
[splash]

221
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,916
[Mugen yells]

222
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,541
[Umpire]
You're out!

223
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,916
[Mugen] Huh?

224
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,833
[Ichiemon] Mugen makes a
critical base running error

225
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,416
and passes the runner
in front of him. He's out!

226
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,416
Geez!

227
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,708
[Ichiemon]
The next batter is Fuu,

228
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,958
the only female on the team.

229
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,750
Bring it on.

230
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,000
[Umpire] Strike.

231
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,958
Strike.

232
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,875
Strike 3, you're out!

233
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,333
Aww...

234
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,458
Three pitches and
she's out on strikes.

235
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,416
The next batter up is the
village consul, at age 80,

236
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,458
he's far and away the
oldest player on the team.

237
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,250
[Machidoshiyori yells]

238
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,083
[Fuu] Hey, Mister!

239
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,291
It's alright.

240
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:20,500
Step over my corpse and move
on to a brighter tomorrow.

241
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,083
You can't!

242
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,875
[ding]

243
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,625
[Ichiemon]
The next batter steps up.

244
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,916
The dog...?

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,833
[Fuu] Oh come on, there's no way
an animal can hit the ball.

246
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,000
Don't worry about it,
he won't have to hit the ball.

247
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:36,750
[Fuu] Huh?

248
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,875
[Umpire]
Ball. Ball. Ball.

249
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,291
[Ichiemon] The pitcher can't
seem to find the strike zone.

250
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,791
Exactly.

251
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,625
It's because the animal's strike
zone is incredibly small.

252
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,041
All he has to do is stand there
with the bat in his mouth

253
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,916
and he'll get walked.

254
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,458
[Ichiemon]
And here comes the fourth pitch.

255
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,083
[dog yelps]

256
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,708
Huh?

257
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,375
[Kagemaru]
He's runnin' away!

258
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,000
[Fuu] Momo!

259
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,916
[Kagemaru] Damn. What do
you expect from an animal?

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
[Manzou] Hmm...

261
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,583
What's going on here?

262
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:17,208
Why's a ball game being
held in secret like this?

263
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,958
Huh?

264
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,500
Who are you?

265
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,666
Maybe I'm a baseball
fan just passing by.

266
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,708
Although to be honest,
that's not the truth.

267
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,041
We're short on players,
so grab a bat.

268
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,083
Huh?!

269
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,625
[Ichiemon] A pinch hitter
has entered the game.

270
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,750
Looks like a baseball
fan who was passing by.

271
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,958
What's this?!

272
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,458
His first at-bat and
he's calling a homerun.

273
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,416
Who is this player?
Where did he come from?

274
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,583
[Kagemaru] <i>Bunt.</i>

275
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,083
Mm-Hmm.

276
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,666
[Ichiemon]
And Doubleday delivers.

277
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,750
[Manzou yells]

278
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,166
[Umpire] Strike.

279
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,166
[Kagemaru grunts]

280
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,583
[Kagemaru] <i>Moron.</i>

281
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,750
<i>Wrong. Didn't you</i>
<i>understand me? I said bunt.</i>

282
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,958
<i>Bunt.</i>

283
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,583
Mm-Hmm...

284
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,583
--[Ichiemon] And here comes
-- <i>Bunt.</i>

285
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,208
--the second pitch.
-- <i>Bunt.</i>

286
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,208
[Umpire] Strike 2.

287
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,208
Stupid son of a--

288
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,541
<i>Moron. Dumbass. Bunt, dammit.</i>

289
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,916
<i>Bunt!</i>

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,791
<i>Or you're dead.</i>

291
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,708
Mm-Hmm...

292
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,000
[Ichiemon]
The count's 0 and 2,

293
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,875
and the pitcher
goes into his windup,

294
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,833
trying to put him away.

295
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,791
Ahhh!

296
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,416
No!

297
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,791
[Ichiemon]
The Japanese team is hot today,

298
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,791
while the American
players take a time-out

299
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,916
for a conference on the mound.

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,500
Son of a bitch.

301
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,083
Freakin' Japs.

302
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:55,375
It's time for us to teach these
savages how we do things.

303
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,208
Take an eye for an eye.

304
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:01,208
Show 'em the American way.
All the way.

305
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,500
[Umpire]
Play ball!

306
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:04,791
Ball.

307
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,875
A-Ahh!

308
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,791
[Umpire] Ball.

309
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,958
Bastards.

310
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,416
So they gonna play dirty, huh?

311
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,083
[Kagemaru] Ahh!

312
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,625
Ahhhh!

313
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,583
[Soldier 4]
Here it comes.

314
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,666
[Manzou yells]

315
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,083
[Soldier 4] Amen.

316
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,333
[Manzou]
Hey, I'm still alive.

317
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,750
[Manzou yells]

318
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,375
Manzou is dead,
but freedom will never die.

319
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,375
[ding]

320
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,750
Cheaters.

321
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,208
Hey umpire!

322
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,250
Paid him off.

323
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,166
[Ichiemon] The pitcher sets,
and here comes the pitch to Jin.

324
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,541
Ha!

325
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,333
[Ichiemon]
Holy cow he's fast.

326
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,166
He's going for an inside
the park homerun!

327
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:12,958
Huh?

328
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,541
What the--?

329
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,583
[Jin groans]

330
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,250
I... am ashamed.

331
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,166
[ding]

332
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,416
[Umpire]
You're out!

333
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,541
That's three.
Side's retired. Batter up.

334
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:34,500
[wind blows]

335
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,833
[Mugen]
You stay outta this.

336
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,416
[Kagemaru]
Hold on. I ain't dead yet.

337
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,750
They're not gonna stop me
from takin' the mound,

338
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:54,166
and I ain't comin' down until
they're out or my arm falls off.

339
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,666
[Ichiemon]
It's the bottom of the inning,

340
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,125
and the American team
is coming up to bat,

341
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,125
but the Japanese team has
been decimated by injuries.

342
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,791
They're down to a pitcher
and a first baseman.

343
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,708
What in the world
do they hope to do?

344
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,625
[Mugen yells]

345
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,958
[Umpire]
You're out!

346
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,250
God damn...

347
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,416
[Ichiemon] The next batter
is Commodore Joey Cartright.

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,208
[Fuu]
Get out of the way! Watch out!

349
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,625
Come on.

350
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,375
[Kagemaru groans]

351
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,208
[Kagemaru]
<i>I die with no regrets.</i>

352
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,250
[Umpire]
You're out!

353
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,583
[ding]

354
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,500
[Ichiemon] Things have
really gotten serious

355
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,291
here in the bottom
of the inning.

356
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,375
The Japanese team now has
only one player remaining.

357
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,916
How in the world does he intend

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,791
to keep fighting when
it's nine against one?

359
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,041
[Doubleday laughs]

360
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,666
It's not even a contest,
this game's in the bag.

361
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,500
'Gainst a bunch of pansy
ass girls like you,

362
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,541
one of me is more than enough!

363
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,791
Mugen goes into his
windup for the pitch. Uh...

364
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,041
Huh? What in the
world is he doing?

365
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:20,958
What the hell?

366
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,000
That's a balk! A balk!

367
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,458
What?

368
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:31,708
Ball. Ball. Ball.

369
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:32,833
Ball four.

370
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,916
[Ichiemon]
His plan has gone to pieces.

371
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,875
Not only does the pitcher
have no control,

372
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,291
at this point he seems to be
having difficulty standing.

373
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:44,166
Alright then. Guess I'll
try throwing it normally.

374
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,625
Yah!

375
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,125
[tree falls]

376
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,791
That was unbelievable.

377
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,250
No human being could
possibly hit a pitch like that.

378
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,583
[crack]

379
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,750
[Umpire]
Take ya base.

380
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,000
Yah!

381
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,125
God help us.
This isn't baseball anymore.

382
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,208
This is madness.

383
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,625
[Ichiemon] Amazing, the American
team's roster is decimated.

384
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,833
They're down to
one last player.

385
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,666
This game has been reduced
to a one-on-one battle.

386
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,291
It's man against man.

387
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,541
I'm not going to lose to you.

388
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,791
I won't let that
happen no matter what.

389
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,000
America cannot afford
to lose this game.

390
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,541
[Doubleday and Mugen yell]

391
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,833
Ahhh...!

392
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,541
[Ichiemon]
I can't believe it!

393
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,166
Both of the players are down!

394
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,916
How on Earth do we
decide the outcome?

395
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,833
Will this go down in the record
books as an incomplete game?

396
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,958
[Mugen grunts]

397
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,375
Jesus.

398
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,416
Friggin' kamikaze...

399
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,625
Listen up, ya damn Yankees.

400
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,666
Now I wanna see
a little hustle.

401
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,458
Go back to your own country!

402
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,708
[Ichiemon]
He's back on his feet,

403
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,208
and the American team
has no players left.

404
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:48,083
It's a forfeit. The game
is over! The game is over!

405
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,625
