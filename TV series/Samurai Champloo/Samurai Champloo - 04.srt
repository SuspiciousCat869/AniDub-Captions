disposing of their rulers.

But not this ruler. With
you under my command,

they wouldn't dare, which
preserves the natural order.

00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,750
So the power you're talking
about is the power to control

by using my skills and my
strength, I can get whatever

161
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,708
[Heitaro] Very well.

162
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,291
[Sosuke] Huh?

163
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,666
If I win, you will spare my son.
If I lose, one death will atone

164
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,833
for the other and I will never
see my son alive again.

165
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,125
[Heitaro] On one condition.

166
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,541
[Rikiei] What's that?

167
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,833
In the interest of fairness,
my gang will provide

168
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,458
the dice roller for the game.

169
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,916
The Nagatomi Gang
will provide the dice.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,250
You're sure?

171
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,583
He knows what it means
to be yakuza.

172
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,708
Outlaws must always be prepared
to pay the ultimate price.

173
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,625
I'm looking forward to our game.

174
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:24,333
[thundering]

175
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,250
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

176
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,041
You promised you
wouldn't kill each other.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That little bitch.

178
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,416
[Rikiei chuckling]
That dumb bastard.

179
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,958
Soon his territory
will be mine legally.

180
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,291
I don't understand.

181
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,458
All I need to do is lose,
which I'll prearrange.

182
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,125
Give him back his son
and take his territory.

183
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,041
Yeah, but what about
the dice roller?

184
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,500
We agreed to use theirs.

185
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,583
Not to worry. Their dice
roller's gonna be a no show.

186
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,583
[Kawara Gang 1]
It doesn't make any sense, Boss.

187
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,958
You lose even if you win.

188
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,416
[Kawara Gang 2] It's to
their advantage either way.

189
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,958
[Heitaro] Nevertheless,
atonement must be made.

190
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,125
But Boss, if you lose
then Sosuke will have to die.

191
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:06,875
Please, Boss.

192
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,500
Don't do this.

193
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,750
[Fuu] A big wager?

194
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,166
[Prostitute] Yeah, I heard a
couple of guys talking about it.

195
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,208
They said the
Nagatomis and Kawaras

196
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,166
are putting their
gangs on the line.

197
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,208
What do you think will happen
to us if the Kawaras win?

198
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,750
Why? You think they're
gonna let us go free?

199
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,666
Don't be so naïve.

200
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,333
There's gonna be a gang war?

201
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,166
[Prostitute] You got it honey.

202
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,666
[Jin] For yesterday, Old Man.

203
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,750
[Shop Owner] You don't want
to catch a cold, do you?

204
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,000
Thank you.

205
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,041
Where do you think you're going?

206
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,541
[Heitaro] In the yakuza,

207
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,541
confrontation is
part of our lives.

208
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,750
Over the years I've killed
countless men toward whom

209
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,875
I've harbored no ill will.

210
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,791
The price I've paid is the loss
of precious friends and family.

211
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,750
Yes, I've seen more than
enough blood in my time.

212
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:18,458
So now this gang exists
for one reason.

213
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,041
For the sake of the young men
who are its members.

214
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,625
In the end,
we're simply outlaws.

215
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:29,291
Human beings who can't get by
in respectable human society.

216
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,375
There have always
been people cast aside

217
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,000
by the rest of the world.

218
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:37,916
Many years ago I realized people
like that have difficult lives.

219
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,250
They need looking after
by someone responsible like me.

220
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,625
But when Ishimatsu
joined up with the Nagatomis,

221
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,666
I thought to myself,
"Perhaps this is the right time.

222
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,416
Perhaps I should make
the decision to step down."

223
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,833
I admit that with skills such
as yours you might very well

224
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,375
be able to kill Rikiei. But
that would solve nothing.

225
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,125
It would just lead
to a new round of reprisals.

226
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:08,375
So please let me handle this
matter in my own way, alright?

227
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,250
This is for Sosuke.

228
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:27,166
[women chatting charmingly]

229
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,291
[Osuzu] Hey, Fuu,
what are you doing?

230
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,333
[Fuu] Can't you tell?

231
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,833
Instead of attracting customers,
I'm scaring them away.

232
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,291
If we don't get any
customers, we'll be fired

233
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,583
and we can leave, right?

234
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,958
Oh?

235
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,541
Don't give me that "oh"
stuff. You do it too.

236
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,833
[Guest] Wow,
what a perfect face!

237
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:45,833
Huh?

238
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,875
You're just what
I was looking for.

239
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,166
I want you to look at me
like that and then tell me

240
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,208
I'm a naughty boy.

241
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,833
You gotta be kidding, right?

242
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,916
[Guest] That's the look.
Just like that.

243

to come here today to act

as your witness.
It is an honor to serve you.

Where is the
bodyguard you hired?

263

He quit the gang.

I imagine he's
left town by now.

265

Both parties please
present your wagers.

[Oryu] There will be one throw,

there be no delays.

[Nagatomi 2] Doesn't look
like he's arrived yet.

He's quite late. I wonder
what could be keeping him.

Where's the dice roller?

call in one of our substitutes.

00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,833
[Rikiei] What?

320
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,541
[Heitaro] I will not force my
adopted children to suffer

321
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,541
under the likes of you.
Nor will I surrender

322
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,125
my territory to you.

323
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,916
[Rikiei growling]
What is this?

324
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,208
I agreed to give you

325
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,041
a life to atone for the
life that was taken.

326
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,583
[Heitaro] I atone
for that life with my own.

Father!

[Rikiei laughing]

331
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,125
How pathetic. What a useless
display of outdated melodrama.

332
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,833
All this for nothing.

333
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:15,958
Nothing?

334
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,000
My dad gave his life
to honor the code

335
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,500
of the yakuza to the end.

336
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:24,375
[Sosuke] But you're not yakuza!
You're nothing but thugs!

337
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,125
I like being a thug.

338
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:30,083
Enjoy your territory kid,
'cause it won't be yours long.

339
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,500
[Rikiei] You fool. You threw
your life away for nothing.

340
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:37,541
Careful now. Hold it right there
mister hotshot bodyguard.

341
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,125
Don't even think about it.

Huh?

You're back.

345
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,250
What are you doing here?

346
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,833
[Mugen] I noticed nobody
was coming after me.

347
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,458
So I came after
you guys instead.

348
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,125
[Rikiei] Don't you care
if this kid lives or dies?

349
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,000
Nah, can't really say I do.

Ishimatsu, where you going?

355
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,416
You gotta get back in there
and kill those guys.

[sudden impact]

357
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,166
You never trusted me
because I used to be

358
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,166
a member of the Kawara Gang.

359
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,958
The other guys either.
You never trusted anyone.

360
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,458
The only thing you ever really
had faith in was money.

Ishimatsu.

362

I finally saw him
for what he was.

[Sosuke] This was my father's.

[Jin] He asked me
to give it to you.

365
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,916
Ishimatsu, will you
come back to us someday?

366
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,583
[Ishimatsu] Sosuke.

367
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,916
I'm certain it's what
my father would have done.

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,541
Thanks for the offer,
but I want to keep honoring

00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,583
the outlaw code.
I don't want to turn into

00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,166
one of those thugs
you were talking about.

371
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,625
Once I've atoned for what
I've done, I'll be happy

372
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,583
to take you up on that offer.

We need to settle things.

00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,208
[Osuzu] Thanks so much
for all your help.

I'm really happy for you, Osuzu.

Come back here

[Jin] Yeah.

But we gotta find the
Sunflower Samurai first, okay?

00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,833
[Mugen] Problem is,
I don't really know

383
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,875
how to hold back, you know?
