the whole town would be
in an uproar over it by now.

stay, you're all quite welcome

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,791
[Jin] The security
in this village

163
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,958
seems to be very
tight for its size.

164
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,958
Nothin' to get worked up about.

165
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,500
Let's hope not.

166
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:50,166
[multiple footsteps]

167
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,541
[multiple footsteps]

168
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,333
[running footsteps]

169
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,250
[Jin] Hey, are you in there?

170
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:32,583
[voices cheering]

171
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:38,041
[People in the crowd]
Saint Xavier! Saint Xavier!

172
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:42,166
[Xavier Yo] Thank you!

173
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,791
Okay, everyone, please listen.

174
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,875
For many years, it was
believed that you could

175
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,291
gain entry into the
holy land of Heaven

176
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,583
simply by believing in God.

177
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,041
But alas, those days
exist no more.

178
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,166
Heaven has become overpopulated.

179
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,833
The land of salvation
is not infinite.

180
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,250
And it is no longer possible
for just anyone to get in.

181
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,625
But fear not, for I have
your key to the gates of Heaven,

182
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,958
and it is this gun!

183
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,291
You see, whether or not you're
able to enter the Promised Land

184
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,583
is dependent on
your ability to produce

185
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,916
the divine weapons
you see before you.

186
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
These words are
indeed righteous and true,

187
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,541
declared by my grandfather,
Francisco Xavier!

188
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,500
[Crowd cheering]

189
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,916
Huh...?

190
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,250
Look who we have here.

191
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,541
[Suzukichi]
So what do you think?

192
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,833
If these bad boys
were European imports,

193
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,875
they'd probably
cost you around twenty ryo.

194
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,625
But you're a first time buyer,
so I'll cut you a deal

195
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,291
and let you
have 'em for fifteen.

196
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,791
[Kuroihara] I gotta say, I like
the way that you do business.

197
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,833
Why don't you consider this
my first installment?

198
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,333
[Yuri] Why are you doing this?

199
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,916
Just what do you think
that you're gonna get out of it?

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,041
Money, and lots of it!

201
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,375
Let me tell you,
it's hard to find

202
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,708
a more profitable
venture than religion.

203
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,958
Simply mention God's name, and
you can get away with anything.

204
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,291
And by working with
the underground Christians,

205
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,083
my risk of exposure
is virtually zero.

206
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,166
You can't imagine
how grateful I am to God.

207
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,666
Take a good look around.

208
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,500
I have such
a fabulous collection.

209
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:05,000
Shotoku Taishi's dentures--
five thousand ryo.

210
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,083
The three arrows
of Motonari Mouri,

211
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,541
which comes complete with a
certificate of authenticity,

212
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,583
and it cost me
seven thousand ryo!

213
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:15,000
Sojun Ikkyu's folding screen-
twenty thousand ryo.

214
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,041
Nobunaga's sandals,
the very ones

215
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,291
Hideyoshi held
to his chest to warm up.

216
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,625
Now this one's unique,

217
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,208
for it's two famous people
in just one item,

218
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,125
and it cost thirty thousand ryo.

219
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,166
It's true.

220
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,875
No matter how much
money you make,

221
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,541
it's still never enough
to keep you satisfied.

222
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,875
Do you really think that
my love is just another thing

223
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:34,916
that you can buy?

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,791
[laughing] Why yes indeed, I do.

225
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:41,208
I don't know why poor people are
always resistant to this fact,

226
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,916
but you see, there is
absolutely nothing out there

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,291
money can't buy.

228
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,958
And I'm afraid
that truth applies

229
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,291
to someone's love as well.

230
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,875
Like it or not,
my feisty little peasant girl,

231
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,625
you're going
to become my wife.

232
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,333
I won't.

233
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,041
Young lady, do you want to meet
the same unfortunate fate

234
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,166
that your father met?

235
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,458
In my experience,
when money fails,

236
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,875
violence becomes
an excellent alternative.

237
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,083
Well, come on now.

238
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,541
Isn't it in moments like this

239
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,333
you are supposed
to turn the other cheek?

240
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,750
[Fuu] You got it, Momo?

241
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,416
It's up to you to get them
this message, okay?

242
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,916
[squeaking]

243
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,666
[Fuu] Yuri! Are you alright?

244
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,041
Oh, Fuu, what are you
doing in here?

245
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,625
[Xavier Yo] I will give you
until nightfall.

246
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,541
Perhaps tonight you
will be my bride.

247
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,875
Or perhaps tonight you
will breathe your last breath.

248
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:50,958
Whatever it is,
the choice is yours. [laughing]

249
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,125
I can't believe that I've gotten
you mixed up in all this.

250
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,000
[Fuu] No, no, that's not it.

251
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,083
I came here, 'cause there's
something I wanted to ask you.

252
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,958
I have to know about someone,

253
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,375
about the samurai who
smells of sunflowers.

254
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:17,000
[Mugen yells]

255
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,583
You mangy furball.

256
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,958
Hold on. I've seen
that furry mug before.

257
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,458
Hey.

258
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,500
[Mugen] Hey! Yo!

259
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,291
This is between
me and the rat.

260
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,208
I believe this flying
squirrel is Fuu's pet.

261
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,000
She's got a pet?

262
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,500
[Mugen] Well, it'da been nice,
if she'da told us

263
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,666
where the hell
we can find her!

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,541
[Yuri] Ikitsuki Island
was a wonderful place.

265
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,833
It was like a sanctuary
for us Christians.

266
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,500
Trying to escape from
years of persecution,

267
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,916
the underground
Christians began

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
to show up on
the island in droves.

269
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,500
My father and I
were among them.

270
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,875
As was Seizo, also known

271
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,000
as the samurai who
smelled of sunflowers.

272
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,000
Confusion rose from the chaos,

273
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,083
and people scattered
into the night.

274
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,583
We fled to where we are now.

275
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:26,916
After that night,
I never saw Seizo again.

276
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,833
So do you have any idea
where he is now?

277
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,250
I'm afraid I don't.

278
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,458
All of that happened
so many years ago.

279
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't know if he's
still on the island,

280
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,375
or if he died that night.

281
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,458
[Kuroihara] The next
stepping stone test

282
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,125
will be in Shimonoseki.

283
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,041
Can I expect that to be
just as entertaining?

284
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,625
[Suzukichi] Well it seems
the bigger spectacle we make,

285
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,708
the more new believers
we create.

286
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,958
Give our best
to the governor, will you?

287
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,833
[Mugen] So, that whole act of
yours is just a sham, huh?

288
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,583
Hey, who in the hell
are you two guys?

289
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,916
Too slow.

290
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We're looking for our companion.

291
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,208
Nuh-uh!

292
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,625
How 'bout you be nice
and show us where she's at?

293
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,875
[Fuu] So, were you and your
father still together when

294
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,583
you ended up in this area?

295
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,500
My father is...

296
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,916
...is dead now.

297
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,541
That Xavier man...
is the one who killed him.

298
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,000
[Yuri] My father was a gunsmith.

299
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,000
He found out that Xavier the
Third was secretly negotiating

300
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,166
with the lords within the area.

301
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,875
Xavier had him silenced...

302
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,583
forever.

303
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:41,541
Perhaps this is the fate
that we must endure.

304
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,916
I'm sorry.

305
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,625
[Yuri] I tried to escape
from this place,

306
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,291
just as soon
as I had the chance.

307
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,666
But I was captured.

308
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,833
I'm beginning to think
that this is all just

309
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,708
an enormous trial,
meant to test my faith.

310
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:56,083
[footsteps]

311
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,458
[Xavier Yo] So, have you
made your decision yet?

312
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:02,041
Hurry, the party
will be starting soon.

313
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,708
[Xavier Yo] Now, make your vows
before the eyes of God

314
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,458
and all those
standing before you

315
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:16,875
that you will be faithful to me
in sickness and infirmity.

316
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,000
[Fuu] She'll do no such thing!

317
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,083
She won't do it, ya big creep!

318
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,416
The devil's voice dwells
within this young girl!

319
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,166
Execute her at once and
save her soul while you can.

320
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,333
This poor child
is overcome by demons.

321
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,208
We must exorcise them at once.

322
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,958
[Crowd worrying]
Demons! Demons?

323
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,625
Please don't, I beg you.

324
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,375
[Fuu] No, Yuri, please,
please don't let this man

325
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,541
do this to you.

326
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,750
Do what your heart
tells you to do.

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,833
I'm not going
to go through with this.

328
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,708
I'm not going
to become your wife.

329
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,041
I'd rather die first!

330
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,416
What'd you say to me?

331
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,416
I asked you a question!

332
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,000
[Crowd gasping]

333
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,375
[Xavier Yo] You must be punished
for your betrayal against God.

334
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't you dare.

335
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,541
[Xavier Yo] Foul demons, I'm
going to send the two of you

336
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,791
back to Hell where you belong.

337
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,916
Die, devils!

338
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,500
[man screaming]

339
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,625
Mugen! Jin!

340
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,208
Who are these intruders?

341
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,625
Hey, you're that whackjob
from the checkpoint.

342
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,875
You deceive these people
with your histrionics,

343
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,958
then racketeer these firearms.

344
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,416
The gig is over, Boss.

345
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,000
Those guys were watchin' us
make the whole deal.

346
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,125
They saw?

347
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,666
[Crowd worrying]
Racketeer?

348
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,333
[Crowd worrying]
What's he mean by illegal guns?

349
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,833
[Crowd worrying]
Is this true?

350
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,625
[Crowd worrying] He's not
a Christian, don't believe him.

351
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:42,583
It's a lie, they're just trying
to slander us! All of them!

352
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,416
[Crowd screaming]

353
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,916
Shoot that man!

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,958
[gunfire and screaming]

355
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,416
Missed me!

356
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,833
Oh, my God!

357
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,125
[Crowd gasping]

358
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,208
[Crowd] Look, he's Japanese!
That can't be right.

359
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,458
We can see
who you truly are now.

360
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,041
You're obviously
not the descendant

361
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,833
of Francisco Xavier, are you?

362
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,208
He's found a way to turn a
profit by exploiting all of you

363
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,666
under the pretense that
you're doing it for God.

364
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,000
[Crowd] Then he's not truly
a servant of our Lord? Oh no!

365
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,458
[accent gone] Now hold on,
everyone, please calm down.

366
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,208
So yes, it turns out
that I'm actually Japanese.

367
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,791
But wasn't I able
to save you all,

368
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,541
solely because
you believed in me?

369
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,916
So doesn't that mean that
no matter where I hail from,

370
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,583
I'm still your savior?

371
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,750
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but a savior's supposed to

372
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,958
bear the cross
of those he saved.

373
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,916
Okay, yes, you're right.

374
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,833
I shouldn't have
said that. I'm sorry.

375
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,333
I repent for my sins.

376
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:01,000
I was wrong.
So please, forgive me.

377
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,625
[gun shot]

378
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,208
Just kidding!

379
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,541
[Xavier Yo] As if I'd
really repent to a bunch of

380
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,041
mindless morons.

381
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,375
I'm sick of it.

382
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,666
I'm sick of you people
and your "God, God, God."

383
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,375
You only turn to God when
you want something from Him.

384
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,875
Well if you love Him so much,

385
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,250
then allow me to send you all
straight to His doorstep.

386
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,250
[Xavier Yo] Amen.

387
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,708
[Yuri] You're going to
Ikitsuki Island, aren't you?

388
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,166
[Fuu] Yeah.

389
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,375
I'll pray for you.

390
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,791
Good luck. May you find

391
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,083
the samurai who
smells of sunflowers,

392
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,375
even if it isn't Seizo.

393
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,958
Thanks.

394
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,666
Hey, you know it might be nice
if you told us who this guy is.

395
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,666
It would be easier
to find him if we knew.

396
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,250
Alright then.

397
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,250
The truth of it is...

398
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,541
He's actually my father.

399
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,708
[Fuu] Well, goodbye Yuri.

400
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,333
Take care, Fuu.

401
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,500
[Fuu] Alright you two,
let's get goin'.

402
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,750
May the grace of God
be with you on your journey.

403
