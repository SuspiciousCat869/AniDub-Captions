00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,125
So you came after all.

166
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,833
Huh?

167
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,958
You and me head to
Roppongi Hill, how 'bout it?

168
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,541
[snoring]

169
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,500
[liquid being poured]

170
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,875
[Mugen] What the hell
is this stuff? It's red.

171
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,708
It's called grape wine.

172
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,833
It's a drink that comes
from beyond the sea.

173
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,666
Aah. It's wonderful.

174
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,708
How fitting. A beautiful drink
for beautiful lips.

175
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,250
I believe if you wish
to have beautiful eyes,

176
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,166
then you should gaze upon
beautiful things.

177
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,416
No matter how
deeply wounded you are,

178
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,833
it's never so deep that the
power of love can't heal it.

179
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,375
Remember, when a woman
blossoms into her true self,

180
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,333
that's when she experiences the
ultimate in sophistication.

181
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:50,041
Oh, lately I've been
longing for the touch of a man.

182
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,250
However, my policy is to
only drink with boys

183
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,291
who are better at
holding their liquor than I...

184
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,958
I think I'll have another.

185
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,166
[Mugen] Don't forget me.

186
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,500
Oh, so you're a drinker.

187
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,500
Your friend here
is awfully quiet.

188
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,250
Don't worry about him.
He's always like that.

189
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,291
[giggling]

190
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:15,541
I must admit... I've no
desire to go home tonight.

191
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,166
[distant bell toll]

192
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,583
[Nagamitsu] Do you know why
I brought you here tonight?

193
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,083
This grass will be
my front lawn one day.

194
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:49,208
And that over there...well
that someday will be my house.

195
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,500
Edo Castle.

196
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,291
With that said,
how do you feel about

197
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,291
becoming a part
of the harem of my heart?

198
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,916
Um, I'm not following you.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,708
If you want to know
everything about me,

200
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,625
you should take a look at that.

201
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:08,666
[beat boxing]

202
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,750
Keep reading.

203
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,458
That's my
autobiography there. Yeah.

204
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,125
The title I'm going with is
"The Path to Being Really Big."

205
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,583
Read up. My past,
present, and future plans.

206
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,791
It's all there. Written
down for the whole world

207
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,208
to reflect back on someday.

208
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,083
As you can see,
I won't be satisfied

209
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,208
with being second best
at anything I do.

210
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,625
I wanna become bigger than
anybody else and have

211
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:36,041
the name Nagamitsu known and
respected throughout the land.

212
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,250
Do you know who's the biggest
man in the country right now?

213
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:44,166
Señor Toku, the shogun.
Tokugawa no mistake.

214
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,375
Knowing this, I jumped
aboard the last ship from

215
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:51,000
the province of Aki and made
my way to Edo by myself.

216
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,083
Along the way, I came across
some roughneck on horseback

217
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,583
and took him down.

218
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,875
Then there was
that Kogarashi bozo,

219
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,750
after him I started
building a reputation.

220
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,958
And it'll keep on building
'til people throughout the land

221
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,625
are buzzing with
rumors about me.

222
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,041
I just needed to finish my plan.

223
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,875
Come out and face me, Tokugawa!

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,125
I'm too late.

225
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:19,458
There I was, wailing on what
I thought was Edo Castle when...

226
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,000
You know, that's Osaka Castle.

227
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,500
[Nagamitsu] And that's
how it went down.

228
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:30,458
But because of that,
I met my first follower, Ogura.

229
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,250
At around that time is when I
began to hear these whispered

230
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,291
rumors about some legendary
man who was undefeated

231
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:40,250
in a thousand duels.
And that man's name was...

232
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,875
[screaming] Enshiro Mariya

233
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,708
It was going to be perfect,

234
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,500
if I could defeat Enshiro,
take over his legend

235
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:52,000
of a thousand victories and give
my reputation an enormous boost.

236
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,208
[screaming] Mariya

237
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,333
Now I've got you.

238
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:04,541
I'm... too... late.

239
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,208
My perfectly-laid plan

240
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,375
ran straight into
a brick wall that day.

241
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,625
I learned from the
remaining disciples

242
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,166
that Enshiro had
already been killed.

243
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,750
The man responsible for
striking down the legendary

244
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,250
undefeated Enshiro was none
other than his top student.

245
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,375
You can't allow a man
who's so corrupt that he'd

246
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:28,250
kill his own teacher to take on
his master's undefeated legend.

247
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,000
So after that,
I decided to make a new entry

248
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,500
into my autobiography.

249
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,875
It's... right there!

250
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,041
When I perfectly defeat
that cowardly disciple to death,

251
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,208
my own legend will
echo through the country

252
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,458
for everyone to hear.

253
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,125
Yo, Nagamitsu!

254
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,333
Once I defeat this man

255
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,375
every dream I have
will be within my grasp.

256
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,083
When I share this dream, people
might think to themselves,

257
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,625
that Nagamitsu
is one lonely guy.

258
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,500
And I admit at times,
I am lonely.

259
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,791
But this is
the path I have chosen.

260
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,416
And if I'm going
to live this life alone,

261
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,166
then I want to live it
alone inside that castle!

262
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,958
I've had it up to here with
being lonely inside a shack.

263
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,500
[crying] Big Guy.

264
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,833
So, that's why you're attacking
any samurai you come across?

265
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,375
Not just any!

266
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,625
The samurai I want
wears glasses,

267
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,625
and that's a pretty
unusual thing, even here in Edo.

268
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,000
And, that man's name is 

269
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,958
[beat boxing] <i>Chewie-chewi</i> Jin

270
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:31,583
Huh?

271
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,166
That's right. Jin.

272
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,916
[Fuu] Uh, gosh, I hope
you find that what's his-

273
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,291
[beat boxing] <i>Chewi</i> Jin

274
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,708
Oh, yeah,
that's right. That guy.

275
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,500
<i>Chewie-chewi</i> Jin

276
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,875
[Fuu] Well, it's getting late,
I better head back now.

277
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,208
Okay! I'll be waiting for ya
here tomorrow night,

278
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,625
alright baby?

279
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,000
Should we really let her go?

280
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,083
[Nagamitsu] Don't be an idiot. 

281
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,750
You gotta take your time
with that kind.

282
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,250
You don't rush a fine female. 

283
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,416
That resilient spirit
in her eyes,

284
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,666
it reminds me of when
you-know-who was young.

285
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,333
I wonder where those two

286
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,625
could have wandered off
so late at night.

287
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:20,875
Hmm, well, I guess
bigger isn't always better.

288
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:27,500
That's not gonna happen,
there's no way.

289
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,708
Jin wouldn't do that.

290
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:41,708
[birds cawing]

291
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,375
[Fuu] You guys!

292
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,750
Aahh!

293
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,666
[groaning] Would you shut up?

294
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,833
My head.

295
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,333
Ugh. You reek of booze.

296
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,458
That woman.

297
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,583
Bitch rolled us.

298
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,833
Get your act together.

299
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,791
Losers.

300
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,958
Now get on your feet
and make some more.

301
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,458
[people talking]

302
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:15,166
Okay now, step on up
and take a look, don't be shy.

303
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,166
The two master swordsmen you see
before you will astound you

304
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,333
with their amazing
skill and technique.

305
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,208
I promise you've never seen
anything like it before.

306
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,791
If they succeed, feel free
to put money right in here.

307
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,083
Alright, we got us a crowd now.

308
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,375
So, what are you gonna do?

309
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,708
Take the bottom.

310
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,916
Very well.

311
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,791
I-I'll be fine.
I'll be just fine.

312
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:11,416
[crowd ooh-ing, ahh-ing,
and applauding]

313
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,083
Hey, I need
to ask you something.

314
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,500
Yeah, what?

315
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,625
Well, it's about Jin.

316
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,041
Huh?

317
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,250
Has he ever...mentioned
anything about his past before?

318
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,000
What the hell do I look like?

319
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,625
Ask him yourself
if you want to know so badly.

320
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,458
Well, it's not a topic
you just bring up.

321
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,833
Could he really be a bad guy?

322
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,166
[Pawnshop Owner] Hmm...

323
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,125
You've got it rigged up
as a low-rider, huh?

324
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,791
Palanquins are never
worth as much

325
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,500
after they've had
one of these "custom" jobs.

326
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,208
[Ogura] Hey, don't try
to take advantage of us!

327
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,958
Old man, you do still have them?

328
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,208
Well, look who's here.

329
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,500
You must have
come up with some money.

330
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,500
This will only take a minute.

331
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,833
At this moment,
a door has opened.

332
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,541
And the name of that
fateful door is "destiny."

333
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,625
You couldn't wait 'til
nightfall to see me again,

334
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,916
so you followed me.

335
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,458
Oh now don't be embarrassed.
I understand.

336
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:23,166
[Fuu stuttering, trying
to catch Jin's attention]

337
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,708
What is this guy's name?

338
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:25,916
[Mugen] Jin, what of it?

339
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,791
Jiiiinnnnn!

340
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,125
Jin of Mujushin-ken school?!

341
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,958
I am Ogura Bunta, student
of Mujushin Kenjutsu dojo,

342
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:35,791
answer me.

343
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:36,666
Eh?

344
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,291
You're correct. I am that Jin.

345
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,166
Huh?

346
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,666
You killed our master!

347
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,041
And now you're gonna pay for it!

348
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,625
Step outside.

349
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,000
Ogura?

350
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,416
[Jin] No one interfere.

351
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,250
[Ogura] I've looked
everywhere for you.

352
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,375
I've stopped
at nothing for this.

353
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,083
I even stooped so low as
to follow that buffoon,

354
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,458
patiently biding my time.

355
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,083
Why did you betray him?

356
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,833
Why did a great man like you
betray our master?

357
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,958
I wasn't the one...
who betrayed him.

358
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,166
But...

359
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,291
There are no excuses.

360
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,208
The fact of the matter is, the
person who killed him was me.

361
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,125
Bastard.

362
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,125
Hyah!

363
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,333
Holy crap.

364
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,500
Ogura is really tough.

365
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,208
Hyah!

366
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,250
Yah!

367
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,458
Kill me.

368
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,666
But remember, I won't be
the last. There's a whole lot

369
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,208
of other students out there that
are after your head as well.

370
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,125
[Jin] I've made
my peace with that.

371
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,291
In fact, I'm going to
let you live today,

372
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,291
just so you can relay
that to the others.

373
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:17,166
Someday, we'll avenge him.

374
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,541
[Fuu] So, it was
really true after all.

375
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,625
Big Guy?

376
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:32,291
Luigi! Oh, Luigi, where have
you been? [nervous laughing]

377
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,583
Good boy. I've missed you
so much boy, Luigi.

378
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,375
What's Luigi doing here?

379
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,208
O-Sen!

380
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,333
Oh! So there you are.

381
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,958
Alright Honey,
now stop playing around.

382
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,750
Hurry up and come home.

383
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:50,583
So sorry about that.
My husband can be such a fool.

384
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,125
Just hold on a sec.

385
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,708
Listen up, men simply aren't
the brightest of our species,

386
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,666
so it's best to keep them
wrapped around your finger.

387
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,875
Let's go.

388
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,000
[Shinpachi] Yes, Ma'am.

389
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,291
[Nagamitsu] Farewell,
harem of my heart.

390
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:10,125
Not to worry, you'll get your
mention in my autobiography.

391
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,458
[O-Sen] What were you thinking?

392
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,125
Your children are
waiting at home for you

393
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,875
with empty stomachs.

394
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,375
[Nagamitsu] Yes dear.

395
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,291
Huh? Our dough.

396
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,916
I'm gonna let Enshiro go.

397
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,833
A better one might be,
that Musashi guy.

398
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,000
He's already dead.

399
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:29,666
Huh?

400
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,833
How about Nobunaga?

401
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,000
Right.

402
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,541
[O-Sen] Why are men such fools?

403
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:46,833
