00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,791
[Mugen] No, loosen up
the purse strings.

161
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,666
That happens to be my seed money
to make more cash.

162
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,958
[door sliding open]

163
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,541
[Fuu] Jin! What happened?

164
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,083
How'd you get all beat up?

165
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,583
I'm fine, really.

166
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,750
No you're not, look at you.

167
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,083
[Jin] You've got money.

168
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,208
[Fuu] When did you...?

169
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,875
Hey, it was my bug
who won that match,

170
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,833
I'll do whatever
I want with it.

171
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,041
[Jin] Let me have it.

172
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,125
Say what?

173
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,166
What do you want it for?

174
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,750
I need to buy a woman.

175
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,291
Huh??

176
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,791
It's you.

177
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,291
I thought I asked you
not to come here.

178
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,583
[Clerk] Back again for another
ass whoopin, huh?

179
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,083
Got a thing for
getting' yourself beat up?

180
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,166
Please come in, kind sir.

181
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,500
Is Kohana who
you'd like for the evening?

182
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,125
[Clerk] I'm afraid I'll have
to ask you for your swords.

183
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,916
House rules, Sir.

184
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,541
Enjoy yourself.

185
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,125
So, just what do you think
Jin meant by what he said?

186
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,958
Do you really think
he's gonna go buy some woman?

187
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,208
[Mugen] Hey,
I'm glad to hear it.

188
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,541
[Fuu] What?

189
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,583
[Mugen] Well, ya know,
I was getting' suspicious.

190
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,291
You ever seen him
check out a girl?

191
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,666
So, who cares?

192
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,541
It's a pretty big sign
he's queer.

193
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,000
No way.

194
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,541
Well, at least now we know
what team he's playin' for.

195
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,750
What do you know?

196
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,458
What I don't get is
why he thinks he needs

197
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,666
another woman
when he's got me around.

198
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,958
What, you sayin' you
wanna be his main squeeze?

199
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,375
[Fuu] T-That's not what I said.

200
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,625
You've got the figure
of a wood plank.

201
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:29,875
I do not.

202
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,333
Clothing just
makes me look slender.

203
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,500
Yeah, right.

204
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,291
It's the truth!

205
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,625
Show me what you got then.

206
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,916
Brace yourself,
cause it's an eyeful.

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm having second thoughts.

208
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,375
[Mugen] You're
jealous aren't ya?

209
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,875
Huh? Of course I'm not jealous!

210
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,708
What in the world would
lead you to believe I'm jealous?

211
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,125
Nope, lone wolf
wannabes like Jin

212
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,333
with that far off
look of theirs,

213
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,958
the kind that doesn't
let you know at all

214
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,666
what they're thinking
are so not my type.

215
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,666
[snoring]

216
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,500
And they snore!

217
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,333
[Shino] Would you
like some sake?

218
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,875
No.

219
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,291
I see.

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's alright, can we just sit?

221
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,458
If you like.

222
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,708
But you're paying a whole lot
of money just to sit here.

223
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,625
Well, my unagi stand friend,
will this rain ever stop?

224
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,125
That's not my stand.
I'm traveling,

225
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,500
and I'm trying to earn
enough money for lodgings.

226
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,958
So, you're a wanderer then.

227
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,708
I've been held up in this city
for a while, due to the rain.

228
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,958
Oh, I see.

229
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,583
So as soon as it stops raining,
you'll leave.

230
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,458
[Jin] I hope that the rain
will never stop.

231
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,000
[Shino] What?

232
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,666
[Jin] If it continues, I'll
be able to stay here forever.

233
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,916
That wasn't meant to be a joke.

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,333
I'm sorry, it's just that
nobody talks like that anymore.

235
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:10,166
[Jin] Miss Shino, this must
be difficult for you.

236
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,750
[Shino] Sure, this is
a very difficult time.

237
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,041
The thing is,
when I'm really sad,

238
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,041
I find that that's when
I tend to laugh the most.

239
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,250
I get so frustrated
that all I do is laugh.

240
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,875
[Clerk] I swear! This rain
is killing my business.

241
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,500
My only customer today was
a samurai who wears glasses.

242
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,458
He seems to have
this thing for Kohana,

243
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,791
the new girl
I got workin' here.

244
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,750
Heh, her husband's such a loser
he had to sell his wife

245
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,083
to get out of debt.

246
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,333
Guess that's what happens when

247
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,250
it's illegal for you
to divorce your husband.

248
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,625
You get stuck paying
for his lousy mistakes.

249
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,666
[Jin] Let's leave this place.

250
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,541
Where would we go?

251
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,625
[Jin] I can't let you
do this anymore.

252
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,458
You make it sound so simple.

253
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,458
Do you have any idea
how much it costs

254
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,500
to buy a prostitute's freedom?

255
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,625
Even if there were
a hundred of you,

256
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,375
you still wouldn't have
enough to afford it.

257
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,791
When I got married,

258
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,250
my parents were relieved
that I was marrying into money.

259
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,333
But my husband had
a gambling problem,

260
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,791
and soon he'd amassed
a massive amount of debt.

261
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,375
The next thing I knew,

262
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,666
the girl who owns the dry goods
store had become the town whore.

263
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,333
Please do me a favor,
and let's change the subject.

264
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,916
I appreciate the sentiment,

265
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,791
but I'm afraid it's
nothing more than a daydream.

266
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,916
[Clerk, behind the door]
I beg your pardon Sir,

267
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,416
but Kohana, you have a visitor.

268
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,250
I'll be right there.

269
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,708
Unfortunately our
fantasy time is over.

270
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,125
The real world is
out there waiting for us.

271
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,500
[Hanjiro] Aww, c'mon
have a heart, Shino.

272
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,125
Spot me a little bit.

273
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,208
[Shino] You don't really believe
that I have money, do you?

274
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,791
[Hanjiro] Aww, Baby,
don't be like that.

275
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,291
Nobody slipped you
some tips, hmm?

276
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,250
[Shino] Why don't you deal
with your gambling problem

277
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,916
and try to earn
an honest living?

278
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,666
[Hanjiro grunting]
What did you say?!

279
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,000
[Shiro screaming]

280
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,833
You still got a problem
with my gambling? Huh?

281
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,541
What, you wanna leave me?

282
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:29,250
Well, too bad, cause I don't
feel like cuttin' ya loose yet.

283
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,666
[Hanjiro being punched]

284
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,333
Ow, what do you think
you're doing you son of a bitch!

285
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm her husband!

286
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:40,708
I can do whatever the hell
I want to her. [punch] Ow!

287
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,375
Alright, that's enough,
let him go.

288
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,375
Asshole.

289
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,708
Listen, bitch,

290
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,166
I'm gonna bleed you dry
for the rest of your life.

291
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,125
Think about that.

292
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,250
[Fuu] Where are you going?

293
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,541
Back to that Kohana lady?

294
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,125
What for?

295
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,333
I mean I understand why
you'd feel sorry for her, but-

296
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,291
It's not out of pity.

297
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,750
You're not gonna
stand here and tell me

298
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,958
that you're actually in love
with this woman, are you?

299
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,708
Jin, are you thinking
about running away with her?

300
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:33,458
[Jin] If for some reason I am
unable to make it back,

301
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,291
I want the two of you
to continue on.

302
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,708
You're serious.

303
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,833
But you can't just leave.
You promised you'd help me

304
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,125
find the sunflower samurai.

305
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,958
If you leave,
I won't speak to you again.

306
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,291
We've come all this way!

307
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,166
How can you do this?
You promised me!

308
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,583
[Jin] Forgive me.

309
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,958
[Fuu screaming]
You're such a jerk!

310
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,250
[door sliding shut]

311
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,958
[Shino] Welcome back.

312
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,583
Something wrong?

313
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,416
[Jin] We're leaving now.

314
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,541
Pack what you need.

315
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,208
You're joking.

316
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,833
It's hopeless. Even if
I do make it out of here,

317
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,250
they'll hunt me down
'til they find me.

318
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,333
[Jin] There's a shelter for
women like you across the river.

319
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:19,083
If you ask for refuge,
they might help you.

320
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,416
[Shino] Yes, but even if
they do let me stay,

321
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,250
I'll be a prisoner there too.

322
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,875
You have to stay there
for three years.

323
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,333
You and I won't be able
to see each other either.

324
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,458
I'd much rather spend
my time here waiting for you.

325
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,083
[Jin] When I met you
on the bridge that day,

326
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,708
you were planning
to kill yourself, weren't you?

327
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,458
[Shino] I was.

328
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,208
If you hadn't have
come by when you did,

329
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,875
I know that right now,
I'd be...

330
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,041
Let's leave this place together.

00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,958
[Clerk] My apologies for
interrupting you, Sir,

332
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,041
but your time with
Kohana is up now.

[Shino, moaning]
Oh, you're amazing.

334
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,708
[Jin] I'll take an extension.

335
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,250
Take your time, Sir.

336
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,458
I'll be waiting for you below.

337
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,958
But what if...

338
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,500
It'll be alright.

339
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,666
[Clerk] Now sir, about
that extension fee...

340
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,625
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

341
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,375
You're not
going anywhere, bitch.
