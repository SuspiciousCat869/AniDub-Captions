172

In the end, my friend,

173
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:49,291
you and me are just
a couple of cursed men.

174

There will never be
a place for us to run to.

175
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,250
[Jin] They killed
everyone in the village

176

except for the young men.

177
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,208
No one was spared. Not even
the women and children.

178
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,041
My guess is that the men were
forced to fight each other.

179
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,416
And the survivors are the ones
who make up that gang.

180
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,666
I think that we'd be better
off staying away from Mukuro.

181
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,458

But you can't take it.

185

What about us
going to Nagasaki?

186
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,916
Well, either way,
we're gonna need the cash.

187

[Murkuro] I knew you'd come.

197

Alright then.
I got one condition.

198
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,916
Hmm? What's that?

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,916
Once this job's done, I never
have to see your ugly ass again.

200
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,375
Got it?

201
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,583
[Murkuro] Alright, listen up.

202
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,333
Our target's a shogunate
transport ship carrying

203
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,333
60,000 ryo in gold coins.

204
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,333
The ship has already
set sail and is currently

205
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,000
en route from Osaka to Edo.

206
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,583
And tonight, it's gonna dock
right here in our harbor.

207
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,833
They're stoppin' here
to let their sailors rest

208
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,375
and to load up on
some fresh food and water.

209
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,375
And that's when
we're gonna hit 'em.

210
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,666
[Mugen] Hang on a minute.

211
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,791
Just where in the hell are you
getting' this information from?

212
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,833
I got a connection
that's workin' from

213
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,083

214
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,333
This mole's
a member of my gang.

215
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,000
Here's how it'll go.

216
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,458
Ken and Ryu will take out
the shipyard guys and carry

217
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,041
the barrels of supplies
onto the ship.

218
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,958
Inside one of those barrels
will be a surprise:

219
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,791
me. 

220
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll use a gunpowder bomb
to stir up a commotion.

221
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,916
While I'm doin' that,
the rest of you sneak up

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,625
with a pirate ship and
ambush from the side,

223
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,125
after that,
it's business as usual.

224
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,625
We board the ship, show no
mercy, and take everything.

225
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:24,250
The 60,000 ryo
and their lives.

226
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,541
And when we're done
stealing the gold,

227
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,750
we'll blow that ship sky high.

228
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,250
You realize that this is a
government transport ship?

229
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,708
[Murkuro] I'm aware of that.

230
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,416
It's gonna be crawling with
top-notch security guards.

231
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,000
But we don't have
enough guys for this.

232
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,583
That's why tonight's
our only shot.

233
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,750
It's gonna be rainin' tonight,

234
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,500
and there won't
be any moonlight.

235
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,958
We'll use the darkness
and be on that ship

236
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,791
before they know what hit 'em.

237
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,333

looking down from up there,
