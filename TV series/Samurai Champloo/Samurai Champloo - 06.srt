We just got to Edo, and our
luck's looking up already.

[Mugen] Whoa, it's all
you can eat for free?

18
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,625
[Fuu] Not only that,
we're gonna win this thing.

19
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,875
The three of us are
always half starved anyways,

so this must be in our destiny.

then we don't need to win.

Alright, then.
Who's next in line?

No way. I thought it was free.

If we had money,
we wouldn't be here.

Well, I could take something
worth that amount, I suppose.

If you win,
you get the whole pot.

How 'bout your
samurai friend over here?

00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,541
I'm sorry,
but I can't simply hand over

33
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,250
the embodiment
of a warrior's soul to-- Hey.

Relax. Once we win,
you'll get them right back.

Hold on a minute.

00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,916
Think of it as handing them
over for safe keeping.

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,958
Ain't no way in the world
we can lose as hungry as we are.

The munching has commenced.

43
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,083
It's the annual
big eater contest.

44
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,625
The games of
gastronomic gobbling.

45
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,875
Once again, big eaters
from all over the city

have come out in full force.

The rules are extremely simple.

48
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,791
The contestant
who eats the most wins

49
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,666
and takes home
all the entry fees.

50
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,750
Our contestants are eating
eel rice bowls made

51

with plenty of that
main ingredient

52
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,583
that Edo kitchens
are famous for.

53
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,583
And of course, I, Ichieimon,
Edo's number one gossip,

54
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,750
will be your announcer.

55
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,625
With me today
is Buddhist priest, Ingen,

56
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,458
known for his catchphrase,
"To hell with vegetarianism!"

57
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,250
Thank you. It's an honor.

58
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,750
[Announcer] The contestants
are now underway.

59
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,500
The one to watch out for this
year would have to be Izumi,

60
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,750
the winner from
the year before last.

61
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,125
She's been training hard
and looks to be in top form.

62
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,041
Wouldn't you say, Father Ingen?

63
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,625
Yes, but her specialty
has always been sweets.

64
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,291
We don't know how long
she can keep this up.

65
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,958
Bring me another.

66
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,083
[Announcer] And there he goes.

74

their hands together

75
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,000
in the traditional
gesture of surrender.

76
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,083
Would you look at that?
We already have a contestant

77
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,375
throwing in the towel.

78
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,875
We're barely underway
and the man's given up.

79
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,541
Why in the world
did this bespectacled man

80
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,250
even bother to come today?

81
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,458
That's enough.

82
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,125
I am ashamed.
Please win my swords for me.

the last one eating?

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,208
You must not consider stopping.

the final three contestants.

93
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,083
Sonosuke, the man with
the bottomless stomach.

94
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,458
Izumi, the queen of sweets.

95
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,333
And a newcomer to the contest,
a mysterious giant of a man.

96
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,291
Wait a minute, I missed one.

97
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,666
There's one more. We have one
more contestant I overlooked.

98
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,500
And what's more, she seems
to be a petite, young girl.

99
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,250
All four of them have begun
their twenty-second bowl.

100
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,125
Twenty-two
was last year's record.

101
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,458
What's this? Have the
queen of sweets chopsticks

102
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,208
stopped moving?

103
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,583
An official has gone over
for verification.

104
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,250
Could she possibly be...?

105
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,250
He's giving the signal.
She's done for the day.

This is unbelievable!

Last year's champion, Sonosuke,
is down for the count.

111
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,291
Bring me another. Another!

112
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,708
Another!

113
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,291
Eh? This girl's stomach
is a cosmos unto itself.

114
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,625
It's connected to
the void of the universe.

[Announcer] The unthinkable
has finally occurred.

These two newcomers are locked
in a one-on-one battle.

118
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,916
What's more, they've done
what no eater has done before

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,208
and broken the
twenty-seven bowl barrier.

120
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,833
We have finally gotten
the personal data

121
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,458
on these two contestants.

122
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:24,000
Hmm... The young girl's name
is Fuu. Age fifteen.

123
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:29,000
And the name of the large man
is... Wait, I can't read this.

124
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,291
This is unprecedented
in the history of gluttony.

125
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,291
Unless my eyes deceive me,
these two have

126
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,083
picked up their pace even more.

127

The cooks are having trouble
keeping up with them.

128

Shut the hell up, will ya?

129
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,708
[Announcer] How much food
can a human being eat?

130
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:46,583
One has to ask, "Where have we
been? Where are we going?"

131
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,583
Their forms are likened
to the gods themselves.

132
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,458
This is truly awe inspiring.

133
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,625
[Ingen] It may very well
be that what we are

134
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,458
witnessing here
today is a birth.

135

315

319

<i>[Jouji] Japan is the greatest</i>
<i>wonderful culture of manly love!</i>

327
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,500
When I first read this, I think
Japan is like no other country.

328
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,583
It is like heaven on earth.

329
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,875
Well, if it isn't the European
and the insolent fools

00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,208
Now come along quietly.

332
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,750
[Jouji] I do not understand.

333
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,708
Why do you arrest me?
I do not anything wrong.

336
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,750
there's no law that says
we have to accept foreigners.

You're all just

You better surrender

Get that bastard.
Kill him if you want.

[Jouji] Mugen! I keep my promise
to give back sword now.

345
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,625
Here, Jin.

346
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,458
Mugen.

347
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,833
Yeah, I know.

00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,833
Wow. Is sword fight.
Real samurai.

What's going on? Are those guys
the next act or something?

351
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,833
[Jouji] Oh samurai...

00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,208
[Policeman 1] Alright,
hold it right there.

353
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,416
[Tanaka] Hold it.
Hold it. Hold it!

354
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,125
I have here and official order.

355
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,041
Look what's on it. The scarlet
shield of the Shogunate!

356
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,791
[Tanaka] Let me inform you
of this man's true identity.

357
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,166
This is the chief merchant of

358
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,875
the Dutch East India Company's
Japan branch.

Governor-General Isaac Titsingh.

360
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,500
We beg your forgiveness for
our reprehensible insolence.

361
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,916
Any idea what's going on?

362
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,083
It appears our friend
the foreigner has official

363
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,083
dispensation from
the Shogunate.

364
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,958
Allow me to introduce myself.

365
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,375
I am Sukeemon Tanaka.
Official representative

366

assigned by the Shogunate.

367
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,500
I've been sent here
to act as interpreter.

368
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,666
[Jouji] I guess
it was just dream.

369
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,166
I hoped could live in
this country as a Japanese,

370
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,333
but I suppose is
not possible yet.

371
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,875
[Fuu] Hey, cheer up.

372
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,458
[Jouji] But some day will come
when this country

373
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,666
will accept people like me.

374
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,541
I am sure one day things
will change and people here

375
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,583
will not be so tight-assed.

376
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,958
Like anybody's gonna be able to
relax their ass with you around.

377
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,166
[Jouji] I want to
show you my gratitude.

378
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,333
[Mugen] Forget it. It's not like
we did anything for it.

379
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,916
[Jin] If you'll excuse us.

380
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
[Mugen] See ya!

381
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,041
[Fuu] Hey, wait a minute.

382
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,041
There's something
I wanted to ask you.

383
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,708
[Jouji] What is it?

384
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,541
Have you ever heard of a samurai
who smells of sunflowers?

385
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,041
I've been looking
all over for him.

386
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,250
No, I have not heard of this.

387
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,375
However, it was we Dutchmen who
first bring sunflower here

388
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,750
to this beautiful
country of yours.

389
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,333
Perhaps if you give me
more clue to go on than that.

390
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,541
Oh yeah, right.

391
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,416
I'm not really sure
if it's a clue or not,

392
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,125
but I have something
that belongs to him.

393
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,291
[whispering] You must not
show this to anyone.

394
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,666
[Fuu] Huh?

395
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,500
[Jouji] It is very dangerous
thing in this country.

396
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,708
Do not let anyone see it.

397
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,333
[Fuu] Why not?

398
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,125
[Jouji] I am sorry, but there's
only one thing that I can

399
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,083
tell you. Nagasaki is
where you should to look.

400
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,291
I'm sure you might be able
to find answers there.

401
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,625
Nagasaki.

402
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,541
[Fuu] Hey, wait.

403
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,125
[Mugen] So, what are we
supposed to do now?

404
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,958
[Fuu] Isn't it obvious?

405
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,041
[Mugen] Huh?

406
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,250
Hey!

407
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:33,875
[Mugen] Huh?

408
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,000
[Jin] Is it?

409
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,375
[record scratching]

410
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,583
[Mugen] What, seriously?

411
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,083
[Jin] I wasn't told of this.
