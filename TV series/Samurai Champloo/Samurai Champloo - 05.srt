00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,166
Hm?

158
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,625
[Mugen] Hey. How you doing?

159
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,833
Get you ass back here!

160
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,541
[Punk 1] No way, you bastard!

161
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,208
[Hishikawa] This is my
humble studio.

162
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,416
[Fuu] Ah...

163
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,333
What the heck are you up to now?

164
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,458
[Mugen] Look who's talking.

165
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,250
What's up with you
and lover boy there?

166
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,791
You've got it all wrong.

167
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,625
You see, I am here
for a modeling job.

168
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,250
Damn, he got away.

169
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,833
[Hishikawa sighing]

170
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,250
It's not quite right.

171
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:37,083
Just a little further.
Down about here.

172
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,875
Wait a sec. It's not
what you're thinking.

173
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,666
I'm not asking this because
I'm some sort of pervert.

174
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,375
What we're doing here
is all for the sake of art.

175
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,666
You see? And when I'm
over here, I can't see anything.

176
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,208
Alright now? Relax.

177
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,791
<i>[Manzo] Since I've been working</i>
<i>this stakeout, I've begun to</i>

178
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,958
<i>form a theory that the</i>
<i>disappearances of the</i>

179
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,916
<i>young girls are somehow</i>
<i>related to the European ships</i>

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,583
<i>in the harbor.</i>

181
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,541
<i>By the way, this is</i>
<i>my truncheon blade.</i>

182
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,875
<i>It would normally</i>
<i>be used as a billy club.</i>

183
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,458
<i>But when you</i>
<i>adapt it as I have,</i>

184
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,666
<i>it makes an excellent weight</i>
<i>loss tool that you can use</i>

185
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,166
<i>whenever you find you</i>
<i>have a spare moment.</i>

186
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,166
Your hunch was right.
Looks like a big deal

187
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,541
is going down tomorrow.

188
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,916
I see. Good.
Now get back and see

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,208
what else you can find out.

190
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,416
Sir.

191
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,125
[Policeman] Sir?

192
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,208
[Manzo] For Pete's sake--

193
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,333
[Fuu] Who's there?

194
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,958
You're not bad at this are you?

195
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,625
Where'd you become
such a skillful player?

196
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,375
I learned at the dojo.

197
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,666
[Old Shogi Player] Hmm.

198
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,916
[Jin] In both shoji and
swordplay, the key is

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
to read ahead. Battles are
decided by thinking beyond

200
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:03,000
your opponent. At least, that
is what my master taught me.

201
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,500
Fascinating.

202
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,666
Your master was a very
skilled player, I take it.

203
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,625
Yes.

204
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,041
Although we played often,

205
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,500
I was never once
able to defeat him.

206
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,791
And with swords,
did you beat him there?

207
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,583
It's finished.

208
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,083
[Fuu] Really? I want to see it.

209
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,041
Nice! A job well done.

210
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,791
What? What's going on?

211
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:47,083
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
this is part of my job.

212
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,666
What are you talking about?

213
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,875
You tricked me.

214
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,083
You had this whole thing
planned, didn't you?

215
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:56,166
[muffled screaming]

216
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,875
[Punk 1] Hold still.

217
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,250
[Old Shogi Player] Oh my,
the sun's gone down.

218
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,625
Let's continue this tomorrow.

219
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,416
How clumsy of me.

220
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:16,208
[pieces clacking]

221
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:20,916
My, very impressive.
You have quite a memory.

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,416
Except for this kin piece here.

223
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,666
Wasn't it on this space?

224
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:34,208
[muffled screaming,
Punks chuckling]

225
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,625
[Punk 1] Relax. You'll be
out at sea by tomorrow.

226
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,500
We're gonna
take real good care of you.

227
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,875
[squeaking]

228
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,625
[Punk 2] Hey, did she just make
a sound like an animal?

229
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,791
[Punk 3] Come on. Let's go.

230
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,958
[Punk 1] You're
imagining things.

231
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,291
[Fuu moaning]

232
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,750
[sad squeaking]

233
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,125
Well, well, you're
certainly in a big hurry.

234
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,625
Where are you going?

235
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,875
[Hishikawa] Uh, well, I uh...

236
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,458
You've been so busy with
this art nonsense lately

237
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,833
that you never stop by
to see me anymore.

238
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,416
Darling, you haven't forgotten
who you have to thank

239
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,083
for this current
lifestyle of yours?

240
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,375
No, I haven't.

241
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,750
I can't let you
go home tonight.

242
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,125
Wait a minute.

243
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:31,875
Huh?

244
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,125
I have a stomachache.

245
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,333
Oh, it hurts. It's been
bothering me all day.

246
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,041
Sorry, I just don't think
I'm up to it tonight.

247
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,875
Tomorrow! I promise
I'll come see you tomorrow!

248
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:56,000
[muffled screaming]

249
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,833
I'm gonna get you out of there.

250
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,625
Okay.

251
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,000
You! How many other girls
have you conned like this?

252
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,416
Answer me, damn it!

253
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,500
When I first started,
I didn't know what was going on.

254
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,291
Of course I had suspicions,
but I did nothing.

255
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,083
It was easier for me
to look the other way.

256
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,750
I mean, an ukiyo-e artist
could never make ends meet

257
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,500
without doing
something like this.

258
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,041
You're making
excuses for yourself?

259
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,375
How could you do that to me?

260
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,125
[Sawa] I get it.

261
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,125
What you prefer is
a young girl like this one.

262
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,708
You're aware of what
happens to people

263
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:47,208
who are foolish enough to
mess with my merchandise!

264
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,166
[Mugen] Hey, where is she?

265
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,875
[Jin] I don't know.

266
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,708
It's not like
I really give a rat's ass.

267
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,500
[Jin] Gin.

268
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,166
[Mugen] Huh?

269
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,958

anything to eat.

00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,333
Shit.

273
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,041
Well, it appears you're not

274
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,041
willing to sacrifice
that piece yet.

275
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,458
I always appreciate
your patronage.

276
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,833
Were you looking for anything
in particular today?

277
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,625
Ah, nice choice.
You have an eye for quality.

278
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,625
[Mugen] Damn.
Doing it with a squid.

279
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,791
Hmm?

280
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,750
[door sliding open]
Huh?

281
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,416
[Punk 1] In you go.

282
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,208
You know, you're pretty lucky.

283
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,791
If you weren't the boss's
stud, you would have been

284
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,250
fish food a long time ago.

285
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,958
Try anything like that again,

286
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,958
and we'll bust
your right hand for good.

287
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,541
Remember that.

288
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,875
[Mugen] Wakey, wakey, Loverboy.

289
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,583
Hey. Where'd your model go?

290
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,083
You gotta save her.

291
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,958
If we don't do something soon,
she's gonna be sold.

292
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:13,791
Huh?

293
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,833
Just accept it, will ya?

294
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,416
Hey, you ready yet?

295
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,916
What the hell's in here?
It weighs a ton.

296
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,833
Forget it. That one's
not on the list.

297
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:25,041
[Punk 1] If you idiots don't
hurry she'll beat us up again.

Eh?

315
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,708
It's that guy.

316
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,500
Stay back!

317
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,958
Not again!

318
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,541
[Mugen] Get back here!

319
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,041
Boo.

320
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,875
Please don't hurt me.

321
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,541
What's going on here?

322
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,083
Huh?

323
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,666
[Policeman] Hold it right there.

324
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,083
You're under arrest, Ma'am.

325
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,833
Why? What's the meaning of this?

326
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,083
I'm a law-abiding book lender.
I've done nothing.

327
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,708
[Manzo] For Pete's sake!
There's no way

328
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,666
this sleazy bookstore is legit.

329
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,625
I saw through this scam
of yours a long time ago.

330
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,125
What are you talking about?

331
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,458
Your bookstore's been
a front for slave trafficking

332
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,875
with those foreign ships.

333
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,000
She's a witness,
this is evidence,

334
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,083
and that'll put you away.

335
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,583
[Policeman] Uh, Sir?

336
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,666
For Pete's sake. Using ukiyo-e
prints for a catalogue,

337
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,250
that was very clever.

338
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,791
But in the end,
it was your downfall.

339
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,208
[Jin] Checkmate.

340
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,833
Now come along peacefully.

341
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:59,583
[laughing]

342
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,541
[Old Shogi Player]
You found me out. Well done.

343
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,166
At least now I can
go with no regrets.

344
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,541
So if you don't mind,
we'll take you in now.

345
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,083
Boss.

346
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, Darling.

347
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,208
[Old Shogi Player] Hm. That's
right, I nearly forgot.

348
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,166
We had a deal, didn't we?

349
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,250
[Fuu] After all that, it was Jin
who earned our boat fare

350
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,000
even though it looked like
he wasn't doing anything.

351
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,083
[Mugen] I came away with
a little booty of my own.

352
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,208
Huh?

353
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,708
Hm? Ah, gross!
What is this stuff? Porno?

354
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,125
You two are disgusting.
Can't you ever give it a rest?

355
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,291
[Hishikawa] Backwards Beauty!

356
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,583
Huh?

357
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,875
[Fuu] Now listen you.

358
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,875
[Hishikawa] I'm really sorry
for tricking you.

359
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,666
But please,
you've got to believe me.

360
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,750
I told you I got chills
when I first saw you.

361
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,083
That was the truth.
I swear it.

362
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,875
You were the very first.

363
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,583
No other girl looked
at my sunflowers

364
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,291
and said they were beautiful.

365
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,791
So you see,

366
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,875
I now proclaim it to the world:

367
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:29,000
You are my number one fan!

368
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,333
I'm leaving now.

369
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,541
I'm going to
sneak aboard one of the

370
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,083
European ships going to Holland.

371
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,208
I won't return to this
land until my paintings

372
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,625
are recognized as great art.

373
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,750
This is what I have decided.

374
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,333
But I swear,
I'll never forget you.

375
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,083
Never! Never, never...

376
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,416
Oh, right. Do me a favor:
please don't tell

377
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,750
that Sawa woman
where I'm headed.

378
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,375
I appreciate it.

379
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,541
[Fuu] Jerk.

380
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,416
[Fuu grumbling]
This is ridiculous.

381
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,625
Are you sure you want
to let that guy go?

382
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,125
I don't really care.

383
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,875
I mean, he did give me
a great set of hooters.

384
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,833
[Jin and Mugen]
"Set of hooters"?

385
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,458
