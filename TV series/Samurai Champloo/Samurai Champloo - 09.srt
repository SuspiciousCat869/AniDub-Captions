What's going on?

316
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,250
[Guard 3] There's a fire
in the storage room.

317
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,583
If we don't do something quick,
it's gonna spread!

318
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,625
What?

319
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,833
[men] There's a fire!
Fire! Fire!

Guess the idea of
waiting for tomorrow

00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,000
didn't sit well with ya.

323
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,708
That's alright,
we can be accommodating.

324
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,083
We'll reschedule the execution
and kill you both now.

325
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,250
Yo, hit the deck.

[Aohabu] What the-

328
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,125
[Guard 5]
Dammit, where are they?

329
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,166
[Aohabu] Find them!

330
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,375
[Guard 6] Do you see them?

331
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:01,083
[men] No! The field!
The field is on fire!

332
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,083
Our crops!

333
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,041
Our revolution!

334
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,333
You bastards.

335
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,625
Take a look at what's
happening to our grass.

336
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,166
Do you realize what you've done?

337
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,125
[voice getting pitchy] Our
holy grass has been destroyed

338
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,833
by your recklessness.

339
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,541
And now you'll pay for it.

Sunset will be over any moment.

00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,250
So, he ran away.

343
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,500
He wouldn't do that.

344
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,958
Hey, just wait
a little bit, maybe...

345
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,000
maybe he's just over
the horizon. Right?

346
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,208
[Kinugasa] Know what I think?

347
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,666
I think it's time for you
to say your prayers.

348
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,041
Look! Someone's coming.

349
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:13,500
[Fuu] Mugen. I knew it.
I knew you'd come.

350
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,041
Who are you?

351
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,833
Oh, are you referring to me?

352
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,458
I'm just out for
a little jog today,

[Fuu grumbling]

355
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,541
So, without further ado, 

356
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,041
it's execution time.

357
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,708
Aww, come on.

358
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,083
If you come back
to haunt someone,

359
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,625
you may want to consider
haunting your friend.

[Fuu] So what do you think
happened back there anyway?

370
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,291
[Jin] We should be grateful that
in the confusion we were able

371
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,083
to cross the checkpoint.

[Fuu] Can you believe Mugen?

Not only did he not

but it's morning
and he still hasn't shown up.
