00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,250
Say what?

162
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,458
Ten percent would be
a very large sum of money.

163
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,583
Are you kidding?

164
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,791
We don't have time
to mess around here,

165
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,458
we've gotta get to Nagasaki!

166
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,583
You'll need it all the more
if you're going to Nagasaki.

167
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,125
You can't fight a battle
on an empty stomach.

168
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,916
He who does not work
does not deserve to eat.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,708
Well, I guess you got a deal.

170
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,375
Right.

171
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,666
No way!

172
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,791
Please, allow these
two to show you the way.

173
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,416
Sabini, Fuupa,
I leave them to you.

174
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,708
Yes. As you wish.

175
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,416
[Fuu] Geez. Why does
this always happen to us?

176
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,666
We're only doing this for
a little while. You got it?

177
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,291
[Shige] There's no need
to be in such a hurry.

178
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,125
Make yourselves at home.

179
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,458
After all, there is no escape.

180
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,208
[Fuu] I don't know what you guys
think, but that Shige is fishy.

181
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,833
Well at least while
we're staying here,

182
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,291
we're saving ourselves the
cost of food and lodging.

183
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,458
I say if we find that treasure
first we just grab it and run.

184
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,875
And somethin' about that
map didn't seem right.

185
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,041
[stomach growl]

186
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,458
Hey, can't we get some
grub around here?

187
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,958
[Fuupa] Um, well...

188
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,250
You guys do have food, right?

189
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,750
[Sabini]
We got this. Hey!

190
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,083
Hold on, share will ya?

191
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,041
Ah! Ug, what is this?

192
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,708
It's wasabi.

193
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,708
[Mugen gags]

194
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,625
[Narrator]
<i>There are some theories</i>

195
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,750
<i>that suggest that</i>
<i>life on Earth</i>

196
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>sprang from organisms carried</i>

197
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,791
<i>These chunks of rock</i>

198
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,833
<i>have traveled from the far</i>
<i>depths of outer space.</i>

199
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,333
<i>And no one can deny</i>
<i>the possibility</i>

200
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,041
<i>that unknown viruses</i>

202
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,916
[Shige] This is Penta,
a self-professed psychic.

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,791
It was he who
divined the location

204
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,541
of the buried treasure.

205
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,833
Explosives were then
planted in the bedrock

206
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,625
that had long ago buried
the bounty beneath it.

207
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,208
This treasure does exist!

208
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,916
[explosion]

209
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,416
[Mugen grunts]

210
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,875
Dammit. What does that bastard
think I am, a freakin' mule?

211
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,708
[Fuu] You've got nobody
to blame but yourselves.

212
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,291
[Fuupa] Hang in there
just a little while longer.

213
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,291
Look at the dowsing
rod over there.

214
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,125
It's picked something
up in the bedrock.

215
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,833
Hold on. Somethin'
strange is goin' on.

216
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,833
I coulda sworn that guy's
arm was cut off before.

217
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,125
Did I just imagine it?

218
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,458
[crashing sound]

219
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,375
[Mugen grunts]

220
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,375
[Fuu] How many days
have we been here now?

221
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,291
[Jin] It feels like
just a few days,

222
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,166
but it could be several months.

223
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,208
The truth is you lose
all track of time

224
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,000
when you start
workin' down here.

225
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,875
But when we finally get to lay
our hands on that treasure,

226
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,666
it'll make the five years we
spent in this hole worth it.

227
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,000
Cause we'll finally knock
that corrupt bastard,

228
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,708
Genji, off his throne.

229
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,250
Genji?

230
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,916
What kind of jackass leader
moves the capital to Kamakura?

231
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,041
I'll tell ya,
Yoritomo's a son of a bitch.

232
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,625
Kamakura?

233
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,666
Hello?

234
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,416
Uh, we're in the
Tokugawa Era now.

235
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,791
[Sabini] Hey, what do you
say we take a little break.

236
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,291
[Fuupa] Yeah.

237
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,166
You really gotta admit,

238
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,666
the people here are
a little bit strange.

239
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,541
I mean, how can anyone
exist on nothing but wasabi?

240
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,375
It is odd.

241
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,333
But I recall wasabi
having certain

242
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,791
preservative elements to it.

243
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,791
Hmm?

244
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,541
Hold on.

245
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,166
I coulda sworn
those two guys were...

246
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,250
Are they... rotting?

247
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,875
Impossible.

248
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,041
That's why they always
eat so much wasabi.

249
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,625
[Fuu gasps]

250
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,291
What do you think?

251
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,458
Is this not the most
perfect place to forget

252
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,708
the troubles of
the world outside?

253
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,250
Alright, come clean.
Who are you people?

254
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,833
[Shige] My word.

255
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:51,083
Such a philosophical question
for someone of your age to ask.

256
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,375
I've pondered this myself.
Who am I, indeed.

257
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,666
I can only hope that someday

258
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,625
I'll be able to find the
answer to that question.

259
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,500
[Henta] Sorry, Sir, but
we're running out of manpower.

260
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, I have no choice.

261
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:08,041
I must go summon some
reinforcements. Excuse me.

262
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,000
[Mugen groans]

263
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,750
I'm completely spent.

264
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,875
[coughing]

265
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,375
I have a heart burn again.

266
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,875
[coughing]

267
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,041
Wait a sec. Maybe I was wrong.

268
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,041
Maybe those weren't
matsutake mushrooms

269
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,125
that they ate after all.

270
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,333
Somethin's not right.

271
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,041
Are you guys also...

272
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,541
[coughing]

273
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,708
Huh? What's her problem?

274
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,583
[Jin] You know, something
has been bothering me.

275
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,083
[Mugen] Huh?

276
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,041
[Jin] Did that Heike family
tree seem suspicious to you?

277
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:08,291
Not really, but if you wanna
take a look at it, it's in here.

278
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,041
Why don't we take
a look at it then.

279
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,500
[Mugen] I can't make any
sense out of this damned thing.

280
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,708
[Jin] Hmm...

281
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,083
[stomach growl]

282
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,791
Man, don't they got anything
else to eat around here?

283
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,791
Guess I got no choice.

284
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:47,875
[Fuu gasps]

285
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,333
[Fuu screams]

286
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,375
[Fuu screams]

287
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,416
Help me!

288
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,250
[Fuu screams]

289
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:32,208
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
pull your arm off. I'm sorry.

290
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,291
[Fuu breathes heavily]

291
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,458
[Fuu screams]

292
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,916
Too bad.

293
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,041
Sorry you discovered our secret.

294
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,416
But now that you have,

295
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,541
I'm afraid I have no choice
but to kill you, too.

296
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,000
[Mugen] So that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

297
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,541
Wish you woulda said
somethin' earlier,

298
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,291
cause I got no problem
takin' all you ugly dudes on.

299
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,416
[Mugen]
Aww, come on, you done already?

300
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,125
What the--

301
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,333
No way. Why aren't you dead?

302
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,625
What the hell's up
with these dudes?

303
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,750
Ah! Ah! Hey! Get off me!

304
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,750
I'm afraid these men
are already dead,

305
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,500
which would make
killing them impossible.

306
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,458
Aww, don't fight it.

307
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,875
Once they kill you, I'll bring
you back to life as well.

308
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,166
[Mugen]
Get off me you freak!

309
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,958
That sure was a
close call, wasn't it?

310
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,583
My head was hanging
by a mere flap of skin.

311
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,583
[Jin]
What's this? Can't be.

312
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,041
Don't resist. Come join us

313
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,958
and help us take back what
that Genji scum stole from us.

314
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,166
[Mugen screams]

315
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,958
What are you talking about?

316
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,125
The Heike and the Genji
have been dead forever.

317
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,666
Don't you know that we're
living in the Edo Era now?

318
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,958
What did you say?

319
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,208
Don't you see?

320
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,416
You think you've been
digging here five years,

321
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,125
but it's really 500.

322
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,250
You guys are so screwed up
you don't even realize

323
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,666
you died hundreds of years ago.

324
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:52,208
[Shige laughs]

325
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,041
You stupid little girl.

326
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,625
How dare you come here and start
babbling this nonsense to me!

327
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,375
[Jin]
Just a minute.

328
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,583
You should probably see this.

329
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,083
Look at the family line here.

330
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,708
Huh?

331
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,708
The two names aren't connected.

332
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,208
But then that means...

333
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,250
You guys are totally unrelated.

334
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,791
I'm afraid you're
not a descendant

335
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,458
of the Heike after all.

336
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,833
Liar!

337
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,333
They aren't connected... at all.

338
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,000
[Mugen]
You got no Heike blood in ya.

339
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,541
[Fuu]
That's a bummer.

340
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,875
How can this be?

341
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,208
I've been digging
for so long now.

342
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,875
After everything
I've been through.

343
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,000
After all my hard work.

344
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,208
All of it was for nothing?

345
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,125
This can't be happening.

346
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:44,041
Nooo!

347
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,750
Uh...

348
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,541
Wait a minute,
what am I thinking?

349
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,166
Just because I'm not
related doesn't mean

350
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,750
we can't keep
digging for treasure.

351
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,750
We shouldn't get too
hung up on bloodlines.

352
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,791
We don't have a drop of
blood in our bodies anyway.

353
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,041
Why don't we just continue
on like we have been?

354
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,500
Let bygones be bygones.
Forgive and forget.

355
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,166
You don't wanna do that, huh?

356
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,375
You sure? Uh...

357
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,541
[biwa strum]

358
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,625
That's all!

359
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,083
Look, it's a mushroom!

360
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:46,666
