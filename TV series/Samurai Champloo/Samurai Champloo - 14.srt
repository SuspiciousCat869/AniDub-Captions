[Mugen] You son of a--

164
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:30,791
That was for me to--!

165
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,875
[Jin] I was deceived.

166
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,916
We were all
played like a fool.

167
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,666
As was he.

168
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,041
[Jin] This is one opponent
that I cannot kill.

169
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,791
[Koza] Do you think we did
the right thing?

170
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,333
[Shiren] Without a doubt.

171
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,708
You wanted to be free
of Mukuro, didn't you?

172
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,416
On top of that, we've got more
money than we could ever spend.

173
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,791
Once the heat dies down,

174
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,125
I'll show you where
it's all hidden.

175
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,958
Are you having second thoughts?

176
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,833
I had to. I couldn't
live like that anymore.

177
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,375
My whole life...
he's been controlling me.

178
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,833
Promise you won't
leave me. Not ever.

179
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:13,000

Don't leave.
