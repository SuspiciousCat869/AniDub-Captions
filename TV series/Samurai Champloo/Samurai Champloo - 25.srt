<i>[Fuu] It's been too hard</i>

3
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,541

00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,958

00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,125

8

15
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,083
<i>And I decided that</i>
<i>I needed to make</i>

16
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,625
<i>this last leg</i>

17

On the north cape, there's
a house alone by itself.

18
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,833
You should go there
and look for him.

19
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:29,083
You should go quickly;
there's not much time.

20
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,541
Thank you.

21
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,791
Thank you!

22
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,375
[Kariya] And now, although it
pains me to say this,

23
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,041
I have to insist that
you two die right here.

[Mugen] You're takin'
us on by yourself?

You sure got a big
pair on ya, pal.

26
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:50,125
Come. I hope that you
don't disappoint me.

27
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,666
[Umanosuke] I want him to know
exactly how we feel.

28
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,875
Wh-What are you talking about?

29
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,125
I'm saying...

30
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,333
You're standing in your grave.

31
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,250
Well, this'll be fun!

[yelling]

33
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,500
[Kariya] Interesting.

34
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,208
You utilize erratic movements

35
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,500
that prevent anyone
from predicting them.

36
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,000
Huh?

37
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,791
[Kariya] But you must learn to
make use of your intellect

38
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,625
in the martial arts.

39
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,250
By relying solely upon
instinct and reflex,

40
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,375
you involuntarily reveal
your limitations to your enemy.

41
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,208
[Mugen] Quit talkin' to me like
you're all hot shit!

[Kariya] I would
very much like to see

44
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,375
your Muju Shin Kenjutsu style.

45
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:51,666
Show me the student able
to take down Enshiro Mariya.

46
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,166
How is it that you
know about that?

47
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,250
I see.

48
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,916

Bye bye.

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,041
Say what? Can't ya see
we're kinda busy here?

63
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:54,541
If you don't hurry up,
bad things might happen to her.

I can't promise that he's not
carving her into little pieces

65
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,875
right now!

66
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,166
Don't piss me off!

67
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:03,833
Go.

68
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,500
Huh?

69
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,500
Go on.

70
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,416
I'll handle this.

71
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,208
No, you go!

72
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,916
[Fuu] You know, I don't
really wanna think about

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,791
stuff like that right now.

74
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:24,041
If you did, then that
jerk Mugen would...

75
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,291
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,166
Forgive me.

77
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,958
Take care of Fuu.

78
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:42,083
[Kariya] Please decide which
of you is going to fight me.

00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,958
Well just don't
let him kill ya.

00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,708
You and me got
unfinished business.

00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,708
Go!

82
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,041
[Boatman] Yes, Sir.

83
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,625
[Kariya] I hope
we can finally fight

84
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,250
without any distractions now.

85
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,583
How do you know the Mugu style?

86
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:50,000
[Kariya] Fate is
a fascinating thing.

87
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,958
If you hadn't killed Mariya,

88
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,708
the Muju style would
be something that

89
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,083
I alone am the master of.

90
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,666
So then, you're Kagetoki Kariya.

91
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,500
[Jin] You want to turn
Muju Shin Kenjutsu

92
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,333
into a band of assassins?

93
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,250
You're asking me to walk
a path of darkness.

94
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,708
No I am not.

95
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,000
But this is the
only choice I have.

96
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,250
[Mariya] There's no dishonor
in serving Master Kariya.

97
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,750
In fact, it's the same as
serving the shogunate itself.

98
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,250
[Jin] You're wrong.

99
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,750
If you do this, it'll no
longer be a martial art.

100
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,291
[Mariya] The period of the
Warring States is over.

101
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,541
This country is at peace now.

102
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,541
There is no need for our
style of martial arts,

103
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,500
one that teaches how to kill.

104
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,583
Martial arts schools
are in decline.

105
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,583
We must accept that.

106
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,583
Please, Jin, endure this.

107
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,916
So then, you were the--

108
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,250
[Kariya] Indeed I was.

109
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,625
[Mariya] You're ordering me
to kill my own pupil?

110
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,625
But he's the one I am planning
to pass my dojo onto.

111
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,125
You cannot ask me to do this.

112
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,708
[Kariya]
As you may have realized,

113
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,041
I was the one who
put him up to it.

114
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,375
Your skills have
grown well, Jin.

115
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,916
Master.

116
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,541
[Mariya screaming]

117
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,208
[Kariya] Regardless of the past,
there's no escaping that

118
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,833
it's your destiny
to die by my hand.

119
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,833
Since it is destined,
let's begin this.

120
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,708
I'd like to see what the
Hand of God is all about.

121
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,208
Gladly.

122
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,583
I've been sitting idle
now for far longer

123
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,291
than I would have liked.

124
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,166
[Boatman yelling]

125
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,833
I shouldn't do it.
I really shouldn't.

126
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,416
What's this... you again?

127
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,083
He made me promise that
I wouldn't do anything to you

128
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,625
until I got to the church.

129
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,625
But it's so hard.

130
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,041
I wanna kill 'im so bad.

131
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,291
And there he is,
right there under my nose

132
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,750
and it's driving me crazy!

133
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,166
I don't think
I can stop myself.

134
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,208
I can't. I just can't wait.

135
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,625
[screaming]

136
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,791
For what?

137
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,958
For what purpose
would a man like you

138
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,500
stoop to becoming
the shogunate's dog?

139
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,041
[Kariya] Hmph. You really think
that a man can live by

140
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,875
his sword skills alone
in this day and age?

141
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,333
So then, you're saying
that you have a lord

142
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,666
worth risking your life for?

143
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,666
You know as well as I that
the only thing any lord values

144
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,625
is self-preservation.
Honor means nothing to them.

145
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,875
There are no lords out there
worth laying down one's life.

146
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,041
[Kariya] You're right.

147
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,166
However, I am far from
being any man's puppet.

148
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,666
They think they have used me,
but it is I who have used them.

149
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,916
The age of the samurai will most
likely be coming to an end soon.

150
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,583
And although I
hate to admit this,

151
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:01,916
it's become painfully apparent
I was born into the wrong era.

152
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,958
As were you.

153
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,041
What'sa matter? That Ryukyu
style of yours not workin'?

154
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,166
Doesn't work so well
in tight spots, does it?

155
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,500
[Kariya] You're
an excellent swordsman.

156
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,375
It's been quite some time since
I've enjoyed myself this much.

157
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:05,791
Your skills are almost
on par with my own.

158
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:10,666
It will be by a razor thin
margin, but you will lose.

159
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,500
<i>[Jin thinking]</i>
<i>His speed is amazing.</i>

160
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,916
<i>And I can't find a single</i>
<i>opening in his defense.</i>

161
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,708
<i>There's just one move</i>
<i>that will end this.</i>

162
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:24,958
[panting]

163
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:42,833
<i>[Voice] A samurai who</i>
<i>smells of sunflowers?</i>

164
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,875
<i>Sunflowers don't have a scent.</i>

165
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,916
<i>So wouldn't that mean that this</i>
<i>samurai you're searching for</i>

166
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
<i>doesn't even exist?</i>

167
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,541
<i>[Fuu] No, you're wrong.</i>
<i>I know you're wrong!</i>

168
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,916
[Umanosuke] Just hang in there
a tiny bit longer.

169
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,041
You'll be put out of
your misery soon enough.

170
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,750
[Fuu] You do realize that
you guys are just

171
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,791
wasting your time with this.

172
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,125
Mugen's the worst.

173
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,958
The last thing he'd care
about is saving a hostage.

174
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,250
[Umanosuke] Oh really?
You don't say.

175
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,083
Well, if that's true

176
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,250
then I may as well kill
the hostage right now.

177
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,333
[Umanosuke] I guess I don't
have to kill you.

178
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:54,000
There's always the option
of leaving you only half dead...

179
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,791
[Fuu grunting]

180
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,208
Just so long as you're
still a little bit alive.

181
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,750
[Fuu grunting]

182
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,333
[unsteady footsteps]

183
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,958
Mugen.

184
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:23,333
[Mugen, tired] Sorry, Buddy.
Time to give her back now.

185
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:27,750
[Umanosuke] Oh I'm so happy now.
We finally meet at last.

186
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,166
So who the hell are you people?

187
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,291
[Umanosuke]
Don't play dumb with me.

188
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,541
Huh?

189
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,708
If you have forgotten us, fine,

190
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,750
but the three of us
will remember you

191
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,166
until the end of our
miserable lives.

192
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,583
Allow me to help.

193
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,833
Perhaps this will
jog your memory.

194
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,250
Before we met, my brothers
and I were well known

195
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,125
around the Satsuma area.

196
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,416
But that all changed.

197
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:00,041
We happened to be in
charge of a raw sugar ship.

198
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:05,666
Maybe you remember that night,
when you and Mukuro robbed it.

199
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,458
My oldest brother ended up
like this thanks to you.

200
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,916
When we returned to Satsuma,

201
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,125
they blamed us for the raid
and drove us out of town.

202
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,250
And that wiped out our chances
of working for the government.

203
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,875
The only thing that
keeps us going now

204
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,666
is the desire to hunt
you down and kill you,

205
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,708
you worthless piece of shit.

206
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,958
Y'know about that
ugly brother of yours...

207
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,458
Huh?!

208
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,916
[Mugen] I just sent his ass
to the bottom of the ocean.

209
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,708
You bastard!

210
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,583
You don't get it, do you?

211
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,625
Whether this little
girl lives or dies

212
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,375
doesn't mean a damn thing
to either one of us.

213
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,000
[Mugen] Shut up.

214
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,333
Look, I'll put down my sword,

215
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,041
but in return, you gotta
let go of the girl.

216
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,666
Well do it then.

217
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,125
But Mugen.

218
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,041
[Mugen] Get outta here.

219
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,375
You gotta go meet
your sunflower dude.

220
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,708
I'm gonna take care of this guy.

221
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,375
[Fuu] But Mugen,
I can't leave you.

222
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,291
[Mugen] Don't gimme that crap.
Listen to me.

223
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,916
I'm gonna be pissed off if we
came all this way for nothin'.

224
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,500
Get lost.

225
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,166
I can't. What if they--

226
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,458
I ain't gonna die.
Have some faith in me, will ya?

227
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,625
Oh Mugen.

228
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,208
[Mugen] Beat it.

229
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,958
Go on!

230
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,875
[screaming] I said go!

231
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,041
[Umanosuke]
You almost made me cry.

232
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,666
Are you really gonna throw
your life away for some girl?

233
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,916
Very well, but I think
I should tell you

234
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,458
that I intend to
kill you slowly.

235
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,458
[Mugen grunting]

236
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:21,500
Oopsie! Did I cut a little
too deeply that time?

237
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,500
Don't give up on me now,
I'm just starting to have fun.

238
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,583
[wheezing] You bastard.

239
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:47,375
