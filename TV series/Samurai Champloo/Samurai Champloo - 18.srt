Stop copyin' what I say.

160
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,833
You're the one who's copyin' me!

161
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,958
Those big brown eyes are so hot!

162
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,250
You're wrong again, you putz,

163
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,458
it's that sexy
little mouth of hers.

164
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,458
Oh? Goodness.

165
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,083
That voice is so sweet
like silver bells.

166
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,500
Idiot.

167
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,708
It's the way her nose
is turned up just a little bit,

168
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,750
like a cute little honey bunny.

169
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,000
Take it easy.

170
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,875
This one's mine, Bro.

171
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,833
[Jin] It's been a long time.

172
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,833
Tatsunoshin. Kazunosuke.

173
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,708
Can't be!
Jin, is it you?

174
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,625
You know these two?

175
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,416
[Mugen] That hurt!

176
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,666
Who the hell
do you think you are?

177
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,833
My name is Bundai.

178
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,333
This is a school.

179
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,750
While you're here,
address me as Sensei!

180
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,500
Oh, so you're a teacher, huh?

181
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,375
Yeah, you could keep trying
to solve your problems by force,

182
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,458
like you do now.

183
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,166
But the world
will keep on turning.

184
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,541
You can't build a castle if
all you've got is carpenters.

185
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,833
What you need is a wood plane.

186
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,583
Even if you've got the wood
plane, if it isn't kept sharp,

187
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,541
you'll get hurt.

188
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,916
First you sharpen your plane,
'cause when you start,

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,541
that's the first tool you use.

190
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,166
Now take your seat boy.

191
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,916
Startin' right now,
I'm gonna teach you how to read.

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,166
Huh?

193
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,875
I'd think that it would
piss you off to have

194
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,458
your companions always
mock you like that!

195
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,541
[Fuu laughing]

196
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,708
Are you kidding me?

197
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,333
You can't read?

198
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:43,125
[Fuu and Jin laughing]

199
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,125
Alright, dammit, you're on!

200
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,250
[Jin] Why do you quarrel
with one another?

201
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,375
As brothers, would you
not be better served

202
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,708
by helping each other
and mastering the path

203
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,666
your father laid down for you?

204
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,625
Hey, what do you
expect? Nobody follows

205
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,500
in their father's
footsteps these days.

206
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,791
It's not cool.

207
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:06,958
When someone offs themselves,

208
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,416
they screw over
the ones left behind.

209
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,375
Besides, the way
he dresses scares people.

210
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,125
Come back and say that
again after you wash

211
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,875
that butt-ugly face of yours.

212
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:17,958
You got somethin' to say?

213
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,708
You want some of this, pinhead?

214
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,750
[sighing] That's enough.

215
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:25,250
As the true heirs of Gojuu Hall,
settle this with swords.

216
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,375
[both]
We don't know how.

217
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,208
[Jin sighing]

218
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,750
Alright then, what would
you substitute for swords,

219
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,708
so that you two
can settle this?

220
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,791
I guess, uh...

221
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,583
Yeah, definitely that.

222
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,875
[Jin] Graffiti.

223
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,333
[Kazunosuke] Hey, it's not
what you think, bro.

224
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,416
It might look like
ordinary graffiti to you,

225
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,958
but we devoted our lives to it.

226
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,541
See, it's really
no different from the way

227
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,041
the old man
devoted himself to the sword.

228
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,625
It's called tagging,
and we do it because

229
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,416
it proves that we're alive,
and we make a difference.

230
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,000
[Tatsunoshin] No, that ain't it.

231
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,791
We try to push the limits and
tag the most dangerous places...

232
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,375
places nobody else ever
tagged before, you know?

233
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,250
The only time
we is really alive

234
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,583
is when we
experience that thrill.

235
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,250
They're saying pretty much
the same thing.

236
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,500
Here's an idea,
maybe you should duel each other

237
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,250
doing this graffiti thing.

238
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,583
[both]
How do we do that?

239
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,125
You could say
that whoever writes

240
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,291
in the most dangerous place
without getting caught

241
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,500
is the winner.

242
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,208
And the prize would be...

243
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,375
Oh, goodness boys,
whatever shall I do.

244
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,000
[both] Bro, please, you gotta do
this. You gotta be the judge.

245
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,875
What's this one?

246
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,083
Hmm, that's "re".

247
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,708
You dumbass!
This one right here is "ne".

248
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,416
The way you can always tell
that it's "ne" is that

249
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,291
it's got this loop on the end,

250
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,166
not the one with a swoop!

251
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,250
The one that's got
the swoop is the "re".

252
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,458
How many times do I
gotta explain it to ya?

253
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,666
This sucks!

254
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,958
What's wrong with
my little kindergartner?

255
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:59,416
Are you givin' up that easy?
Well? Are ya wussin' out?

256
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,833
They look the same, all these
damned letters piss me off!

257
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,750
If you got any complaints,
I listen to 'em

258
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,708
after you pass these drills.

259
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,833
[Fuu] This is kinda unusual
for you isn't it,

260
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,750
acting as a mediator
all of a sudden.

261
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,875
I mean, this is just
a simple squabble

262
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,583
between brothers, isn't it?

263
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,875
Their father was a man
I'm indebted to.

264
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,916
He once asked
something of me--

265
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,708
[Jyunosuke] There is now nothing
more that I can teach you,

266
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,666
my student.

267
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,125
Return to your master,

268
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,375
and walk your path
with your head held high.

269
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,083
[Jin] Yessir.

270
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,666
I've a favor to ask of you.

271
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,916
If anything should
ever happen to me,

272
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,375
I'd like you to look
after my sons.

273
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,250
[children laughing]

274
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,458
[Tatsunoshin] C'mon Kazu.

275
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,791
[Kazunosuke] Wait up, Tatsu.

276
00:13:58,875 --> 00:13:59,875
You're it!

277
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:12,208
[Bonze] Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.

278
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,375
I don't suppose
you remember who I am?

279
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,458
It has been
far too many years, Priest.

280
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,125
I see that you've grown
into a fine young man.

281
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,500
Not at all.

282
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,083
Those are beautiful
flowers you've placed there.

283
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,583
Just some wild
chrysanthemums I found.

284
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,791
The thought is more important
than the flowers themselves.

285
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,416
I'm sure that as we speak,

286
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,125
Master Niwa is smiling
from beyond the grave.

287
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,750
[Jin] What happened to him?

288
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,750
[Bonze] Of all the earthly
emotions of men,

289
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,333
jealousy may be
the most powerful.

290
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,708
There was no dojo in the area
that surpassed Gojuu Hall.

291
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,666
The masters of the other dojos

292
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,583
curried favor
with the local lord

293
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:55,083
and made false accusations
against Master Niwa.

294
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,541
He was ordered to either
close his doors and take down

295
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,791
his sign or
cut off his own arm.

296
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,666
And so, in order to leave
the dojo to his sons,

297
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,125
Master Niwa felt
he had no other choice

298
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,750
than to commit ritual suicide.

299
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,541
But his sons proved they were
unworthy of this sacrifice,

300
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,208
for they were unable
to appreciate

301
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,541
their father's strength
and learn from his example.

302
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:20,208
And their behavior
forever dishonors his memory.

303
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,375
[clock chiming]

304
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:32,708
[labored breathing]

305
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:36,791
[Mugen] Be, Ne, No, Me, A, O!

306
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,166
All answers are correct!

307
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,833
Hell yeah.
What else did you expect?

308
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,541
Now use those letters
to write your story.

309
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:49,000
Write it bigger than
anybody else. Got it?

310
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,583
Bet 'cher ass.

311
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,041
Hey, where the heck
have you been?

312
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,041
[Mugen] Eh, here and there.

313
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,333
Geez, Mugen, we've got
a serious situation going on.

314
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,750
There are these two guys,
vying for my attention.

315
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,333
They're fighting over me now.

316
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,208
[Mugen] Yeah,

they picked Hiroshima Castle?
