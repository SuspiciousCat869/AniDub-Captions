22
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,916
you're making
a big mistake here.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,458
What makes you so sure
I'm the guy you're lookin' for?

24
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,791
[Head Officer] We're after a man
by the name of Okuru.

25
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,791
He's a criminal who has fled
all the way from Matsumae.

26
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,916
We were told that
he's wearing strange clothes

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,125
and is hiding somewhere
in these mountains.

28
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,458
Then we're both
lookin' for the same guy.

What's that?

30
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,500
What'd this Okuru guy
do anyway that makes you

31
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,083
wanna find him so badly?

32
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,541
[Head Officer] This man
isn't Okuru, let's go!

33
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,208
Move out!

34
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,375
[Mugen] Hey,
come back here, dammit!

35
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,583
You weren't takin' off
without apologizing, were ya?

36
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,166
I cannot let you come with me.

37
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,375
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,250
But why not?

39
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,416
It's because I've killed
soldiers of the domain

40
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,875
and I'm on the run.

41
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,708
If you were to come with me,
you'd be a fugitive, too.

42
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,958
It doesn't matter.

43
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,791
There are these two guys
I've been traveling with

44
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:49,958
up until now.

45
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,333
They've done a lot
worse things than that.

46
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,916
If you have friends nearby,

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,250
then you should
be traveling with them.

48
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,916
Those cold-hearted jerks
are no friends of mine.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,416
[Okuru] Once you have
traveled with someone,

50
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,333
they become like brothers.

51
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,958
So you are never alone
in this world.

52
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,000
[Fuu] Okuru...

53
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,500
Are you always
going to travel alone?

54
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,375
[Okuru] I'm never alone;

55
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,000
my wife and daughter
are always with me.

56
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,000
Now go to sleep.

57
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,000
[Officer 4] We don't know why.
He was probably driven mad

58
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,250
by the disease.

59
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,208
I heard that he killed
everyone in his village,

60
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,500
and when the domain soldiers
went in to capture him,

61
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,000
he killed them, too.

62
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,166
The man even killed
his own wife and daughter.

63
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,500
If we leave him running loose,

64
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,208
there's no telling
what he might do.

65
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,125
You're sayin' he's insane?

66
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,041
Funny, he didn't look
like a nutjob to me.

67
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,791
I'll just have
to take him down, then.

68
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,083
What's that?

69
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,916
[Mugen] You better warn
all your little buddies

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,750
to stay outta my way
if they don't wanna get hurt.

said he was from the Ryukyus.

and shavings from
arrows being carved.

There's no doubt about it,
Okuru is here in this forest.

why you're here.

[Fuu] None of your business.

00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,458
Something tells me
you didn't come back

144
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,000
because you suddenly
felt sorry for me.

you might have drowned.

in the river.

[Fuu] So you were gonna keep it
as a memento of me or something?

There are some medicinal herbs.

162
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,000
Pretty sure I saw
some over here.

163
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,125
[Okuru] It was people
from the domain

164
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,416
who brought the disease
to my village.

165
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,916
While I was away,

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,958
the village was transformed
into a mountain of corpses.

167
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,208
It was a terrible sight.

168
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,958
That is how my village
was really destroyed.

169
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,416
It doesn't matter
whether you believe me or not.

170
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,875
Your eyes kinda
remind me of somethin'.

171
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,416
It's a look I've seen before.

172
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,291
Like the half open eyes of a
head that's been chopped off...

173
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,250
Still a little moist
and you can't quite tell

174
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,041
where they're lookin'.

175
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:05,708
So I've gotta wonder.
Are you alive or dead?

176
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,250
[Fuu] Jin! What are you doing?
What is it?

177
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,083
Did you honestly think
you could fool me?

178
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,708
The people revere
these mountains here.

179
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,208
Have you any idea why?

180
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,833
They say you will
be reborn here.

181
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:30,375
Death and rebirth. Everyone
comes here in search of this.

182
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,791
These mountains have
that kind of power.

183
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,083
What about you?

184
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,291
You looking to get
a second chance?

185
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,500
[Jin] Yukimaru.

186
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,166
[Yukimaru] You won't truly be
dead until I perform the job

187
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,166
with my own two hands.

188
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:51,166
You're still extremely young.
I am an old man of nearly forty.

189
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,250
I have lived past my days.
Perhaps it is time

190
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,958
to put an end
to my ceaseless flight.

191
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,416
You're pretty spry
for an old man.

192
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,125
Why do you keep
running from me?

193
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,666
You're sure you want this?

194
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,916
Even if you
hadn't betrayed me...

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,041
or turned your back.

196
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:39,375
I will never, ever
let you get away.

197
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,541
[Mugen] What's the matter?
Outta arrows already?

198
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:03,083
[sound fading away]

199
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:13,375
[paced breathing]

200
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:23,458
[heart beating]
[paced breathing]

201
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:32,125
[heart beating]
[paced breathing]

202
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,666
[Yukimaru]
When I said

203
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,000
I only wanted to make
a name for myself,

204
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,833
I was lying.

205
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:56,083
I only wanted one thing:

206
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,291
to be you.

207
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,416
[Jin] Yukimaru.

208
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,875
What the hell
are those idiots doin'?

209
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,541
Who was he, Jin?

210
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,500
Was he someone you knew
from before?

211
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,333
Yukimaru was like
a little brother to me.

212
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,416
That's ancient history now.

213
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,083
[Officer 7]
We found him, it's Okuru!

214
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,541
[Officer 8]
Get the others, hurry!

215
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,500
[hurried footsteps]

216
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,833
Okuru.

217
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,125
Did they say Okuru just now?

218
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,458
Yes.

219
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,708
Hey, come back.

220
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,500
[Head Officer] Can you hear me?
There's nowhere to run.

221
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,833
Don't make this harder than
it has to be. Give yourself up.

222
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,375
Just stay out of this,
you bastards.

223
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,416
Son of a-

224
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,416
Persistent little peckers,
aren't they?

225
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,708
[Jin] Do you know this Okuru
that they're after?

226
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,875
[Fuu] I have to help him.

227
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,458
I owe him my life.

228
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,291
You have a strong
sense of duty.

229
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,291
Without duty this world
would be a dark place.

230
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,625
You should get out of here.

231
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,833
It's me they want, and I'm tired
of running from these men.

232
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,875
[Mugen] What?

233
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,125
I have to face them.

234
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,500
There's some matters
that need to be settled.

235
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,791
Perhaps what you said to me
earlier was true after all.

236
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,833
Maybe that day,
back in my village,

237
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,291
I became one of the dead.

238
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,625
Go on.

239
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,541
[Mugen] Hey, wait a minute.

240
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh no!

241
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,708
Which way do we go?

242
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,541
Momo!

243
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,916
Where did Okuru go?

244
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,541
[squeaking]

245
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,791
This way.

246
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,958
[Head Officer]
Okuru. We meet at last.

247
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,625
After all this time,
I can finally bring your head

248
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,666
back home with me.

249
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,291
You know nothing...

250
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,541
...about what happened to us.

251
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,916
[Okuru] That official didn't
make the slightest effort

252
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,541
to try to save
even a single person.

253
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,666
He was afraid the disease
would spread further.

254
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,208
So he simply burned
the village to the ground.

255
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,833
No matter. It's still
my duty to bring you in.

256
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,666
Those are my orders.

257
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,666
Okuru's down there.

258
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,250
[Mugen] You bastards!

259
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,875
Keep your hands off him.
This guy's mine!

260
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,500
Hey, what're you...

261
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,625
You- You monster!

262
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,875
I'll make you pay
for what you've done.

263
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,291
[Mugen] I never met anyone
like him before.

264
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,166
I know he's still alive.

265
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,750
Something in my gut tells me.

266
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,958
Right. Ghost of
Yoshitsune my butt.

267
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,875
I bet the rumors were
just a bunch of stories

268
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,333
about those two.

269
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,875
Geez, what a load of garbage.

270
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,708
[Mugen] So tell me...

271
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,583
Why don't you let us in
on the real reason

272
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,541
you're lookin' for
the sunflower samurai.

273
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,125
Is it revenge?

274
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:39,708
[Fuu] That's right. Revenge for
my mom. Or something like that.

275
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,666
Whatever the reason. Wars
aren't won on an empty stomach.

276
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,916
[Mugen] You got that right.

277
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,500
[Fuu] Huh?

278
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,666
Hey, hold on!

279
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,125
Where are you going?

280
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,750
[Mugen] Where the hell is
this Nagasaki place anyway?

281
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,708
You hear anything
about the food there?

282
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,291
[Jin] They've got something
called "castella"

283
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,541
that was brought over
from Europe.

284
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,833
Huh?

285
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,083
[Mugen] C'mon, Girlie,
move your ass.

286
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,958
