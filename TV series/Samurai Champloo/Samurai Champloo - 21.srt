164
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,083
See like a... fish?

165
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,083
[Matagi]
They go with the flow.

166
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,458
Fish use the water
surrounding their bodies

167
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,791
to sense what'll happen next.

168
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,000
If you move against the flow of
the water, the fish feels it,

169
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,083
darts away at the last minute.

170
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,458
But, if you don't
fight the current

171
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,416
and flow with it instead...

172
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,166
[Matagi] Whoopsie.

173
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,208
But, some fish get away anyway!

[Matagi laughs]

Let's call it quits.

[Fuu] It's just...

178
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,416
If I lost you,
I don't know what I'd do.

179
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,750
[Mugen] That blind chick,
she was pretty intense,

180
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,875
but I didn't get the feeling
that she wanted to kill me.

181
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,208
Still, that bitch just
might be able to take me.

[Jin]
Your teachings are wise.

189
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,375
I will take them to heart.

[Jin] Give a man a fish
and you feed him for a day;

192

teach him how to fish and
you feed him for a lifetime.

193

I'm sure you know this
old Chinese proverb.

Did you become attached to them?

207

Perhaps I need to remind you.

It's not just your life
you're gambling with.

your son's fate

[Fuu] Geez...

220
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,125
I think you're dead and
the first thing you ask

221
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,708
is if I'm hungry.

222
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,166

come up with a more

that keeps getting us hurt.

He knows what I'm sayin'.

He went off with that chick,

even though he knew
she wanted to kill us.

It would seem that
for whatever reason,

234
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,333
someone has been
investigating us.

235
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:18,416
She had obviously been ordered
to befriend and accompany us.

236
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,625

She said somethin' about

00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,125
her kid's life
bein' on the line.

238

She did? Well, if that's true,

239
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,666
then someone's
forcing her to do this.

240
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,125
But who could that be?

241
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,916
[Mugen] Take your pick.
We've dined and dashed,

242

snuck through a checkpoint,
and oh yeah, killed people.

243
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,083
But I hardly think the
people we've offended

244
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,416
could've hired an
assassin of her caliber.

245

[Mugen]
Gotta point there.

I guess you're right.

247
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,291
[Mugen] Well, regardless
of who sent her,

248
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,666
if that bitch is
trying to kill us,

chances are we're
gonna see her again.

That woman...

251

...can sense our moves
before we make them.
