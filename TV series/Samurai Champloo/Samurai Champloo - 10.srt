00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,000
Sorry Mister, but I'm afraid
that's all 10 mon'll buy ya.

159
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,250
[Shoryu] Excuse me.

160
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,875
Have some of mine.

161
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,208
Hmm?

162
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,708
I insist.

163
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,833
The true joy of sake comes
only when one is slightly tipsy,

164
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,250
but I've had a little too much
to drink tonight.

165
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,458
Go ahead.

166
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,583
[Mugen] Alright then,
if you insist.

167
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,833
Oh, my apologies.

168
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,083
I guess I really have had
too much to drink.

169
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,375
So, ya heard about this guy?

170
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,666
Who do you mean?

171
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,375
[Mugen] The street killer.

172
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,583
Not really. I'm afraid
I've been out of touch

173
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,291
with public affairs.

174
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,666
From everything I've heard,
he only goes after tough guys.

175
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,458
Why do you suppose
he does that?

176
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,208
I really haven't
the faintest idea.

177
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:04,416
It reminds me
of a story I once heard.

178
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,208
Long ago, on the continent,

179
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,083
there was a man
who was an expert mountaineer.

180
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,083
This man had climbed
an incredibly tall mountain,

181
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,625
but no one had ever heard
of or seen this mountain,

182
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,000
so they couldn't comprehend

183
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,375
the magnitude
of this accomplishment.

184
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,583
Reluctantly, the man
continued to climb mountains

185
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,875
that were said
to be even taller.

186
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,625
Day after day he climbed,

187
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,250
all in order to make the people
recognize his greatness.

188
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,250
In the end, the man stopped
trying to convince them,

189
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,750
made the mountains his
home, and became a demon.

190
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,416
[Mugen] And?

191
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
[Shoryu] The story ends there.

192
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,250
[Mugen] So, what's the point?

193
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,458
[Shoryu] Forgive me, I suppose
there was no point to the story,

194
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,250
but now we go our
separate ways.

195
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,541
That street killer's out there,
so be careful.

196
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,000
Thanks, I will. You, too.

197
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,583
You're him, right?

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,916
What kind of
fighting stance is that?

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,250
[inhaling]

200
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,500
[thunderous wind]

201
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,000
[Shoryu] Impressive.
You were able to dodge that.

202
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,208
[Shoryu chuckling]
This should be entertaining.

203
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,000
[whistling]

204
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,000
[Thieftaker] There he is!
It's the killer!

205
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,916
[men yelling in the distance]

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,708
On the night of the next full
moon, we'll meet here again.

207
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,708
[pained grunting]

208
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,541
[Mugen] What the hell?

209
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,541
[Zuikou] Ah, what
a beautiful moon.

210
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,375
I always love watching it
from here; it's so relaxing.

211
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,583
Oh, there you are.
I was wondering.

212
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,833
I'm so sorry.

213
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,708
[Zuikou chuckling]
It's alright, Miss.

214
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,166
I've been doing some thinking
about that street killer.

215
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,208
[Fuu] The people here say that

216
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,250
the corpses were
bleeding everywhere,

217
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,375
even though there wasn't
a single cut on them.

218
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,916
Jin, you think this
might be too dangerous?

219
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,875
[Fuu] Jin, are you crazy?
What are you doing?

220
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,541
[Jin] My apologies, but the
speed of your movements

221
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,500
leads me to believe that
you're no ordinary priest.

222
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,375
Not ordinary?

223
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,333
Then what kind of priest is he?

224
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,666
[footsteps]

225
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,125
[Mugen] Hey.

226
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,541
Oh, Mugen, it's you.

227
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,958
When did you get back?

228
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,291
Hey, your hand's bleeding.

229
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,583
How did you get
cut up like this?

230
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,708
It's just a scratch.

231
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,416
It's worse than scratches.

232
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,833
You ran into
the street killer, didn't you?

233
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,250
Yeah.

234
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,541
[Fuu] No way.

235
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,000
Guy was using
some kinda weird ass sword.

236
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,750
I dunno, it was like
a real strong wind

237
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,166
shot out of it or something.

238
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,250
[Jin] A wind?

239
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,916
Yeah, and when that wind
hit me, it just-

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,666
[Zuikou, defeatedly]
I knew it.

241
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,291
Unless I'm wrong,
the street killer is most likely

242
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,041
a man called Shoryu.

243
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,125
You know who this guy is?

244
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,208
Shoryu was
a student of mine, years ago.

245
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,583
Back when I was a young man,

246
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,208
I know you may not believe
it to look at me now,

247
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,666
but I was a warrior,
in charge of my own dojo.

248
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,916
And Shoryu whose name was Ukon,

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,750
was a dedicated student at my
dojo, and I was his teacher.

250
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,208
He was a man
of considerable skill.

251
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,250
And he was totally devoted.

252
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,583
Each day he put

253
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,583
his heart and soul into
studying the martial arts.

254
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,375
Eventually, Ukon was sent
on a sea voyage,

255
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,291
on the orders of
this domain's lord.

256
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,583
But the ship met with disaster.

257
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,208
It was believed that
the ship had gone down,

258
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,791
and that there were
no survivors.

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,250
But Ukon escaped death

260
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,958
and miraculously washed ashore
on the continent.

261
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,416
In that land, he encountered
a mysterious martial art.

262
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,791
[thunderous wind]

263
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,875
Whoever could have guessed
just how great an impact

264
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,916
that would have on him.

265
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,916
And then...

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,250
a full ten years
after the shipwreck

267
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:39,541
and Ukon's disappearance,
he returned to this land.

268
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,333
However, he had
changed so completely,

269
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,750
that he almost seemed
a different person.

270
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,166
[Shoryu] In learning the martial
arts of the continent,

271
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,625
I've come to realize
how weak and empty

272
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,125
the disciplines I've
previously studied are.

273
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,583
There is a technique
called Hakkei.

274
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,875
It allows you to defeat
an opponent, not with strength,

275
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,708
but with the power
of your inner chi.

276
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,458
After many hours
of arduous training,

277
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,791
I mastered this technique.

278
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,208
So tell me,

279
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,458
what is the condition
of the warriors of this country?

280
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,208
I wish to teach the ways
of the true martial arts

281
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,791
to the samurai who have
grown indolent and weak.

282
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,708
I want to do something
about this corrupt country.

283
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,625
Ukon, what are you saying?

284
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,541
[Shoryu] I have
given up that name.

285
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,125
I now go by the name of Shoryu.

286
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:31,958
[thunderous wind]

287
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,750
[Student] Enough, I give up.

288
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,375
[Students] Hey wait! Stop!
What are you doing?

289
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,291
[Zuikou] What's going on here?

290
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,791
[Student Teacher] H-He's dead.

291
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,125
[Student 4]
How could you do this?

292
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,541
[Student Teacher]
What kind of a man kills

293
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,000
during a training round?

294
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,958
You would attack a man
who thinks he's training,

295
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,208
and when you have him completely
defenseless, you kill him?

296
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,750
What do you think
the martial arts are for?

297
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,666
[Shoryu] Once mastered,
the martial arts

298
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,166
are a tool for killing.

299
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,625
In other words,
they have but one purpose,

300
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,250
which is to take
the life of your opponent.

301
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,750
You're hereby expelled
from this dojo.

302
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,958
[Shoryu] I-I-I'm what?

303
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,333
Expelled?

304
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,791
You're throwing me out. Why?

305
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,041
That you don't understand

306
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,958
why you're being expelled
is reason enough!

307
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,000
It's ridiculous,
you really believe

308
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,125
that you can throw me out!

309
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,875
You can't be serious!

310
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,583
You're just scared of being
beaten by me, is that it?

311
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,958
You want to get rid of me,

312
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,000
because you're
afraid of me, now.

313
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,125
You're nothing but a coward.

314
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:46,708
[crazed laughing]

315
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,625
[Zuikou] After Shoryu left my
dojo, he wandered from domain

316
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:53,750
to domain, trying to be
accepted into service.

317
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,041
But I heard that
no matter where he went,

318
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,666
he was always
treated as a heretic,

319
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,833
and no domain
would take him in.

320
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,541
He began to hate this world
which wouldn't accept him

321
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,333
or give him recognition.

322
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:10,250
So he went from dojo to dojo,
defeating the master of each.

323
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,708
That's what brought me here:

324
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,458
to serve penance
for my inability

325
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,833
to save the soul
of my disciple,

326
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:24,291
which had become
utterly corrupted with darkness.

327
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:30,708
I left the dojo and became the
priest you see before you now.

328
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,958
I mustn't allow Shoryu
to commit any more sin.

329
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,458
But I don't know if
anyone can stop him.

330
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,041
[Mugen] Sounds good to me.

331
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,458
I think I'm really gonna enjoy
taking on someone like that.

332
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,875
[Mugen yelling]

333

Geez, what in the heck's
goin' on with you?

334
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,708
Why the sudden
change of heart? I don't get it.

--[Mugen] Damn it hurts!
--[Fuu] Weird. I've never seen

336
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,875
Mugen like this before.

337
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,333
[Jin] It's because this
is one opponent

338
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,416
he isn't sure he can defeat.

339
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,125
[Mugen] Meditate under
a waterfall.

340
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,000
Screw that.

341
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,416
[Mugen] Hmm?

342
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Shoryu doesn't use a sword
to kill; he uses his chi.

343
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,750
In this country, the technique
is called the "Armor Piercer,"

344
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,833
and once mastered,
it can destroy the body's

345
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:23,458
internal organs without
scratching the victim's skin.

346
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,875
[Mugen] Well, maybe that's true,
but it can't hurt ya

347
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,666
if it don't hit ya, right?

348
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,750
Look at that moon;
it's so big tonight.

349
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,875
[Mugen] I'm headin' out
for a bit.

350
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,041
You haven't forgotten
your promise, have you?

351
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,541
Huh?

The samurai who smells
of sunflowers, remember?

353
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,125
Don't forget, you said
you'd help me find him.

354
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,750
I won't forget.

355
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,041
[Jin] One other thing...

356
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,208
Hmm?

357
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,416
I shall be the one
who gets to slay you.

358

What are you,
my wife or something?

359
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,250

[Shoryu] I knew you would come.

00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,083
You have no idea
how happy this makes me.

363
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,458
Ever since I returned
from the continent,

364
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,458
everyone has feared me.

365
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:33,041
Not one of them was intelligent
enough to recognize my strength,

366
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,666
in spite of the fact that
my skills were far superior,

367
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,666
even the ones
who they call masters.

368
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,625
That is why I decided
to teach them a lesson.

369
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:46,166
And I showed them exactly
who is the strongest.

370
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,916
[Mugen] Why don't we just
get this started.

371
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,125
I don't need
another pointless story.
