Kariya.

5
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,416
My, what a surprise.

6
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,916
To what occasion do
I owe the honor, Councilor?

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,750
Do you really need
for me to spell out

8
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,833
the reason for my visit today?

9
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,500
[Kariya] Not at all,
I have a pretty good idea.

10
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,458
[Councilor] We're in a race
against time right now.

11
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,708
I only know a little bit,

12
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,000
but I've heard that the
felon from the Ryukyus

13
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,458
and that the ronin who
betrayed the Muju dojo

14
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,625
are both incredibly
gifted swordsmen,

15
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,166
and they should not
be treated lightly.

16
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,625
I've heard that as well.

17
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,791
There's one more thing
you should know.

18
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,000
I've been told that they
are about to make contact

19
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,250
with Seizo Kasumi any day now.

20
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,958
If they manage to meet up with
him before we finish rounding up

21
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,250
the stragglers from
the Shimabara Rebellion,

22
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,875
it'll make things
very complicated.

23
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,125
[Kariya]
Councilor...

24
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,166
Since you made the trip,
do me a favor, 

25
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,708
allow me to show you some
of the flowers in my garden.

26
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,958
There's no time
for that. Understand?

27
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,458
Are you aware of the proper
method that one should use

28
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,125
to eliminate weeds?

29
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,166
Hmm?

30
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,125
You see, weeds,
when left unchecked,

31
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,083
will rob the flower of
its proper nutrients.

32
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,791
So what do you do?

33
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,791
If you uproot the weed,
then you disturb the flower,

34
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:01,333
its roots and soil don't
like to be interfered with.

35
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,791
So, what do you do?

36
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,416
[Kariya] You learn to plant
flowers that utilize the weeds

37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,708
as a form of nourishment.

38
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,458
Take a look. This flower is an
example of a beautiful exterior,

39
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,583
masking its true intentions.

40
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,458
Intentions that are
really quite brutal.

41
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,000
[Councilor] I've been
told that Sara was killed.

42
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,875
--Really?
--Mm-Hmm.

43
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,958
If they're good enough to
kill someone of her caliber,

44
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,958
then perhaps the time
has finally come

45
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,666
for me to draw my own
sword once again.

46
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,166
[Councilor] Pardon me?

47
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,500
This one I'll do personally.

48
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,875
[Associate]
Councilor...

49
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:43,958
Excuse me...

50
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,250
What is it?

51
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,833
The only thing Kariya does

52
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,291
is sit around and look
at his flowers all day.

53
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,875
I don't know anyone who's
seen him draw his sword.

54
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,625
The only thing he
cares about are flowers.

55
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,625
I may be out of
line by saying this,

56
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,750
but I don't think he can handle
a task of this magnitude.

57
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,833
Really? You are
young, aren't you?

58
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,333
I'm not surprised that
someone from your generation

59
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,583
might doubt him.

60
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,750
You want to know why he
doesn't draw his sword?

61
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,541
Because there hasn't been
an opponent out there

62
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,666
that's worthy of him in ages.

63
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,041
Kagetoki Kariya was once
known as the Hand of the Gods.

64
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,708
The man is a master swordsman.

65
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,333
[Associate] He is?

66
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,666
[Councilor] I don't
think it's possible

67
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,291
that there's
anyone in this world

68
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,458
who is more capable
of killing them.

69
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:43,958
[Mugen] Hey, how much longer
'til we get to Nagasaki?

70
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,083
[Jin] Well, actually
we've passed Nagasaki.

71
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,250
[Both] Huh?!

72
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,625
According to the map,

73
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,250
Ikitsuki Island is just
north of Nagasaki.

74
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,916
After we pass the mountain, we
should be right in sight of it.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,083
That figures.

76
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,041
We been bustin' our
asses all this time,

77
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,250
and we already passed it.

78
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,000
So we made it.

79
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,000
It almost doesn't seem real.

80
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,375
There were times when
I thought we'd never get here.

81
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,458
But we actually did.

82
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,791
We're not done. 

83
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,875
Even if we do get to that
damned island of yours,

84
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,416
it doesn't mean we're gonna
find your smelly samurai.

85
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,000
Well yeah, I guess you're right.

86
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,250
[Fuu] You know,
doesn't it seem strange?

87
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,750
[Mugen] What?

88
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,916
[Fuu] Well, the fact that
we've been traveling together

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,250
this whole time,

90
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,541
but we don't really know
anything about each other.

91
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,166
Like who we each were, before
we all hooked up, ya know?

92
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,250
Huh?

93
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,750
I suppose you're right.

94
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,166
Hey, I know, it's
time to come clean.

95
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,041
Why don't we go around
and tell one thing

96
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,208
that we've each kept
secret about our pasts.

97
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,041
You never know,
we might not ever...

98
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,666
get a chance to tell each
other these things again.

99
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,791
What's up with her?

100
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,500
She's sentimental.

101
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,333
She's what kinda mental?

102
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,791
[Jin] It's a female emotion
found in western European women.

103
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,375
I suspect her
emotions are getting

104
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,791
the best of her right now.

105
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,208
'Ja hear me?
Mugen you're first.

106
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,166
[Mugen] Me?

107
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,916
Sorry, Sister, I don't
really got any secrets.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,083
But if you must know, I been
up to no good my entire life.

109
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,666
Tell us something
we don't know.

110
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,291
Uh, well, I'd kinda like to shag
a chick with great big hooters.

111
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,708
Know that too.

112
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,250
[Mugen]
I got one.

113
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,208
I got into this nasty ass fight
when I was on the road once,

114
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,958
I ended up having to totally
waste some weird old geezer.

115
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,666
Weird? How was he weird?

116
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,833
He turned to me and said,

117
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,375
[in deep voice]
"Can you not see this box

118
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,625
with the shogun's crest?"

119
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,083
[in normal voice]
So I said "No, I can't."

120
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,333
And I killed the
crazy old dude cold.

121
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,541
Really?

122
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,958
Wasn't that dangerous?

123
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,458
I wouldn't call it dangerous,

124
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,833
but you're lucky that you
left there with your life.

125
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,375
[Fuu]
Okay, Jin, you're next. Go!

126
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,875
Well, I...

127
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,291
Tell us what you were up to,
before you met us.

128
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,458
[Jin] I had been traveling
for quite some time.

129
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,875
My parents both passed
away when I was still young.

130
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,875
The Muju Shin Kenjutsu dojo
was left to care for me.

131
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,583
I had nothing.

132
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,375
I did nothing but
train in kenjutsu

133
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,000
day in and day out
from that point on.

134
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,208
I got used to being alone,

135
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,541
and soon, none of the other
children were any match for me.

136
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,541
Instead, they were
jealous and afraid.

137
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,958
And they did their
best to reject me.

138
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,875
[Mariya]
Your eyes see too much.

139
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:42,250
Your strength is
unbridled and relentless.

140
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,458
That means your strength
is a power that exists

141
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,750
for no one other than you.

142
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,666
[Jin] Eventually, I was
forced to bear the shame

143
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,291
of killing my master and
was driven from the dojo.

144
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,750
I've spent every single day
since then on the road,

145
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,250
traveling in search
of something,

146
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,500
but having no real idea
of what that something is

147
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,083
or where to find it.

148
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,666
Perhaps, the only thing
I've ever done is run away.

149
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,500
[Mugen]
Your turn now.

150
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,333
My mother and I had
lived by ourselves

151
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,125
for as far back
as I can remember.

152
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,666
I grew up believing that
my father had died

153
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,333
when I was very young.

154
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,916
But while my mother
was sick and dying,

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,541
she told me the truth.

156
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,833
She said she knew in her heart

157
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,083
my father was still
alive somewhere,

158
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,916
that he had left her
when I was really little,

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,500
to go someplace that
he wouldn't say.

160
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,125
And while my mother seemed
completely at peace with him,

161
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:55,458
I wasn't. And I wasn't
gonna forgive him.

162
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,916
Right then,
I swore I'd find him.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,958
And slug him good for my mom.

164
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,250
I felt I owed her that.

165
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,000
But for whatever reason, I could
never work up the courage

166
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,333
to actually start the journey.

167
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,291
Then I met you two
at the teahouse.

168
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,125
And that's when it hit me.

169
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,458
I had this feeling that if I
were to join up with you two,

170
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,583
I might just be able
to pull it off.

171
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,041
Thanks guys.

172
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,625
Thanks a lot for
stickin' with me.

173
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,791
[footsteps]

174
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,541
[Jin]
Is there something wrong?

175
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:53,375
No. It's alright. I'm fine.

176
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,791
Tell me...

177
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,041
Huh?

178
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,000
[Jin] After you find
the sunflower samurai,

179
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,083
what do you intend to do?

180
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,375
Well, um, that's
a good question.

181
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,208
I should probably
think about that.

182
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,416
Perhaps I should...

183
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,916
[Fuu] You know,

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,458
I don't really wanna think about
stuff like that right now.

185
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,958
If you did, then that
jerk Mugen would...

186
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,958
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,750
Forgive me.

188
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,208
[birds chirp]

00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,541
[sniffing]

190
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,000
[Umanosuke] Well?

191
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,041
Oh yeah, it's them alright.

192
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,208
Excellent.

193
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,541
I wanna kill 'em.
I wanna kill 'em so bad!

194
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,916
Settle down.

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,791
Just wait a little longer.

00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,958
[footsteps]

197
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,500
[Umanosuke] You there!

198
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,708
Have you any idea

199
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,041
who might have set
this campfire yesterday?

200
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,833
I got no clue.

201
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,708
We don't like outsiders
around here. Get lost.

202
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:10,125
Hey, you just pretend like
you never saw us, alright?

203
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,958
Perhaps I should help,
just in case he forgets.

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,166

[blood gushing]

206
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,541
Huh?

207
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,500
Wow, look at that!

208
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,708
[stomach growls]

209
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,041
[Fuu] Aww, don't answer
me with the grumblies.

210
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,041
[Mugen] First thing we're
doin' is gettin' food.

211
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,666
[Jin] Hmm.

212
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,083
[Owner]
Ikitsuki Island?

213
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,250
Well, you're gonna have to
hire a boat to get there.

214
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,541
Here ya go.

215
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,541
One order of Shabu-shabu.

216
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,458
Whoa, check it out.

217
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,333
Is that beef?

218
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,583
It looks like

219
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,041
this area has picked up
European eating habits.

220
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,791
Am I just whacked,
or is this stuff raw?

221
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:29,041
Uh, you're supposed to soak
it in the hot water first.

222
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,333
It'll cook up pretty quick.

223
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,333
Hell, I'll try anything once.

224
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,833
Now hold on!

225
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,458
People can get weird when
they're sharing one pot dishes.

226
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,833
I think we should lay
down some ground rules.

227
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,166
We take turns, meat,
vegetables, meat, vegetables,

228
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,666
like that so no one feels
they're being slighted.

229
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,708
Will you guys wait?

230
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,833
Don't start eating without me!

231
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,291
Mugen! All you're
eating is the meat!

232
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,583
Yo, get out of my
space ya pot freak.

233
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,416
You've gotta follow the--

234
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,625
Jin, all you're eating
is the meat, too!

235
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,625
[Jin]
Delicious.

236
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,541
You can shove your damned rules.

237
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,666
[Mugen]
Early bird gets the worm.

238
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,333
This food is wonderful.

239
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, I give up! You guys
only think of yourselves.

240
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,083
[Fuu]
Hey, look, there's a boat.

241
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,541
I forgot to buy some souvenirs.

242
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,416
Huh?

243
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,375
Souvenirs?

244
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,166
[Fuu]
Some castella cakes.

245
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,500
Would you guys go 
get some for me, please?

246
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,791
Do it yourself.

247
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,041
Relax, I got all the
cash you need right here.

248
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,666
So quit your
grumblin' and get goin'.

249
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,208
Thanks!

250
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,958
I'll take care of handlin' the
boat fare while you're gone.

251
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,416
[Mugen] Man, she just
keeps gettin' weirder.

252
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,458
Here.

253
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,500
Be right there.

254
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,041
[Umanosuke] You had a criminal
from the Ryukyus

255
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,208
who goes by the name of Mugen
pass through here, didn't you?

256
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,666
[Owner]
Who are you?

257
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,916
If you're trying to hide him,
I don't really care.

258
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,291
However, one of
my men out there

259
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,500
wants to kill him so
badly he can taste it.

260
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,791
And you know, when
he gets like this,

261
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,250
keeping him under control
is very difficult.

Hold on a minute, please!

Please stop!

[Owner whimpering]

268
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,750
[Owner] I don't know if this is
who you're lookin' for or not,

269
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,666
but some guy came through here
earlier with a strange sword.

270
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,625
And he said he was
going to Ikitsuki Island.

271
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,541
[Umanosuke]
You're gonna forget

272
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,208
you ever saw us
come in here, alright?

273
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,541
Don't tell a soul, got it?

274
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,833
I understand.
I won't tell anyone.

275
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,125
[Denkibou]
Now that's not nice.

276
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:11,625
We told you you shouldn't go
telling anyone, not didn't we?

[screaming]

00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,708
[Mugen] Any one of these
damn things'll do, right?

279
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,833
[Jin] Yes, these are
rather expensive.

280
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,791
[Mugen] How much
she got in her bag?

281
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,041
[Boatman] Alright, we're
about to cast off.

282
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,208
Okay, I'll be right there!

283
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,416
[Kariya] Something wrong?

284
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,750
No, I...

285
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,041
[Boatman] All aboard.

286
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:02,750
'Scuse me, but is your name
Seizo Kasumi by chance?

287
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,625
You know, forget I said that.

288
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:11,791
I was wrong. I guess
I thought you were someone else.

00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,458
Sorry.

290

What's that thing?

291
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,291
It's from Fuu.

<i>I want you to know</i>

<i>the talk we had around</i>
<i>the campfire last night.</i>

296
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,750

<i>I found myself wishing</i>

<i>that this journey</i>
<i>could go on forever.</i>

298

<i>But then all of a</i>

<i>When I thought of the</i>
<i>three of us splitting up,</i>

300
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,291
<i>I started to panic.</i>

301
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,750
<i>Maybe I've been relying on you</i>
<i>guys too much this whole time.</i>

302
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,791
<i>I wasn't sure if I'd be</i>
<i>able to make it on my own</i>

303

<i>once this journey was over.</i>

304
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,583
<i>So I started giving</i>
<i>it a lot of thought...</i>

305
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,958
<i>..and I decided that</i>
<i>I needed to make</i>

306
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,875
<i>this last leg of</i>
<i>the trip alone.</i>

307
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,750
<i>Just one last thing...</i>

308
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,541
<i>I know you said you'd</i>
<i>put off your duel</i>

00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,250
<i>until our journey was over,</i>

310
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:28,208
<i>but I really don't want</i>
<i>you two to kill each other.</i>

311
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:32,250
<i>The souvenir castella cakes</i>

312
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,750
<i>Take some time. Eat the cakes.</i>

313
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,375
<i>And try to reconsider the duel.</i>

314
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,583
<i>Goodbye.</i>

00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,125
'Scuse me,
I'm looking for someone.

317
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,375
Maybe you've heard of him.
His name is Seizo Kasumi.

318
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,916
I was told that he
was on this island.

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,333
[Villager] Do you
have a death wish?

320
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,500
Huh? No.

321
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,250
I'm just hoping I can
find someone, that's all.

322
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,250
[Villager]
This used to be

323
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,250
a peaceful village
a long time ago.

324
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,291
And if those Christians
hadn't come here,

325
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,083
then they might not have come
and burned down our homes

326
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,666
with our families
still inside them.

327
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,083
Get out. And don't ever speak
that name around here again.

328
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,625
[door sliding shut]

329
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,375
[whining]

330
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:52,625
Come here.

331
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,583
Look!

332
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,333
Come on, let's go.

333
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,416
[Mother] This person that you're
looking for...  are you related?

334
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,000
Well he's... my father.

335
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,750
Oh.

336
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:23,625
On the north cape, there's
a house alone by itself.

337
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,958
Go there and look for him.

338
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:31,083
You should go quickly;
there's not much time.

339
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,250
Thank you.

340
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,416
Thank you!

341
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:49,791
[Kariya] Only hope can give rise
to the emotion we call despair.

342
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,208
But it is nearly impossible

343
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,208
for a man to try to
live without hope,

344
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,541
so I guess that
leaves man no choice

345
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,583
but to walk around with
despair as his companion.

346
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,166
[Mugen]
Huh?

347
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,125
What the hell do you want?

348
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,166
[Kariya] If you're looking
for Kasumi's daughter,

349
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,583
she's crossed over
to the island.

350
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,250
[Jin] Do you know him?

351
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,625
You know Seizo Kasumi?

352
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,166
I know he's a felon who
abandoned his country

353
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,875
and had his soul stolen
by that foreign religion.

354
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,958
I've heard that he
fled here to Kyushu

355
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,125
and that he was involved in
the Shimabara Rebellion.

356
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,583
I also know he's the
man who the shogunate

357
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,916
wants eliminated more
than anyone else.

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,250
They've known all along

359
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,666
that his daughter was
trying to find him.

360
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,916
In fact, it's helped them.

361
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,416
They've let her run
free this whole time

362
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,541
so they're able to discover
Kasumi's whereabouts.

363
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,083
And now, although it
pains me to say this,

364
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,958
I have to insist that
you two die right here.

365
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,541
[Mugen]
You're takin' us on by yourself?

366
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,416
You sure got a big
pair on ya, pal.

367
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,833
Come. I hope that
you don't disappoint me.

368
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,333
[Umanosuke]
Why in such a rush, little girl?

369
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,750
It's so unfortunate.

370
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,416
Life is such a bitch sometimes.

371
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,833
You go and make
a really long journey 

372
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,208
only to have the whole
thing blow up in your face

373
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,958
as you reach your
final destination.

374
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,958
You see, I want him
to have a good taste

375
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,041
of what that feeling is like.

376
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,958
I want him to know
exactly how we feel.

377
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,583
Wh-What are you talking about?

378
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,958
I'm saying...

379
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,833
You're standing in your grave.

380
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:47,250
