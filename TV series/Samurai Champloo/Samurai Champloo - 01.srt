00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,375
You just don't get it
at all, do you pal?

165
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,875
[Mugen] Huh?

166
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,750
[Younger Shibui] My old man's
the governor around here,

167
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,291
so folks who
mess with me pay for it.

168
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,500
Big time.

169
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,500
Hell, fact is
they don't live long enough

170
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,458
to see the next sunrise.

171
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,000
You starting to get it?

172
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,291
This isn't the damn civil war.

173
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,125
In this day and age
acting like a loose cannon,

174
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,291
going around swinging a
sword is totally passé.

175
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,041
Huh? AHH!

176
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,625
Do you understand
what I just said?

177
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,833
[Mugen] Nope. Not at all.

178
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,916
Come on, why not?
It's common sense.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,916
That's just the way
the world is today.

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,750
I don't give a rat's ass
about your common sense.

181
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,833
Huh?

182
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,000
Because I come from Ryukyu, pal.

183
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,291
Huh?

184
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,875
[record scratching]

185
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,416
Huh?

186
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,541
Wait!

187
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,541
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait just a minute!

188
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,208
You want money? Is that it?

189
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,291
You can have as much
as you want, okay?

190
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,750
H-How 'bout it?

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,083
You?

192
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,083
I'll take these.

193
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,208
You... bastard!

194
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,208
Somebody stop that man!

195
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,250
You miserable,
good-for-nothing cowards!

196
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,791
[record scratching]

197
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:02,333
[Younger Shibui] Listen. My old
man has three Yagyu badasses

198
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,041
guarding him around the clock.

199
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,083
Huh?

200
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,750
[Younger Shibui
nervously laughing]

201
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,958
What's the matter? You scared?

202
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,000
You pee your pants?

203
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,250
[laughing]

204
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,500
[wailing]
I'm sorry!

205
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey, gimme your hand.

206
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:14,833
Hm?

207
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:18,625
[Younger Shibui whimpering]

208
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,083
Listen up, morons!

209
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,000
Here's the deal. You guys
ain't worth bothering with.

210
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,458
You're gonna leave
and I'm gonna count to ten.

211
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,708
You've got that long
to get those badasses over here.

212
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,458
I'll count with his fingers
until you get back.

213
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,000
This is one.
[bone breaking]

214
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:37,458
[screaming]

215
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,875
And two.

216
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,208
[bone breaking,
Younger Shibui screaming]

217
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,541
[hectic yelping, running]

218
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,791
And three.

219
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,083
[Younger Shibui
wailing in pain]

220
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,875
And four.

221
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,250
How boring.

222
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,208
What the hell,
let's do them all.

223
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,041
No, wait. Hold on a minute...

224
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,208
[gasping]

225
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,416
Are you one of them?
A Yagyu swordsman?

226
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,000
You are in the middle
of something. Pardon me.

227
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,708
[Mugen] Hey! Are you one of
those so-called badasses?

228
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,583
[running footsteps]

229
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,750
[Mugen grunting]

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,916
You've got the wrong guy.
And don't bother

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,166
waiting for the Yagyus,
they're all gone.

232
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,250
[Mugen] They're gone?

233
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,375
I killed all three.

234
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,875
Better yet!

235
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,208
[Jin panting]

236
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:57,125
[surprised gasping, whimpering]

237
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,166
[Fuu gasps]

238
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,291
[water trickling]

239
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,083
Uh, Mr. Ryujiro?

240
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:08,166
[maniacal laughing]

241
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,500
[frantic screaming, yelling]

242
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:15,291
[laughing] Burn it all.
Burn it to the ground!

243
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,833
[frantic screaming, yelling]

244
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,500
I can't imagine
a more perfect setting.

245
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,083
Aren't you going to run?

246
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,458
[Mugen] Nah, but go ahead.
Don't stay on my account.

247
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,833
[Mugen shrieking]

248
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,166
Damn that's cold!

249
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,416
Huh?

250
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,583
[water dripping]

251
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,291
[splashing]

252
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,541
What in the hell
is going on here?

253
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,500
Don't you remember?

254
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,500
I remember a dream.

255
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,166
There was fire all around me.

256
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,333
It wasn't a dream.

257
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,708
Oh, yeah?
So you were in a bathtub

258
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,125
with your thing hanging out?

259
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,958
Now that was a dream.

260
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,666
[Elder Shibui]
Too bad it wasn't a dream.

261
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,708
My son burned to death
in that fire.

262
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,916
And now you're both
going to pay for that.

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,250
Fortunately, it wasn't long
ago this place was called

264
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,208
"the torture department store."

265
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,916
You're going to be
well taken care of

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,875
till your execution tomorrow.

267
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,041
Ahh!

268
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,375
[Jin groaning]

269
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,500
[grunting]

270
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,125
Ugh.

271
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,166
[choking]

272
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,083
[grunting]

273
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,875
[bell tolling far away]

274
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,416
[bell tolling far away]

275
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,291
[Kikuzo] Fuu.

276
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,958
Huh?

277
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,333
I guess this must be
awfully tough for you.

278
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,583
Nah. It's really no big deal.

279
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,458
Well since you have no family,

280
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,833
you'd be welcome
to come with us if you like.

281
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,000
No. I'll be okay.

282
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,625
This thing has forced me
to make up my mind.

283
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,708
[Ogin and Kikuzo together]
Huh?

284
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,458
[Jin] You're the
lowest of the low.

285
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,000
[Mugen] What did you say?

286
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,833
[Jin] Your stance
leaves you wide open,

287
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,083
and your moves are
totally inefficient.

288
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,541
All in all your
fighting style is a mess.

289
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,250
You son of a...

290
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,583
I swear, you are the most
undisciplined fighter

291
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,916
I've ever known.

292
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,750
Shut you damn mouth.

293
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,666
And the only one
I wasn't able to kill.

294
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,125
Mugen is the name, pal.
You got that?

295
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,000
[Jin] Mugen.

296
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,708
Right.

297
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,416
My name is Jin.

298
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,083
You should remember it.

299
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,833
[crickets chirping]

300
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:48,916
[Fuu] Please, sir.

301
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,291
Forget it.

302
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,583
The prisoners aren't allowed
to have any visitors.

303
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,208
Can't you bend the rules
for a minute?

304
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, please, sir.
Do it for me.

305
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:57,958
Pretty please?

306
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,125
No way.

307
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,333
[Fuu] I'm begging you.
I'll do anything.

308
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,333
Anything?

309
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,541
[Fuu] Uh...

310
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,333
You mean you'll...

311
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,041
[Fuu] I, uh...

312
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,875
You know... have se--

313
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,166
Anything but that.

314
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,541
What is this?

315
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,125
You said anything.
You lying little bitch.

316
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,208
Not with you Baldy. No way.

317
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,500
I'm not bald.

318
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,625
--This is a hairstyle.
--Hey, cut it out!

319
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,208
[Guard] Stop wiggling.

320
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,666
Take this.

321
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,083
Thanks for the help, Momo.

322
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,208
[happy squeaking]

323
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,208
[Fuu] Oh, wow.
From the looks of things,

324
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,541
they really put you two
through the ringer.

325
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,791
You're that chick.

326
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,750
The one from the tea house.

327
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,416
[Fuu laughing]

328
