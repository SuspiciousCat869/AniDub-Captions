I'm afraid not.

This is no place for

You should go home.

[Fuu] Please, Sir.
I came here to see someone.

I've traveled a long way,

so much to find him.

if I allowed you
to die so easily.

Because there's a lesson
that I want you to learn.

29
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,875
I feel I have a responsibility

[Old Man] Yes, Seizo, it is I.
There is a young girl outside.

If you like, I could
tell her to come back later.

No, don't. It's alright.

I'm afraid my eyes
can't see very much these days.

59
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,875
[Fuu] Ever since I was
a very young girl,

60
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,416
my mother and I
lived by ourselves.

61
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,916
As long as I can remember,

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,250
I've been told that my father
had died a long time ago.

63
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,166
But now I know
that wasn't true.

64
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,416
He was alive the whole time,

65
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,208
and he had abandoned
Mother and me.

66
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:24,541
My mother finally told me
the truth as she lay dying.

67
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:28,041
Even now, when people
ask me about my father,

68
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,875
I say I don't have one.

69
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,541
I tell them, "I don't even
consider myself his daughter.

70
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:38,083
If I met him now,
I wouldn't accept any excuses.

71
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,875
I won't forgive him
as long as I live."

72
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,041
And why should I?

73
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,250
He knows nothing of what
my mother and I went through...

74
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,541
How we both suffered
when mother was sick.

75
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,250
Or the way she died.

76
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,833
That's why I swore
when I met him,

77
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,250
I would make sure
he understood.

78
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:04,083
I swore I'd finally
belt him one, no matter what.

79
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,625
I had it all planned.

80
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,208
This isn't fair.

81
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:15,041
I can't do anything to you now,
not if you're like this.

83
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,708
I don't think
we'll see each other again.

84
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,583
Goodbye.

85
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,583
[Young Fuu] Dear God,
please hear my prayer.

86
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,625
Once is all I ask.

87
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:11,291
When I grow up, please let me
meet my father someday.

88
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,791
[Old Man] The moment I saw you,
I said to myself,

89
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,166
"This is Seizo's daughter."

90
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,083
You should know that

and your mother a great deal.

I am Guard Captain

I have come here under order
of the shogun to take your life.

99
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:18,666
Well then, do what you have to.
I'm as good as dead already.

100
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,875
[Kariya] Do you have any
last words before you die?

101
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:29,625
[Seizo] Fuu, I have no right
to ask forgiveness.

102
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,666
I don't deserve it.

103
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,083
But you should know...

104
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,916
Not a single day has passed

Damn it! Come out and fight.

I have fulfilled my first order.

109
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,750
I must now eliminate Kasumi's
family members and retainers.

110
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,125
No please don't.

111
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,500
Well that hurt like

You've chosen well.

124

If you are truly
the daughter of a samurai,

125

you may choose
to take your own life.

[Kariya] You have
my compliments.

130
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,791
You've somehow managed
to avoid a fatal blow.

131
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,875
In your current
condition however,

132
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,750
you can't possibly defeat me.

133
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,375
Why are you here?
Are you trying to throw away

134
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,333
the life you so narrowly
managed to keep?

135
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,875
As I recall, you once said,

136
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,208
"There are no lords
worth risking your life for."

137
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,208
That's right.
For my entire life,

138
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,625
I've chosen to fight
for no one but myself.

139
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,875
My dedication and
my study of the sword

140
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,250
was for no one but myself.

141
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,083
Until now.

142
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,166
[Mariya] This is the last lesson
I have to teach you.

143
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,166
It is the only means
in which to kill your opponent

144
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,500
when you have
no hope of victory.

145
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,000
It is not likely
you will survive,

146
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,916
but it is possible that
you will take him with you.

147
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,916
You leave an opening
in your defense,

148
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,041
which allows him to strike.

149
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,166
When that happens,
it creates a brief opening

150
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,625
for you to deliver your blow.

151
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:49,041
Your chances of surviving the
encounter are virtually zero.

152
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:53,750
If at all possible,
do not ever use this technique.

153
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,333

get stuck with it.

161
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,958
I can't move my body.

162
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,791
Looks like I finally bought it.

163
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,541
It's been sweet.

164
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,291
[Fuu] Mugen!

165
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,875
Mugen!

166
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,416
Mugen!

167
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,083
Mugen, you're alive.

168
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,708
Aw shit, it's only you.

169
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,208
I thought you were the angel
of death for a minute there.

170
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,250
[Fuu] It seems like
all I do is cry.

171
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:16,041
And here I was trying to
make it on my own. [sobbing]

172
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,916
You dumb broad.

173
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,041
What about the
sunflower samurai?

174
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,833
D'you finally meet him?

175
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,041
You did, huh?

176
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,000
A promise is a promise.

177
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,083
And you and I have

178
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,625
some unfinished business
to take care of.

179
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,583
You're right for once.

180
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,375
We really suck.

181
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,750
You got that right.

182
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,625
[Old Man] It's important that
you know the truth.

183
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,875
Seizo wanted to bring you
and your mother with him.

184
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,083
But he needed to
separate himself to keep

185
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:30,125
the shogunate's Christian hounds
from coming after you as well.

186
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,500
That is why your father
came here by himself.

187
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,000
In my memories
I can picture my father.

188
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,375
He was such a big man
and incredibly strong.

189
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,583
But then when I met him,

190
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,875
he wasn't anything like that.

191
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,416
He seemed so small
and frail lying there.

192
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,833
But still,
even before he spoke...

193
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,416
I sensed that he was my father.

194
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,250
Are you awake?

195
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,333
I guess.

196
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:08,375
[Jin] I could be wrong, but
this doesn't seem like Hell.

197
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,541
[Mugen] This is so weird.

198
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,416
Up until now,

199
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,541
whenever I met somebody
who was tougher than me,

200
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,708
I couldn't rest
until I killed the guy.

201
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,291
For some reason, I dunno,

202
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,791
I just don't feel like
killin' you at all.

203
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,333
[Jin] I, too, feel as if
I finally found

204
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,375
what I've been
searching for all this time.

205
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,541
I have been alone
my entire life.

206
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,708
You two are my first friends.

207
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,458
Hey, you guys are awake.

208
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,500
You certainly got enough sleep.

209
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,916
You've been out
for almost an entire week.

210
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,208
[Jin] We have?

211
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,916
I could eat a horse.

212
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,500
Can you get us some food?

213
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,458
[loud burp]

214
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,083
Catch ya later.

215
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,333
Until we meet again.

216
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,000
[Fuu] Uh, guys, there's
something I haven't told you...

217
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:21,916
Huh?

218
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,333
Such as...?

219
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,125
You remember back
when we started this trip

220
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,958
we made a little bet.

221
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,833
We'll decide this
by tossing this coin.

222
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,750
If it's heads,
you fight each other.

223
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,083
But if it's tails,
you forget about the fight

224
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,666
and you both come with me.

225
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,125
Are we clear on this?

226
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:39,958
Tails!

227
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,916
The thing is,
it actually came up heads!

228
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,916
[Mugen] Say what?

229
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,291
[Jin] You're kidding me.

230
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,791
[Fuu] That's all.

231
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,791
The whole thing was a trick.

232
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,666
Why'd we even
make this trip, you remember?

233
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,208
Later guys, see ya round.

234
00:20:55,291 --> 00:21:00,250
