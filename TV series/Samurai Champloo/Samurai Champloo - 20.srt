163
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,958
Well...

164
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,500
Kinda.

165
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,916
[Mugen]
Man, I'm tellin' ya.

166
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,541
I've never met a chick
as guarded as that one is.

167
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,583
[Jin] Hmm?

168
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,750
I'm likin' this babe
even more now.

169
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,708
Did you see him?

170
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,416
Did I see what?

171
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,041
Huh? What do you want?

172
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,416
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,375
What was that?

174
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,541
[Fuu] And so...

175
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,708
...that's why I'm sure that he
has to be somewhere in Nagasaki.

176
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,416
Yep. I'm gonna find the samurai
who smells of sunflowers.

177
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,791
Who is this man?

178
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,916
[Fuu] My father.

179
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,958
I haven't seen him
in a really long time.

180
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,958
Now I barely even remember
what he looks like.

181
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,458
But when I find him...

182
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,541
I'm gonna knock him senseless.

183
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,916
[Sara] Oh.

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,041
And you, Sara?

185
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,416
Huh?

186
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,875
Do you have a girl?

187
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,416
[Sara] 
No, it's a boy.

188
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,375
A son, huh?

189
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,833
[Sara]
I know what you're thinking.

190
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,208
However, there's
nothing that I can do.

191
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,541
Just like I'm not able
to make my eyes see again.

192
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,583
Have you thought that maybe

193
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,916
you'd be better off if you
didn't reach Nagasaki?

194
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,291
No, why?

195
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,833
When your journey
finally takes you there...

196
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,833
it'll be all over.

197
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,083
That's kinda scary. It's as if

198
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,833
you're looking straight
into my heart right now.

199
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,208
That's what happens.

200
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,875
When you lose one
of your senses,

201
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,041
you find that other senses
become infinitely stronger.

202
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:58,125
Like smells, and the way
air feels against your skin.

203
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,500
Or the aura of
things around you.

204
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,750
The aura of your little friend
in your kimono, for example.

205
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,458
[Momo squeaks]

206
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,833
[Fuu]
That's amazing!

207
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,791
However, I can't sense
what people are feeling.

208
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,083
Which is the one you
don't want to leave.

209
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,416
Huh? What do you mean?

210
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,875
It's not what you're thinking.

211
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,041
Nothing's happened.
We're nothing more than friends.

212
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,541
I don't know why, but sometimes

213
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:37,833
I find myself wishing this
journey could go on forever.

214
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:42,375
And at the same time, I know
that that can never happen.

215
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,916
I see.

216
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,916
[Fuu]
What about you, Sara?

217
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,375
Your journey...
will it ever end?

218
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,166
[Sara]
Not until I die I suppose.

219
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,375
These are the cards
that I've been dealt.

220
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,541
This is my fate.

221
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,250
[clattering]

222
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,333
[Fuu]
I wonder if we can reunite them.

223
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,000
[Jin] Everyone has
troubles to overcome.

224
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,833
It's best not to meddle
in other people's affairs.

225
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,375
[Fuu]
But Jin, that's her family.

226
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,291
Families are always better off
being together, no matter what.

227
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,291
[Pinwheel Seller]
Here we go now! Here we go!

228
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,916
Here we go now! Here we go!

229
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,666
Are you listening?

230
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,708
[Fuu]
What did you pray for?

231
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,708
[Sara] Huh?

232
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,708
[Fuu]
At the shrine back there.

233
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,125
Was it for your son?

234
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:39,041
Actually, I have a favor
to ask you regarding that.

235
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:45,083
[chattering and drumming sounds]

236
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,666
[Jin]
So, you wish to see your son.

237
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,083
You kiddin'?

238
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,708
But I haven't had a chance
to make a move on you yet.

239
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,833
Would you please pick
something out for me?

240
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,291
Something a boy would like.

241
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,958
[Mugen] I don't know.

242
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,500
It's not really my thing.

243
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,750
[Kids laugh]

244
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,166
Yo, brat!

245
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,791
If you could have anything
here, what would you want?

246
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, your sword I guess.

247
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,250
Hey, you wanna live, kid?

248
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,750
A-Ahhhh!

249
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,458
Hey, why don't you tell
us what we should get?

250
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,875
Okay.

251
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,750
[Sara] I'd like one of
them to come with me.

252
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,333
[Fuu] Huh?

253
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,666
[Sara] Either Mugen or Jin.

254
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,250
I don't care.

255
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,083
Hey.

256
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,583
[Sara] I wonder if
he's going to like this.

257
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,125
[Mugen]
Beats me.

258
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,041
It's been a long time since
I can remember what it's like

259
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,500
to even have any
parents, you know?

260
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,666
'Fraid I can't help you there.

261
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,958
We have a lot in common.

262
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,583
The two of us.

263
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,750
The words happiness and joy

264
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,416
have never had any
meaning for me.

265
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,291
However, at the moment
that my son was born,

266
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:19,583
I began to have the same dreams
that any mother would have.

267
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,541
What's wrong?

268
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,416
[Fuu sobs]

269
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,916
I'm alright. Sorry.

270
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,875
I'm sorry...

271
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,291
Sara?

272
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,291
[Pinwheel Seller]
You understand, don't you?

273
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,333
Even if you wanted a different
life, it isn't possible.

274
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,916
Make sure you don't forget that.

275
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,000
Aw man...

276
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:10,166
After today all this
chow'll be gone.

277
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,791
Please choose to either
to eat or to speak.

278
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,750
[Mugen]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

279
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,333
Listen up.

280
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,708
Huh?

281
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:27,541
Jin, I want you to be
the one to go with her.

282
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,833
Take Sara to her son.

283
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:30,916
Say what?

284
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,458
Why him and not me?

285
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,625
Because it's not safe
for Sara to travel alone

286
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,833
with a guy like you.

287
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,625
Oh, and she'll be
safe with this bozo?

288
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,041
[Fuu]
Jin will act like a gentleman.

289
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,708
Sara's told me that she would
like to be with her child,

290
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,500
but it sounds like
there's a lot of obstacles

291
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,000
standing in her way.

292
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,416
That's why... I'd like
you to try and help her.

293
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,083
[Jin]
Very well.

294
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:12,125
[Sara] Thank you, for
everything you've done for me.

295
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,916
So then, let's
hope we meet again.

296
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,541
Well, take care.

297
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,541
Take care now.

298
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,625
Bastard, he didn't
even put up a fight.

299
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,125
[Fuu]
I can't believe it.

300
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,458
Huh?

301
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,500
[Fuu] We've come all
this way together.

302
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,625
How could he just turn
around and leave like that?

303
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,166
[Mugen] Huh?

304
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,875
I really thought for sure
that Jin was gonna say no.

305
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,625
But he didn't.

306
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,291
No shit.
I wouldn'ta said no either.

307
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,916
You dumb broad.
What a giant pain in my ass.

308
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,541
Will you shut
the hell up already?

309
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,416
[Fuu] How could you do it
after all we've been through?

310
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,416
Who was it that hired you?

311
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,666
Someone that you and your
friends are no match for.

312
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,041
To be honest with you,
I'd rather not do this.

313
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,083
But this is how it must be.

314
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,125
Well then.

315
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,291
It seems that I don't need
to hold back with you.

316
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,666
[Sara] You definitely
have the talent

317
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,958
to have killed Enshiro Mariya.

318
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,125
[Jin] What?

319
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,125
[Jin]
What's going on?

320
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,916
Is she really blind?

321
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,166
