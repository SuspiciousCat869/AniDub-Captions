00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,416
Almost every gambler in town's
been swindled by those goons.

159
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,666
[Kawara Gang 2]
We could lose everything to

160
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,000

Even our women!

161
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,250
[Kawara Gang 1] 
At this rate it won't be long

162
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,958
before they gain control
of our entire territory.

[Rikiei] The weak
get eaten by the strong.

I've risen to where I am now by

You are an interesting guy.

How'd you like
to join forces with me?

Huh?

If we combine my expertise
and money with your courage

and raw power, no one could
stop us. So how 'bout it?

Wanna take over
the country with me?

181

That game with the dice
was rigged, wasn't it?

What's that?!

You're even phonier
than your dice.

185
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,625
[Shop Owner] And that's the way
it stands. At least for now.

186
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,458
I figure it's got
nothing to do with me,

regardless of how it turns out.

I have no money.

Well, if you're looking for
a way to earn some quick cash,

190
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,583
the Nagatomi Gang's always
looking for bodyguards.

191
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,541
Seems like they
never have enough.

192

Speak of the devil.
They're here.

193
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,125
That's the Nagatomi Gang
right now.

194
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,750
[Shop Owner] Good afternoon.

195
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,708
[Sosuke] Give me that IOU.
Hand it over!

196
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,708
[Nagatomi 3] Well, well,
what do we have here?

197
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,041
Why, it's little Kawara Jr.

198
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,708
You've got an IOU
from Osuzu's father.

Now hand it over!

[Heitaro] Ishimatsu.

Hmm?

316
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,875
Mr. Heitaro, you used to be
my boss, but not anymore.

317
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,166
Address me respectfully
or not at all.

318
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,041

What's going on?

323
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,041
You're going to work until
you've earned that hundred ryo.

324
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,583
[Fuu] Wait a minute. Do you
mean to tell me that this is a--

325
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,500
A brothel, of course.
What did you think it was?

326
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,666
You're kidding me.

327
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,958
[Sosuke] Dad, listen to this.

328
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,791
[Heitaro] Is this the bodyguard
I've been hearing about?

329
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,791
Huh?

330
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,875
[Heitaro] Where's the IOU?

331
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,458
You little fool.

332
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:21,375
Osuzu's going to be forced
to work in a brothel.

333
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,541
She was taken there
a few minutes ago.

334
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,875
No way.

335
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,166
[Heitaro] You must have known
what would happen.

336
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,833
An eye for an eye.
That's the way the Nagatomis

337
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,833
handle everything.
Which is why, for all our sakes,

338
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,000
I've chosen not to
confront them.

339
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,458
Boss, we can't stand it anymore.

340
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,958
Let's raid their headquarters.

341
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,208
That's exactly
what they want us to do.

342
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,666
Anger breeds more anger,
destroying those around it.

343
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,375
And once it's begun,
it's a never-ending cycle.

344
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,166
And that is why
I'm afraid I must ask your guest

345
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,750
to leave now. The Kawara Gang
has no need for a bodyguard.

346
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,458
They're walking all over us.
Doesn't it bother you?

347
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,625
And what about Osuzu?
You can't just leave her there.

348
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,833
You're always saying things like
"anger breeds more anger,"

349
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,375
or "don't spill blood
unless it's necessary."

350
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,666
Well that might have worked
when there was peace, Dad,

351
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,250
but not now. Not anymore.
Those days are over!

352
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,791
Let's go.

353
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,625
If the Kawaras won't hire you
as a bodyguard, then I will.

354
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,000
I forbid it.

355
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,750
[Sosuke] I'm going after
all those Nagatomi bastards!

356
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,458
[Heitaro] I will not allow it.

357
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,250
Wait, Sosuke!

358
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,833
Hey, there. You're
new here too, aren't you?

359
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,125
Yes. How did you know?

360
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,541
I can see how sad you are,
and that's how I feel too.

361
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,250
Oh, come on now. Cheer up.

362
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,875
We'll help each other
and hope for the best.

363
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:46,666
Hope's a wonderful thing,
but I've none left.

364
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,291
I'll be helping my father pay
his debts by working here,

365
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,750

[men talking, women laughing]

367
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,541
[Sosuke] Damn, their security's
really tight.

368
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,125
Both our faces are known.

369
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,250
Getting in there can
be quite difficult indeed.

370
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,875
I got it.

371
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,875
You ask me, now's
not the time to be

372
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,708
chasing cathouse skirts around.

373
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,125
[Rikiei] What's your rush?

374
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,583
Rest assured the Kawaras'
bodyguard will be here.

375
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,083
That's why I baited
the hook so carefully.

376
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,166
Why go to all this
trouble for one guy?

377
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,041
It'd be quicker to just storm
the place and trash them all.

378
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,375
That's how we'd do it
back in the old days.

379
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:38,416
Now we remove the enemy's claws
and start him working for us.

380
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,833
Think about it.

381
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,541
If we start a war with
these guys, the people in town,

382
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,083
our customers, might be too
scared to do business with us.

383
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,250
And if the government
notices, they could make

384
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,500
a whole lot of trouble for us.
So when I make my move against

385
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:55,791
the Kawaras, I'll do it legally,
not by fighting in the streets.

386
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,500
I don't like waiting around.

387

Then don't just sit there.
