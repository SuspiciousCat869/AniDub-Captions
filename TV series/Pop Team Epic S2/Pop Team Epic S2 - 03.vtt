[POPUKO]
Kweh, kweh, kweh-kweh.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.690
Kweh, kweh, kweh. Kweh,
kweh-kweh, kweh!

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.070
Kweh, kweh, kweh?!

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.320
Kweh-kweh, pi pi pi kweh!

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.070
[PIPIMI]
Kweh, kweh.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.110
[POPUKO]
Kweh-kweh, pi, pi, pi!

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:04.510
Man, I'm exhausted.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.140
Like holy shit. They just
let us say whatever.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.640
Like, how the hell did
this even happen?

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.020
Jarrod Greene, you were
insane. For real.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.480
[BOTH laughing]

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.140
[PIPIMI]
Aargh! My head!

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.770
Oh, he's broken! Jarrod Greene!
Jarrod Greene is broken!

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.940
He's broken! Nooo! What's wrong?

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.990
I-I never thought I'd
be going through

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.860
all this on <i>Pop Team Epic</i> .

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.530
Crunchyroll is just--
Uh, they're just like...

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.580
The only place that
hires you? Yeah, I know.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.700
I don't even know, man.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.790
So you're probably
gonna go record

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.620
another show right
after this, right?

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.040
Uh, for Crunchyroll?

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.340
Is... Does it have anything
to do with pirates?

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.920
I believe in you.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.090
Fuck, man. Wait, what the fuck?

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.670
[POPUKO]
Sh-Should we not say fuck?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.630
[POPUKO laughs]

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.970
[PIPIMI]
And we're outta time.
