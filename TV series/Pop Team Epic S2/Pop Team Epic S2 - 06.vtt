Say, what's something
you'd want to do

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.500
if you had a giant lump
of brown sugar?

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.300
I'm waiting.

I'm waiting! I'm waiting...!

Yo, great job today, David.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.220
You, too, Gabe! Good job.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.480
David really wanted to
tell you all something.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.310
We're not sure what it is
or if it's worth hearing,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.900
but he's got 35
seconds to say it.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.230
Thirty-five seconds? Really?

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.690
Do you know how
far I had to drive

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.270
so I could be here
to record today?

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.410
Hey, hey, where are you going?
Don't abandon me in the booth.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.620
All right, well,
this is happening.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.990
Hi, everyone.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.610
As I said, I'm David, and if
you haven't heard of me,

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.080
well, that's entirely
your fault.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.700
For real, anime
is super huge now,

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.290
and so you should be
doing your homework.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.410
<i>Pop Team Epic</i> is, like,
a hit show or something.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.460
So, yeah, look us up,
or whatever.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.040
I mean, I guess
I can forgive you

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:44.510
if you didn't know before hand,
but now you've got no excuse!
