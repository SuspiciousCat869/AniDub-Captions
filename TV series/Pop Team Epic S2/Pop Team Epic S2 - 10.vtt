National Nature Reserve.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.170
Due to civil war and poaching,
the populations of apex animals

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.550
such as lions and elephants
have declined in recent years.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.300
This has caused a boom in the
populations of prey species

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.720
on the savanna.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.050

It's created all sorts of
problems for the region.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.480
The herbivores here have
grown up without the fear

of their natural predators,
so they just do what they want.

With nothing to stop them,
they'll cause harm.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.240

to the local ecosystem,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.320

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.300
Well, I knew that you
knew that I'd say that.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.680
How 'bout that?

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.230
Oh, yeah?

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.770
Well, I knew that you knew that
I knew that you'd say that.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.230

--I--
--I--

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.700
I knew that you--! Oh, biscuits.
I fwubbed my wine!

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.370
Well, I knew you'd say that.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.160

Piece of cake.

Heh. And stay down.

[POPUKO] Time for me
to unleash my finisher.

[POPUKO cackles]

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.760
Hello, everyone!

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.970
Thank you very much
for purchasing

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.890

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.770
Okay, why is everyone thanking
people for "buying" season 2?

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.810
It's on the app!
Just stream it, you doofs!

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:25.970
[PIPIMI]
Katelyn, don't say that.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.390
Am I wrong though?

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.440
Think of all the stuff you could
get by not buying a DVD.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.400
Yeah, but we want them
to buy the DVD!

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.230
Instead, you could get
ringside seats

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.240
to a pro-wrestling match
and get blood sprayed on you

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.780
while two titans
wail on each other!

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.820
Why would anyone
wanna do that? Gross!

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.620
Get yourself a musclehead
boyfriend and bring him along.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.580
I'm not doing that.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.080
Your loss. New topic!

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.540
Do you have any crazy
plans for the money

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.830
you're making from this session?

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.300
I'm saving up for
an electric scooter.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.130
And not a copy of
<i>Pop Team Epic</i> ?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.710
Oh, God, no! I'm not a doofus.
I'll just stream it on the app.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.260
See, that's funny
because I was thinking

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.510
of getting one for myself.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.550
[POPUKO, PIPIMI]

How much do you use?

Whoa! They let you shake hands
with the otters here?

That's so cool! Time to
make a new otter friend!

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.180
[OTTER A]
Die, human!

the question yet.

What is Australia?

to do an emergency landing?

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.550
[PIPIMI] You mean like
that one arcade game?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.130
I can't remember the name of it.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.500
But it starts off with you crash
landing in the jungle. That one?

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and then the whole game

Hey, that's the theme!

remember that much.

All right, players,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.740
your first question
for this round is,

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.740
What was something one
of the transported animals

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.990
said on the flight?

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.360
Yes, Cthuo. You were the
quickest on the buzzer!

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.700
"You know what I'd
kill for? A latte!"

Darn! That sound means that we
are out of time for this round.

attention back to the footage

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.130
so we can move on.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.430
they're going to fall in
love before the end?

safari park sucks.

I'm looking at you, Popuko!

I think I speak for everyone
when I say humans are selfish.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.160
They say they're working
to fix the environment,

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.290
but they're the hypocrites

who wrecked it all
in the first place.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.170
Humans are a blight
on this world.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.250
Our only way forward
is to wipe them out.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.090
That's all I have
to say, thank you!

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.220
Correct!

come-from-behind victory!

be nice to visit the park.

Oh. no. I knew I should've
checked my weather app today.

If that meteor hits the Earth,

into a new Ice Age!

Those Picolino bollards were
more than just decoration.

What's up?

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.310
[POPUKO]
Hey, great job today.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.640
You, too. It's been a good while
since we've worked together.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.430
Didn't we do a con together
recently or something?

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.860
[PIPIMI] Oh, yeah, That's right.
That completely slipped my mind.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.780
Yeah, remember how you almost
got yourself in big trouble?

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:16.810
Um, no?

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.530
Yeah, we were
gettin' interviewed

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:18.950
about that show we're on

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.520
and, uh, someone asked you
a really spoilery question

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:21.740
and I had to cover your mouth

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.280
to keep you from givin'
too much away.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.700
You were, like, seconds away
from revealing the big twist.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.660
That the butler did it?

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.910
No, that's the other show.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.910
Are you talking about
the one with the ghost?

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.240
We've done so many
shows together,

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.040
--it's hard to keep track.
--The ghost and the kid.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.620
I remember now.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.630
Yeah, you did save me from doing
a stupid during that interview.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.090
Good thing we both got invited

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.460
or else things would have
turned out very differently.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.710
[POPUKO]
Happy to help, man.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.620
Hey, didn't you get with
a new agency recently?

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.170
[POPUKO]
I did, yeah.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.760
It's a boutique agency that
specializes in animal talent.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.670
And, uhh, yeah...
