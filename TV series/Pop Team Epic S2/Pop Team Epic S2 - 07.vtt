00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.070
[ITAKURA]
I used to get yelled at a lot

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.690
for saying I wanted to be
a paladin when I grew up.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.910
But it's a fine job,
protecting the citizens.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.120
[ADACHI]
Hellshake Yano.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.530
The musician who wrote himself

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.120
into the stuff of myth and
legend at the Big Budokan.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.120
Alas, with his musical
career crushed

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.790
in the wake of a
mysterious disaster,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.830
and his major record
label contract lost,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.250
Yano faded into obscurity,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.630
with nary a blip on
the public's radar.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.220
So our crack investigative team
took it upon themselves

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.220
to track down Yano for an
up-close-and-personal interview.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.760
Ta-da!

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.890
An emotional
documentary special:

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.390
"Rising Hell,
The Hellshake Arrow."

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.190
[ADACHI]
We begin somewhere in Tokyo,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.020
where our team found
the legendary Yano

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.150
working in a Ramen shop.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.690
Make sure you shake all the
water out of those noodles.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.990
Yessir!

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.950
Shake-a-shake-a-shake!
Shake-a-shake-a-shake...!

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.330
You see, Yano had gone
from shaking crowds

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.830
to shaking noodles.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.290
Until one day, he had
an unexpected visitor.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.080
So this is where you ran off to.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.540
Manager! How did you
know I was here?

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.630
[ADACHI] Huh. A true manager
never reveals his secrets.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.880
But enough about me!

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.890
I've got something
that'll change everything!

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.930
There's a contest for only
the industry's best musicians.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.930
The Musicione Grand Prix!

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.770
If you win this,
you'll be back on top

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.270
in two Hellshakes of your Yano!

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.940
Not interested.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.560
Excuse me?

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.060
I made a choice.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.070
I will never go back to music.
Never again. Never, ever.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.530
[ADACHI]
Oh, Yano. You're a damned fool.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.030
It seemed like that was it.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.500
Till the day of the competition

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.540
when Yano apparently
changed his mind.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.750
[ITAKURA] I'm definitely gonna
win this thing! Hell yeah!

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.760
[ADACHI]
Rising Hell.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.350
[ADACHI] And now,
a word from our sponsor,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.350
Exciting Sound Shop Apollon.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.940
Exciting!

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.900
Sound Shop!

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.030
[BOTH]
Apollon! Celebrating 50 years.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.450
Exciting!

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.370

Apollon!

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.870
An only slightly
unique music shop.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.620
Exciting!

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.750
Sound Shop!

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.510

Apollon! In Niigata.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.350
[ADACHI]
Rising Hell.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.690
Musicione Grand Prix!

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.480
Each contestant
will have four minutes

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.110
to wow the judges
with their music.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.310
The judges will then repeatedly

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.690
tap their buttons
to award points,

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.110
and the contestant with
the highest score wins!

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.990
All right, it's time for
our first contestant

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.490
to strut his stuff!

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.080
Please welcome to the stage
No-Subject Prince!

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.410
[ADACHI grunting]

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.380
[ADACHI] Tis I, the No-Subject
Prince. No subjects from me.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.630
True to his name,

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.250
he's removed the subject
from his last sentence.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.130
Will this strategy get
him the high score?

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.300
He's running out of time!

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.130
--[ADACHI] Bow down.
--[ITAKURA] Brilliant!

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.550
[ADACHI]
Magnificent lack of subject

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.890
with the "understood you"!

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.720
No-Subject Prince
gets a perfect score!

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.060
Many thanks.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.190
[ITAKURA] One phrase got
him a perfect score?

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.900
That guy's good.
But not good enough!

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.650
[ADACHI] Our next contestant
is Hellshake Yano!

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.120
Walk, walk, walk, walk. Pose!

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.200
Just then, Yano realized
a terrifying truth.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.950
<i>Donde esta</i> do-re-mi?

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.830
I remember a deer.
A female deer!

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.960
Is it here? Here? Here?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.420
Damn! Come on!

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.090
Do the thing. You can do it.
You did it before...!

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.970
Yano, what's are you doing?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.380
Oh, no.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.890
Don't tell me you've forgotten
how to play the guitar.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.480
We've got no choice
but to throw in the towel!

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.020
Rustle, rustle, rustle, rustle.
Flappy, flappy, flappy, flap.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.230
And land!

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.690
This is an upset, folks!

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.940
It seems Yano's second
has thrown in the towel.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.530
Does this mean Yano is going
to forfeit the competition?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.990
[ITAKURA]
Hell no! I can do this.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.240
Gotta trust my instincts.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.740
I've gotta let my
fingers do the work.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.580
Time to rock and roll!

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.410
Shake-a-shake-a-shake!
Shake-a-shake-a-shake!

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.870
Hey! You're ramen order's ready!
Wait, no! I'm not making ramen!

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.500
I'm making music!

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.340
I must purge myself
of my worldly attachments.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.920
[ITAKURA yells]

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.630
[ITAKURA] And let the Hell flow
into my heart once again!

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.560
Hey, MC! New guitar
on the double!

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.310
[ADACHI]
Rolly, rolly, rolly...

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.560
That's the legendary
108-stringed guitar!

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.060
The Purifying Guitar!

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.980
I can purify myself of my
worldly attachments. Hell yeah!

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.150
[ADACHI]
Stop!

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.320
No one can survive
playing on 108 strings!

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.530
Then I'll be the
first! Hey, hey!

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.820
[ADACHI]
Don't be a fool!

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.990
Too late, dude!

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.870
[ITAKURA yells]

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.960

[ADACHI]
Ka-ching.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.960
[BOTH grunt]

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.710
Oh, snap! My pick's
been shattered!

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.840
My dreams of victory.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.010
My hubris shattered
those as well!

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.180
Ugh... Sweet dreams.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.640
[ADACHI]
Flap, flap...

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.230
[ITAKURA] A bird? Are you
even real, my tender friend?

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.520
Flappy, flappy, flappy... Land.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.150
Wait! Could it be you have
some great wisdom to share?

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.520
I'm here to tell you that
you must travel west

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.690
to the Guitarist Forest.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.530
The what?

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.570
From there you will, uhh...

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.320
Will what? Tell me!
Wait, don't go!

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.580
You've got 30 seconds on the
clock. You better hurry!

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.460
Crap! I don't have
time to mess around!

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.710
And so he ran.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.460
Equipped with naught but
a tiny glimmer of hope,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.250
he blazed on, headlong,
down that perilous path.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.510
[ITAKURA]
Twenty-eight Seconds left!

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.220
Twenty-six seconds left!

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.390
Twenty-four seconds left!

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.390
And then,
deep within the forest,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.020
his long journey came
to an end at last!

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.190
[ITAKURA]
Hey! I found something!

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.310

indestructible pick of legend!

The Master Pick!

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.360
Please, Master Pick.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.030
Lend me a bit of your
transcendent strength!

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.830
Come on, Yano, you got this!

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.660
Wait, somethin's wrong.
It won't budge.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.460
I've never been pushed
this far before.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.330
This is gonna take
everything I have.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.750
I'll even sacrifice my health
to free the Master Pick.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.090
All I've got to do is shake!

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.850
[ITAKURA grunting]

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.680
Wow, amazing!

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.890
He's shaking his own health and
converting it into raw power!

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.890
Is there nothing
you cannot shake?

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.900
Hellshake Yano!

the Master Pick was free!

Let's fly!

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.790
The overwhelming energy from the
Master Pick flowed into Yano,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.130
fusing them together,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.090
and flying them back to
the Musicione Grand Prix!

What's this?

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.920
A big, giant pick just
fell down from the sky!

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.640
I have returned.
And it's not over yet.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.060

the Hellshake Arrow!

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.890
[STAFF A] How long did it take
you to make this episode?

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.520
[ITAKURA]
Psh, I have no idea.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.770
The two actors in the segment,

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.190
Shunuske Itakura and
Tohru Adachi, did it.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.400
I'm just a dub VA. Right?

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.900
Wai, getting a note saying
that Adachi did everything

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.320
and Itakura just came in
for the acting bits.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.620
Huh, that's interesting.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.200
Wonder what they're
saying in the Japanese.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.910
Hey, Ian, you have any idea
what they might be saying?

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.660
[ADACHI]
If I were to hazard a guess,

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.330
it's probably how long it took
to make the segment or--

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.280
[ADACHI]
I used to get yelled at a lot

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.990
for saying I wanted to be
a paladin when I grew up.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.620
But it's a fine job,
protecting the citizens.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.950
[ITAKURA]
Hellshake Yano.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.370
The musician who wrote himself

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.330
into the stuff of myth and
legend at the Big Budokan.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.500
Alas, with his musical
career crushed

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.380
in the wake of
a mysterious disaster,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.420
and his major record
label contract lost,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.210
Yano faded into obscurity,

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.300
with nary a blip on
the public's radar.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.050
So our crack investigative
team took it upon themselves

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.390
to track down Yano for an
up-close-and-personal interview.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.760
Dun-dun!

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.850
An emotional
documentary special:

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.270
"Rising Hell,
The Hellshake Arrow."

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.360
[ITAKURA]
We begin somewhere in Tokyo,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.360
where our team found
the legendary Yano

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.860
working in a Ramen shop.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.200
Make sure you shake all the
water out of those noodles.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.950
Yessir!

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.780
Shake-a-shake-a-shake!
Shake-a-shake-a-shake...!

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.540
You see, Yano had gone
from shaking crowds

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.040
to shaking noodles.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.420
Until one day he had
an unexpected visitor.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.040
So this is where
you ran off to.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.670
Manager! How did you
know I was here?

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.670
[ITAKURA] Huh! A true manager
never reveals his secrets.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.970
But enough about me!

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.470
I've got somethin' that'll
change everything!

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.810
There's a contest for only
the industry's best musicians.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.020
The Musicione Grand Prix!

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.560
If you win this,
you'll be back on top

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.940
in two Hellshakes of your Yano!

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.230
Not interested.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.480
Excuse me?

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.940
I made a choice.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:07.820
I'll never go back to music.
Never again. Never, ever.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.450
[ITAKURA]
Oh, Yano. You're a damned fool.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.290
It seemed like that was it.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.210
Until the day of the competition

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.500
when Yano apparently
changed his mind.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.960
[ADACHI] I'm definitely gonna
win this thing! Hell yeah!

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:27.590
[ITAKURA]
Rising Hell.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.260
[ITAKURA] And now,
a word from our sponsor,

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.810
Exciting Sound Shop Apollon.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.770
Exciting!

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.940
Sound Shop!

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:46.070
[BOTH]
Apollon! Celebrating 50 years.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.820
Exciting!

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.080
Sound Shop!

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.120
[BOTH]
Apollon!

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.790
An only slightly
unique music shop.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.580
Exciting!

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.710
Sound Shop!

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:05.670
[BOTH]
Apollon! Located in Niigata.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.480
[ITAKURA]
Rising Hell.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.390
Musicione Grand Prix!

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.940
Each contestant will
have four minutes

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.860
to wow the judges
with their music.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.110
The judges will then repeatedly

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.900
tap their buttons
to award points,

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.110
and the contestant with
the highest score wins!

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.610
All right, it's time for
our first contestant

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.740
to strut his stuff!

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.120
All right!

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:38.160
Please welcome to the stage
No-Subject Prince!

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.460
[ITAKURA] Tis I, the No-Subject
Prince. No subjects from me.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.710
True to his name,

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.460
he's removed the subject
from his last sentence.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.510
Will this strategy get
him the high score?

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.760
He's running out of time!

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.680
Bow down.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.800
[CONTESTANTS]
Brilliant!

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.850
[ITAKURA]
Magnificent lack of subject

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.430
with the "understood you"!

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.310
No-Subject Prince
gets a perfect score!

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.100
Many thanks.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.230
One phrase got him
a perfect score?

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:06.150
That guy's good.
But not good enough!

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.400
Our next contestant
is Hellshake Yano!

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.120
[ITAKURA grunting]

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.330
St-St-St-St-Stop.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.660
It was at that moment

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.580
when Hellshake Yano learned
a terrifying truth.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.870
[ADACHI]
<i>Donde esta el</i> do-re-mi?

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.590
I remember a deer.
A female deer!

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.380
Is it here? Here? Here?

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.800
Damn! Come on! Do the thing!

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.050
Yano, what're ya doin'?

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.470
Oh, no.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.260
Don't tell me you've forgotten
how to play the guitar.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.930
We've got no choice
but to throw in the towel!

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.560
[ITAKURA grunting]

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.440
This is an upset, folks!

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.230
It seems Yano's second
has thrown in the towel.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.150
Does this mean Yano is going
to forfeit the competition?

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.280
[ADACHI]
Hell no! I can do this.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.330
Gotta trust my instincts.
Let my fingers do the work.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.290
Time to rock and roll!

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.160
Shake-a-shake-a-shake!
Shake-a-shake-a-shake!

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.540
Hey! Your ramen order's ready!
Wait, no! I'm not making ramen!

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.630
I'm making music!

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.670
I must purge myself of
my worldly attachments.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.300
Ah!

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.010
And let the Hell flow into
my heart once again!

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.390
Hey, MC! New guitar
on the double!

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.770
[ITAKURA]
Roll, roll, roll, roll...

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.850
That's the legendary
108-stringed guitar!

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.360
The Purifying Guitar!

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.070
I can use it to purify myself
of my worldly attachments.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.240
[ITAKURA]
No one can survive 108 strings!

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.030
Then I'll be the
first! Hey, hey!

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.070
[ITAKURA]
Don't be a fool!

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:36.910
[ADACHI]
Too late!

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:42.910
[ADACHI yelling]

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.750
[ADACHI]
Hellshake!

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.420
[ADACHI]
Shatter.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.130
Oh, snap! My pick's
been shattered!

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.880
My dreams of victory.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.680
Has my hubris shattered
those as well?

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.310
Oh. Sweet dreams.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:03.680
[ITAKURA]
Flap, flap...

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.860
[ADACHI] A bird? Are you
even real, my tender friend?

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.310
[ITAKURA] Flappy, flappy,
flappy, flappy, flappy, land!

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.070
Wait! Could it be you have
some great wisdom to share?

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.280
[ITAKURA] I'm here to tell you
that you must travel west

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.530
to the Guitarist Forest.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:15.530
[ADACHI]
The what?

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.660
[ITAKURA]
From there you will--

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.160
[ADACHI]
What's there? Tell me!

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.160
[ITAKURA]
Hoo-hoooot!

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.240
[ADACHI]
Will what? Wait, don't go!

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.330
[ITAKURA] You've got 30
seconds on the clock.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:24.410
You better hurry!

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.620
Crap! I don't have time
to mess around!

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.250
And so he ran.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.710
Equipped with naught but
a tiny glimmer of hope,

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.430
he blazed on, headlong,
down that perilous path.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.140
Run, run run, run... Jump!
Twenty-eight seconds left!

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.600
Jump! Twenty-six seconds left!

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.180
Jump! Twenty-four seconds left!

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.350
And then, deep
within the forest,

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.690
his long journey came
to an end at last!

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.440
[ADACHI]
Hey! I found something!

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.610
Zoom...

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.700
Holy cow. It's the
indestructible pick of legend.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.990
The Master Pick!

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.500
Master Pick, lend me but
a bit of your strength!

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.660
So this is the legendary-- Uh!

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.710
Wait, it's not coming out!
It won't budge.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.710
[ADACHI yells]

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.380
[ADACHI] I've never been
pushed this far before.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.050
It's going to take
everything I have.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.800
I'll even sacrifice my health
to free the Master Pick.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:24.270
All I've got to do is shake!

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.520
[ADACHI grunting]

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.640
Amazing!

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:29.980
He's shaking his own health

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.110
and converting it
into raw power!

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:37.280
Is there nothing you cannot
shake, Hellshake Yano?!

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:44.040
[BOTH] Hellshake! Hellshake!
Hellshake! Hellshake!

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.250
And on that final pull,
the Master Pick was free!

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:53.670
[BOTH]
Rumble, rumble, rumble...

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.920
Let's fly!

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.760
The overwhelming energy
from the Master Pick

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.590
flowed into Yano,
fusing them together,

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.510
and flying them back to
the Musicione Grand Prix!

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.390
Crash!

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.600
What's this?

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.850
A big, giant pick just
fell down from the sky!

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.140
I have returned.
And it's not over yet.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.390
For I have become
the Hellshake Arrow!

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.810
Ten seconds remaining!
Will he make it in time?

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.860
[ADACHI yells]

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.120
[ADACHI]
Let's rock!

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.210
[ADACHI grunting]

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.460
[BOTH]
Hellshake!

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.260
[BOTH grunting]

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:48.060
He cut through all 108 strings!
The winner is Hellshake Yano!

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.770
[CROWD]
Hellshake! Hellshake!

00:21:51.850 --> 00:22:00.690
Hellshake! Hellshake! Hellshake!
Hellshake! Hellshake!

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.280
[BOTH]
Crash!

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.370
Hey, are you listening?

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:04.570
[ITAKURA]
Oh, sorry.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.330
I was just thinkin'
'bout Hellshake Yano.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.820
[YAMADERA]
Oh, man, I am wiped.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.400
Seriously, how many
roles did I just--?

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.450
Hey, wait, so isn't
the whole bit here

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.660
that it's the guys from AC-bu
playin' all the parts?

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.160
So what gives?

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.580
'Cause y'all made me do
all these roles by myself.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.790
You're treating me like some
kind of dancing circus monkey!

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.250
Dance, money, dance!

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.210
Heh. Nah, but for real, thanks.
