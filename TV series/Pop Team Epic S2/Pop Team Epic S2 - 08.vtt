How dare you!

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.630
You don't understand
this at all!

[CTHULHU B]
Thanks!

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.260
Huh?

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:03.760
[CTHULHU B]
Oh!

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.400
Goodness,
my shoulders are stiff.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.690
[POPUKO]
Grandma, I can--

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.480
Oh, dear, she bugged out.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.650
When I was your age,

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.410
you'd be hard-pressed
to go a day

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.950
without runnin' into these
sorts of problems.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.660
You young gamers don't know
how good you all have it.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.910
Now I'm gonna show you how
we fixed things old school.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.180
[POPUKO] Grandma,
I can rub your shoulders!

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.020
[POPUKO]
Uh...

Here you go, Pipimi!
A jack-in-the-box!

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.770
[POPUKO] Oh, no,
I gave away the surprise.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:55.480
[POPUKO chuckles]

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.940
[PIPIMI]
Hm?

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.620
[screaming]

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.080
[POPUKO laughing]

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.700
[PIPIMI]
Peekaboo.

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.260
Well, that's a wrap on that.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:10.890
You got any more sessions today?

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.640

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.310
Ah, that's that dance from
season one, right?

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.780
<i>Eisai haramasukoi.</i>

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.900
Yeah, I don't know why
but I love that dance.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.060
I remember getting
really excited

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.400
whenever it would
pop up in season one,

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.950
and now that I'm here
recording for the show,

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.740
it felt like the right
time to bust it out.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.570
Didn't I see you prating
it in the lobby?

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.160
Honestly, I only
just now realized

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.490
that's what you were doing.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.500
I was very confused
watching you at that moment.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.080
I'm kind of embarrassed
that it took me this long

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.800
to remember where
the dance was from.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.210
[POPUKO] Don't be.
Season one was years ago,

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.720
and this is a show
with a ton of gags.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.890
I mean, the last episode was
nothing but Hellshake Yano.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.310
Yeah, that was a cool
episode, though.
