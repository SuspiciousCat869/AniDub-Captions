That's where it all began!
The birth of the train battle.

I was afraid.

Scared to see another piece
of Showa era culture fall away.

I couldn't bear it, to see
such things irrationally,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.950
immorally, and
inconsiderately erased.

[POPUKO]
Yeah, I get it.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.240
So even though I lost,

I'm happy to see train
battlers like yourself.

carrying the torch.

the Showa era.

Yeah. Easy.

an enryusay oempay!

Have at it already!

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.970
Shut the fuck up, you.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.560
I said, shut the fuck up, you.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.650
Shut the fuck up, you.

My, that is so rude.

I must say that you lack
tact, and quality, too.

Pipimi.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.320
Hm? What?

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.120
Well, now I feel dumb.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.120
I just read that poem out
loud ever so proudly.

Do not cry, my dear.

too far, don't you think?

Wait, hold on, are there people
who actually bought this crap?

Well, you were probably better
off buying bleepity-bleep,

in my humble opinion.

Popuko, what's bleepity-bleep?

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.440
Bleepity-bleep is totally
more bleepity-bleep

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.480
and a better deal,
overall, IMHO.

of that bleepity-bleep?

Huh, weird.

Hey, Pipimi, question.

What are you going
to do with the money

you didn't spend on <i>PTE S2</i> ?

Right now? Invest in
an accumulating NISA.

Ah, accumulating
nii- <i>sans</i> , eh?

That's great. Wait,
you're not buying <i>PTE</i> ?
