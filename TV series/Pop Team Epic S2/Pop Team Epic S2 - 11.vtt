<i>Pop Team Epic.</i>

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.600
So that's when I told him,
"Hey, you're not my doctor!"

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.760
What's up?

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.230
There's a triple c
thick beast-girl MILF

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.520
and a twink robot with emo
bangs makin' out over there!

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.850
Don't do it, man! It's a trap!

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.320
Look me in my eyes.
Do I look like I care?

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.510
Oh, hey-o. Great to meet ya.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.720
I'm surprised that a
lil' TV station like yours

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.680
would make an offer to
super-popular comedians

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.260
like me and my partner.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.220
I expect our fee ended
up putting you guys

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.590
way over budget, amirite?

Huh?

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.230
Yo. How's it hanging?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.950
[POPUKO] Um. What's my partner
doing in my green room?

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.410
Oh, come on!
You have us sharing a room?

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.490
You know I was kidding
about that budget stuff.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.620
Comedians at our level deserve
to have separate rooms.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.000
After all these years,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.080
it's just plain awkward having
to share a room now.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.730
Say, does that paper
have winners

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.520
for today's horse race in it?

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.350
Nope.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.100
Oh, I see.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.400
Hey, remind me, when
were you in England?

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.650
I've never been.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.400
Oh. That's right.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.570
Who's the better actor,
Sabat or Sinclair?

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.360
The answer should be obvious.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.620
I guess you're right.

[KANCHI A] Why you gotta
bring up boners?

We don't have any--we're all

you've been in the biz.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.650
As a token of that respect,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.190
we brought you a bunch of
Osakan' grannies' panties!

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.740
--Hey-o!
--Moron!

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.610
You couldn't even erect

with those nasty things.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.780
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.530
They're really just bento boxes.

[POPUKO]
Hmm...

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.510
I'm understanding
these young comedians

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.470
less and less every day.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.230
[PIPIMI] If those aren't
Gyogyoen bento,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.150
then I don't want mine.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.470
Since when are you picky?

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.690
They're probably some
cheap train station bento

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.150
they got on their way here.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.480
Honestly, I'd appreciate it more

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.600
if they stuck to the bit
and got us panties.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.990
That's weird. I feel like
I've seen these bento boxes.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.070
But for the life of me,
I can't remember where.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.480
You know how every
casting director nowadays

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.520
wants ya to be cuter
in the auditions?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.020
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.360
Well then, what do you do
when they ask for that?

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.400

have that, can we?

I'm more than happy to share.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.890
[POPUKO] Whoa. Is that from
that one stall in Kansai?

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.970
I'm sorry about all this, Popu.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.980
I dragged you along into
this zany world with me.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.600
You shouldn't have to
live like a pauper

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.150
just so I can chase
some crazy dream.

What are you on about?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.730
I was poor way before I met you.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.860
I knew exactly what
I was signing up for.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.150
Don't sweat it. Our only focus
is coming up with jokes.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.410
We'll let the rest
sort itself out.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.410
You're right!

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.830
And one day we'll be big enough

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.290
to where they'll have to
give us our own green room!

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.160

[BOTH chuckling]

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.680
Still delicious. At least we
each had our own this time.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.220
[PIPIMI] The last time
I ate one of these,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.220
we were workin'
on our first set.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.690
[POPUKO] Hey! I thought you said
you weren't gonna eat yours.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.070
Yeah, well, I found myself
with a sudden hankering

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.610
for the good ol' days.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.980
I know. If it's the old
days you're hungry for,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.700
then let's go get
some beef soup.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.820
Remember how we used to go
out for soup all the time?

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.320
I would, but when I eat meat,
it aggravates my gout,

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.620
and my legs start to hurt.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.990
Then order it without the meat

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.750
and enjoy the tofu
and green onions.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.460
[PIPIMI] I didn't come
all the way to Osaka

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.290

Why don't we play "Look
That Way" with Like2d?

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.940
I'll be the one who picks
which way to look.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.240
And I'm perfectly fine being

Okay, get ready.

Nice try!

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.920
Thank you very much
for buying this copy

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.930
of <i>Pop Team Epic Season 2</i> !

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.430
Although you probably
would've been better off

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.680
if you'd bought concert tickets
for, like, a KPop band,

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.230
or maybe even an idol group!

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.770
No! Don't say stuff like that!

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.390
You know, there's an
idol group called Sphere

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.650
that's been together
for 13 years now.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:29.860
They're all in their 30s,

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.360
which means they get
called "veteran idols,"

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.690
like they're geriatric
or something,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.240
but they can still sing
84 songs in two days,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.650
or so the script says.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.530
Some of their older songs
reference school uniforms

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.000
and stuff like that,

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.830
which is pretty cringe since
they are all in their 30s.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.500
I mean, it's cringe
even for back then,

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.540
but it's especially cringe
looking back now.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.870
At least, that's what
the script is telling me.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.750
Huh? Not sure why this
part of the episode

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.670
turned into a Wikipedia
entry for Sphere,

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.960
but that's what's in the script
so that's what I'm gonna say!

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.800

Hey-o. Good to meet ya.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.960
I'm surprised that a lil'
TV station like yours

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.010
would make an offer to
super-popular comedians

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.550
like me and my partner.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.640

Do you have any idea how long
we've been in this business?

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.210
This is very unprofessional
to have comedians at our level

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.580
sharing a room.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.340

it's going to get

they were panties,

I dragged you along into
this zany world with me.

to live like a pauper

I was poor way before I met
you and I knew exactly

what I was getting into when
you asked to partner up.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.240
Don't sweat it. Our only focus
should be coming up with jokes.

We'll let the rest
sort itself out.

You're right!

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.410
And one day we'll be big enough
to where we can demand

I thought you said that you
weren't going to eat yours.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:28.780
That was the plan originally,
but I got nostalgic.

I know, if you're
feeling nostalgic,

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.410
then let's go get
some beef soup.

Remember how we used to go
out for soup all the time?

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.540
I would, but when I eat meat,
it aggravates my gout,

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.790
and my legs start to hurt.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.040
Then order it without meat.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.000
You can still enjoy the
tofu and green onions.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.000
[PIPIMI] Why the hell am I
goin' all the way to Osaka

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.540
just for tofu and green onions?

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.130
[POPUKO laughs]

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.880
[POPUKO, PIPIMI]
We're Pop Team Epic!

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.380
[POPUKO laughing]

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.760
You can't escape me!

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.090
I'm the tickle monster! Heh.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.850
[BOTH laughing]

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.270
[PIPIMI]
Got you! Got you! Got you!

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.270
Tickle! Tickle! Tickle!

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.070
[POPUKO gasps]

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.280
[PIPIMI]
You like that? You like that?

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.450
You having fun?
You look like you're having--

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.080
[PIPIMI grunting]

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.870
[gasps]

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.660
[PIPIMI]
Time for the special move!

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:32.090
Gosh. You know what
I wish I had right now?

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.130
A shiitake mushroom log.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.500
[SHIITAKE A]
Shiitake!

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.340
Did you hear me, Pipimi?

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.850
Huh? Is that...?
A shiitake mushroom log.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.600
Oh, Pipimi. You did hear me!

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.900
Popuko, hey! Check it out!
I'm in the sun!

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.360
[PIPIMI]
<i>Pop Team Epic.</i>

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.150
Hey, what's going on
with you, Pipimi?

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.440
You're being awfully
quiet. Hold up.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.490
Silly torpedo.
You're not Pipimi.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.240
Let's get you back home.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.040
[POSEIDON]
Greetings, sweet Popuko.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.040
It is I, Poseidon--

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.750
[POSEIDON screams]

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.080
[POPUKO]
<i>Pop Team Epic</i> !

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.590
[PIPIMI]
<i>Bob Epic Team</i> ?

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.840
Kablam! All right, listen up.
It's the prefectural police!

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.460
Ah! So bright!

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.260
What prefecture are you from?

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.480
Hey! I asked you what
prefecture, you punk!

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.230
You know, there's an
easier way to do this.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.020
I asked you which
prefecture, jackass!

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.480
It's Canada! I'm with the
Canada prefectural police!

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.240
[POPUKO, PIPIMI gasp]

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.860
[POPUKO, PIPIMI] We're very
sorry about all this!

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.990
[COP A]
Vroom! Vroom!

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.700
[POPUKO]
<i>Pop Team Epic</i> !

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.830
Ooh! It's a pro gamer!

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.660
'Sup, shorty? Get rekt!

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.250
OMG!

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.540
He's getting tidy just like the
pros do in Poppex Tournament!

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.170
Hey, girl. Let's go!

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.510
Oh, no way!

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.970
He's doing the taunt from
Unreal POPU Tournament!

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.140
I do that in Unreal
POPU Tournament.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.020
Yaas! OMG! You're
so cool! Slay, queen!

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.640
Yo, bae. Poggers!

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.570
Yeah!

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.740
[POPUKO]
I have a great idea.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.530
Let's play "Look That
Way" with Like2d!

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.530
I'll be the one who gets to pick
which way for you to look.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.030
I guess I'm all right with
just playin' defense.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.000
[POPUKO]
Okay, get ready.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.130
There! There! There!

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.170
[PIPIMI]
My eyes.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.250
We didn't have anything
else drawn up.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.040
I'm sorry, but you're
stuck like this.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.970
[PIPIMI]

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.890
Save me, Popuko!

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.180
Leave it to me!

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.930
I'll rescue you from that
garbage perspective

with the free transform tool!

[BOTH yelling]

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.660
I'm sorry. I've made it worse.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.450
Nice try.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.840
Thank you very much
for purchasing

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.140
<i>Pop Team Epic Season 2</i> !

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.640
Why are we shilling
out for this show

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.010
when we could be doing it for
one of those yakuza games?

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.190
Because we're in this show
and not a yakuza game.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.650
Yeah, but yakuza games are
so much cooler, you know?

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.150
Plus, they usually have
fun karaoke mini-games.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.230
Are you talking about
a specific franchise?

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.280
[POPUKO] No, just yakuza
games in general.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.740
[PIPIMI] Well, stop, we're
talking about <i>Pop Team</i> !

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.280
Fine, Mom!

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.870
This isn't really about the
show, but what are you gonna buy

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.370
with the money
from your session?

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.410
Oh, that. Probably
a steak dinner.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.000
Why not a copy of
<i>Pop Team Epic</i> ?

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.210
Because man cannot survive
on anime alone, obviously.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.460
[POPUKO]
Yeah, that's fair.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.080
I bet some fans wish
it were true though.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.630
And they're the ones
buying this show

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.090
instead of yakuza games.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.250
I'd figure they'd get both.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.800
Then why were you
going so hard on 'em?

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.960
[POPUKO]
'Cuz they're awesome!
