[PIPIMI]
Popuko!

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.210
Whoops, I should've caught
that with my face.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.130
It's all about new-money trains
in this day and age.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.960
I mean, just look at my form.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.390
So beautiful.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.890
Ten points is not enough.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.850
[PIPIMI] Are we talking about
old-school [beep] here?

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.440
Gonna puke.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.270
You are?!

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:10.400
It's passing.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.570
It is?!

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:15.450
I'm better.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.660
You are?!

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.450
I lied.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.490
You did?!

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.670
Hey, I really wanna
buy a hedgehog.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.830
What kind of look did you
want to go for today?

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.670
The usual tomboy bob, please.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.830
Okay!

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.090
Hey, wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.100
My bad. Guess I made an oopsie!

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.810
C'mon, man! Fix it!

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:40.970
Okay!

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.770
Hey, wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.020
Hey, Cactus- <i>kun</i>
is looking for hugs.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.200
Serial killer.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.200
Kenzan- <i>kun</i> , too!

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.160
This'll be a bloodbath.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.740
Just hug it out already!

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.530
What, are you scared?
Well? Go on. Hey.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.660
[PIPIMI]
Hey, get on with it!

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.030
Hey, you want hugs, don't you?

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.670
What's the matter? Huh?
Hey. C'mon, get on with it.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.630
You're holding a sign
that says "free hugs,"

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.050
but they're not free at all!

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.420
You're picking and choosing!

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.300
It's the truth!

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.010
The Earth's in big-time
grave danger.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.340
[PIPIMI]
The Earth's in danger?

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.020
I mean, the Earth is
<i>really</i> in danger here.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.430
Wait, I wasn't listening.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.180
Actually the Earth could
already be in grave danger.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.690
Oh, shit! No way! That sucks!

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.900
Whether you believe it or not

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.020
depends on if you really
believe it or not.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.320
[PIPIMI chuckles]

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.730
Then I have to say
that I don't.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.030
[CROWD]
Aww...

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.700
Okay, just go roll some
dice then or something.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.510

You stupid, ugly fuckwad!

[PIPIMI]
Popuko, I'm ready!

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.900
I got all nice and yummy.
Now, eat me up.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.530
[POPUKO]
I can't eat Pipimi!

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.860
I can't, I can't, I can't!

[POPUKO, PIPIMI]

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.590
[PIPIMI] The long-awaited,
brand-new segment...

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.550
[POPUKO]
...begins now.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.760
[POPUKO, PIPIMI]
<i>Pop Team Epic</i> B-Side.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.090
Popuoka!

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.390
[POPUKO]
Hm?

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.550
Pipihara.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.270
Apparently, this segment
has been canceled.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.190
[POPUKO]
Canceled.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.320
[POPUKO]
So that means...

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.340
Hey, Popuko,
I have a question for you.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.850
What is it, Pipimi?

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.890
You know how you get some
hair growing on your big toe?

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:09.890
It's just like there.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:11.220
[POPUKO]
Yeah.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.520
But why's it even there?
What's it even protecting?

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.140
[POPUKO] That question
could sway the fate

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:16.860
of the whole world.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.320
What?

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.200
Because that hair protects
you from being electrocuted

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.530
when you drop your smartphone
on your big toe.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.110
[PIPIMI chuckles]

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.950
[PIPIMI] Oh, so you're
saying that humanity,

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.250
even from a long time ago,

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.040
predicted the creation
of smartphones

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.330
and that they'd be dropping
them on their own feet?

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.760
<i>Then</i> grew that hair?

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.120
Whether you believe it or not...

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:43.090
[BOTH] ...depends on if you
really believe it or not!
