[NARRATOR A]
Since the Earth came to be,

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.970
time has continued to flow.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.470
Countless branching points
come from that flow,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.310
causing alternate
timelines to manifest.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.680
With his mission to
protect all smiles,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.980
one man traverses through
those alternate timelines:

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.780
Shouta Aoi.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.700
However, there are
powers that be

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.490
which believe the
original timeline

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.450
to be sacred above all others.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.200
A belief that has
inspired their mission

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.620
to destroy all other
timelines in existence!

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.660

Hold it!

Get away from her!

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.570
I won't let you take
any more smiles!

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.720
You should be all right
for the time being.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.260
You're wrong.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.180
Those who stay with me...
always end up getting hurt.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.390
That's not because of you.

[GIRL A]
But--

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.770
Hey, don't worry.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.650
[SHOUTA]
I have this.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.520
And I can use it to stop them.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.900
Where did you get that?

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.080
From a not-so-friendly
lookalike actually.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.590
Right. Let's rest
here for a while.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.010
[NISHIKAWA]
This isn't good.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.590
Shouta coming into contact
with her is dangerous.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.480
Secure her.
This is your top priority.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.020
If you don't, then that
spacetime criminal

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.770
will bring chaos to every world.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.490
Roger!

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.250
Hands up! And step
away from the girl!

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.010
Not a chance! I'm going
to protect her, okay?

[GIRL A groans]

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.680

Oh, no.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.760

you do to her?

Hang on. Why did you save me?

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.030
Isn't it obvious?
You're not a bad guy.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.030
Hurry. Take the girl and
get her somewhere safe.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.830

Are you hurt?

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.890
[NAKAMURA]
Why'd you shoot her?

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.560
I'm sorry.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.560
Please save everyone.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.700

Excellent. This couldn't
have gone better.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.920
Commander Nishikawa,
what the hell is going on?

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.340
Well done.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.890
You've managed to make it back
alive, Captain Nakamura.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.520
Cut the crap! Why did you
order them to shoot her?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.650
Nakamura, you're
forgetting our mission.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.980
We have one job.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.480
We protect history.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.570
Which means putting down
the criminals who threaten it.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.990
Shouta Aoi was trying
to protect that girl.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.910
[NISHIKAWA chuckles]

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.450
Tell me something.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.590
Are you suddenly friends with
him now, since he saved you?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.380
Countless alternate timelines

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.840
are continuing to
sprout, like weeds.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.420
And all of them are a threat to
the sacred original timeline.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.010
Sacred?

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.340
[NISHIKAWA] Every time
a timeline branches off,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.350
they become weaker,
sullying the sacred timeline.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.810
I will not stand idly by
and let that continue!

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.440
What are you--?

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.770
By using the Time Noise
created by that girl,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.030
I could destroy all
the other timelines.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.740
But Shouta Aoi stopped me.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.610
Who the hell are you?

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.990
[NISHIKAWA laughs]

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.460
Who am I?

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.040
Why, I'm just a lowly repairman,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.000
born to protect the
sacred timeline.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.920
[NAKAMURA]
What are these things?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
[NISHIKAWA chuckles]

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.590
Try to keep up, will you?

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.260
They're the Time Noise.
And more importantly...

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.260
...they're under my control.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.820

for much longer.

We'll figure something out.

That's your plan?
We wait and do nothing?

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.020
The longer we wait,
the more timelines are lost!

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.310
And the more people will suffer!

He might be able to fix
up your clock for you.

borrow mine if you want.

[yells]

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.980
But how?!

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.740
[SHOUTA gasps]

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.610
[POPUKOS, PIPIMIS]
<i>Pop Team Epic</i> ! <i>Pop Team Epic</i> !

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.940
<i>Pop Team Epic</i> !
<i>Pop Team Epic...</i> !

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.800
They're here. And just
in the nick of time!

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.480
Call all the vermin you want.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.520
You're all dead!

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.140
All right! Let's go!

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.270
[yells]

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.520
[BOTH yell]

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.450
[NISHIKAWA yells]

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.630
Time is a precious,
sacred thing.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.670
Your filthy hands
will never touch it!

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.250
[yells]

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.840
No matter how filthy
you think they are,

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.880
we can still join
hands together!

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.930
[BOTH laughing]

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.490
Endless Punch!

[NISHIKAWA screams]

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.620
[NISHIKAWA]
Well then,

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:35.840
I guess that fairytale of
yours will finally exist...

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:42.510
[NISHIKAWA] A future where
everyone can smile.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.540
Hey. Where did you
two come from?

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.170
We're from the future.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:45.840
Or rather a future that may
yet come to pass, right?

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.970
[SHOUTA]
Hm?
