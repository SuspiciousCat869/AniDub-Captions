00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.930
Ooh!

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.050
The mouthfeel of this floor

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.850
is like a landslide
across my tongue.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.060
There's a hint of smokiness

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.850
that's enrichening the
floor's natural flavor.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.890
The warmth from this topaz
color might fool some,

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.030
but underneath, I can taste the
extreme malice left by the devs!

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.450
Hm?

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.810
I choose A as the
Titan EX floor.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.820
B is the hard floor; you can
tell. It's the "weight"!

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.460
[PIPIMI] Now let's see
how right you were!

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.880
Whichever room I enter was the
correct answer to the challenge!

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.920
Congratulations!

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.210
[PIPIMI]
Oh, yeah!

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:41.310
[BOTH shouting]

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.230
[POPUKO, PIPIMI]
<i>Pop Team Epic.</i>

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:52.230
I'm gonna get you!

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.730
[yells]

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.470
Hey, thank you very much
for purchasing this copy

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.840
of <i>Pop Team Epic Season 2.</i>

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.390
Oh my God, I can't believe
somebody bought this

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.440
when they could've streamed it.
Like, you'd think people

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.560
would have better common
sense than that.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.360
Eh, that's assumin' a lot.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.940
True, true, true.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.650
Hey, what you spend your money
on other than this show, y'know.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.320
I would-I would get myself a
snazzy Kanto Electric Massager.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.070
That's what I was
gonna say! Yeah!

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.530
It's a very wallet-friendly
massager

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.660
and it's reliable
than the later models.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.700
Granted there's
not much difference

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:32.620
between any of them, y'know.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.330
I'd rather get alcohol.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:35.910
[POPUKO]
Oh, yeah you would, bitch.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.250
Well, you're in luck!

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.540
If you act now, you can get
a Blu-ray and a DVD!

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.170
What are you talking about?

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.460
Ah, come on, man!
How else do you think this show
will sell?

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.930
Do you honestly think that
anybody watches this show sober?
