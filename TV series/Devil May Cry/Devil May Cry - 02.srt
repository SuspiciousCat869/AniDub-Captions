1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Yee-haw!

2
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,208
Hey, Michel!

3
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,916
What is it?!

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,916
You're ridin' way
too fast tonight!

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,041
If you don't want to push it,
you can always slow down!

6
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,625
Michel!

7
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:03,208
The sound of the wind is
exceptionally sweet tonight!

8
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,125
There's no way I'm stoppin'!

9
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:23,208
Y-You want a race? Bastard!

10
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,416
Ah... This rain
sucks, doesn't it?

11
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,458
So, who you waiting for?
Your boyfriend?

12
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,750
Your husband?

13
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,833
You'll freeze if you
hang around here.

14
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,083
Hey, why don't you forget your
boyfriend and come with me.

15
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,708
I'll find us a warm place.
I can buy you a nice dinner.

16
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,041
Good answer, little lady.

17
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,708
H-Hey! W-Wait up!

18
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,958
What's going on here?

19
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,166
There's nothing here.

20
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,291
Is that what you think?

21
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,958
Wh-What's going on here?

22
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,541
Why, have you forgotten?

23
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,916
That's so insensitive of you...

24
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,375
considering you're the
very man responsible for this.

25
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,000
Recently, there have
been a string of women

26
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,333
gone missing in
Elahnay City...

27
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,541
Each one of them was
picked up by some guy

28
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,000
and treated to dinner,

29
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,916
then spent a night with him
at a hotel, and ultimately

30
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,875
went missing when he brought
them to this abandoned building.

31
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,291
Oh come on...
you think I did this?

32
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,416
Give me a break.

33
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,791
Do I look like the
kind of human being

34
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,250
who'd do something like that?

35
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,041
You don't look
like a human being.

36
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,250
I prefer you in this form!

37
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,250
Impressive skills...

38
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,791
Who the hell are you guys?

39
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,833
My associate and I represent
the Highway Department.

40
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,875
We've been searching for
you for some time now.

41
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,833
The female Devil Hunter.
The one we've heard about

42
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:05,208
who takes out any
adversary without fail...

43
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,708
Miss Lady...

44
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,000
And your real name would be...

45
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,416
What do you want from me?

46
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,541
We might have...
a little job for you.

47
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:33,000
Unbelievable! Guys'
places are such a mess!

48
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,500
No one's going to want to
come to a sty like this,

49
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,166
much less any clients...

50
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,375
Mr. Dante!

51
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,750
It's a customer! Hello!

52
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:49,291
Yeah I got one basil and spicy
salami pizza, no olives...

53
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,791
Thanks. I'll pay you everything
I owe at the end of the month.

54
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,041
Pizza again...?

55
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,000
So when do you think clients
will start coming today?

56
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,416
I suppose... I probably better
decorate the outside too.

57
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,125
Give me a break.

58
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,125
You saw the pizza boy's
reaction didn't you?

59
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:23,000
Nobody who comes here can
appreciate your fancy tastes.

60
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,125
Just put everything back
the way it was and shut up.

61
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,916
Welcome come on in!

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,041
Hmmm...

63
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,375
Seems like your sense of
style has improved a lot

64
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,583
since we last met.
Hasn't it, Dante?

65
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,708
And then you...

66
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,666
if I'm not mistaken
would be Patty Lowell...

67
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,125
Huh? How do you know?

68
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,958
Am I famous or a kind of
celebrity or something?

69
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,041
The little girl hanging
around the "Devil May Cry"

70
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,625
has become quite the subject
of gossip in this town...

71
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,250
But it's not like
you came all this way

72
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,250
just to have a look at
this brat, now is it?

73
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,166
What are you here for?

74
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,916
If it's about some job,
thanks, but no thanks.

75
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,958
I see you're as
cold as always...

76
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,625
Cuz the only jobs you
bring me are shit jobs.

77
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,416
And they don't pay.

78
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,958
That's a fine way to talk.

79
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,625
Are you aware of how much money
you owe me? Don't you get it?

80
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,583
I'm here today to collect.

81
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,208
You're the detective. You
should've figured that out.

82
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,208
Whoa, Lady. I think you're
the one who doesn't get it.

83
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm so deep in debt I
can't even keep track.

84
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,541
I couldn't pay you back
now even if I wanted to.

85
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,041
Which I don't.

86
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:53,375
Well, I was aware of that at
any rate. What can you do?

87
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,125
How about a bet?

88
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,625
If I put the 8 ball in,

89
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,583
you take the job I got
for you unconditionally.

90
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,750
Are you game?

91
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,750
You can never do things
the simple way, can you?

92
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,333
It's a deal.

93
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,625
And if you miss, you forgive my
debt and pay me 20,000 in cash.

94
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,458
Done.

95
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,541
That was great!

96
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,333
Shit. Alright...

97
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,625
Dammit.

98
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,083
You should just be a hustler,

99
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,916
you'd make more cash,
donch'ya think?

100
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,458
Just hitting a ball
doesn't do it for me.

101
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,708
I have a need to
annihilate and destroy.

102
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:46,083
So... who's the poor
sonofabitch this time?

103
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,000
Demons... of course.

104
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,208
What the hell is this?

105
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,541
There is no way in
hell these morons

106
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,291
can be the demons you
were telling me about.

107
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,541
Look.

108
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,458
As far as the Highway
Department is concerned,

109
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,250
these guys are real demons.

110
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,000
Are ya scared?

111
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,375
Don't mess with me.

112
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,708
Why would a "Demon
Hunter" waste time

113
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,166
taking out a bunch of bikers?

114
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,041
And that's exactly
why I'm giving the job

115
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,208
to a jack-of-all-trades
like you.

116
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,625
Because I don't know what the
Highway Department was thinking,

117
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,833
but they came to me
with the job, so I...

118
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,583
The hell with this.
I'm going home.

119
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,625
Huh? What's wrong?

120
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,083
I can't use swords or guns
when dealing with humans.

121
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,041
In a way, they're more of a
pain in the ass to deal with

122
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,333
than real demons.

123
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,625
And to make matters worse,

124
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,041
they won't listen to a
goddamn word I say. Bye.

125
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,500
I mean really...

126
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,000
Who needs words or weapons
to deal with these pansies?

127
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,791
Follow me.

128
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,208
Well... Is he here yet?

129
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,708
No luck.

130
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,375
Might as well just
forget about it.

131
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,041
What?! I dare you
to say that again!

132
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,500
Say it!

133
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,375
Knock it off.

134
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,458
Who do you think you are, honey?

135
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,041
I'm not interested in talking to
you guys where's your leader?

136
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,625
What the hell is your problem?

137
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,625
I'm Vincent, the leader.
What do you want?

138
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,041
Don't mean to bust the party but
you guys need to hit the road.

139
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,541
What are you talking about?

140
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,958
We do what we want,
where we want!

141
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,791
See? Like I said...

142
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,333
Talking to losers
who don't even know

143
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:43,291
what a pain in the ass they
are is a waste of time. Bye.

144
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,666
What did you say?!

145
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,500
I'm sorry about the
inconvenience to you guys,

146
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,291
but would you let us
do our thing for now?

147
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,000
There's this asshole
that I'm looking for

148
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,916
that I have to fight.

149
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,125
My older brother ran
against him 3 weeks ago...

150
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,583
and got killed.

151
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,375
This guy's a legend
on the highway,

152
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,458
and everyone who's run
against him is dead.

153
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,333
And come hell or highway
I will avenge my brother!

154
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,541
So you and your girl here
need to move on or else.

155
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,000
What a load of crap...

156
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,875
If you ask me your
brother getting killed

157
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,083
racing others around
is dumb enough...

158
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,416
But you're dumber than he is...

159
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,291
for trying to get
revenge for his death.

160
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,541
What'd you say!?

161
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,583
Hold on. If you want to
pick a fight so bad...

162
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,875
--Why don't you race him?
--Huh?

163
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,041
If you lose you and your crew
leave this place quietly.

164
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,583
Hey, Lady! What do you
think you're doing?

165
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,416
It's fine, isn't it? If you win,
your job's finished.

166
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,375
and the money will be all yours.

167
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,958
Wait a damn minute! I'm not--

168
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,291
This guy you're talking about,
his name's "Red Eye", correct?

169
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,458
Well if you race him...
chances are this Red Eye

170
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,583
will probably
show up, won't he?

171
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,000
Maybe...

172
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,708
Here you go.

173
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,083
I don't need it.

174
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,416
Didn't think you would.

175
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Me either!

176
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,208
H-Hey dude, what are you doing?

177
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,250
That's crazy...!

178
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,666
And you... What're
you up to exactly?

179
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,083
Oh, come on now...
Don't say it like that.

180
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,000
All I'm doing is trying
to take care of you

181
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,791
so you don't end up
starving to death.

182
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,125
Shit... In for a penny,
in for a pound.

183
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,666
I guess I'll have to stick
around a little longer.

184
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,541
Here, I probably
won't be needing this.

185
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,458
Probably not.
At least not right now...

186
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,541
How do you like that?

187
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,083
You're gonna have a hard
time avenging your brother

188
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,333
if you ride that slow.

189
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,083
Shit!

190
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,333
Look at you!
This race is all mine!

191
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,583
See ya back at the
Sands, ya dickhead.

192
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,291
He's got nitros! Idiot!

193
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,166
Brother!

194
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,916
Don't be stupid don't do it!

195
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,041
Brother!!

196
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,625
Stop!

197
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,458
Brother! Brother!
Brother! Brother!

198
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,791
Can't stop now!

199
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,416
Not when the wind's this good!

200
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,375
That sound!

201
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,250
What are you trying to do,

202
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,416
going this far to
follow your brother?

203
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,666
I shoulda known...
That was her plan all along.

204
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,333
Alright then...!

205
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,916
Shit!

206
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,583
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

207
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,625
You called me 'cause you knew

208
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,041
you couldn't take
this thing out.

209
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,250
Not on your own anyway!

210
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,875
Well, if you already knew that.

211
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,875
Then what are you
waiting for? Go get him.

212
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,208
You make it sound so easy.

213
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,500
What's wrong?
Is it too hard for you?

214
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,833
Nope, easy as can be!

215
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,125
Haven't you learned that
speeding causes accidents?

216
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,041
My Brother...

217
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,666
My Brother!

218
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,041
You had plans to
use me all along.

219
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,666
Sorry. Actually
this is the real job

220
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,875
the Highway Department
wanted to have done.

221
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,166
Girl's gotta do what
a girl's gotta do.

222
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,416
You can never do things
the simple way, can you?

223
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Maybe. But you can't ever
simply do what I ask you.

224
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,458
You're damn right I wouldn't.

225
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,541
Brother!

226
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,041
Brother...

227
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,083
Brother!

228
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:35,958
Brother... Brother!

229
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,375
Even with this room
put back the way it was,

230
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,041
I still don't see any clients.

231
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,958
I'm all about a one-day
workweek, little drummer girl.

232
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,166
And I should be getting paid for
that recent job any day now...

233
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,500
When you say recent job,

234
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,000
do you mean the devil
on the motorcycle thing?

235
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,250
Yep. After all, I am
the one who ended up

236
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,875
getting rid of
the Highway demon.

237
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,000
And Lady's negotiating
with the Highway Department

238
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,166
to get us a big wad of cash.

239
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,416
Here we go!

240
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,416
I was waiting to hear from you!
Oh, about the money...

241
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,583
What? You added it to my debt?

242
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,166
Yeah.

243
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,375
Of course you and I got paid for
taking care of old Red Eye.

244
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,500
But there might've been
a few other charges.

245
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,916
Like repairing that
city bridge you tore up.

246
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,500
What? Our pay?

247
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,458
Well naturally, I'll just
deduct it from what you owe me.

248
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,208
What? Just a goddamn--

249
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,208
Shit! That woman...

250
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,375
You're the most unlucky guy
I've ever met. You know that?

251
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,041
Shut up.

252
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,958
Here you go!

253
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,041
That lady friend of yours
told me that your office

254
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,958
was down here...so I thought
I'd drop by to say "thanks."

255
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,125
So, thank you, man.

256
00:21:56,208 --> 00:22:00,166
If I had kept on like
I was, I'd be dead too.

257
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,250
For some reason I
thought I heard him...

258
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,208
The voice of my brother saying,

259
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,916
"It'd be a waste
for you to die."

260
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,250
I'm done chasing the
memory of my brother.

261
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,291
From this day on, I'm gonna
ride for me and me alone.

262
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,625
That's why I gotta ask.

263
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,791
Would you please race
me just one more time?

264
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,166
Let's make a little bet.

265
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,375
A bet?

266
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,416
If none of the balls
go in, I'll race you...

267
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,250
But if I sink the 8 ball...

268
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,958
The 8 ball...

269
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,000
Then you buy me dinner.

270
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,083
There are people out
there who would say that

271
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,708
there's nothing more
important than love.

272
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,125
But is love really that great?

273
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,791
There are women who,
because of love,

274
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,750
get chased around by men.

275
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,375
And there are men that, because
of love, get killed by women.

276
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:26,041
To boil it down,
for love to be so great,

277
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,166
there's gotta be something else
behind it that's even greater.

278
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,333
But I'm not going to
tell you what that is.

279
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,416
It's not my style.

280
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,125
Check out the next
Mission: "Not Love."
