1
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:25,250
Hey. Bartender. Hit me again...

2
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,916
Here alone?

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,625
What do you say, want to
come with me after this?

4
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:40,708
Thank you.

5
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,833
That was cold!

6
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,625
You didn't have to ignore me.

7
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,541
You really shouldn't
involve yourself with me.

8
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,708
See? I told you
not to get involved.

9
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,541
I've had enough!

10
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,291
I clean and clean, but you
just make it total chaos again!

11
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,041
Huh? What are you talking about?

12
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,875
I'm telling you to
clean up after yourself

13
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,083
when you're done eating!

14
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,875
Okay, sure. Check in
again tomorrow.

15
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,250
Tomorrow?

16
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,708
Yep. Tomorrow, I bet they'll
be magically cleaned up.

17
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,291
Huh?

18
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,958
That's probably
because I clean them up!

19
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,458
That's another
way of putting it.

20
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:33,500
Sheesh! Hurry and
clean up, already!

21
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,375
Ow. Okay, fine!

22
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,166
Jeez... What's with you?

23
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,083
Didn't your parents raise
you to respect your elders?

24
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,291
I don't...

25
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,958
I don't have any parents.

26
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,166
Uh.

27
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,833
No. That's not what
I meant by that, I--.

28
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,333
Hey, you... Ow!

29
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,375
Hey... No, wait!

30
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,583
Dante, you jerk!
Well, forget you!

31
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,458
Hey, is Pat...

32
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,375
Made her mad again, huh?

33
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,916
Shut up.

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,166
What do you want here anyway?
If you're going to clean up,

35
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,958
you're more than welcome
to pick up the mop.

36
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,958
You want someone to
do that, hire a maid.

37
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,875
You can use the
pay for this job.

38
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,750
I'd like to hire you to
watch over this for a while.

39
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,875
Hey Morrison, isn't
this more of a job

40
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,166
for the coin lockers at
the train station downtown?

41
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,541
Come on, don't be so hasty.

42
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,666
See, this is a historic
heirloom that's been passed down

43
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,333
in Miss Nina's family
for generations.

44
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,333
This pendant is priceless.

45
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,416
She says that she inherited
it when her old man died,

46
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,416
and then in the 10 years since,

47
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,458
those who want it
are out for her blood

48
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,625
whenever they
smell a chance.

49
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,208
Ten years...

50
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:06,458
Why do you suddenly want to give
it to someone after that long?

51
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,250
Well, the attacks weren't
so frequent up until now,

52
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,333
but lately she's
targeted all the time,

53
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,166
and she's frequently
been in danger.

54
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,833
So, it's time for
you to step in.

55
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,000
Would you take this job for me?

56
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,458
I don't want to hear any
stupid answers, partner.

57
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:27,250
Sure, all right. I wasn't
doin' much this week anyway.

58
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,541
I'll take on the job for you.

59
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,041
That jerk, Dante.
He just has no delicacy!

60
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,166
Jeez, he doesn't have
any parents either...

61
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,916
Hi, Dante!

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,541
Oh, you're alone today?

63
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,458
I'm always alone,
Cindy, you know that.

64
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,916
Now, now, girls that age
get hurt real easily.

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,291
Hurry up and apologize to
Shortie, and make friends again.

66
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,333
Heh. It's not really
any of your business.

67
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,791
How about you just
roll over there

68
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,333
and bring me the usual, will ya?

69
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,750
Okay!

70
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,833
Now let's take a look at this.

71
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,083
You're a jerk, Dante!

72
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,333
Why the long face?

73
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,291
If you've got the time
to sit here grumbling

74
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,916
into your sundae dish,
go do some work.

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,583
You still haven't paid
back all you owe me.

76
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,208
I'm doing work right now.

77
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,666
What's this?

78
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,875
A pendant.

79
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,625
I can see that,
you big dumb ass!

80
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,541
I'm asking you,
what's with this pendant?

81
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:02,416
I'm its bodyguard...
No, necklace-guard, I guess.

82
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,958
Dante, that wasn't funny.

83
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,541
Thanks for waiting!

84
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,958
Mommy.

85
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:25,333
Huh, can it really
be that valua...

86
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,458
What's with you?

87
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,583
This one thing I can't let you
turn into payment on that debt.

88
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,416
So it's hands off, Lady.

89
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,000
As if I'd take it!
Keep in mind, it's not yours.

90
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,583
--Got it!
--Hey!

91
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,458
Even I'm not that evil
to take something away

92
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,625
from your poor broke ass.

93
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,291
Let's see.

94
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:54,041
Well, work hard and
pay me back soon. Later.

95
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,625
This just isn't right.

96
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,125
It's too late to say that.

97
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,958
You've already handed
it over to him.

98
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,666
We just have to watch over
him and see what happens.

99
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,000
I did what you told me
because you said...

100
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,000
you said that he could
handle it, but...

101
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,416
It was getting too risky.

102
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,583
I didn't want to let you
face any more danger.

103
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:33,666
And it is true.
He is a man we can trust.

104
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,666
If only I could just carry that
pendant around a little longer,

105
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,000
I would have the power to
defeat lower-level demons

106
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,750
and I won't be so powerless.

107
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,750
Yes, I know that.

108
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,875
But there are no guarantees
your attackers will always be

109
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,125
easy to defend against.

110
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,958
True, but...

111
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,000
It looks like it's begun.

112
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,375
Who the hell are you?

113
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,541
Where is the woman?

114
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,458
Do you possess the magic stone?

115
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,583
By "magic stone,"
do you mean this?

116
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,458
Wait! What do you think you're
going to do if you go out there?

117
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,708
Please, let me go.

118
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,375
Nina, stop!

119
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,791
If I just get the magic stone,

120
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,083
I'll have the power
of my master...

121
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,791
I really don't know what you're
talking about, you ugly bastard.

122
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,000
But it's way past your bedtime

123
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,583
and you need to get some
shut-eye, shithead.

124
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,291
Sweet dreams.

125
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,916
Man, I thought I'd be able to
have a little more fun there.

126
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
What?

127
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:35,000
My, my. If you came to cheer me
on, too bad. Things just ended.

128
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,583
Well, you're pretty
wicked, aren't you?

129
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,291
By not telling me
the whole story--

130
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,916
that it wasn't a bunch
of jewel thieves

131
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,083
who were after your necklace,
it was a bunch of demons.

132
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,250
You defeated the demon?

133
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,000
This type of thing is
my specialty, you see.

134
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,250
So... you gonna tell me
who your buddy is?

135
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,625
An old friend.

136
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,291
My name is Simon.

137
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,416
Simon's the one who
told me about you.

138
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,083
He told me there
was an odd-jobs man

139
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,791
who would even protect a
demon-summoning pendant.

140
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,166
But please give it back.

141
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,625
I just can't let strangers be
put in danger because of me!

142
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,125
Sure thing.

143
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,833
How about you pay me for the
work I've done up till now?

144
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,208
Yes, I'll pay you tomorrow.

145
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,625
Fine. Then tomorrow is when
I'll return this to you.

146
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,666
All right. I'll come to
your office tomorrow.

147
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,916
Wait, Mommy!

148
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,333
Mommy, wait!

149
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,750
Patty?

150
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,541
Mom!

151
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,875
Mommy! Mommy...

152
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,166
Come on, I'll take you home.

153
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,500
Just come to the office
tomorrow like you always do.

154
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,916
That woman you think
who's your mother

155
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,541
is supposed to show
up with my pay.

156
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:50,166
I know she's my mother!
I know she is!

157
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,958
So you think you can
take me any time, eh?

158
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,916
Your conceit will be
the death of you, Dante.

159
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:42,041
Come on, Patty. Just cheer up
already and start cleaning.

160
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,458
Whatever, never mind.

161
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,958
Hmph!

162
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,875
Man, she's really late.

163
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,625
I thought I told her
the right time.

164
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,666
This new client better
be trustworthy, Morrison.

165
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,208
What are you saying?

166
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,833
You trusted her enough to tell
her to bring your pay here.

167
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,000
That's not what I mean.
And you know it.

168
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,750
You're wondering whether
she might be a demon herself?

169
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,208
I'll grant you that she just so
happened to leave out the fact

170
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,291
that the crew out for her
priceless necklace were demons.

171
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,250
This whole time she seemed
like a normal human to me.

172
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,666
I mean she's even
renting a fancy hotel room

173
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,333
here in the human world...
all normal-like.

174
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,791
And what hotel would that be?

175
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,791
The Grandia Hotel,
if memory serves.

176
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,875
Please, don't make this place
any more of a mess than it is.

177
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,375
You're not one to talk, Dante!

178
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,833
Hey!

179
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,500
What's with Patty?

180
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,958
I thought she
wanted to see Nina.

181
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,375
Beats me, man.

182
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,500
She probably remembered
some soap opera or game show

183
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:48,208
she wanted to watch.
She's a hopeless brat.

184
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,750
Dante, get the telephone.

185
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,208
Jeez, what a pain.

186
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,416
Devil May Cry.

187
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,416
Oh, it's you.

188
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,291
What are you saying?
Are you sure about that?

189
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,041
Of course.

190
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,750
I came all the way out to the
public library to confirm it.

191
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,708
If you need them, I'll collect
the references for you, too.

192
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,125
Yeah, good idea.

193
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,125
Thanks, I'm counting on you.

194
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,625
Was that Nina?

195
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:23,625
Nope. It wasn't Nina. It was
more about Nina's necklace.

196
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,833
Hey, Morrison, what did
you do with the pendant?

197
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,041
Huh?

198
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,041
Mommy...

199
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,875
Patty...

200
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,666
Simon! Come in.

201
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,333
Thanks.

202
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:52,625
Perfect timing. I have
a favor to ask of you.

203
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,958
A favor?

204
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,791
I'd like you to go to that
odd-job man's place now

205
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,958
and get back the pendant
in exchange for this pay.

206
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,000
You can just go yourself.

207
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,791
I don't want to go.

208
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:07,125
Because that "Patty" girl
might be there, perhaps?

209
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:11,125
I can't be with her.
You should know that.

210
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,041
Yes... Yes, you're right.

211
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,250
Oh, did you do something
to your hand?

212
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,541
Nothing really; I just spilled
some coffee this morning.

213
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,875
But you said...

214
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,625
I thought you told me you
couldn't stand coffee...

215
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,708
Oh, was that right?

216
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,125
You...

217
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:46,625
That's strange. I can't imagine
the book is that popular.

218
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:56,125
My, what a surprise. I didn't
realize demons study.

219
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,541
Unlike Dante, I have an
avid thirst for knowledge.

220
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,250
By the way, that book...

221
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,916
Huh?

222
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,333
What the hell is the deal?

223
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,375
Never mind, just drive faster.

224
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,875
You got it.

225
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,583
Are you awake?

226
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:28,833
Who are you?

227
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,250
A good question.

228
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,833
What do you want?

229
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:36,375
What do I want? You should know
that better than anyone else.

230
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,333
But it only means
anything to demons...

231
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,750
Are you a demon?

232
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,083
But if you are, the pendant
should react to you...

233
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:49,291
True, that stone reacts
to the powers of demons.

234
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,125
But when the demon's
power is just too weak,

235
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,666
it doesn't have
much of an effect.

236
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,833
My powers are extremely weak.

237
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,958
I'm a demon with no power.

238
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:02,666
As you can see,
to take human form,

239
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,458
I have to actually
wear human skin!

240
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,375
Then, Simon is...

241
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:15,833
I'm so sorry, but I threw
away all the insides.

242
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:23,208
That's how it is, Nina Lowell.

243
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,708
Now if I get the final
part, your necklace,

244
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,875
I'll have everything I need.

245
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,916
About the guest that's
reserved the suite...

246
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,000
Hey!

247
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:58,250
I'm telling you, we can't give
out information about guests.

248
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,791
So tell me,

249
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,500
would you rather break some
precious hotel policy of yours,

250
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,458
or have a gigantic
hole in your face?

251
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,541
Now, I guess it's about
time to go pick them up.

252
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,916
Pick them up?

253
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,708
Don't play dumb with me.

254
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:17,833
I know. That necklace,
and your daughter...

255
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:23,625
I need both together, or I can't
complete the ceremony, right?

256
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:27,541
I'm begging you, just
leave Patty out of this.

257
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:32,625
"Leave her out of this," huh?
Well, you would want that.

258
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,750
After all, that's why
you had to part ways

259
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,208
with your own daughter.

260
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,250
Patty!

261
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,000
You are. You are
really my mother.

262
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,916
Patty, run away!

263
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,125
You really are my
mother, aren't you?

264
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,041
Patty, never mind, just run!

265
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,666
This is a happy surprise.

266
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,500
I never imagined
you'd bring that to me

267
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,750
of your own free will.

268
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:06,250
I guess that means luck
has finally turned my way.

269
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:12,750
All right, take the necklace and
go stand in front of that altar.

270
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,333
Patty, you mustn't
listen to what this man...

271
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,166
Mommy!

272
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,208
You keep your mouth shut!

273
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:22,333
Now, hurry up. Otherwise...

274
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,791
No, Pat...

275
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,958
Get a move on!

276
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,666
That's it.

277
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,875
Yes, there is fine.

278
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,208
Now all you have to do

279
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,875
is place that necklace on
the center of the altar.

280
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:53,375
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

281
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,291
Patty, stop!

282
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,833
Okay, is this what you wanted?

283
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,916
Will you let my mommy go, then?

284
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,250
Mommy!

285
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,625
It's here!

286
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:27,416
It's here! It's here!

287
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,041
Now I can become a king
of the demon world

288
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,791
that surpasses even
the four great demons!

289
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,666
Mommy! Mom...

290
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,291
What have... What have we done?

291
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,041
Mommy?

292
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,875
Dante!

293
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,250
What? What the hell's
going on here? Dante!

294
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,500
Never mind, Morrison.

295
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,166
Just take these two and
get away from the hotel.

296
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,333
Hey, Dante, wait!

297
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,625
While you're at it,
do me one more little favor

298
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,333
and get everybody else
out of the hotel too!

299
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,250
As if I can get that
many out at once!

300
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,958
Dante!

301
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,208
What the hell?

302
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,833
What's happening?

303
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,416
I don't care, just
evacuate everyone, quickly!

304
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,708
I can't very well just...

305
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,000
Get your ass in gear!

306
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:37,291
You can come here, but you're
too late to do anything.

307
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:43,125
Unfortunately for you, I've
gotten hold of Abigail's legacy.

308
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,833
You're always scurrying
around behind the scenes

309
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,291
pulling cheap tricks.

310
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,375
And I've gotta confess
something to ya, Sid.

311
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,500
I'm really sick of
seeing your face.

312
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,333
How about we say our goodbyes?

313
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,291
Goodbye, dickhead.

314
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,125
What, did you think I'd beg
for my life or something?

315
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,625
Fool. I'm different
than I was before.

316
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,875
I'll show you.

317
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,875
Everyone hurry!

318
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,416
I'll show you the
power of Abigail,

319
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,166
who once rivaled the demon king!

320
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,916
What in the hell just happened?

321
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,416
My god. It's over.

322
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,583
The world as we know it
is coming to an end.

323
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,625
Don't you go dying on me, Dante.

324
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,916
Everything with a
beginning also has an end.

325
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,333
That's the rule.

326
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,666
It may be sad,
but looking all gloomy

327
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,625
just because it's
the end isn't my thing.

328
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:24,291
Since it's the end, all the more
reason to paint the town red.

329
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,625
If you do that,

330
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:29,583
you can keep smiling no
matter how things pan out.

331
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:34,083
Next Mission: "Stylish!"
