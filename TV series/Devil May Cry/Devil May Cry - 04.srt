1
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,791
Help!

2
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,541
H-Help me! Help me someone!

3
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,250
Get out of here.

4
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,208
Oh god. What is this
thing? What is that?

5
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,833
Didn't you hear me?
Get out of here now.

6
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:20,958
Or perhaps your life
doesn't matter to you?

7
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,708
Move your ass.

8
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,375
The fun's... just
getting started.

9
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,875
Well, I guess I'm not gonna
be able use that anymore...

10
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,041
Lightning?

11
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,791
It was terrible!

12
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,666
Is that woman really a demon?

13
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,458
There's no mistaking it.

14
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,291
The town fell into ruin soon
after that woman arrived.

15
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,583
There are people who saw
her commanding demons.

16
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,000
My parishioners.
Members of the faithful!

17
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:13,833
Go on.

18
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,958
And I saw it too, my dear...

19
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,541
That woman
manipulating lightning...

20
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,791
and burning people
of our town to death!

21
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,791
I've been looking for you.

22
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,750
So you're the devil
laying waste to this town.

23
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,916
Why don't you take
your true form?

24
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,583
That's when you're at
your strongest, right?

25
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,500
You don't think you're
a little cocky?

26
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,625
So you prefer to remain
in that form, do you?

27
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,958
Well... regardless
of the form you take,

28
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,333
I'm going to hunt you
down and kill you.

29
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,916
Dammit!

30
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,291
I'll wipe that smile
right off your face.

31
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,458
Well it looks like
my job won't be over

32
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,875
until I take that little
blonde bitch out...

33
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,125
Ridiculous...

34
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,625
Who the hell's gonna wear
anything that expensive?

35
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,208
With that much money, I could
drink all night at Cindy's bar

36
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,750
and still come home
with some change.

37
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,333
Damn... That sure was
a stupid bet I made...

38
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,500
Thinking about
dressing up in drag?

39
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:12,083
Let me know if there's anything
you think would look good on me.

40
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:16,000
God... Your jokes
are always so lame.

41
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,500
So, what do you want?

42
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,291
If you're here to
collect money from me,

43
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't need that right now.

44
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,000
Relax. I just dropped by today

45
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,083
because I have
something to ask you.

46
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,041
The truth is that, yesterday,

47
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,375
the demon I was supposed
to bag got away from me.

48
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,375
Poor bastard. So I
guess you're gonna be

49
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,583
hunting him until
he's dead, huh?

50
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, he's got my sympathy.

51
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,000
You wouldn't know anything
about a she-devil...

52
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,750
that commands
lightning, would you?

53
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,083
Lightning?

54
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,500
Yeah. Though she looked human...

55
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,916
Don't have a clue...

56
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,833
But I can tell ya there's
a ton of demons out there

57
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,416
in the world that could
totally pass for human.

58
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,666
Huh...

59
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,958
Oh yeah, and she was
packing heat too.

60
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,416
Well, demons do have fingers...

61
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,916
That's all you need
to pull a trigger.

62
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You got a point there.

63
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,791
It's just that...
this she-devil...

64
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:14,041
kept shooting at me with a
gun in each of her hands...

65
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,208
Just like you.

66
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,875
Later.

67
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,541
This chick sounds interesting.
You should introduce us.

68
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,708
On the slim chance you're
able catch her, that is.

69
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,041
Then I could teach her how
to use those guns of hers.

70
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:29,000
That won't happen...
next time I see her she's dead.

71
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,500
You're one scary lady...

72
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,208
Hey there, Lady!

73
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,416
Are you leaving already?

74
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,875
Yeah, gotta go.

75
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,375
Maybe the next time we'll
hang out and play together.

76
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,291
Sure.

77
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,708
Dante! So did you have
a good look at this?

78
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,125
Listen to you... did you
forget how old you are?

79
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,708
There aren't any clothes
for kids in there.

80
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,708
Look here. If you're
going to buy me clothes,

81
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,958
I want to get some cute stuff!

82
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:12,166
Remind me why I should have
to buy you cute clothes...

83
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,750
You promised you would!

84
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,375
You said if you
lost to me at cards,

85
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,333
you'd buy me some clothes!

86
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,666
I didn't say I'd buy
them for you today.

87
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,875
That's not fair!

88
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,833
You have any idea how
much those clothes cost?

89
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,166
Didn't you get paid yet
for tracking down that guy?

90
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,250
That "guy" ended up being
just some runaway lizard...

91
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,458
You can imagine what that pays.

92
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,750
No, I can't.

93
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,666
Well, it turned out
that it pays three pizzas

94
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,250
and two strawberry sundaes.

95
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,833
Pizza... again?

96
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,291
So if you want
clothes like that,

97
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,916
you better do something like
find a rich guy to marry.

98
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,083
But this is just a
regular fashion magazine.

99
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,541
It's not like it's only the
expensive brand-names in here.

100
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,708
Are you telling me little kids

101
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,750
really wear stuff
that costs this much?

102
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,208
That's how it is for girls!

103
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,083
You don't understand
anything about girls' fashion!

104
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,333
For crying out loud...

105
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,625
Lightning...

106
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,583
"Devil May Cry..."

107
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,625
So, it was you... I knew it.

108
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,625
So what's the big game
you're after this time?

109
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,750
Actually this target
isn't big at all.

110
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,916
Just about the size of a human.

111
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,416
What?! You go and shoot
'em with a gun like that

112
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,541
and they'll be nothing
but minced meat!

113
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:41,125
That's fine if you're
looking to become a butcher.

114
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,458
Well... I doubt that
I'll end up using it.

115
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,125
But just in case,
it's good to have.

116
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,791
--Hey!
--Huh?

117
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,125
Is that good looking woman
out there someone you know?

118
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,291
She's gone! I know
I saw her here.

119
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,541
W-What the...?!
What just happened?!

120
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,208
So that's revenge
for yesterday, is it?

121
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,750
You don't do things half-assed.

122
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,750
So what... What the hell
did you do to her?

123
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,250
Nothing yet, really.

124
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,833
We're just having a
little spat, that's all.

125
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,375
Huh?

126
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,750
Looks like I had better change
before I go to work. Damn.

127
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:37,166
Thanx. Think I'm gonna
take this with me.

128
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,958
That woman always gives
me the heebie jeebies.

129
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,000
Though the other chick
must be something, too,

130
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,875
to be spatting with her.

131
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:50,208
You had better get
ready... demon-bitch!

132
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,625
All these expenses!

133
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,291
I should bill that
priest for this stuff,

134
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,125
but I doubt he'd cover it...

135
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,625
Excuse me, I'd like
to try this stuff on.

136
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,791
I'm sorry, but there's
another customer

137
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,791
in the dressing room right now.

138
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,208
Would you wait just
a moment, please?

139
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,416
What awful style.

140
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,083
A demon out shopping?
My, aren't we full of ourselves?

141
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,375
Get the hell outta here.

142
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,250
I'd hate to go at it
with you and destroy

143
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,583
this nice boutique and
all the designer clothes.

144
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,208
All this? You want to
purchase all of these items?

145
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,208
This is all from
this year's collection.

146
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,875
I think you'll look fantastic.

147
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,875
Make sure you come
back next week.

148
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,375
Can't shake it. Feel like
I'm losing a fight...

149
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,458
Hello! I need some
clothes from that rack

150
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,083
by the goddamn front door!

151
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,000
What do you think you're doing?!

152
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,666
You let that dangerous
devil get away?!

153
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,458
If things continue like this,

154
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,416
the damage could spread
to other towns as well...

155
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,791
She's terrible!

156
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,250
That's what you say,
but I didn't think

157
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,708
she was all that terrible...

158
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,458
What are you saying?!

159
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,333
Do you know how many of
our brethren she's killed?

160
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,041
What will she do next?

161
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,958
Alright... I will admit...
she is pretty strong.

162
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,666
I even bought this thing.

163
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,125
Take care of that demon
as quickly as you can.

164
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,833
Use whatever means you have to.

165
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,375
Got'cha. Besides, it looks like
the bitch is here anyway...

166
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,333
We just keep running
into each other today...

167
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,291
I may have let you get
away at that boutique,

168
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,250
but this time I'm going
to kill you for sure.

169
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,916
I don't care if this church
falls to the ground...

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,958
Not to mention I'm a little
pissed off at how much

171
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,208
these clothes cost that
I had to buy because of you!

172
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,541
I don't like being ignored.

173
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,958
You're in the way.

174
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,791
You should get out of here
now and say your prayers.

175
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,250
He's out of the way.

176
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:22,125
Now we can do as we like.

177
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,166
A two-gun toting demon bitch...

178
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,666
It's not often I
run into enemies

179
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,125
that I'm so averse to losing to!

180
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,333
Well it looks to me like

181
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,333
your clothes have
been ruined again...

182
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:52,041
But your body seems to
be holding up quite well.

183
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,500
So, I guess you'll have
to allow me to use this!

184
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,375
You bitch! You shot my hair!

185
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,583
What's the matter?

186
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,166
It feel's like I'm just
fighting another human!

187
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,500
If you're going to
continue like that,

188
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,833
you should go find some
underground club or something.

189
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:38,083
Your little show could
probably bring in some money.

190
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,583
Dante, that's
the bitch that I--

191
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,208
--You're late.
--Am I?

192
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,750
What time is it?

193
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,583
Too bad, it doesn't look like
there's a clock around here.

194
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,458
I told you not to be late.
You never did listen.

195
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,708
I'm here, aren't I?

196
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,958
Just a minute...

197
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,416
I mean everything's fine
since we're both okay.

198
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,916
But... what would you have
done if one of us was killed.

199
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,833
What about then?

200
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,375
Relax...

201
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,416
Neither of you seem like you're
gonna go and die that easy.

202
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,458
Hello!

203
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,458
Hmm?

204
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,166
What is going on here?!

205
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,375
What do you mean,
"what's going on here"?

206
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,375
Are you two playing
some sort of joke on me?!

207
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,083
You better not tell me there
were cameras rolling all along.

208
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,208
I don't watch reality tv shows
and I'm not gonna be on one!

209
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,250
Umm....

210
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,666
And who are you?
You can speak, huh?

211
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,791
Are you telling me
you were playing mute?

212
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,625
Seems that you're
quite the actress.

213
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,833
Don't just stand there.
Say something will ya?

214
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,375
Hey! Don't look at me.

215
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,208
You're the one opened
your big mouth.

216
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,500
And it looks like you
were having some fun

217
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,208
with that little
misunderstanding.

218
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,000
Well yeah, maybe, but...

219
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,458
"Misunderstanding"?

220
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,166
Would you explain this
thing from the beginning

221
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,250
so I understand it?

222
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,208
Yeah, I'm sorry
I had to put you on.

223
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,333
You can call me Trish.
And I am Dante's partner.

224
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:49,166
Ex-partner. Nowadays
we work independently.

225
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,333
That's not a very
nice way to put it.

226
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,125
It was your idea, wasn't it?

227
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,416
That we'd probably work
more efficiently apart.

228
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,666
Are you pouting? Maybe you're
lonely being all on your own?

229
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,541
Don't talk down to
me like I'm a kid.

230
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,125
I totally dig being on my own.

231
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,250
Plus, I can eat
all the pizza I want.

232
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,875
Didn't I tell you for years
to go easy on the pizza?!

233
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,083
And don't tell me that's all
you're eating every day.

234
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,750
God you're pathetic,
you know that?

235
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,708
Please don't talk to me
like you're my mom.

236
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,666
You're not the maternal type.

237
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,125
That's enough. Look.
You better explain this.

238
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,083
I don't give a damn about your
personal lives. Start talkin'.

239
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,916
If you're feeling
a little bit jealous,

240
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,833
you should just let
yourself express that.

241
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,625
Jealous?

242
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,000
You think I'm jealous?!

243
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,375
This bastard's a
strawberry sundae freak,

244
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,666
he eats pizza every day,
and he never pays back

245
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,125
the money he borrows
from me or anybody else!

246
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,708
How exactly am I supposed
to fall for him?!

247
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,583
Oh! So I'm wrong?!

248
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,958
Take a wild guess!

249
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,625
Say something, you!

250
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,375
Like I said, don't look at me.

251
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,166
Why didn't you just explain
things to me right away?

252
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,125
Then we wouldn't have had to

253
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,166
ruin our clothes
and hair, right?

254
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,750
I think you understand...

255
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,958
that in this business, sometimes
people want to test themselves

256
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,916
against a powerful enemy.

257
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Can't blame her since recently
you and I haven't been

258
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,416
getting that much of a
workout from our opponents.

259
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,208
And at any rate, when I
first saw you running around,

260
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,041
you seemed like you'd give
me more fun than my quarry.

261
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,125
Your quarry?

262
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,208
Why don't you come on out?

263
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,333
You've been watching us
all along, haven't you?

264
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,125
I see...

265
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,333
I'm here at the request
of another person.

266
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,625
Since this strange
priest showed up,

267
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,416
this town has become
a den for demons.

268
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,833
And he felt like he was in
danger so he hired me...

269
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,583
What a clever little father.

270
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,416
Don't misunderstand me.

271
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,625
Putting an end to you three
do-gooders will be easy.

272
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,000
I just thought I'd like to
avoid the hassle of doing so.

273
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,166
I always thought this
guy was a little weird.

274
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,916
But I wouldn't have
guessed he's a demon.

275
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,250
Now that you know me for
what I am, I have no choice...

276
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,625
It's a hassle but you're all
going to have to die here.

277
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,416
Tell me, Dante. Whatdya think?

278
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,041
Unfortunate for him.

279
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,291
Since this horny little
devil is new to town,

280
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,416
he probably doesn't know
what we do for a living.

281
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,250
I could almost cry knowing
this dork had me fooled...

282
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,416
Boohoo. Boohoo.

283
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,041
Enough with your jokes!

284
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,708
Joke's on you pal!

285
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,541
So where are you headed
off to this time?

286
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,791
I've got a lot of them
that I'm following.

287
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,500
I guess it depends on them.

288
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,333
If you get sick of it,
you can always come back here.

289
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,916
Why that's uncharacteristically
kind of you!

290
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,041
But, for the time being, I think
I want to travel around a bit.

291
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,500
Take care of yourself, alright?

292
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,291
You too, baby.

293
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,625
Let me drive you partway.
Jump on.

294
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,166
Nice suit. Looks good on you.

295
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,666
Don't suppose you did a
little shopping recently?

296
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,541
Of course I did.
And I sent him the bill...

297
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,208
You did? What a coincidence.

298
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,375
Whatdya mean by that?

299
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,458
I got a dress.

300
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,000
Good for you.

301
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,083
Um... Are you Dante?

302
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,125
Huh?

303
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,416
I was told to
bring you this bill.

304
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,791
We take cash, check,
or charge, sir.

305
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,375
No, you got the wrong guy.

306
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,583
No, no, no...

307
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,041
I'm sure this is the place!

308
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,500
Two separate women
gave me the address.

309
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,083
Two women?

310
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,208
What?! They what?!

311
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,875
Would you please pay this?!

312
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,708
Just... Just a damn minute!
I don't have any money now!

313
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,250
Well I need to be paid!

314
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,250
I can't give you money
if I don't have it.

315
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,375
Whatdya want me to do?

316
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,666
I can't just let
you off with that.

317
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,458
What is this for in the first
place? What did they buy?!

318
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:18,833
Clothes.

319
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,458
Clothes? Why the hell would
clothes cost this much?!

320
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,625
I hope Dante won't be mad...

321
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,958
that I bought some clothes.

322
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,625
Well, it should be fine.

323
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,333
He's the one who said
he'd buy them for me!

324
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,208
Every now and then,

325
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,375
there's someone who likes to
sneak around and spy on me.

326
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,750
I don't know what
anyone gets out of

327
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,083
following around
and investigating

328
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:18,041
a normal, upright
citizen such as me.

329
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,208
Must be a boring job...
I gotta tip my hat off to 'em.

330
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,500
But if anyone is gonna
follow me around,

331
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,833
they better be ready for all
the danger that comes with it.

332
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,291
'Cuz there are plenty of demons

333
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,375
that like to follow
me around too.

334
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,583
Make sure you don't
miss my next mission.

335
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,125
In Private.
