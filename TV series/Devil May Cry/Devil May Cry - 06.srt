1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,583
As payment for the potion that
would grow the princess legs,

2
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,708
the witch demanded
the princess's voice,

3
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:23,125
which was peerless in beauty.

4
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,541
So the mermaid princess
had her little tongue

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:30,791
cut out by the witch, and could
use her voice no more.

6
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,458
Who's there?!

7
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,916
Wh-What are you?!

8
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,708
But man, Dante...

9
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:08,125
Every time I drop by, you're
further and further in debt.

10
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,750
What do you expect?

11
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,375
Everyone leaves me bills
instead of a damn paycheck!

12
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,375
Hey Dante, are you here?

13
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,583
Sleeping again...

14
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,750
You're kidding me...

15
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,041
What kind of adult
spends all of their time

16
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,000
sleeping or eating pizza?
It's pathetic.

17
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,166
What happened to the jukebox?

18
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,625
Just find a way
to fix it, will ya?

19
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,833
Don't be ridiculous.
You're just too violent.

20
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,375
You've never been
able to handle things.

21
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,041
Whether they're simple
machines or good lookin' women.

22
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,458
You need charm
school, my friend.

23
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,625
I totally agree.

24
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,875
Lay off.

25
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,500
The only ways this
thing's going to get fixed

26
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,083
is by getting parts for it.

27
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,583
Or you could find some way to
get a different one altogether.

28
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,208
But I bet that
would be pricey...

29
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,583
This jukebox of yours
looks vintage to me

30
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,041
and that's gonna cost ya.

31
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,958
There's a lot of freaks into
vintage stuff out there,

32
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,250
you know...
And you're one of 'em.

33
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,750
Hey Dante, why is this the
only record you have framed?

34
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,041
I've played that record
more than any other,

35
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,708
but it got scratched...

36
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,958
I framed it 'cause

37
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,125
I couldn't bring myself
to just throw it away.

38
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,583
If you like it so much,

39
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,541
I don't understand why you
don't just buy another one?

40
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,375
Look at it and you'll see why.

41
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,875
I don't know the name of
the singer or the song.

42
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:44,291
Back in the day, that was one of
the records in that jukebox.

43
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,750
It's no use... It'd
be a helluva lot quicker

44
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,625
to just go out and buy
a new one, Dante.

45
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,250
Yeah, like I got the
money to do that....

46
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,791
Of course you don't.

47
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,250
All right then, it doesn't have
anything to do with demons,

48
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:00,166
so I was planning on handing
it off to someone else, but...

49
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,625
What are you talking about?

50
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,916
I'm talking about
a job, of course.

51
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,666
There's this abandoned
building up north.

52
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,000
And a secret room
was discovered in it.

53
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,500
Luckily, the room was airtight,

54
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,916
so its contents were
in good condition.

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,708
A ton of never-played records

56
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,208
were miraculously
preserved there.

57
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,791
The treasure hunters who
got wind of this came to me

58
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,958
because they're looking
for a bodyguard.

59
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,166
Yeah, I know what
you're thinking.

60
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,333
Why would they need a bodyguard?

61
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,708
Well, Dante, it's
your job to find out.

62
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:40,625
Mr. Dante. Thank you very much
for accepting this position.

63
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,208
We feel much more at
ease knowing we have

64
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,916
a man of your talent
serving as our bodyguard.

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,166
I'm afraid that our profession
is simply treasure hunting..

66
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,375
We are admittedly quite lousy
when it comes to fighting.

67
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,625
So this counts as...
treasure hunting?

68
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,083
It certainly does.

69
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,041
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
didn't you accept this job

70
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,250
because you thought the goods
were going to be worth it?

71
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,291
There are a lot of people
out there willing to pay

72
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,708
enormous sums of money
for priceless antiques.

73
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,500
Sometimes people will
even kill the owners

74
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,166
to get their hands
on what I find.

75
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,833
Some people must really
dig their antiques...

76
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,833
Hey Tim, we should
liven things up...

77
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,708
Why don't you play something?

78
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,541
Yeah, you bet.

79
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,041
What's that?

80
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,791
Oh, you mean this?

81
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,916
Now this... is
something special...

82
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,375
It's by the legendary
rock queen, Elena Houston.

83
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,291
First record she ever recorded.

84
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,500
And it's all mine.
The real thing.

85
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,458
But this record is
filled with her soul,

86
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,750
the purest thing there ever was.

87
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,250
Really?

88
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,875
I don't suppose you'd
be interested in playing

89
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,875
that one for me?

90
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,791
Yeah, let's give it a spin.

91
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,583
It's good to have a listen
to it every now and then...

92
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:34,500
I can hear it...
I can hear it...

93
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,541
That's... my...

94
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,333
Not bad... It strikes
you right to the core...

95
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,625
Doesn't it? Her voice is kind
of husky, but it's really good.

96
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,708
Did you know she started
writing the tunes and lyrics

97
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,875
for these while she was just
a musician on the street.

98
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,416
You seem to know your stuff.

99
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,083
Yeah, well...

100
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, time for me
to get to work.

101
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,291
Oh no you don't... let it play.

102
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,791
You gotta have music
if you want to party.

103
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,791
Elena...

104
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,333
So, she ran away.

105
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,875
Thanks a lot there, man.

106
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,375
There's no doubt about it.
That was Elena back there.

107
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,375
Elena and I were
childhood friends.

108
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,125
I was just a plain,
good-for-nothing kid,

109
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:05,041
but Elena was different.
She was this brilliant singer.

110
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,833
How can I say it...

111
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,083
Her voice had this strange
power that drew people in.

112
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,208
And I was one of those
who were just spellbound

113
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,708
by the very sound of it.

114
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,208
I had this intense
desire to have

115
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,625
more people listen to her songs.

116
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,416
Even if it was just
one more person.

117
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,583
In the beginning all
she has was a guitar...

118
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,250
But before long,
she got a band together

119
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,125
and put on shows
out in the streets.

120
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:41,541
And soon the whole city
got to know her voice.

121
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,458
And me? I just played dressup.

122
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,083
Put on the suit and the tie.

123
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,250
Went all around town
making the sales pitches.

124
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,750
I needed to help her
any way I could.

125
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,791
But the road was paved
with so many rejections.

126
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,791
With no backing from anyone,

127
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:01,250
just putting out a single record
was further away than a dream...

128
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,916
but it's a dream
we had together.

129
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,333
How long I am going to have
to keep doing this crap?!

130
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,041
Hey. Take it easy.
We just have to be patient.

131
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,666
What we need to do
is grind away at

132
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,041
building a bigger
fanbase however we can.

133
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,791
Grind away, grind away.

134
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,583
I swear you're always like this!

135
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,958
Always the business!
Always sales!

136
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,916
I wanna be famous!
I've had it with this!

137
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,416
Take it easy...

138
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,250
The next show's going to be
at a bigger venue I promise.

139
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,375
The next show?!

140
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,208
How many damn shows
has it been now?!

141
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,333
I'm goddamn sick of this!

142
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,750
The only thing I want
is for more people

143
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,541
to lose themselves in my music.

144
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,833
That's the only
thing I care about...

145
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,000
That's all I want.

146
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,083
Why can't you
understand that, Tim?

147
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,583
Elena, please...

148
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,750
Then suddenly, all of our work
finally paid off for something.

149
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,625
We got our shot at a major debut
and she gradually got more gigs.

150
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,333
When we finally got that
first album released...

151
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,666
Something we wanted
for so long...

152
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,875
we started getting popular.

153
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,583
But... these really strange
things started to happen

154
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,416
to all of the fans who were
listening to her records.

155
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,250
What strange things?

156
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,375
The fans lost themselves
in excitement, and in the end

157
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,500
all kinds of people
started committing suicide

158
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,500
or even murdering one another
for tickets to her concerts.

159
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,541
--Elena! Elena! Over here!
--I love you, Elena!

160
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,625
And then Elena, herself,
began to change...

161
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,708
And then the more that Elena's
spellbound fans went crazy

162
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,583
and outta control the
further she withdrew

163
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,625
from me and the other
guys in the band.

164
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,125
And then she just...

165
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,083
Sing... Sing, Elena...

166
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,875
You have to sing for us.

167
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,041
Sing for us.

168
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,375
What's going on?!

169
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,041
Is there something
you're not satisfied with?

170
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,875
Who are you?! What's
happened to everyone?!

171
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,125
Isn't it just what you wanted?

172
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,500
A spellbinding voice that
your fans couldn't do without.

173
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,250
A devilishly beautiful voice...

174
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,791
That's what you
wanted, isn't it?

175
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,625
And you got what you wanted...

176
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,708
Nothing more.

177
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,375
That's not what I...

178
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,083
If you want something,
you have to give something.

179
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,958
It's what we say in the
business, a tradeoff.

180
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,625
You are me, and I am you, Elena.

181
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,916
We are both of the same...
mind and body.

182
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,666
So you'll use this on her?

183
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,833
Yeah... I think she's
searching for this record.

184
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,708
I believe that she might be
looking for her own songs.

185
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,958
It sounds crazy, I know.

186
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,375
So tell me, Dante...

187
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,500
What is the "Devil Hunter"
going to do with her?

188
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,583
The woman you knew as Elaina
Huston isn't here anymore, man.

189
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,541
What you saw...

190
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,083
...was nothing... but a demon.

191
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,625
I... suppose you're right.

192
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,500
This music's a little
rowdy for a funeral, though.

193
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,208
My voice... My song...

194
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,458
You want your songs
back, don't you?

195
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,583
If you do, you're
going to have to kill

196
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,000
those who stand in the way.

197
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:14,500
You have to kill for your
precious, precious songs.

198
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:18,666
Let's kill them...
Let's crush them...

199
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,625
Let's do it for your songs,

200
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,666
the most precious
things to you...

201
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:30,833
Let's kill, kill, kill...
and then let's kill some more.

202
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,125
You said it, didn't you?

203
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:37,000
That for your songs
you'd sacrifice anything...

204
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,625
For... my songs...

205
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:46,833
Yes... For my songs. Let's kill!

206
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,583
Ah, wonderful! Wonderful!

207
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,750
The best... The rock queen...

208
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,541
Elena, please stop.

209
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,291
Please don't do this
anymore. I'm begging you.

210
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,875
Your voice...
Your songs...

211
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,833
I know this isn't
what they were for...

212
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,750
I'm begging you, Elena...

213
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,291
Enough already...

214
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:36,875
Enough... Elena, please...

215
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,333
Please...

216
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,833
Elena!

217
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,916
Mark my words... you're
all going to regret this.

218
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,500
Elena! Elena! Elena!

219
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,708
Please Elena, just open
your eyes and look at me.

220
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,500
You can do it!

221
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,250
Elena!

222
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,666
You just hang in
there a little longer

223
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,541
I'll get a doctor for you.

224
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,708
My record....

225
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:59,416
What did you say,
Elena? I can't hear you.

226
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,125
Oh... It was you, wasn't it?
I can't believe it.

227
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:07,708
You still...
had my... record...

228
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,333
Tim?

229
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,333
Oh, Tim...

230
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:17,625
Of course! Because it's...

231
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,916
Because you're
truly the greatest.

232
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,708
I wish we could be...
together again...

233
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,666
Elena...

234
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,875
A tribute to the
spirit of the Queen...

235
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:13,375
What would you ask for if you
could have your wishes granted?

236
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,916
Would you ask to be rich?

237
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,875
Or to have the woman you're
in love with be yours?

238
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,875
You can wish for whatever you
want, it's your business,

239
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:26,500
but to have one's wishes come
true always comes with a price.

240
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:32,208
Every deal has a catch. You'd
better be nice and careful.

241
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,791
Next Mission,
"Wishes Come True."
