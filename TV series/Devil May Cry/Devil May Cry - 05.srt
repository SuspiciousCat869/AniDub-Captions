1
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,416
Hey. So what's
the problem, baby?

2
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,916
Get it.

3
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,500
That was fast.

4
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,875
I figured you'd be
coming in sometime soon.

5
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,375
Kinda hard to believe you've
been waiting for me too long.

6
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,666
I missed you so much.

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,416
Fredi, could you come here?

8
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,500
Hey, hang on! Cindy!

9
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:56,833
Hush! If you keep bothering me,
I'll never get any work done!

10
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,750
What's your problem with me?

11
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,458
To be honest...
I don't really care

12
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,833
for guys who keep
trying to chase after me.

13
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,541
Actually, I'm the type of girl
who likes to do the chasing!

14
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,083
What are you talking about...?

15
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,500
So tell me what kind of guy
you're looking for then, baby.

16
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:13,666
A real he-man! I like 'em
wild, sexy, and intelligent!

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,791
But still kind to women
and always relaxed.

18
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,666
And he's gotta be
to die-for cute.

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,041
A real head-turner...
just like Dante is!

20
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,625
Dante?

21
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,000
Him.

22
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,208
If you could become just
a little more like Dante...

23
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,458
I might think about
going out with you!

24
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,250
Hey, Cindy!

25
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:40,666
That guy? She thinks
he's a real man?

26
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,333
I don't get it...

27
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,625
So just what does Cindy see
in a guy like that anyway?

28
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,250
What the...?

29
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,625
Did I...? I guess
I drank too much...

30
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
She's not here!
She's not here!

31
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,375
What gives?

32
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,416
Where'd that woman go?!

33
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,333
What's his deal?

34
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,916
Hey dude! Hey! Whassup?

35
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,625
Cindy, forget about that guy!

36
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,833
My god! what happened
to your face?!

37
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,291
Ow!

38
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,916
Cindy. Listen up.
And listen good.

39
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,750
That Dante guy is no "real man."
He's nothing but a pervert!

40
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,916
Forget you ever met him.

41
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,041
What?

42
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,083
I saw it with my own eyes!

43
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,875
He went right into the girls'
restroom! What gives?!

44
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,250
What are you talking about?

45
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,708
Cindy! What I'm saying is...
he picked up some girl

46
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,958
took her to the women's
restroom and...

47
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,583
Ow!

48
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,458
Hey, what gives?

49
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,083
God dammit.

50
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,625
Dammit... I swear I'm going
to get the dirt on you.

51
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,875
Hey, What d'ya think
you're doing?!

52
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,958
Uh, n-n-nothing...

53
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,125
Looks like business
is slow as always, eh?

54
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,708
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Let's just see it.

55
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,541
Now, take it easy.

56
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,875
Look, here we go.

57
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,208
You watch your back.

58
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,166
Heh... Like you give a shit...

59
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,333
What the hell are you doing
here, Dante? Hit the road.

60
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,250
I came to give you
a little message...

61
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,625
"You guys don't need
to be messing with

62
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,583
a little thing like
this, now do you?"

63
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,750
No way! He's going to
take on the Mafia?!

64
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,083
Holy shit! He really did...

65
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,791
Jesus Christ!
Who is this maniac?!

66
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,458
He's gotta be crazy!
He's out of his mind!

67
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,041
Stay away from that guy!

68
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,208
He's a heartless,
cold-blooded killer!

69
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,208
It doesn't matter even if
it's the Mafia or whoever!

70
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,333
That dude will even
kill people for money!

71
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,666
It wouldn't matter
if you had nine lives!

72
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,750
If you're with that guy,

73
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,916
you'll just get used up,
Cindy, trust me.

74
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,458
You'll wind up
riddled with holes!

75
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,416
He said "riddled with holes."
We should tell someone, Ted!

76
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,958
No, wait! You're
misunderstanding me!

77
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,291
Cindy!

78
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,625
Just go home.

79
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,916
Ah, don't be that way...

80
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,958
What gives? The door
isn't even locked...

81
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,500
This is what I should have
done in the first place.

82
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,041
I don't care what it is...

83
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,291
I just need to find
something that will

84
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,666
land this freak in the slammer.

85
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,375
I could make your
wish come true.

86
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,041
It's my imagination...

87
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,125
No... I'm the only
one fit for that job.

88
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:28,250
You despise Dante,
right?! Me too!

89
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,041
You gotta let me out of here!

90
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,416
You?! What the hell
could you do?!

91
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,750
I'll make this worth
your while, little boy.

92
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,333
Let me out of here, and I'll--

93
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:42,958
Don't listen to those morons!
Me, I'm the one you need! Yes.

94
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,125
I'm the one who found
this guy! So get lost!

95
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,208
Hey! Let me out of here!

96
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,333
I'll make your wish come true.

97
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,000
What the hell were
those things?!

98
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,416
They're devils.

99
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,750
Wh-Who are you?!

100
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,291
I don't think you've
got the right to ask

101
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,750
since you're the one who's
broken into someone's house.

102
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,375
I... That's...

103
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:28,083
Just relax, my friend.
I won't tell Dante about this.

104
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,625
You want to know...

105
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,708
Know the real truth
about Dante, do you not?

106
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,083
Huh?

107
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:40,083
If that's the case...
I've got something for you.

108
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,333
What gives? What is this?

109
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,750
Don't ask. Just take it and go.

110
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,625
When you open it, you'll
know what Dante really is.

111
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,916
Dante?

112
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,125
You're home, aren't you?

113
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,583
Morrison told me about it.

114
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,208
It's sounds like you've made
a bunch of money, haven't you?

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,791
Hey, it's true, Cindy!
You gotta believe me! I promise!

116
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,708
I swear I saw it
with my own eyes!

117
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,958
That dude isn't
normal. He's crazy!

118
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,666
There's something
really weird about him!

119
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,541
He's weird?

120
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,166
You broke into Dante's place!

121
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,833
And when Dante
wasn't even there!

122
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,208
That? Well that was...
just because...

123
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,250
It's 'cause I wanted you to
know that he's dangerous, baby!

124
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,833
Shame on you!

125
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,708
Why did things turn
out like this?

126
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,208
Dammit, that hurt!
What the...?

127
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,958
Dammit!

128
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,416
Trying to make me look stupid...

129
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,166
My family have been pacifists
since my grandfather's time,

130
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,125
but not any more!

131
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,333
Well, it's just a little kitty!

132
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,125
It's all right. Come on...

133
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,750
It's not like I'm going
to eat you or anything...

134
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,000
Who is it?
Who's that over there?!

135
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,375
What the hell is that?!

136
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,333
There he is!

137
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,000
You idiot. Get outta here!

138
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,083
Nice timing there, ya dickhead.

139
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,708
Seems that lately
I've had nothing to fight

140
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,416
but a bunch of weaklings.

141
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,791
I've been wanting to
go up against someone

142
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,125
that can give me
a little workout!

143
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,750
A... A de... It's a demon...

144
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,666
All bark and no bite...

145
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:33,250
It's true!
You gotta believe me, Cindy!

146
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,416
--Cindy, listen!
--Isaac!

147
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,833
I saw that dude hack
a demon in two

148
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,625
with this big sword
that he carries!

149
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,791
Listen!

150
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,916
He's a demon! It's true!

151
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,583
That guy's a demon himself!

152
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,250
A demon, I tell ya!

153
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,208
That's the only
explanation for all this!

154
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,000
I cannot believe you!

155
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,375
It's after noon and I'd swear

156
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,041
you're still asleep
and dreaming!

157
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,791
Nonsense! I didn't
dream up any of this!

158
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,041
How can I make you believe me?

159
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,958
Come in, Dante. The usual?

160
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,375
Hey, settle down!

161
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,791
So, who's that?
Your little boyfriend?

162
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,916
Well...something about
him made me actually

163
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,500
think about maybe dating him.

164
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,875
But he's been acting like a
stalking psychopath lately.

165
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,333
Maybe he kind of misunderstood

166
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,708
that comment I made
the other day.

167
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,208
I mean the only thing
I meant was that

168
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,958
I'd wish he was a little
more like you are, Dante.

169
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,291
It looks like he took what I was
saying totally out of context.

170
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,833
And now he says I should
stay away from you

171
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,583
'cause you're a demon!

172
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,333
Well he's got things
about half right...

173
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,666
And get a load of this, Dante.

174
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,750
He swears he saw you
kill a demon last night.

175
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,916
Isn't that crazy?

176
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,833
I mean it's so stupid.

177
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,458
It's just that I wanted to
be the one to chase him...

178
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,625
Oh, I'm sorry!
I'll be right with you.

179
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,666
Yep, that's right.

180
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,416
You can be a little
devil, you know that?

181
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,625
Who's the devil?!

182
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,916
You'd be a lot better
off giving me money

183
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,291
to pay off what you owe me,

184
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,791
rather than having
me take it from you

185
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,041
'cause you lost at pool.

186
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,333
Are you saying you're
really that far in debt?

187
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,166
I mean, and some
weirdo man's been

188
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,375
spying on you
office lately, too.

189
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,833
A weird man?

190
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,458
Mm-hmm. But he seemed
like a total wussy wimp,

191
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,291
so I got rid of him pronto!

192
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,083
That reminds me... there was
some visitor in your office

193
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,666
when I had stopped
by recently, too.

194
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,000
A visitor?

195
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,333
Dammit!

196
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,791
U-Um... behind you...
Look out behind you!

197
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,208
Dante...

198
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,875
Dante!

199
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,291
Dante...

200
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,708
You called?

201
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,875
You ready?

202
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,666
Cuz it looks like now...

203
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,750
this party's just
getting started.

204
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,291
N-No, stop!

205
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,958
Stop! What are you
doin' man? What gives?

206
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,833
All right, bring it on!

207
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,000
Just a minute.

208
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,791
You forgot something.

209
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,708
If you're going to skip town...

210
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,083
you should at least
let her know about it.

211
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,500
If you don't, she can't chase
you, even if she wants to.

212
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,833
What do you mean by that?

213
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,916
Why don't you ask her yourself?

214
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:13,291
You mean... you came to...
just to tell me that?

215
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm just a demon, man.

216
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,125
I just hadn't had
my fill of fun yet.

217
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,708
Dante!

218
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,625
What are you?
I mean, who are you?

219
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:35,750
Who knows... Maybe you should
try asking God or someone...

220
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,708
I'll have what he's having!

221
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,916
Huh?

222
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,833
I said I want one of those too!

223
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,833
All right!

224
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,250
Fredi, one strawberry sundae!

225
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,208
So what, are you planning
on eating with me?

226
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,041
Mmm-hmnm.

227
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,791
There you go.

228
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,916
Okay. One strawberry sundae
with extra berries. Enjoy!

229
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,541
You're kinda making me
lose my appetite, dude.

230
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,125
I'm not sure when it started,

231
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:14,208
but before I knew it, I was
always listening to her songs.

232
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,791
Tougher than any man,
softer than any woman,

233
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,041
she sings of the sadness
in human hearts.

234
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:25,000
If I ever get to meet her,
I'll probably thank her.

235
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,458
Because she
made me realize that

236
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:30,458
even I have enough emotional
depth to understand songs.

237
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:31,583
Keep on playing.

238
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:35,416
Next Mission: "Rock Queen."
