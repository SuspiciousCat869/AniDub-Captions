1
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,083
What'll it be?

2
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,000
Strawberry sundae.

3
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,750
This is a bar, Mister.

4
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,250
No place for a kid.

5
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,625
Really?

6
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,958
Just tryin' to sweeten
up the air in here.

7
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:52,750
Smells like shit.
Or more like...blood.

8
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,625
That's fine with me...

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,875
What I'm interested in
is this rumor I heard.

10
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,125
They say that somewhere
around here there's some bar.

11
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,083
More like a dive.

12
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,583
A place where they'll
take someone's life

13
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,541
in place of money.

14
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,333
Kinda scary.

15
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,875
Sorry. Forgive me pal.

16
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:18,208
Royal Straight Flush, is it?

17
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,625
Laying a hand like
that could kill a guy.

18
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,875
How about... I buy you a round?

19
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,708
Not bad, Mr. Royal Flush.

20
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,375
The next time you open up shop,

21
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,291
don't forget to add strawberry
sundaes to the menu.

22
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,250
Bingo.

23
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,458
Yeah, my usual pizza.

24
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:13,458
The special with prosciutto and
garlic potatoes. And rush it.

25
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,458
What, my tab?
Don't sweat the small stuff.

26
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,208
Soon, I'll pay you
everything I owe ya.

27
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,958
Oh yeah no olives and be
sure to make it a large.

28
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,541
Don't forget.

29
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,500
Are you listening to me, Dante?

30
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,041
Didn't you hear me?
I'm studying.

31
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,125
I may take the occasional
odd job here and there,

32
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,166
but I have no desire
to baby-sit some brat.

33
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,000
Brat?

34
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,333
Sorry, young lady.

35
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,250
Maybe in 10 years or so,

36
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,541
I'll ask you out on a date.

37
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,791
And I'll tell you
"no" in 10 seconds.

38
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,583
Me, I'm only into younger guys.

39
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,208
Listen, Dante.
She may be a kid, but...

40
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,583
Oh I'm sorry. My apologies.

41
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,916
But the young lady standing
before you is not just any girl.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,333
She's Patty Lowell.

43
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,750
The Cinderella girl
who is heiress

44
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,500
to the Lowell family fortune.

45
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,041
She sure doesn't look it.

46
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,916
That's because all this
time she's been living

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,375
as an orphan downtown.

48
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,791
I can tell.

49
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,125
Kinda like Cinderella but
after the magic wore off.

50
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,750
Actually it's the opposite.

51
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,041
The head of the Lowell
family passed away.

52
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,958
When the will was read,
the existence of an

53
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,375
illegitimate child
came to light.

54
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,500
And the lucky winner was
our young lady, Patty?

55
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,833
Precisely.

56
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,333
In other words, the magic
is just about to begin.

57
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,916
If you like, I could
always hire you

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,750
as my very own
personal servant...

59
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,625
Yeah.

60
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,541
Basically, it has been
requested that you escort

61
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,250
Miss Patty back to the Lowell
Mansion by 6:00pm tomorrow.

62
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,458
Think you can handle that?

63
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,458
That's all?

64
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,333
That's all.

65
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,208
I won't do it.

66
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,708
I've got a pizza on the way...

67
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,166
There's no pizza on the way.

68
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,291
I stopped by and talked
with Andy at the pizza place

69
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,916
and told him that, until
you pay your tab in full,

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,916
they are not to deliver a
single pizza to you. Capisci?

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,375
You bastard...
What right do you have to...

72
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,166
Shit. not again.

73
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,083
If you win, I'll pay
your tab in full.

74
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,125
And if you lose...

75
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,916
Fine. Alright.
I know the routine.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,541
Heads.

77
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,916
You're not much of
a gambler, are you?

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,208
Shut up.

79
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,250
Dante!

80
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,916
You forget something?

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,666
You've got a show
to play, right?

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,541
A show?

83
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,916
Don't forget,
I'm counting on you.

84
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,041
I could come and
see your show...

85
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,000
I mean, there must not be anyone

86
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,500
who comes to see you
otherwise, right?

87
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,416
Sorry, but my shows
are for adults only.

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,333
So the woman in that picture is
coming to your show then, huh?

89
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,125
Picture?

90
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,041
Well whatever you do, you
should buy yourself a new car.

91
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,125
I don't see any romance
happening in this car,

92
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,458
that's for sure.

93
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,708
It's dirty, it stinks,
and it's falling apart.

94
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,125
Don't you know?

95
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,458
When it comes to women,

96
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,583
it's not where you take
them that's important.

97
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,125
It's how you get them there.

98
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,083
Dante.

99
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,916
This girl's life is mine!

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,500
Hey! Are you even
listening to me!?

101
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,250
What are you doing?!

102
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,583
What's wrong with you?
What was that all about?!

103
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,958
Don't you think that's
a little dangerous?!

104
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,625
What are you trying
to do, kill me?

105
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,541
Can't you do something
about this, bro?

106
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,083
You are a lawyer, aren't you?!

107
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,166
There's nothing
that can be done!

108
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,625
If the person who sent
that letter, Patty Lowell,

109
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,875
actually does exist,
the fortune belongs to her.

110
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,208
You're kidding me!

111
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,291
Relaaaaax.
Take is easy, big bro.

112
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,166
If that letter isn't a fake,
then Patty Lowell

113
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,958
will come here around
6 o'clock tomorrow evening.

114
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,791
That's what I'm worried about!

115
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,416
Tomorrow at 6 in the evening...

116
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,541
That makes exactly
one week, doesn't it?!

117
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,916
Ha, ha...

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,333
"If Patty Lowell's existence
is authentically proven

119
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,041
within one week of the death
of the Lowell family's head...

120
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,750
then the entirety of
the family fortune

121
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,625
is to go to Miss Lowell". Well.

122
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,291
Unbelievable. That our
ever-so-serious brother

123
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,458
had an illegitimate
child all this time.

124
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:51,375
So...you can look
cute when you want to.

125
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,875
Is that a picture
of your boyfriend?

126
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,208
No! It's my mom, you halfwit!

127
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,625
And she's a lot prettier
than your girlfriend!

128
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:05,041
But... I don't remember
anything about her...

129
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:09,375
My mom got sick and died
when I was just a baby.

130
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,041
That's what the
hospital director said.

131
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:16,958
That's why I don't remember...
anything... about my mother...

132
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,958
The only thing I have...
is this picture of her...

133
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,250
Wow! That is one pretty lady!

134
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,958
That wouldn't be a picture
of your mother would it?

135
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,500
Hey, and you're pretty
charming yourself!

136
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,541
Mind if I sit here?

137
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,708
Huh?

138
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,416
There are open seats
all over the place.

139
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,625
Here you go!

140
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,875
Thank you!

141
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,166
I hope I am not bothering you.

142
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,583
You're not botherin' me,

143
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,666
but I can't promise
that you'll live long.

144
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,791
And what is that
supposed to mean?!

145
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,708
I mean really!

146
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,625
Why would anyone need
some promise like that,

147
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,291
just because they sit...

148
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,125
Good grief...

149
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,250
That's why I told you...

150
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,458
He's dead.

151
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,708
Oh Mommy... oh Mommy...

152
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,458
He was beat to death. Damn.

153
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,000
I can't be! Was it you?!

154
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,125
Over here!

155
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,791
Geez! What is this!?

156
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:40,958
You. How 'bout you... start
telling me what's going on here.

157
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,625
Sure, so how about I run
this little scenario by you.

158
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,416
For the ten seconds or so that
this train was in the tunnel...

159
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,458
in this car there were
those three, me and the girl.

160
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:56,708
And then our dead friend
here. That makes six.

161
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,083
First off, the old man.

162
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,833
He didn't do it.

163
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,708
And the couple there was
making out in the dark.

164
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,416
And that's how she was.

165
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,083
So that only leaves you!

166
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,500
No, there was one more person.

167
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,708
Or to be more precise,
one more thing.

168
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,791
That man on the train...
Do you know killed that guy?

169
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,416
Who knows...

170
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,208
It was a demon. He was killed
by a demon, wasn't he?

171
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,625
Could... Could a demon
be hunting me, too?

172
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:11,458
Dante! Dante!

173
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,083
Let's go.

174
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,833
Checkmate.

175
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,958
Damn. I lost again!

176
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,875
Ever since we were kids,

177
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,458
you've always run out of
steam in the closing stretch.

178
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,416
And that is why Jenny left you.

179
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,208
It's because you got in the way!

180
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,000
No, that was because
you were at fault

181
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,541
for jumping to conclusions.

182
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,458
Shit.

183
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,666
But what I'm wondering is

184
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,750
why you seem to love
that painting so much.

185
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,083
Yes. I guess it's
because looking at it

186
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,625
puts me at peace. And I think...

187
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,750
When we divide the
fortune among us,

188
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,333
I'll take the
artwork that's here.

189
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,375
Me, I'll take cold, hard cash.

190
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,833
Hey! Don't get
ahead of yourselves!

191
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:55,125
We know. But we have to be
prepared for the worst...

192
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,750
That's all we're doing...

193
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,708
Welcome to our hotel.

194
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,500
Give me your cheapest room.

195
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,875
I don't give a damn
if it gets sun or not.

196
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,041
We'll be out of here first
thing in the morning anyhow.

197
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,458
One adult and one child.

198
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,666
Oh, she's not a child,
she's a young lady.

199
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,041
What're you doing? Come on
move it let's get to sleep.

200
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,250
That's my mother.

201
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,958
What?

202
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,291
My mom!

203
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,500
Mister!

204
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,166
Yes? What is it?

205
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,125
Where can I go to
meet this woman?

206
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,750
Well...

207
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,625
What are you talking about?
I thought your mother died.

208
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,583
Come on.

209
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,666
Ahhh. This is a tight fit.

210
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,291
Get to bed. Tomorrow's
going to be an early day.

211
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,208
I didn't tell you the truth.

212
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,083
My mom didn't actually
get sick and die.

213
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,458
She disappeared.

214
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,375
I happened to overhear
the hospital director

215
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,250
talking about it.

216
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,500
My mom was being
hunted by a demon.

217
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,000
And she didn't want me,
a baby, to be in danger,

218
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,666
so she put me in the
care of the orphanage.

219
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,583
Anyone hunted by a demon
is as good as dead?!

220
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,291
Is my mother really dead?!

221
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,625
Tell me Dante am I going to
be killed by a demon too?!

222
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,583
Who knows...

223
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,291
I don't care. About any fortune.

224
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,333
And I don't care... about
my family's inheritance...

225
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,416
If I were to get a little
money, I'd just want to

226
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,708
use it to buy lots of clothes
and sweets and stuff like that

227
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,750
for the other kids
at the orphanage.

228
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,666
But then...
clothes and sweets

229
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,333
and those kinds of things aren't
really what they all want.

230
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,958
Like me...they just want to see
their mothers and their fathers!

231
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:49,208
More than anything.

232
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,708
You're probably just
going to laugh at me...

233
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,166
Nope.

234
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,333
Everyone wants to
see their parents.

235
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,958
Dante...

236
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,583
Well, sorry...

237
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:03,083
But I've got a date with some
pretty girls in Sandman Land...

238
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,916
You get to sleep too.

239
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,750
Hey! Where's my daughter!?

240
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,750
Daughter...?

241
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,833
The kid I checked in with!

242
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,708
Hmmm... I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

243
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,541
Bastard. What the hell are you?

244
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,208
Speaking of hell you should
know I know all about you.

245
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,416
Yeah, then you know that
thing won't be enough

246
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,208
to kill me, don't you?

247
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,000
So, where is Patty?

248
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,166
Well alright.

249
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,416
Well, you see, right
now in the underworld,

250
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,791
the four most powerful
demons are vying for power.

251
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,333
Things are pretty
dangerous out here.

252
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,166
--So who's callin' the shots?
--Huh?

253
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,208
Who's the douchebag who
told you to go after Patty?

254
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,250
It must be someone from
the Lowell family...

255
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:35,333
Someone who doesn't want
Patty to claim the inheritance.

256
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,416
I have no idea.
I'm telling the truth

257
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,041
I'm just one of their grunts.

258
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,250
They don't tell me
anything at all.

259
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,625
It's mommy!

260
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:20,208
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

261
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,791
Mommy!

262
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:26,541
Oh, Mommy! Mommy, I wanted to
see you so bad for so long!

263
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,041
I'm sorry, Patty.

264
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:32,041
I won't do anything to
make you feel lonely again.

265
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,875
Oh, mommy, you promise?!

266
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,791
Because you're about
to die right now!

267
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,666
And your mom's
going to kill you!

268
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,500
Hey there.

269
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:02,208
You're not actually into lame
operas like this, now are you?

270
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,750
Dante!

271
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,125
Um... I was... I thought
my mommy was...

272
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:12,083
But...looks like we'll have to
wait for our touching finale.

273
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,291
Sorry honey, but this
show isn't for kids.

274
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,916
I'm so sorry, miss.

275
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,791
But I'm afraid that it is
now time for you to die.

276
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,375
Because I was
promised I would be

277
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,666
greatly rewarded
by my masters if

278
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,791
I killed you if the
others failed to do so.

279
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,125
Hit the road.

280
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,750
Time's up.

281
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,625
Brother, we did it!
The fortune is ours!

282
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:25,791
This letter was just
a bunch of nonsense.

283
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,000
You have a guest.

284
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,541
A guest?

285
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,916
Thank you.

286
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,083
And who might you be?

287
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,916
Oh my, that's not funny!

288
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,125
Nice to meet you.
I'm Patty Lowell.

289
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,500
She's just a child!

290
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,791
No, that child is
nothing but a fake.

291
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,875
I took every situation
into account.

292
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,625
fortunately for me,
I was able to find

293
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,875
a girl with the same
name quite quickly.

294
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,916
I had it arranged so that
all the media attention

295
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,875
would be on her and not me.

296
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,958
Thanks to her, my trip
here was quite pleasant.

297
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,416
Well then.

298
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,708
Why don't we just hurry and
deal with the formalities?

299
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,375
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid

300
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,041
your claim is invalid,
Miss Patty Lowell.

301
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,541
Speaking as the lawyer,
I regret to inform you

302
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,708
that you have renounced
your right to the inheritance

303
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,041
as you missed the 6PM deadline.

304
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,500
You are aware you've
missed it, right?

305
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,416
Even if is... just by
a mere second or two.

306
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,250
Really now! In his will, it says
within one week of his death.

307
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,500
I'm quite sure that my
dad will have been dead

308
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:31,291
for exactly one week at 6:28.
And look! I am on time!

309
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,750
Will a driver's license
suffice for my identification?

310
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,125
No... It's no longer necessary.

311
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,416
What do you mean by that?

312
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,708
Because Patty
Lowell's existence...

313
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,833
...will never be confirmed!

314
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,041
Brother?!

315
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,708
And neither will yours!

316
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,250
The fortune... is all mine!

317
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,541
And I'm not handing
it over... to anyone!

318
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,000
So it was you...

319
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,666
...who requested I serve
as a bodyguard for Patty.

320
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,666
Did you think you were
making some small atonement

321
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,083
for your sins against her?

322
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,583
You've got a pretty face,

323
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,458
but you're more terrible
than those demons.

324
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,416
Well, if you were a demon,

325
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,583
I'd be able to kill you without
thinking twice about it.

326
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,458
Okay. If I can't let this go...

327
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,666
I'll work off the anger...!

328
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,833
Guess this'll be
one helluva party!

329
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,041
I saw it all!

330
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,291
The adult-only part...

331
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:26,791
Wait! Please wait a minute!
I'm begging you.

332
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,666
That child...
Please let me care for her!

333
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,250
I want to do what I
can to make amends...

334
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,791
So, is it alright that you're
not staying at the mansion?

335
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,208
It's fine. I received
compensation.

336
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,541
Compensation?

337
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,416
Yep. Because I'm a little
girl who's been scarred

338
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,125
from being exposed to
the ugly world of adults.

339
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,958
And those clothes, are
those the "compensation"?

340
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,458
As well as clothes and sweets
for the kids at the orphanage.

341
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,833
In all, three truckloads!

342
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,416
That's great! Well done.

343
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,416
Ah, Morrison, you're here?

344
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,208
Yeah.

345
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,208
Huh? I thought my
strawberry sundae

346
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,291
would be delivered here by the
time I got outta the shower...

347
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,875
That strawberry sundae?

348
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,000
What?!

349
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,166
Hey, that was mine!

350
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,875
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

351
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,291
This is MY place!

352
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:22,541
Let's get this straight.
My place. Mine.

353
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,500
It was totally filthy and dorky,

354
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,333
so I cleaned it and did
some cute decorating.

355
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,375
Cute's a relative term.

356
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,666
I'm more concerned about
my goddamned dessert!

357
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,250
That's what I
charge for my work.

358
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,958
Thanks! It was the
best Sunday ever!

359
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,875
What a pain...

360
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,875
The only jobs I get are
those that don't pay anything.

361
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,708
My debt just keeps growing...

362
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:20,041
And now, I got to look after
some brat on top of it all.

363
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,416
On nights like tonight,
I like to open up the throttle

364
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,125
on my bike and
blow off some steam.

365
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,291
And if a demon
should come my way...

366
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:31,708
Well, that would
make it just perfect.

367
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:35,791
Don't miss my next mission.
Highway Star.
