1
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,541
Hey! Get up, Dante!

2
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,208
What time is it?

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,916
My deepest apologies for being

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,666
so late to our
little get-together.

5
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,791
I'm afraid that our client's
train broke down along the way.

6
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:46,791
Anthony...

7
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,375
Huh?

8
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,541
It's me. I'm Earnest.

9
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,416
Don't say you don't remember me.

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,166
How 'bout you tell
me how it's possible

11
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,833
you remember someone
you've never met before...

12
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,458
Just the way you speak...

13
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,458
I'd know that cranky
attitude anywhere.

14
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,958
There's no doubt about it.

15
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,458
Hmm?

16
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,666
I can understand why you'd
rather not remember all of that.

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,041
That was a terrible event...

18
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,416
But at last. At long last,

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,458
I can clear you and
your mother's names!

20
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,458
I found irrefutable evidence!

21
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,583
That it was all
caused by a demon!

22
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:21,208
There's no doubt, Dante.
You gotta believe me.

23
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,250
There you go.

24
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,333
Really... What is
all this about?

25
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,625
You were late, and then what
you brought wasn't a job...

26
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,916
And tell me. What the heck
was that guy talking about?

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,625
I thought you'd be interested.

28
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:26,791
Well, when he's saying a
bunch of stuff like that...

29
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,708
Twenty years ago, in a small
port town called Morris Island,

30
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,541
there was a fire that
wiped out the whole town.

31
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,541
The majority of the
townspeople died in the fire,

32
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,916
leaving only a few survivors.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,166
But afterwards,

34
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,208
some of the survivors
gave testimonials saying

35
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,500
that a demon had attacked the
town before the fire broke out.

36
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,875
They investigated.

37
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,708
Talked to eyewitnesses
who swore they saw it.

38
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,166
And none of these
people's statements

39
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,333
contradicted each other.
Everything checked out.

40
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,333
But nobody would
believe their stories.

41
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,125
I suppose not...

42
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,875
That guy who was here was
one of those survivors.

43
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,333
As was this "Anthony" character?

44
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,833
And his mother lived
through it too.

45
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,416
What was the whole "clearing
their names" thing about?

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,000
All the people in
Morris Island said that

47
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,000
Anthony's mother was
somehow responsible

48
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,333
for setting that fire.

49
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,250
Needless to say, they
weren't very nice to mom.

50
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,958
So, what ended up
happening to their mother?

51
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,333
She took young Tony and
they fled from the town.

52
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:28,375
And so this guy seems to
think I was this... Anthony?

53
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,666
Maybe you are.

54
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,208
Ridiculous.

55
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,500
What would make you think that
I could be this guy anyway?

56
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,333
Got a call the other day.

57
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,958
Someone saying "I want you
to arrange a meeting for me

58
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,583
with Anthony the Devil Hunter."

59
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:45,208
And you're the only devil
hunter that I know around here.

60
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:54,750
Dante, you sure the name Anthony
doesn't ring any bells for you?

61
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,625
Welcome home, Anthony, old pal.

62
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,291
Your buddy Morrison called me up
and told me you were coming.

63
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,125
I'm glad you've come back
to us at last, Anthony.

64
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,250
You can think that, but that's
not what I'm doing here.

65
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,583
Yeah, I know that.

66
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,208
But I'm still so glad that...
you've come back here.

67
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,375
Come on, it's this way.

68
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:40,291
I've said it before and I'll
say it again. I'm not Anthony.

69
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,666
I can understand wanting to keep
your name on the down-low here.

70
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,833
But you don't have
anything to worry about.

71
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,291
There aren't many
left here that know

72
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,166
what happened 20 years ago.

73
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,416
So just relax, will ya?

74
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,166
No one around here remembers

75
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,041
so that I get treated
as an eccentric...

76
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,625
because I wanna clarify
what really happened.

77
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,916
I don't care one
way or the other.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,625
Who was it?

79
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,958
Huh?

80
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,125
So tell me, who's the one
who told you about me?

81
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,333
Very few people know what
it is that I actually do.

82
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,416
Oh... You mean about
being a demon hunter?

83
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,250
I just happened to hear about
it in one of the circus tents.

84
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,875
All right, take me
to that circus tent.

85
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,416
Huh?

86
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,875
Okay, then.

87
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,208
Of course, it's you.

88
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,083
Is this the game
you want to play?

89
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,958
Why... would you
pull a gun here?

90
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,583
Just saying a little "hello."

91
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,708
Man you've really
got some attitude.

92
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,541
What happened?

93
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,750
Listen Anthony, it looks like
the circus is on holiday today.

94
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's get outta here.

95
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,541
I know that our teacher...

96
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,125
Our teacher will be
so happy to see you.

97
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,666
Your teacher?

98
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,666
If you wanna play,
you come looking for me.

99
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,083
Ms. Margaret.

100
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,666
I knew you'd be happy
to see Anthony again.

101
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,791
Anthony!

102
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,291
Sorry to disappoint you, lady.

103
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,166
This guy's just calling me that.

104
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,333
It seems like Anthony
doesn't want anybody to know

105
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,250
who he really is.

106
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,041
Well can you really blame him?

107
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,291
So Anthony, how is
your mother doing?

108
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,958
She's dead. She's been
dead for a long time.

109
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,916
Really? Sad to hear that.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,416
At that time, I wished I
could have helped your mother

111
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,875
through some suffering and
sadness that she endured.

112
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,541
She was so
despondent in the end.

113
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,125
Ms. Margaret. I think
you should know right now

114
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,916
Anthony's working
as a demon hunter.

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,208
I see. You've really come
a long way, haven't you?

116
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,250
Good for you.

117
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,708
Ms. Margaret,
you think it's okay

118
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,625
if we tell Anthony
right now, don't you?

119
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,625
Of course, that's why we had
him come here, after all, Tim.

120
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,416
We want to atone for our sins

121
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,875
of having made your
mother suffer so much.

122
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,000
We've lived with it
for too long now.

123
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,416
What the hell are
you talking about?

124
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,083
I told you all this before.

125
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,583
That I finally found the
evidence we've been looking for!

126
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,416
That the destruction of the
town wasn't caused by a person!

127
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,125
It was all caused by a demon!

128
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,541
Ruins?

129
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,208
Yes.

130
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,291
You're not planning to summon

131
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:46,083
the demon from the
ruins, are you?

132
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,583
You're good. You see through
my whole plan, don't you?

133
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,291
So, did your buddy
in the circus tent

134
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,458
happen to tell you
about that too?

135
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,250
The hidden meaning
of the town ruins...

136
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,666
How some people are able
to summon the demon there...

137
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,333
The trustworthy guy who gave
you the idea that I'm Tony.

138
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,333
He told you everything.

139
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,791
What exactly
is wrong with that?

140
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,333
I mean I really did get to
see you, after all Anthony.

141
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,208
Do you know how
long I've waited?

142
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,875
Don't you see the
important thing is

143
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,166
clearing your and
your mother's names?!

144
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,666
Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

145
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,916
Well, this celebratory
toast's a little delayed,

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,208
but here's to seeing
you again Anthony.

147
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,708
Oh, Earnest,
you're back already?

148
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,958
Welcome home.

149
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,583
Let me introduce you.
This is my wife, Elise.

150
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,083
He's a lot bigger than you made
him out to be in your stories.

151
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,666
Well, of course he is, honey.

152
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,250
Every story I've ever told you

153
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,916
is from when me and
Anthony were just little kids.

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,125
Time waits for no one.

155
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,375
Oh, I guess you're right. Sorry.

156
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,458
Oh, and I'll start
preparing dinner.

157
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,000
You don't have to
do that right now.

158
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,791
You just got back from work.
Stay and have a drink with us.

159
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,875
But, darling...

160
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,291
Why don't you just
slow down, relax,

161
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,166
and have a little chat
with Anthony, okay?

162
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,875
I'm so sorry.

163
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,250
This is the first time
Earnest has ever

164
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,291
introduced me to one of
his close friends...

165
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,416
Oh you don't have to worry
too much about me, lady.

166
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,083
I'm used to the idea
of being alone.

167
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,916
Everyone in this town says
that Earnest is eccentric.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,583
Even his students
call him strange.

169
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,083
Even after all
the work he's done

170
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,708
in this community trying
to emulate Ms. Margaret

171
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,000
and become one of the town's
most respected teachers.

172
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,458
So how about you tell me
what you think, Elise?

173
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,791
Me, I wish he would just forget

174
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,250
the horrors of his
past, that's all.

175
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,125
So, tell him that.

176
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,041
I have... I don't
know how many times.

177
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,958
The truth is, even he was
on the verge of giving up...

178
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,875
Ms. Margaret has
fallen sick and all...

179
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,416
But then one day he
came home ecstatic,

180
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,041
saying that he could
clear up that event

181
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,416
that happened 20 years ago

182
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,833
and that he would be
able to meet you...

183
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,458
In his mind, you are
something special.

184
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:17,333
He was always saying "Tony is
the most wonderful guy"...

185
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,916
Once he gets to
talking about you,

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,375
he could go on all night long
and still have more to tell...

187
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,375
I know everything there
is to know about you.

188
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:29,416
Oh, wait. There is one thing
I don't know about you.

189
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,750
It's probably none
of my business.

190
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,500
And really I don't
mean to pry, Anthony.

191
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,208
But if you could just
tell me about...

192
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,875
...the promise you two made...

193
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,500
--A Promise?
--Yes.

194
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,375
He says "There's no way I can
break a promise with Anthony,"

195
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,666
so the only thing he
won't tell me even now

196
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,125
is the location of that treasure
box you two buried together.

197
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,750
It's probably hidden somewhere
right in front of your eyes.

198
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,833
You know how kids think...

199
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:05,000
So you really aren't...
You're not him, are you?

200
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,083
Do me a favor...

201
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,500
Even if it's just while
you're here in town...

202
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,375
Please just pretend
to be Anthony.

203
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,500
L-Long time, no see!

204
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,250
I went to the trouble to
see you at the circus

205
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,083
in the afternoon... but your
manners are sadly lacking.

206
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,833
I thought about
saying something,

207
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,541
but by then you were gone.

208
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,250
What could I do?

209
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,625
Well, shall we get
right down to business

210
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,833
and pick up where we left off?

211
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,458
Easy, easy, easy...
Hold your horses...

212
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,750
I did this for your benefit.

213
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,250
That old woman and young boy

214
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,250
have been snooping
around the ruins...

215
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,958
I thought, "Boy,
this is dangerous,

216
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,083
they should be very careful!"

217
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,541
So I nicely had the
shrimp call you over.

218
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,083
You understand?

219
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,291
So if you've got the motivation,
why not just take care of

220
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:27,541
that dangerous demon
at the ruins yourself?

221
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,250
That's crazy talk!

222
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:33,208
I try to make it a point to
only fight poor weaklings.

223
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,833
If this doesn't
concern you at all,

224
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,083
you could've just not come.

225
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,250
I just wanted to see your
ugly face one last time!

226
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,541
You're so scary...

227
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,958
In the end, you were drawn here

228
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,541
by the smell of a devil,
weren't you?

229
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,250
Tony, you sure are an
early riser, aren't you?

230
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,708
I'll put some coffee on.

231
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:12,708
Don't do it. Don't try
to summon that demon.

232
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,333
What are you saying?

233
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,875
Tell me. What are
you planning to do

234
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,416
if you are actually
able to summon the demon?

235
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,125
If humans were capable
of defeating them,

236
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,291
that tragedy that
happened 20 years ago

237
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,625
never would have happened.

238
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,375
Or have you been relying
on me from the beginning?

239
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,875
I have no intention of
asking for your help, Anthony.

240
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,458
Don't play tougher than you are.

241
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,291
I can lower my fees
for you if need be.

242
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't worry about it. I'm ready.

243
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,875
That thing won't even
serve as a security blanket.

244
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,958
Does Elise have any idea
what you're planning to do?

245
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,708
This has nothing to do with her.

246
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,666
You have to understand, Tony!

247
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,166
This problem concerns
me as well, man!

248
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,208
That's Anthony, isn't it?

249
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,291
How do you know?

250
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,250
You were just here yesterday.

251
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,833
You came alone today?

252
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,083
He's at school.

253
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,791
I see...

254
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,625
Tell me where those ruins are.

255
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,458
Pardon?

256
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,125
Earnest is planning
on summoning that demon.

257
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,166
He wants to clear you
and your mother's names

258
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,708
of the accused crime.

259
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,500
No, you're wrong.

260
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,083
Anthony!

261
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,375
Margaret, I'm not Anthony.

262
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,625
When I was a little kid,

263
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,666
there were times when I
used to go by that name.

264
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,583
But I am not the Anthony you
and Earnest are looking for.

265
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,333
My name is Dante.

266
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,916
Don't worry. I'll keep
up this little charade.

267
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,375
I promise you. As long
as I'm in this town,

268
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,083
I'll play his friend Anthony.

269
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,666
You just tell me...
where I can find those ruins.

270
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,666
So, do we have a deal, Margaret?

271
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,791
Yavalk, Dhimli, Vashatoo...

272
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,291
Wanudune, Shekto,
Kaopoke, Umyu...

273
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,916
Yavalk, Ashme, Vashatoo...

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,791
Yavalk, Dhimli, Vashatoo...

275
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,708
Wanudune, Shek,
Dhimli, Vashatoo...

276
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,458
Wanudune, Shekto, Kaopoke...

277
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:35,666
[chanting continues]

278
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,750
I can't move!

279
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,916
Anthony?!

280
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,875
Oh my god... it's a demon.

281
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,708
Are you Dante?

282
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,208
What if I am?

283
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,250
Anthony?

284
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,666
As you're the son of Sparda,

285
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,333
I was wondering
what you'd look like.

286
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,291
You're just a kid.

287
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,166
So that means you'll
cut me some slack then?

288
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,000
Anthony... you're a hunter...

289
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,875
Go on!

290
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,166
I'm the one this bastard wants!

291
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:26,375
So you are! I'm here
for your blood, Dante!

292
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,125
Because the moment
I have your blood,

293
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:33,000
the blood of a man
born of human and demon,

294
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,708
I can stand lord
above the demon world!

295
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,750
20 years ago...

296
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,750
The reason that demon
attacked our town is that it...

297
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,791
He... He wanted you. Oh...

298
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,166
Where's the demon?!

299
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,583
It's all right now.
There are no demons.

300
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,458
I saw one, Elise!

301
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,750
How did I wind up
in the hospital?

302
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:30,916
You collapsed at the ruins,
and so Dante brought you here.

303
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,458
Dante?! Dante?!
Tell me where he is, Elise!

304
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,375
He just left...

305
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,708
Wait! You demon!

306
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,208
Stop it, Earnest!

307
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,625
He's not who you think.
He's not Anthony!

308
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,541
Bastard!

309
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,041
If you hadn't been here,

310
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,833
none of the people in this
god damn town would have died!

311
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,958
It's all your
fault, you murderer!

312
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,916
That demon destroyed
this town looking for you,

313
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,958
you son of a bitch!

314
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,625
Oh, Earnest...

315
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,000
You deceived me
and Ms. Margaret!

316
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,458
I'll never forgive you!

317
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,041
Neither will those who died!
Do you hear me?!

318
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,708
Don't you ever come
back here again!

319
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:11,125
If you ever do,
I'll kill you for sure!

320
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,166
I saw it all.

321
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,041
Humans really are such selfish

322
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,458
self-centered little
creatures aren't they?

323
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,083
They're more horrid than demons.

324
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,791
If you hadn't been there,
that town would be getting

325
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,041
devoured by demons
right about now

326
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,958
and there would be
an ocean of blood.

327
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,125
What are you trying to do?

328
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,958
Something that'll be
of use to you, Dante.

329
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,625
I don't mind gambling.

330
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,750
For one thing, the tension of
those win-or-lose situations

331
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,666
is similar in some ways
to the feeling I get

332
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,875
when I hunt demons.

333
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,958
In the end, I guess
I just can't be satisfied

334
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,041
with a "normal life."

335
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:26,125
But a person should never
do anything excessively.

336
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:29,666
There's nothing more stupid
than gambling oneself into debt.

337
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,166
Even worse if you go as far
as to lose your own life...

338
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,000
Don't miss the next
mission. "Death Poker."
