1
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,541
If I miss my curfew...
father will yell at me again!

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,833
Ow...

3
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,666
Are you okay there?

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,125
Um... yeah...

5
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,458
I'm okay I think
I might have just

6
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,958
sprained it a little,
that's all...

7
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,125
Just stay still.

8
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:48,666
What...?

9
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,625
I want you to try standing up.

10
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,708
It doesn't hurt anymore...

11
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:54,708
That's good.

12
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,791
Ah, I can put my
shoes on myself...

13
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,750
There you go.

14
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:06,500
What did you do? Was that
some trick? Or magic?

15
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,625
Bye.

16
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,041
Please wait!

17
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,916
What's your name?

18
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,291
I'm Bradley.

19
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,833
Bradley...

20
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,000
Can we... meet again?

21
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,625
I'm so sorry, Brad!

22
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,666
Do you understand me Angelina?!

23
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,375
I forbid you to see
that man anymore!

24
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,333
Why!? Brad is
such a good person!

25
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,583
I don't care.
You are not to meet him!

26
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,666
And you'll stay in this room

27
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,833
until you promise
me that you won't!

28
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,458
This is for your own good.

29
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,875
I'm counting on you.

30
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,000
I understand, sir.

31
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,708
This darn thing!

32
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,583
Hey, keep it down...

33
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,125
You can mess around with
that broken TV all day...

34
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,666
But it's not like some genie's
gonna pop out and fix it for ya.

35
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,375
And today's is the
final episode...

36
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,958
Well, that's too bad...

37
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:29,250
Me, I'm bummed because my
nap's been interrupted...

38
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,625
Go and buy a new one now!

39
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,166
If I had the cash...

40
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,083
How in the world do you blow
through all your money so fast?!

41
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,500
I got that devil woman
that's taking all my money

42
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,916
and a tightfisted
bastard for an agent...

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,291
You can look for some
change in the couch if want.

44
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,416
Hey, who ya callin tightfisted?

45
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,708
You here with some more jobs

46
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,333
that won't make me
any more money?

47
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:53,041
Nope. You know me. I only
bring you the jobs that pay out.

48
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:57,000
On the condition that
they're done right.

49
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,416
Hey, Morrison...
Can you fix a TV?

50
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,416
A TV?

51
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,791
It's broken,

52
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,250
and today's the last episode
of "Bolero in Spring"!

53
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,000
You got your car
here today, Morrison?

54
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,541
Yeah.

55
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,916
I'll take the job if you let me
get some sleep in it on the way.

56
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,083
I've been losing sleep
due to that broken TV.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are you waitin'
for? Let's go.

58
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,500
I don't care where,

59
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,416
just as long as I don't have
to hear her whining anymore.

60
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,750
Good day, Miss.

61
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,333
You're not going to fix the TV,
Morrison? I need my fix.

62
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,000
You can have Dante buy you one

63
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,791
with the money he
makes from this job.

64
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,208
Wait, Morrison!

65
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,750
That won't be in time
for the last episode

66
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,833
of "Bolero in Spring"!

67
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,166
Hey! You jerks!

68
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,041
Come back here!

69
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,833
Miss, your father wanted me to
tell you your meal is ready.

70
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,500
I don't want anything to eat...

71
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,083
Please Miss...
If you don't eat something

72
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,541
I'm going to be in
trouble with your father.

73
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,791
This is a pretty swank pad.

74
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,750
What kind of racket does he run
to afford something like this?

75
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,083
He's the mayor of Capulet
City, so try to be nice.

76
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,500
Gentlemen!

77
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,000
Hello, sorry I'm late.

78
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,416
That meeting dragged out longer
than I thought it would...

79
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,083
Thanks you so much for coming.

80
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,375
I'm Mike Hagel.

81
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,416
I'm Morrison.

82
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,166
Nice to meet you.

83
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,875
Look, counselor, how about
we all cut the formalities

84
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,666
and get down to business
before I fall asleep again?

85
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,541
That's him?

86
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,625
You got my word. He's good...

87
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,750
Even if he is a little
rough around the edges...

88
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,583
I want you... to kill this man.

89
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,041
Please...

90
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,916
Kill him.

91
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:13,833
I've got a daughter,
my only child... Angelina.

92
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,041
My wife died a long
time ago, and since then

93
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,875
I've raised my little
darling all on my own.

94
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,166
My daughter means
everything to me.

95
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,708
And this Brad
guy is planning on

96
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,250
taking my daughter away
from this town and from me!

97
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,125
I won't allow this
worthless drifter to just

98
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,833
run off with my daughter
because he feels like it.

99
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,166
Surely you gentlemen
can understand that?

100
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,916
I mean, it's my only child.
My baby girl.

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,375
And so... you want to kill him?

102
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,208
Well that sure makes
for a grand story...

103
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,708
Turn it into a soap opera
and Patty would love it.

104
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,583
I smell ratings.

105
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,666
Um... Um, Miss...

106
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,083
You know the rules.

107
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,875
I should at least be able
to use the washroom alone.

108
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,375
Haven't you heard that
there's some killer

109
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,375
running around loose
in Capulet City?

110
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,791
It's been all over in the news.

111
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,708
Had your head under
a rock or something?

112
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,916
My TV's broken, remember?

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,583
Oh yeah, I forgot.

114
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,083
At any rate,

115
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,250
there's been a lot of ugly
little incidents around here.

116
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,791
This is it.

117
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,916
These murders are so hideous.
So gruesome there are even

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,666
some people saying that
the culprit isn't human.

119
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,416
So he's not human?

120
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,083
These random assaults
started happening

121
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,833
right around the time 
this Brad guy showed up.

122
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,208
So you're saying...
that this "Brad"

123
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,458
isn't just a murderer,
but a devil in disguise?

124
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,333
That's a little hard to
swallow. I don't buy it.

125
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,541
I saw it with my own eyes.

126
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,375
There's no doubt about it.
He's a demon!

127
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,541
This job's right up your alley,
don't you think, Dante?

128
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,666
I'm begging you!
Kill this Brad!

129
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,416
Brad...

130
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,625
Brad!

131
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:50,166
Please! Let's run
away together! Please.

132
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,625
What's wrong with you, darling?

133
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,375
Try to calm yourself down
and tell me what's going on.

134
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,791
Brad... Listen to me...

135
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,916
I think my father has hired
someone... to kill you!

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,666
To kill me?

137
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,791
But why would he...
try to kill me?

138
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,833
Because of your strange power.
My father thinks you're a devil!

139
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,416
He must have seen you do
something. I don't know what.

140
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,875
Does he now?

141
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,291
We can run away.
Let's leave here!

142
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,583
My dear Angelina...

143
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,375
I'm sorry, but I can't let you
get wrapped up in all of this.

144
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,916
But I...

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,166
I don't you to worry about me
in the slightest, Angelina.

146
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,833
I'm going to be alright.
I promise you.

147
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,125
Someday your father
will understand too...

148
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,791
But, Brad!

149
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,458
You should be going home now.
I'm glad I could see you.

150
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,416
Mind if I grab a seat?

151
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,458
Huh?

152
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,458
Yeah, I don't mind.
Go right ahead.

153
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,583
I'll take a beer...
...and a pizza.

154
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,791
Any kind... As long as it
doesn't have any olives.

155
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,208
Go about your reading.
Don't mind me at all.

156
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,625
Oh, thanks... I believe I will.

157
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,541
What? You still can't
find Angelina!

158
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,750
Don't even think about
coming back here until you do!

159
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,458
Is she at that greasy
bastard's place again?

160
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,041
I offer you my deepest
apologies, Sir.

161
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:05,750
This is all because I took
my eyes off her. Please--

162
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,958
Miss, you're back!

163
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,500
Father I...

164
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,708
Do you understand me?!

165
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,791
From now on your meals
will brought to your room,

166
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,333
and you'll be watched
everywhere you go!

167
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,750
Oh... my Brad...

168
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,791
What's this book
you're all into?

169
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,625
It's a romance novel actually.

170
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,583
Hmmm... any good?

171
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,333
Yeah, really good.

172
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,916
One person's love for
another is a wonderful thing.

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,500
True love is a thing of beauty!

174
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,208
You find that strange?

175
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,125
No.

176
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,666
One beer.

177
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,625
Well it sure took you long
enough to get me just a beer...

178
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,875
And my pizza?

179
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,333
They're making it now.

180
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,833
Damn...

181
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,250
Drink up.

182
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,750
Uh, yeah... To you...

183
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,791
By the way, you seem
kind of like a drifter...

184
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,916
Where you from?

185
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,583
Okay. You don't have to
answer if you don't want to.

186
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,833
Well, I'm going to
be on my way now.

187
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,541
Here's your pizza.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

188
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,708
Hey, there's olives
on this thing...

189
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,708
Of course there are.

190
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,666
Dammit.

191
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,625
Everyone has been saying that
the gate will open tonight!

192
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,708
Will it, now?

193
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,625
But to leave the
living world like this

194
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,625
would kind of be a shame...

195
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,041
So I guess it's you then...

196
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,333
who's responsible for
that string of murders?

197
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,833
I'm very fond...

198
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,291
of the warm and tasty
blood of the living ones...

199
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,791
Who did that!?

200
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,583
Did you follow me?

201
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,583
Eating a large pizza
in five minutes...

202
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,458
That's a new personal
record for me.

203
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,041
Don't you mess with me!

204
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,750
That's some handshake
ya got there.

205
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,875
You're as strong as I'd heard.

206
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,750
That almost makes it sound
like you know all about me.

207
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,583
I've been in the living world
for over a month now.

208
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,291
I've heard the rumors about
Dante, "The Devil Hunter."

209
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,458
So I guess I can take
that as a confession

210
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,125
that you're not human, right?

211
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,041
Yes.

212
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,375
Well, then I guess
you've got no objections.

213
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,375
No. And I tell you the truth,

214
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,041
I have no intention
of running away.

215
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,375
But there is one thing that
I would like to ask of you.

216
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,416
What's that?

217
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,625
I heard that you're
a half-breed...

218
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,541
Born from the union
of a human and a demon.

219
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,125
If that's so, can you tell me...
Were your parents in love?

220
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,291
Was there a love between
human and demon?

221
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,875
Who knows? You always hear
stories about the lovers.

222
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,500
They look like they were
made for each other,

223
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,500
but inside their hearts
are cold as ice.

224
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,000
That's not what I--

225
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,666
But I think a lot of those
couples truly loved each other.

226
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,916
Deep inside their hearts.

227
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,625
You think so?

228
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,750
Was that all you wanted to say?

229
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,250
Yeah.

230
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,000
I almost thought you
were gonna try to pull

231
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,833
a surprise attack on me...

232
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,791
I know I can't defeat you.

233
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,750
You're kind of a wimp for
being a demon you know that?

234
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,208
Even though I am a demon...

235
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,125
there's no way I could
vanquish an opponent like you.

236
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,083
Besides... my role here is
finished. I'll be leaving.

237
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,833
What do you mean by that?

238
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,166
Tonight, my master will arrive.

239
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,375
He will come from the demon
world into this plane.

240
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,583
I was summoned by a
human to prepare the way.

241
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,791
I have done his bidding
my job is over now.

242
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,625
And why are you telling
me this exactly?

243
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,958
Maybe because...

244
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,250
I want you to put
an end to all this...

245
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,333
My master is greedy...

246
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,875
I'm sure that he will try
to devour this entire city.

247
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,916
That café with the
wonderful coffee...

248
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,458
And the hill with
such a beautiful view

249
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,583
of the setting sun...

250
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,291
Everything...

251
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,583
And Angelina too?

252
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,041
What should I do?
I don't want to lose her...

253
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,958
She was so kind to me.

254
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,125
I've always been treated so
cruelly in the demon world...

255
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,458
But she'd smile at me...

256
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,250
And I don't want to think
about the possibility

257
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,333
of her being devoured
by my master...

258
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,500
But I'm... I'm just one demon...

259
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,041
I don't have the power
to defy my master...

260
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:23,375
It's true, you're pretty
pathetic... for a demon.

261
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,333
But if you can love
Angelina that much,

262
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,375
you'll be able to
live as a human.

263
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,208
A... human? You mean it?

264
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,166
Get up and let's go.

265
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,375
Got a little welcome for your
friend when he comes to town.

266
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,833
Father? Father, what's happend?!

267
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,875
Father!

268
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,833
Father!

269
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,750
Father?!

270
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,208
Father!

271
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,708
Father! Father!

272
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,000
Father!

273
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,208
Hang on, Father!

274
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,666
Don't move.

275
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,916
If you had just stayed in
your room like a good girl,

276
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,833
you could have died
without having to feel fear.

277
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,250
You... Why would you do this?

278
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,875
Soon the powerful
demon will be summoned

279
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:26,041
to this city by the
ritual I have performed.

280
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,458
Together we shall
destroy this world!

281
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,125
Dante!

282
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,166
Sorry. I guess I knocked
a little too hard...

283
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,750
I had a bad
feeling about you

284
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,666
from the moment I saw
you with the mayor.

285
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,625
But, you're too late I'm afraid!

286
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,125
Angelina!

287
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,333
Brad!

288
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,416
Mr. Mayor! Hold on!

289
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,750
What are you doing?!

290
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,833
Are you actually planning
to betray Belphagor?!

291
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,916
You're already too late!

292
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,416
The great Belphagor will
be here any moment now.

293
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm sure it must have been
a long, hard trip for ya...

294
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,791
It's too bad entry to
this world is off limits

295
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,000
for the likes of you.

296
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,875
So, I just gonna have
to ask you to leave!

297
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,708
Angelina!

298
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,291
Father!

299
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,625
What is this...?

300
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,416
Don't try to speak.
Just lie still, Father.

301
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,666
Brad, can you please help him?

302
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,083
I've never tried it on a
wound as serious as this.

303
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,250
I'll do everything I can though.

304
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:42,416
What... do you think you're
doing to me... you demon...

305
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,416
Do you really think...
that by doing this for me...

306
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,166
I'm going to allow you...
to see... my daughter?

307
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,958
Father!

308
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,791
Don't worry yourself.

309
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,875
That is not what I'm
concerned about, sir.

310
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,208
No, I'm doing this
simply because

311
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,291
I don't want to
see Angelina sad...

312
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,958
Sorry Mr. Mayor,

313
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,750
But it doesn't look
like I'm going to be able

314
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,083
to grant your request.

315
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,416
Brad understands love.

316
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,875
He's gonna make it just
fine as a human being.

317
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,458
And the only things I personally
choose to exterminate

318
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,583
are demons.

319
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,166
Hey Morrison, didn't
you get it fixed yet...?

320
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,833
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

321
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,791
How much longer am I
going to have to wait!?

322
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,875
Just wait a little bit longer,
okay? I've almost got it here.

323
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,708
By the way, I've been
meaning to tell you, Dante...

324
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,375
It's a nice story
about how those two

325
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,625
finally got her dad's approval.

326
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,458
But I don't see how your
passing up the money

327
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,041
should result in
my fixing this TV...

328
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,708
My days of TV repair
are long gone.

329
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,416
Less talking and more fixing!

330
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,125
My afternoon soap
opera's about to start!

331
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,750
You fixed it!

332
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:00,875
I'll just deduct my repair
fees from your next payment.

333
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:03,625
Whatever...

334
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,166
Oh, for the love of...

335
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,625
At this rate you'll never
get your debt paid off,

336
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,375
no matter how many good
jobs I bring you...

337
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,750
But you seem happy, Dante...

338
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,666
Even though you usually
do nothing but complain

339
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,416
when you don't get your money...

340
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,791
You complain a lot!

341
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:25,125
Every now and then there
are days like this...

342
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:28,916
I sure hope those two
will be happy, don't you?

343
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:13,250
I've always had pretty
bad luck with women...

344
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,083
I'd be lucky if
they'd just beat me up.

345
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,875
But they also do things like
stick swords in my stomach,

346
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,916
and shoot me in the forehead...

347
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,833
If I wasn't who I am,
I'd probably be dead.

348
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:26,875
Damn... To make matters worse,

349
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,750
the women that do those
things are the very women

350
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,541
that I can't seem to
boot out of my life.

351
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,583
I wonder when my luck
with women will improve...

352
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,916
Next Mission: "Rolling Thunder."
