1
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,916
Wow! This is amazing.

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,291
You would never
know we're on a ship.

3
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,708
This is the renowned official
casino ship of Port Verlington.

4
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,666
Along with the casino, there
are restaurants, a pool bar,

5
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,583
a health spa and everything
else you can ever want.

6
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,875
All those people
are all gamblers?

7
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,750
Oh, no... Most of them
are just moderately rich

8
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,375
with too much free time
and looking to have

9
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,208
a night of dreams
and excitement.

10
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:10,166
By the way, where is Dante?
I don't see him anywhere.

11
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,666
This way.

12
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,625
Two pairs.

13
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,958
My apologies, but I
believe this hand is mine.

14
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,000
Three of a kind.

15
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,666
Dammit...

16
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,291
Well, no big deal...

17
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,791
This game's just
getting underway.

18
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,000
The fun's just beginning.

19
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,375
Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

20
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,333
The longer one gambles, the
more interesting it becomes...

21
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,958
The same as a kiss.

22
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,500
If you're able to beat me,
I'll give you a nice, long kiss,

23
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,291
the likes of which
you've never experienced.

24
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,333
Now that's something
to look forward to.

25
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,916
I'd better be careful not to
lose the clothes off my back!

26
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,416
The man who just
won is Gold-Arm Joe,

27
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,875
said to have a "Golden Arm."

28
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,458
The woman across the
table is also well known.

29
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,000
They say that she has
the luck of a goddess.

30
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,291
She's known as "Lucky Amanda."

31
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,958
The older gentleman next
to her is "Santa Claus,"

32
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,416
a poker ace that they say
can read people's thoughts.

33
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,333
All these people are
trying to act so refined,

34
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,833
but their eyes are
burning with greed.

35
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,083
Alright, lets play.

36
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,208
Please... Save my husband, Paul.

37
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,958
He likes to gamble?

38
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,250
Yes, he was a
straight-and-narrow man

39
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,250
before we got married...

40
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,083
But then it's like he
became a different person

41
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,708
all of a sudden, and got
addicted to gambling.

42
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,250
Gambling is like a sickness.

43
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,291
But there's one big difference
between a gambling addiction

44
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,833
and getting a common cold.

45
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,083
There is no medicine
they've found yet

46
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,583
to cure yourself of it.

47
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,583
You might as well
just give up on him.

48
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,708
Please! If my husband goes on
like this, he could be killed!

49
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,875
Come on... Hey, don't
be so cold, Dante.

50
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,458
Huh?

51
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,291
You know, you should always be
nice to the ladies. Or try to.

52
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,708
I know it may not sound like it,

53
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,916
but this job could
be up your alley.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,125
Huh?

55
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,458
Next, please.

56
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,791
Pass.

57
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,833
R-Raise. I'll raise you 500.

58
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,000
Fold.

59
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,208
I'm dropping out too.

60
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,833
I'll call.

61
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,333
Call.

62
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,583
Three of a kind.

63
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,125
Nothing.

64
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,875
Sorry kids, full house.

65
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,166
Well, if the night
keeps up like this,

66
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,250
I'll be going home with
a bag full of money again!

67
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,041
I see, so that's why
you're "Santa Claus."

68
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,208
It's a clever nickname.

69
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,791
Thank you. When tonight's
game is over,

70
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,000
why not let me treat
you to breakfast.

71
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,041
Sure. That is, as long as
you're not thrown out by then

72
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,000
for being flat broke.

73
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,916
We have quite a collection of
inflated egos here, don't we...

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,250
By the way,

75
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,791
have any of you heard of
a gambler known as "King"?

76
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,750
Yes, one hears about him
quite a lot as of late.

77
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,208
Apparently he's supposed
to be a gambler from hell

78
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,000
who takes the lives
of his opponents.

79
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,208
Hmph! Nothing but silly rumors!

80
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,291
They most definitely are.

81
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,916
However, it is true that a
certain number of gamblers

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,666
have died after losing to
this mysterious individual.

83
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,833
Some say he is a white
bearded, elderly man.

84
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,291
Others say "King" is a
charming, beautiful woman.

85
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,000
But the truth is that
no one knows for sure

86
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,333
what he OR she looks like.

87
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,750
But still if such a
person actually exists,

88
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,750
what would you give
to play a hand or two

89
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:37,083
with this "remarkable
competitor"? Hmm?

90
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,416
King?

91
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,791
Yes. It's said he's a
gambler who brings death.

92
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,583
There have been a number
of well-known gamblers

93
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,375
who've recently gone missing.
The only common thread is...

94
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,625
They all went out to play cards,
and then they never came back.

95
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,916
Before long there were
rumors all over the city

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,916
with people saying that
anyone that plays this "King"

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
will end up dead.

98
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,750
So, this "King"
could be a demon.

99
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,208
Is that what you're
saying, Morrison?

100
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,166
If that's true, I guess I
gotta gamble with the demon.

101
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,791
You'd probably be better
off not doing that.

102
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,416
Do you even remember how much
money you owe me right now?

103
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,291
I mean, you totally
suck at gambling.

104
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,333
Because I'm nice to
the women when I play.

105
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,958
Hey Dante, when are
you gonna pay out

106
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,583
for our game you
lost to me earlier?

107
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:26,083
I'm nice to the
women and children.

108
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,291
But how do I find a guy

109
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,083
when I don't even know
what he looks like?

110
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,000
If I just play cards wherever,
this it'll take forever.

111
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,791
And infinite amount of money.

112
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,000
Shut your face.

113
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,250
A letter?

114
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,291
It's an invitation to
that luxury cruise ship

115
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,875
turned casino operating
in the next town over.

116
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,791
It was sent by "King."

117
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,000
Since he went to the
trouble to invite us,

118
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,083
it would be bad
form not to accept.

119
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,708
And since you'll
be going anyhow,

120
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,583
you can grant that
woman's request.

121
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,500
You did say you're nice to women
and children, didn't you?

122
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,583
Damn.

123
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,083
I don't know who
this "King" guy is,

124
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,208
but he seems like one
stuck up son of a bitch.

125
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,250
That is, if anyone's asking me.

126
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,458
But it's interesting.

127
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:11,083
If "King" is really here
among us... and I beat him...

128
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,500
my reputation will
soar even higher.

129
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,583
Yeah, if King is among us,

130
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,500
I have a feeling we'll
all eventually find out.

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,416
3,000.

132
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,333
Fold. I'm out.

133
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,000
I fold as well.

134
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,541
I don't have enough chips.

135
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,041
Well then,

136
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,791
I guess you'll just have to
sit there and watch quietly.

137
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,625
I'll raise...
I'll raise 5,000.

138
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,833
Ohhh! The game is on!

139
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,583
Hey, you.

140
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,041
You're shaking like a leaf.

141
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't you think it'd be
better for you to go home,

142
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,625
before you make
your pretty wife cry?

143
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,833
Leave me alone! Just be quiet!
Let's just see your hand.

144
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,125
He's holding three of a kind...

145
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,458
His face down card could
give him a full house...

146
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,166
Just to be safe...

147
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,250
Alright, let's play. I'm all in.

148
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, it's time
for a showdown then.

149
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,833
Full house!

150
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,916
F-Four of... a kind!

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,208
I... I did it... I won! I won!

152
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,166
Th-That's not...

153
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,833
Sir?

154
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,750
He's dead...

155
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,500
Could this possibly
mean that you're "King"?

156
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,583
N-No!

157
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,041
What are you saying?
I'm... I'm...

158
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,666
Just take it easy...
Let's take a deep breath.

159
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,958
Miss, call the person in charge

160
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,875
and I'd like a hot
cappuccino, please.

161
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,833
Right away, sir.

162
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,375
Wherever King appears,

163
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,791
that place is governed
by Death's rules.

164
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,583
Maybe the rumors are true.

165
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,500
I wonder... If you're scared,

166
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,708
you should just head home,
get in bed, and go to sleep.

167
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,208
Well, aren't we arrogant...
Maybe you're "King"?

168
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,916
Maybe I am. But we'll
know the truth soon enough

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,541
and I bet the reveal will
be the most fun of the night.

170
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,125
You can have your fun,

171
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,916
but don't you think you're the
most likely to go broke next?

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,708
The real pleasure of gambling is
turning the tables completely

173
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,250
right in the final
moments of the game.

174
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,583
What are you talking about?!

175
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,083
You're losing just like
we predicted, aren't you?

176
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,500
You're totally
hopeless without me.

177
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,625
I'll take over from here.

178
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,791
Hey, Patty!

179
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,500
Interesting... It's best to
teach them just how cruel

180
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,166
the world can be while
they're still young.

181
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,125
What are you...

182
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,333
I didn't expect to see you here.

183
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,000
I heard there was a big
poker tournament on this ship,

184
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,625
and... and I just had to come.

185
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,000
Are you that worried?
I'm jealous.

186
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,500
It's OK. Your husband
hasn't lost anything.

187
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,458
You'd probably be
better off not doing that.

188
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,750
So you're not going to go
and see how he's doing?

189
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,250
No. It's not like I could
get him to stop anyway.

190
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,666
Alright then.

191
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,500
What? This child is
really playing for him?

192
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,625
This isn't a kid's game.

193
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,291
I'm not here for kids' games!

194
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,416
So you can lose the pompous
attitude until you beat me.

195
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,125
Deal the cards!

196
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,375
What the hell...
What's Patty doing here?

197
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,416
Well now that she's here,

198
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,833
there's nothing
we can do about it.

199
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,375
Shit...

200
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,708
So tell me, genius. Have you
figured out who this "King" is?

201
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,125
Not yet. I'd say
he's a clever one.

202
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,250
I guess the only thing
to do is keep winning.

203
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,208
Guess so...

204
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,958
But you know, it's a risky bet.

205
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,875
But that's what gambling's
all about, now isn't it?

206
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,041
Be careful.

207
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,625
Sure.

208
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:14,583
Come on, honey, make up your
mind. Are you in or are you out?

209
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:18,791
You seem to have aptitude,
but you've got a long way to go.

210
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,208
Time for a substitution.

211
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,541
Hey! What's going on?!
I was just getting warmed up!

212
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,250
This is my job.

213
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,208
Nice work, Patty.

214
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,833
I played it safe like you told
me, but these people are good.

215
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,625
Dante's going to
get eaten alive...

216
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,208
That I don't doubt at all.

217
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:38,458
But Dante's got a job to do, and
that's a game he never loses.

218
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,208
The only thing we can
do now sit around,

219
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,708
pray he succeeds, and
have a cup of coffee.

220
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,250
Fine then. But I'll take tea,

221
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,458
cause coffee's way
too bitter for me.

222
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,041
Okay, okay.

223
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,666
I fold.

224
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,000
Hmmm... Two pairs, eh?

225
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:01,333
She's the only one who
seems to have a decent hand.

226
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,041
With those cards, she could
have three of a kind...

227
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,875
If she does, I'm finished.

228
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:14,291
Ah, she always plays with her
hair when she's bluffing...

229
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,500
She's not holding three
of a kind. It's a bluff!

230
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,291
I'll raise 8,000 and call.

231
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,666
I fold.

232
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,833
I fold.

233
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,541
Very smart boys.

234
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:31,208
Hold on. I'll raise 15,000
and call. I'm all in.

235
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,291
Trying to bring me
down with a bluff?

236
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,708
I see right through
you, young lady.

237
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,791
Fine, it's on. I'm all in.

238
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,958
Aww, too bad.

239
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:47,708
Looks like I got you,
Grandpa. Three of a kind.

240
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,583
I win.

241
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:56,541
So you did get me... Looks like
senility is setting in for me.

242
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,250
Please excuse me.

243
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:02,416
The loser will silently take
his leave from the stage.

244
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,583
Now we know for sure.
Someone here is "King."

245
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,125
Let's continue the game.

246
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,708
Interesting... But I won't lose
out to anyone with my luck.

247
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,125
You watch, I'll
annihilate this "King."

248
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,958
It's just not normal.

249
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,000
Don't any of these people
think they can lose?

250
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,166
Aren't they scared of dying?

251
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,500
Straight flush... I win.

252
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,083
This can't be!

253
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,958
I am known as Lucky Amanda!

254
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:35,708
There's no way could
I lose! I don't lose...

255
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,791
That's another one. Now it's...

256
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,666
Yeah. This is the end.

257
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,875
Well now. I guess it comes
down to you and me then.

258
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,125
I didn't think you'd be
left standing this long...

259
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:52,000
If I beat you here,
that would make me King!

260
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,833
Well come on, deal the cards!

261
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,625
What's with these hands?

262
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,291
When this is all dealt,

263
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,833
both could be holding
a royal straight flush!

264
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,208
That's not...

265
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,750
All in.

266
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,750
You're still on
your fourth card.

267
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,541
How about we say that whatever
happens next, we showdown?

268
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,833
It looks like both of us have
got a final attack to launch.

269
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,375
Fine... So it's all or nothing.

270
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:38,000
I accept. But I'm afraid
I'm a little low on chips.

271
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,541
If I lose, I'll pay the
difference with my life.

272
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,375
Sound good?

273
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,750
That's a deal.

274
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,375
Now come on, let's have it.
Let's see the last card!

275
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,541
So, it's a showdown!

276
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,875
A king of hearts!
That's a royal straight flush!

277
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,458
And Dante?!

278
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,125
Royal straight flush.

279
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:23,208
When two players have
the same hand, spades win.

280
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,958
S-Sara... I'm sorry...

281
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:30,458
He did it! Dante won, Morrison!

282
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,083
Morrison?

283
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,333
There's nothing in this
world as interesting to me

284
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,166
as when people are gambling...

285
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,875
Especially when they're
betting their lives.

286
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,666
It's the greatest!

287
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,750
Dante, what are you doing?!

288
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:54,458
This isn't over yet. Lady,
the next game's against you.

289
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,041
The rules are simple.

290
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,500
Whoever gets a bullet through
the other's heart first, wins.

291
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,250
Got it?

292
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,083
Dante...

293
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,708
Dante!

294
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,625
Stop, Dante!

295
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,791
Dante! Why?! Why would
you shoot him, Lady?!

296
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,625
He's your friend, isn't he?!

297
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,458
Let go of me, Morrison! Let go!

298
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,083
Dante...

299
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:36,208
Congratulations. I suppose
that you are tonight's winner.

300
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,750
It's you...

301
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,333
So in the end you're shot and
killed by your own friend...

302
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,583
It makes for quite
a beautiful ending.

303
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:48,208
Stay back! So you're
the demon... this "King"?!

304
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,958
You're half right
and half wrong.

305
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,583
What do you mean by that?

306
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,291
It didn't matter
who played as King.

307
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,500
Whoever held an item into
which I bestowed my magic...

308
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,083
would be captivated by gambling

309
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,458
in exchange for
extraordinary luck.

310
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,041
And that person
would act as King.

311
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,333
I wish this man had won for me,

312
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,291
but maybe I was
hoping for too much.

313
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,291
So it was a trap
from the beginning?

314
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,916
Please don't fret!

315
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,458
Soon, you'll be
as dead as he is.

316
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,041
As will those two,

317
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,541
and all the passengers
on the ship!

318
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,166
Sorry to spoil your party...

319
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,333
But I've been waiting
for this moment...

320
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,750
The moment when you show your
face to brag about your victory.

321
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,958
Dante!

322
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,166
How did you...

323
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,750
You're wondering if
your magic failed on me?

324
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,000
No, it worked just fine.

325
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,708
To be honest I only figured out
what was going on by chance.

326
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,666
Patty?

327
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,875
A game, Dante.
Let's play a game...

328
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,916
Are you going to die, or am I?

329
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,625
Patty?!

330
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,250
Stop!

331
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,291
And that's how I figured it out.

332
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,458
The watch was the
"mechanism" of King.

333
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,250
You were using this
to turn regular people

334
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,458
into King and control
them weren't you?

335
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,083
So you just pretended to
be possessed by its magic?

336
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,125
No, I was entirely
possessed by it.

337
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,583
I knew it was the only
way to keep winning

338
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,208
and stay in the game to the end.

339
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,250
And ultimately I'd draw you out.

340
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,625
It was a gamble.

341
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,041
I avoided hitting your heart
as promised, didn't I?

342
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,208
Actually you grazed it a bit.

343
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,000
Damn...

344
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,375
I've got a lesson for you.

345
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,541
Successful gambling is
something you can't do

346
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,083
without an accomplice!

347
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,166
My, my, you're a tough one.

348
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,166
Okay then... How about
something like this?

349
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:11,833
Dante!

350
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,708
King of hearts.

351
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,166
Ace of spades.

352
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,041
I win.

353
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,833
So basically, it was
all part of your plan.

354
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,666
You letting yourself
be possessed,

355
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,000
then having Lady snap you out
of it if push came to shove?

356
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,541
Hey, I said I was
sorry already, didn't I?

357
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,416
Don't sweat the
small stuff, kid.

358
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,125
Come on, you guys.
Let's do this.

359
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,541
Sure are confident.

360
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,708
Must have some good cards there?

361
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,541
Hmmm... I'll pass this time.

362
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,791
I'll take three.

363
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:15,333
All right...
let's see who's got what.

364
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,875
A full house!
How do you like that?

365
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,333
Royal straight flush.

366
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,375
I win.

367
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,291
We'll just add your
losses to your debt.

368
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,833
Damn...

369
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,041
The hell with this.

370
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:13,416
My father betrayed demonkind,
and fought for mankind.

371
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,000
From the human perspective,
he's a legendary hero.

372
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,875
In the minds of the demons,

373
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,083
he's the perpetrator of
an unforgivable crime.

374
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,666
But... There may have
been some demons out there

375
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,208
who could understand
my father's thinking.

376
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,333
If there really is
such a demon out there,

377
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,583
I'd sure like to meet him.

378
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:37,000
Next Mission,
"The Last Promise."
