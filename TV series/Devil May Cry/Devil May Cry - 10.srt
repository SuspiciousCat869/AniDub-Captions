1
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,375
So you're Sparda's son?

2
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,125
So what if I am, Milkman?

3
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:50,250
The answer is obvious.
I'll take your soul.

4
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,083
Hey, if you're going
to help me out,

5
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,833
how 'bout hold
it down a little?

6
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,750
Help you? Don't get
the wrong idea, pal.

7
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,250
I just targeted
a demon, that's all.

8
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,250
A white demon.

9
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,500
You did! You definitely
promised me!

10
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,041
Like hell I did.

11
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,833
Yes, you did! You said
you'd take me to the ocean.

12
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,666
What the hell do you
want to do at the ocean?

13
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,416
Play, obviously!

14
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,916
Go swimming, get sunburned,
eat good food, that stuff.

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,833
You can do that stuff anywhere.

16
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,000
Doing it at the ocean is
what gives it meaning!

17
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,708
Okay, fine.

18
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,041
Really?!

19
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,875
I'll lend you the car,
so you can go by yourself.

20
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,833
Yeah, right, whatever!

21
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,916
If I could drive myself,
there's no way I'd ask you...

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,958
What was that?! I dare
you to say that again!

23
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,666
Please don't misunderstand me.

24
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,666
I just--

25
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,083
Shut up! Get the
hell out of here!

26
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,458
Thanks for waiting!

27
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,291
What's going on with them?

28
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,875
Oh, that guy at
the bar said that

29
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,416
the boss's strawberry
sundaes weren't very good.

30
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,583
Strawberry sundaes... Like this?

31
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,083
If I offended you, I apologize.

32
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,583
I only meant to say that using

33
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,500
slightly less sugar
would make them--

34
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,125
Shut your face,
you little bastard!

35
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,500
I don't even want your
money! Hurry up and--

36
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:59,625
Hold on, Fredi. Just a sec.

37
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,041
I've got something
of an attachment

38
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,083
to the sundaes here myself.

39
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,125
But they seem to be
sweeter than usual today.

40
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:10,875
That man is right. I'm afraid
I have to agree with him.

41
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,666
He got all moody.

42
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,666
Well beneath that gruff
exterior, he's just a softy.

43
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,166
It seems I've hurt his feelings.

44
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,875
D-Demon!

45
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:35,708
Please, someone help me!
Sh-She's a demon!

46
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:40,208
Yes, you're right. I'm a demon.
And what might you be?

47
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:49,750
That's right...
I'm also... a demon!

48
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,625
Are you still breathing?

49
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,333
I've got a question for you.

50
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,166
Do you know anything
about the White Demon

51
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,791
that's been showing
its face around here?

52
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:19,583
No. Even if I did, I
wouldn't tell you who...

53
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,666
I was lying! I was lying!

54
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,416
I know who you're talking about.

55
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,625
They call that guy
Sparda's apprentice.

56
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,625
Apprentice?

57
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,416
Yes, that's right.

58
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,958
He's supposed to be
a really tough demon,

59
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,083
and the rumor is that when he
takes the sword in his hand,

60
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,291
thousands of demons get
killed in a split second!

61
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:45,083
Um, are we through
yet, Miss? Can I...

62
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,208
...eat you now?!

63
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:10,666
Anyway, I heard rumors
like that around town.

64
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,083
I see.

65
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,625
So you called me here to pass
the word on, is that it?

66
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,000
That's right.

67
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,250
Well, that's unusually
kind of you, if you ask me.

68
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,541
I just thought I'd give
you a little heads up.

69
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:25,416
It'd be such a pity if I ended
up killing him instead of you.

70
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,333
There's a lot of history
between you two. Am I right?

71
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,000
Maybe so.

72
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,083
Sorry, but he asked
for me by name.

73
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,291
I won't let anyone interfere.

74
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:09,291
A demon who fought to
protect the human world...

75
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,541
My mentor...

76
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,208
Sparda, the dark knight.

77
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,791
It's been 2,000 years
since that battle.

78
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,458
And now the one who has
appeared before us is not you,

79
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,916
but your son Dante.

80
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey!

81
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,708
Did I startle you?

82
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,666
Yeah.

83
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,666
Liar.

84
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,666
Why do you say that?

85
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,250
Because you're not
startled at all!

86
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,916
I can't tell,... if you're
a nice guy or meanie.

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,416
You're opposite of Dante.

88
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,958
Opposite?

89
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:09,583
Yep. Because I can't tell if
Dante's a meanie or a nice guy.

90
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,041
So in the end, you can't tell?

91
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,416
Oh, I do know one thing!

92
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,583
Both of you guys love
strawberry sundaes

93
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,250
even though you're grown-ups.

94
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,083
So, what are you doing?

95
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,000
People-watching, perhaps.

96
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,791
Sure do have a lot of time.

97
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,083
It's pretty peaceful, huh?

98
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes...

99
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,416
It really is peaceful.

100
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,333
I'd like to have times
like these forever.

101
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:08,625
Ah, Lord Modeus
always seems so placid.

102
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,708
I can hardly believe that
the two of you are twins.

103
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,500
But really, what a waste.

104
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,875
I wonder why Lord Modeus
abandoned swordsmanship?

105
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,333
I am told that long ago,
his skill with his sword

106
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,625
was great enough to make
the whole demon world tremble.

107
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,250
Well, I suppose he felt he could
never even hope to beat you,

108
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,291
so he decided to just give up.

109
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,416
Right, Lord Baul?

110
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,875
Sparda entrusted his true
strength and will to Modeus,

111
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,833
not to me.

112
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:48,541
L-L-Lord Baul,
I can't breathe...

113
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:55,541
What would the likes of you
know about my brother and me?

114
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,833
Oh, I know what
you have in mind.

115
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:02,458
You intend to go
there, don't you?

116
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,083
To the Devil May Cry agency.

117
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,416
Isn't that your plan my friend?

118
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,166
Catch me if you can!

119
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,291
Over here!

120
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:36,208
And get this! Dante eats
nothing but pizza every day!

121
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,875
What do you think of an
adult who acts like that?

122
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,541
Well, it's not for me.

123
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,083
If I were going to date someone,

124
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,333
no way would it be
a guy like that!

125
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,041
He's lucky if he
gets one job a week.

126
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,166
Oh, Dante runs an
odd-job business

127
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,041
called the Devil May Cry.

128
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,208
But no matter how many
jobs Morrison brings,

129
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,375
he just screws them up,
and it's a real problem!

130
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,500
And it seems like he owes
Lady a lot of money, too.

131
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,125
Honestly, Dante is just so...

132
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,458
Oh no! I'm on dinner duty today!

133
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,750
If I don't get back quick,

134
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,250
the head of the orphanage
will yell at me.

135
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,791
Well, I'm off!

136
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,708
Hey!

137
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,166
Will you have more free time
tomorrow? I bet you will!

138
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,000
Come to the Devil
May Cry tomorrow

139
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:22,541
and I'll make you a
strawberry sundae, okay?

140
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,666
That's a promise!

141
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:34,583
Huh, a strawberry sundae, eh?

142
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,125
What a cute little girl.

143
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,583
Yes, she is.

144
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:42,291
No doubt that girl
will grieve too...

145
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,708
...if Dante should end up dead.

146
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,708
"Closed until further notice"?

147
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:35,208
Heh, did he go off to train in
the mountains or something?

148
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,541
Dante isn't here.

149
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,208
I see.

150
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:02,041
Why? Your opponent
is Sparda, isn't he?

151
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,750
So why would you fight Dante?

152
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,791
Sparda is dead.

153
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,333
He's alive! I'm--

154
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:13,458
So did you find it or not?
Proof that he is still alive?

155
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,625
Well...

156
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,916
I waited 2,000 years.

157
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,833
But Sparda did not appear!

158
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,750
And so you're going after
Sparda's son, Dante?

159
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,333
That's right. If I get his soul,

160
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:30,666
I'll also get the dark
knight Sparda's power.

161
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,083
So you insist on this?

162
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,500
Yes.

163
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:38,375
Then there's no help
for it. In that case...

164
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,500
If you insist on this,

165
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,666
then please do it after
you've defeated me.

166
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,750
I have no desire
to battle someone

167
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,166
who's abandoned
the way of the sword.

168
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,000
When he gets back,
tell him to come to me.

169
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:57,041
I see... A duel with me, huh?

170
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,208
Please run.

171
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,875
My brother should not
fight you. And you...

172
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,250
What could you have to
gain by fighting him?

173
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,791
Even if I don't have anything
to gain, he does, doesn't he?

174
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:19,041
Because word is that if he
gets my soul or whatever,

175
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,916
he'll get the same
powers as my old man.

176
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,666
I don't know who
spread that rumor,

177
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,416
but in the end your brother's
just another one of those losers

178
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,375
who wants to capture it. Another
one with dreams of becoming

179
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,000
king of the demon
world. Am I right?

180
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,916
You don't understand
anything about my brother.

181
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,875
He just wants to
fight someone strong.

182
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,458
He has no indentions
of becoming king

183
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,375
and ruling over
the demon world...

184
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,958
What about you?

185
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:49,541
In truth, don't you want it even
more than your brother does?

186
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,291
Wanting my soul...

187
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,041
You're going to him,
aren't you, Dante?

188
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,666
When someone picks a fight
with me, I give it to them.

189
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,041
That's the only reason I fight.

190
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,250
I came, Milkman.

191
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:54,500
Let's settle this thing fast,
before I catch a cold.

192
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,500
What's wrong?

193
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,208
Maybe you're too scared

194
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,791
to do anything without your
little brother. Is that it?

195
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,000
Heh, well this makes me happy.

196
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,708
I've always wanted to
know what a swordsman

197
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,125
trained by my father would be
like. And now I got the chance.

198
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,541
Looks like my father's
swordwork isn't that great.

199
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,375
How about making this
a little more fun for me?

200
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,125
What's wrong? Done already?

201
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,375
I must not...

202
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,916
...lose here...
in this place...

203
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,833
For the sake of Modeus, Modeus
who gave up the sword for me...

204
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,708
I can not...

205
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:32,375
I must not... be defeated here!

206
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,375
So you're finally showing
your true nature, huh?

207
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,083
Brother...

208
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:50,625
I will surpass the
dark knight, Sparda!

209
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,708
Brother...

210
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,750
Two thousand years ago,

211
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,500
when the demon and human
worlds were connected,

212
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,375
Sparda, my brother,
and I made a promise.

213
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,041
We promised we'd each live
true to our aspirations

214
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,083
and carry them out.

215
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,458
Soon afterwards, Sparda
came to this land all alone,

216
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,916
to protect the human world.

217
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,666
And my brother never aligned
himself with either world,

218
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,666
merely waiting devotedly
for Sparda to return.

219
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,708
Yes... Dueling with Sparda,

220
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,958
the best swordsman
in the demon realm,

221
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:15,583
was his only reason for living.

222
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:20,541
I abandoned my sword.
It had begun to disgust me.

223
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,208
It created nothing,

224
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,500
and could even rob my
brother of his reason to live.

225
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,416
And since I killed
your reason to live...

226
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
...now your only
reason to keep living

227
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,583
is to take revenge against me?

228
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:38,208
You guys couldn't be
any more old-fashioned.

229
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,000
Kinda pathetic, if you ask me.

230
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,666
Morning, Dante!

231
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,583
Honestly, I swear!
That lazy Dante...

232
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,958
Wake up, Dante!

233
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,625
Shut up. What the
heck do you want?

234
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,166
Today I'm making a
special strawberry sundae

235
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,541
for that man in the black coat.

236
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,333
Sheesh, no matter how much
I clean up this place,

237
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,083
you mess it right up again!

238
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,916
I don't think he'll come.

239
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,500
Why not?

240
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,750
A promise...

241
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,166
Promise?

242
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,375
That's right. He said he
remembered a promise he made.

243
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:51,583
An old promise to someone.
A long, long time ago, Patty.

244
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,916
It's all going
according to plan.

245
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,791
This is what I want.

246
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,458
Now there's only
one more thing left.

247
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,250
You hear news about

248
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,083
parents abusing their
children all the time,

249
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,916
but I still feel like
I want to keep believing

250
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,166
that parents love their
children unconditionally.

251
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,458
My mother died protecting me.

252
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,541
Maybe that's why...

253
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,625
I apparently have some
humanity in me, too.

254
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,458
And maybe Patty's
mother abandoned Patty

255
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:32,541
because circumstances
made it unavoidable.

256
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:36,750
Next Mission: "Showtime."
