1
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,666
I got one!

2
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,875
What's that?

3
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,666
I shall grant you a wish.

4
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,958
Three of a kind.

5
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,083
Sorry, but it looks
like I take this hand.

6
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,000
Lady Luck's a pal
of mine, ya know.

7
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,125
Well, I guess I'll
be taking these...

8
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,083
A full house!

9
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,750
Sorry there, loser,
but it looks like

10
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,750
old Lady Luck is my
best friend this game.

11
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,708
Well, I guess I'll
be taking these...

12
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,291
You're pretty good, aren't you?

13
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,333
Okay, fine, I'll play
another hand with you.

14
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,166
Come on, no more cards.

15
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,541
More importantly, you now owe me
10 ice cream cones, you know.

16
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,458
I want you to buy them now!

17
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,375
You'll make yourself sick
if you eat all ten at once.

18
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,666
How bout one a month?

19
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,041
What are you talking about?!

20
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,625
You don't have enough money
to buy ice cream cones?!

21
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:57,083
Um... Is this is Devil May Cry,
the detective agency that

22
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,541
"gets the job done
whatever that may be"?

23
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, that's right.

24
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,750
But that only applies
when I'm in the mood.

25
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,416
And today I'm in a lousy
mood... so get lost.

26
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,000
What are you saying?!

27
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,375
You better buck up, get to work,
and earn some ice cream money!

28
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:16,166
Welcome! Please come in!
I'll make you some tea!

29
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,708
I see... So you want me to
rescue your older brother.

30
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,791
Arrested on false charges?

31
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:24,791
Likely story.

32
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,458
That's correct.

33
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,416
What was the charge?

34
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,416
A charge of murder.

35
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,750
But there's no way
my older brother

36
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,250
would have done
something like that!

37
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,291
To begin with, the man
who died, Claude,

38
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,125
was my brother's best friend!

39
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,750
I wonder...

40
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:45,041
Sometimes the better the
friends, the deeper the hatred.

41
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,333
That's not true!
My brother was the last--

42
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,750
You have any proof?

43
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,416
But, I don't...

44
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,750
Go home.

45
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,541
This is like the stupid
mother who keeps insisting

46
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,958
that her child would never
ever do something like that!

47
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,291
There's nothing I trust less

48
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,833
than sentimental
feelings like those.

49
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,208
To begin with, do you
even have any money?

50
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,541
I don't come cheap, you know.

51
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,833
Ten ice cream cones should
about cover things...

52
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,458
You can take this in exchange...

53
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,750
It's pretty...

54
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,750
No thanks. I only
work for cash, lady.

55
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:24,041
What does she think she's doing?

56
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,958
Well, I guess we've
accepted her payment...

57
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,750
Hey! Anyone here?

58
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,083
Yep.

59
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,500
One strawberry sundae.

60
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,791
We don't have treats
for the kiddies here.

61
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,250
I didn't think you would...

62
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,625
I can never get 'em
at places like this.

63
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,000
But, man. Business is
slow around here isn't it?

64
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,791
Yeah. To tell you the truth,

65
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,625
I can't find any customers
since that incident.

66
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,041
What a way to run a restaurant.

67
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,125
Tell me everything you know...
about that incident.

68
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,958
Who are you anyway, a detective?

69
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,291
Some kinda cop?

70
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,000
It doesn't matter either way.

71
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,583
You tell me that story,
and I'll tell you

72
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:13,791
a secret that'll have
customers lined up out the door.

73
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,916
I still can't believe it.

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,791
Kerry and Claude
were best friends...

75
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,833
Yes!

76
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,500
Well, it seems Kerry was
on a losing streak...

77
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,250
All of a sudden I heard
this really loud scream.

78
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,625
This is all my fault...
This is all my fault...

79
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,583
"It's all my fault"?

80
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,625
So you're telling me that's what
this "Kerry" guy kept saying?

81
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,041
Yeah. That was taken as a
confession and he was arrested.

82
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,166
There were no other
customers here, after all.

83
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,166
And Claude's whole body
was just melted away...

84
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,375
You'd have thought it
was the work of a demon.

85
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,208
So, don't suppose
you have any idea

86
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,333
where this Kerry guy is now?

87
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,625
Well, the last I heard,

88
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,458
they locked him in a
cell at Devil's Prison.

89
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,041
Morrison?

90
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,291
I heard all about it.

91
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,625
You're not actually
thinking about

92
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,541
going to Devil's
Prison, are you?

93
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,458
What if I am?

94
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,000
Here's some friendly advice.

95
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,958
Just forget about it.

96
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,000
There's a rumor that
no one's ever gone in there

97
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,916
and come out alive.
It's supposedly worse than hell.

98
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,791
That's the word on
the street anyway.

99
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,125
I doubt even you could
make it out of there.

100
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,666
I'll take that bet.

101
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,375
Why the hell would I do that?

102
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:47,416
It's not like I'd get any
money from you even if I won.

103
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,250
Hey! How about that secret

104
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,458
that'll have customers
lined up out the door?

105
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,916
Try putting strawberry
sundaes on the menu.

106
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,000
Are you serious?

107
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,958
You son of a bitch!

108
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,541
What d'you think
you're doing asshole?!

109
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,666
Just taking out the trash.

110
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,666
Gotta keep the town
clean, ya know.

111
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't you dare mess with us!

112
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,583
This is a real nice
place you got here...

113
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,541
A person could
probably take a good nap,

114
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,583
and not be bugged by anyone.

115
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,541
It'll be a long nap all right.

116
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,916
You'll probably get to nap
for the rest of your life.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,583
You know a guy named Kerry
Márquez? He's a buddy of mine.

118
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,000
That guy's in a
special cell block

119
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,333
for committers of
heinous crimes.

120
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,041
A special cell block you say?

121
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,500
I bet they serve
great food there.

122
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,833
You'll just be in a normal
cell for having committed

123
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,166
property damage and
infliction of personal injury.

124
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,333
Don't worry, though. No matter
what kind of cell you're in,

125
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,541
Devil's Prison is
Devil's Prison.

126
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,000
You must be a real bad apple

127
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,000
if you're carrying
all this stuff.

128
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,333
Oh, those are just a
few of my accessories...

129
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:26,333
I just made a little mistake
in regard to their size...

130
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,625
Well, don't you look
cute and talk cute...

131
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,375
And this firm body of yours...

132
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,916
So delicious...

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,458
You be a good boy and
do like I tell you,

134
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,000
and I won't do
anything mean to you.

135
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,333
You're the one who looks
delicious, you pudgy fuck...

136
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,166
Being all marbled
with fat and all...

137
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,750
Special cell! Throw him
in a high security cell!

138
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,583
Hey.

139
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,125
There should be some guy in here
by the name of "Kerry Márquez."

140
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,708
You know him?

141
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,291
Who are you?

142
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,250
Oh, my dear Kerry...

143
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:53,333
I'm here 'cause someone out
there believes you're innocent.

144
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,625
It doesn't matter...
Doesn't matter at all.

145
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,791
Because you and I are going
to be killed any minute now.

146
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,416
Oh?

147
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,125
Well why don't you just
give me the real story?

148
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,500
So I have something
to think about

149
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,083
on my way to the other side.

150
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,000
I've told this
story so many times.

151
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,416
But no one has ever believed me
when I told them the truth!

152
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,958
Who can blame them?!

153
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,875
Like anyone's gonna believe
that a demon was responsible...

154
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,000
A demon?

155
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,666
Yeah... I didn't
even believe it.

156
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,625
That something like that
was even possible...

157
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,708
I shall grant you a wish.

158
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:42,208
What is the problem? I said
I will grant you a wish.

159
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,250
Tell me what you want.

160
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,208
You don't have a wish?

161
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:02,833
Any wish will do.
This is a rare chance for you.

162
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,291
Do you mean what you telling me?

163
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,708
You'll grant me
anything that I want?

164
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,125
Yes. Tell me now.

165
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,083
Ok... then give me money, lots.

166
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,750
I want to be the richest
man in the world!

167
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,000
No way.

168
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,041
Ok... then give me
unlimited power!

169
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,250
I want to be the most
powerful man in the world!

170
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,458
No. It wouldn't benefit you.

171
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,291
Ok... I want beautiful women!

172
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,250
I want all the women in
the world to be mine!

173
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,458
No. I'm not interested.

174
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,708
I guess there are some pretty
smart-ass devils out there, huh?

175
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,083
So tell me, in the end,

176
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,416
what was the wish
this demon granted you?

177
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,666
In the end...

178
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,333
Well he definitely gave
me what I wished for.

179
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,791
Sorry, looks like I
win again there Kerry.

180
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,791
Oh, come on man, let's
play one more game!

181
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,416
Hey hey, give it a
rest there, will ya?

182
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,791
I got to be getting to work
soon. Catcha ya next time.

183
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,875
Sure, just up and
run after your win!

184
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,708
Drop dead, you bastard!

185
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,500
I shall grant your wish.

186
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,458
Huh?

187
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,208
Your wish has been granted.

188
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,916
Oh my god.

189
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,166
What the hell have I done?!

190
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,083
What's going on?

191
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,708
What happened to him...?!

192
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,625
Oh god. It's my...
It's my fault...

193
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:38,708
I killed him... I...

194
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,458
Of course I wasn't serious
when I told him to die!

195
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,458
But that bastard...
he killed my friend!

196
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,333
and now I'm being
punished for the crime.

197
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,041
I understand what
you're saying, pal.

198
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,916
And I have to say that I
believe your little story.

199
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,583
The only thing left to do is
get us out of this hell hole.

200
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,750
Well, I wonder
how we'll do that...

201
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,583
I'm telling you,
it's impossible!

202
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,708
This place is worse than hell!

203
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,291
It's started again!

204
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,833
Attention all prisoners.

205
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,916
It's time for a
little game of tag.

206
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,125
If you don't want to die,
I suggest you run!

207
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,458
What's this all about?

208
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,916
It's a game of tag.
But it's not just a game.

209
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,583
If they catch you,
they kill you!

210
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,708
The guards hunt us like game!

211
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:51,375
I told you I'd make you
my little bitch, didn't I?

212
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,125
Huh. So I take it that
these are the demons

213
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,041
taking possession of
your twisted desires.

214
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,791
Well... What pretty jewels.

215
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,375
I bet they'd be perfect
for decorating my room.

216
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,166
I shall grant you a wish.

217
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,916
I shall grant you a wish.

218
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,208
Well, you're definitely
not your typical devil.

219
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,250
What is the problem?
Tell me what you want.

220
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,125
Ok, I might as well
give it a shot.

221
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,541
I'll take eternal youth, so I
can remain flawlessly beautiful,

222
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,666
if you don't mind,
my new friend.

223
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,500
No way.

224
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,250
How about all the priceless
jewels in the world?

225
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,541
I'd like to try bathing
in a tub filled with them.

226
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,000
No. I'm not interested.

227
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,708
Well, can I at least have
a nice dress or something?

228
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,875
No. It won't benefit you.

229
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,250
So what the hell
good are you then?

230
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,375
Time for you to die, buddy.

231
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,416
Listen up.
You guys are criminals.

232
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,791
"Tag"? You got to be kidding me.

233
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,666
I just reported this to
the police headquarters.

234
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,916
Wh-What?!

235
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,041
This time judgment
will be passed on you.

236
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,375
And don't any of you lowlifes

237
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,875
even think about
trying to run away.

238
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,583
This place is an
inescapable hell right?

239
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,250
You're a fuckin' idiot!

240
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,916
We run this place!
We know how to get out!

241
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,375
All right, open the gate!

242
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,333
Open it I said!

243
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,083
My thanks.

244
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,916
Yep, nothing like
the air on the outside.

245
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,541
You-You bastard!

246
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,625
I'll raise.

247
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,833
I take it your presence
here would indicate

248
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,083
that you've escaped from
Devil's Prison. Very impressive.

249
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,083
I guess...

250
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, I'll raise you too then.

251
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,958
So what happened in jail? Call.

252
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,416
It's a long story.

253
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,166
Full house.

254
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,583
Sorry about that.

255
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,958
Yeah, I'm sorry too...

256
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,625
Royal straight flush.

257
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,333
Hm...

258
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,333
Aren't you holding one too
many cards there cowboy?

259
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,333
Yeah, I threw in
an extra as a bonus.

260
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,041
Knock it off,
you fuckin' cheater.

261
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,666
You know you just got busted!

262
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,666
You can go to hell,
for all I care.

263
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,208
I shall grant your wish.

264
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,958
It's him! He's the one who...

265
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,916
Ah, what a good boy.

266
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,833
I'm surprised you'd come to
me and save me the trouble.

267
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,791
Lady, who is this dude?

268
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,291
You got me.

269
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:19,291
Some generous mask
that'll grant you any wish.

270
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,583
St-Stop!

271
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,375
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,000
Please stop!

273
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,291
Not a chance in hell.

274
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,791
I'm begging you! Spare me!

275
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,708
Sorry 'bout that. Not my style.

276
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,458
Do it, Dante! Kill him!

277
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:51,291
What's wrong?
Will you spare me or not?

278
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:56,166
The next line is "It wouldn't
benefit you," you know that.

279
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,250
I'll take this!

280
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,291
I wouldn't expect anything
less of you, Dante.

281
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,666
You really are strong...
I can't help but respect you.

282
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,083
You... What kind of scheme
are you cooking up?

283
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,958
Well, you'll find out sometime.

284
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:34,500
One should always save
the fun part for last.

285
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,708
Don't you worry about it, Dante.

286
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:43,166
All things come to those
who wait. Yes. yes. yes.

287
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,833
So, what are you
going to do now?

288
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,916
Nobody's going to call
you a liar anymore.

289
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,291
You've been cleared of suspicion
and your innocence is proven.

290
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,875
Thank you so much for
everything you've done for me.

291
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,125
But, maybe the world would be
better off if I were in prison.

292
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:02,458
Locked away for the
rest of my living days.

293
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,500
What do you mean by that?

294
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:08,250
Do you still feel responsible
for your friend's death?

295
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,291
It's not just that...

296
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,791
My younger sister's
dead because of me too.

297
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,125
Her name was Lynn.

298
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,208
She's always been frail.

299
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:22,166
But when I got arrested,
she was stricken with worry

300
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,875
and her condition went downhill.

301
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,250
She must resent me.

302
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,500
So tell me... Would
your sister happen to have

303
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,333
sapphire-colored pigtails?

304
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,583
Yeah.

305
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,791
Your younger sister
doesn't resent you.

306
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,166
That ring...

307
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,875
I bought that very same
ring for my sister Lynn...

308
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,375
How did you get
the ring I gave her?

309
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,666
The person who hired me
didn't pay me with money.

310
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,125
She gave me that ring.

311
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,583
And told me "please save
my older brother."

312
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:55,416
But I just don't understand.
How can that be?

313
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,333
See ya.

314
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,916
I got you! Today I want
my ten ice cream cones!

315
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,541
Just one.

316
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,333
No way!

317
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,375
Well, how about
another game of poker?

318
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,541
No. I'm not interested.

319
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:11,083
Everyone has a past.

320
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,500
The problem is
that people's pasts

321
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,750
aren't always picture-perfect.

322
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,458
When you decide to
confront your sordid past,

323
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,958
have you been able to
dispel the darkness?

324
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:24,208
Or have you been living the same
way? Committing the same sins?

325
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,375
Or have you redeemed
your mistakes?

326
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:31,458
In other words, I shouldn't
have anything to worry about.

327
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:35,541
Next Mission:
"Once upon a time."
