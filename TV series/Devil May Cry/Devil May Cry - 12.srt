1
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,625
I'll show you the
power of Abigail.

2
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:16,083
It's over. Abigail is back,
sealed away no longer.

3
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,375
The world is coming to an end.

4
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,625
Hey, what the hell's going on?

5
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,250
What is that light?

6
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,666
It's so pretty.

7
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,500
Dante...

8
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,458
Lady! What are you doing here?

9
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,208
Looks like it's finally started.

10
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,708
What's finally started, Lady?

11
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,125
Who's Alan Lowell?

12
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,333
Once upon a time, there was a
powerful alchemist by that name.

13
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,791
He might have been just a human,
but he was also a sorcerer

14
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,333
who just so happened to
employ various demons.

15
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,750
You mean to tell me
that was Alan Lowell?

16
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,625
Right.

17
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,041
Lowell...

18
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,208
There was just one demon

19
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,125
that Alan couldn't
bend to his employment.

20
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,041
And that was Abigail,
the demon said to have

21
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,708
powers on par with
the demon king's.

22
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,958
Using every bit of
power he possessed,

23
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:52,666
Alan successfully sealed
away Abigail's powers.

24
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,708
But seal them away
was all he did.

25
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,958
He was unable to
accomplish any more.

26
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,541
So to prevent Abigail's powers

27
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,250
from falling into
anyone's hands,

28
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:07,375
Alan constructed many magical
barriers and spread them around.

29
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:11,666
Barriers so tight, even a single
ant couldn't pass through.

30
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,583
Something came into
being during the process

31
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:20,083
of making those barriers:
the magic stone, "Alan's Tear."

32
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:24,708
You know more about that than
anyone else, right, Nina Lowell?

33
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,500
Do you know how long I
protected that magic stone?

34
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,958
It was an age-old
responsibility.

35
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,541
That pendant could unlock
the seal on Abigail...

36
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,416
All I could do was run.

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,875
Run and keep on running.

38
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,541
Why didn't you try to do
anything about the pendant

39
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,958
before you spent ten years
running from all this?

40
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,583
What was I supposed to do?

41
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:52,166
Throw away a pendant that
can summon the demons of hell?

42
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,666
And yet, even if you
destroyed the stone,

43
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,000
all it would do is
just break the seal.

44
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,791
Either way, it's all over.

45
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,375
The seal on the pendant
has already been broken.

46
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,291
With Abigail's powers on
his side, no one can stop him.

47
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,750
Because I'm afraid
that Alan Lowell...

48
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,375
...is no longer in this world

49
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,541
walking among the
living anymore.

50
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,875
Then what about Dante?

51
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,458
It's impossible! No matter
how strong he may be,

52
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,708
there's no way he could
defy Abigail's power.

53
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,958
Watch out!

54
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,458
Hurry up and get going.

55
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,083
Get your ass in gear and
get the hell out of here!

56
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,166
There's no point
in running away.

57
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,166
He won't be stopped now.
No one can stop him!

58
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,708
Looks like he's shown himself.

59
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,000
Jesus! What is that thing?!

60
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,541
And that would be Abigail...

61
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,625
What is that?!

62
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,083
It looks like the end
of the world. Christ.

63
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,916
Hey, hold it there, Patty!

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,958
Where do you think you're going?

65
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,000
Let me go! Let me go, Lady!

66
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,500
What are you going to do?

67
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,250
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to go get Dante!

68
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,666
That's crazy.

69
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,416
--You'll get yourself killed!
--I don't care if I do!

70
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,583
Patty!

71
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,125
Wait. I'll go too!

72
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,375
You...

73
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:01,791
Honestly! All he does
is give me trouble.

74
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,333
I'll leave the rest to you!

75
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,208
What do you mean by that?!

76
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,291
What do you think about
placing a little bet?

77
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,291
The two descendants
of Alan Lowell...

78
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,708
A "little miracle" might happen.

79
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,541
I didn't think you're type
to believe in miracles...

80
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:23,458
Yeah... in this case, I agree.

81
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,000
I might want to start to want
to believe in miracles, myself.

82
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,208
Patty! Don't go
charging on ahead of us!

83
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,125
It's no good, we can't
get through this.

84
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,416
But if we don't
get through here,

85
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
we can't get to the
south wing's top floor...

86
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,500
There has to be a manual control
for the sprinklers somewhere.

87
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,458
You wait here. I'll be back.

88
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:32,625
I didn't imagine that something
this bad would ever happen; I...

90
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,416
Mommy?

91
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,166
No, I'm sorry, Patty.

92
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,791
I'm so sorry...

93
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,583
Oh, my darling Patty.

94
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,916
My poor little girl!

95
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,958
I'm so sorry, Patty...

96
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,583
...for leaving you so
alone all these years.

97
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,458
Mommy...

98
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,375
Well, this beats me.

99
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,208
A little cooler
in here now, huh...

100
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,875
How many more of these small
fries do we have to fight?

101
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,833
My, are you tired already?

102
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,750
Oh yeah, right.

103
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,000
How nice for you.

104
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,791
It looks like this fry
isn't quite so small.

105
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,750
Well, not small in body, anyway.

106
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,375
Shit, when I think about how
I'm not gonna get paid for this,

107
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,583
just makes me want to cry!

108
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,583
Why not send Dante a bill
when this is all done?

109
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,750
Sure, that is if
he's still alive.

110
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,166
Awfully quiet, isn't it?

111
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,916
So, what are we supposed to do?

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,541
I don't know either.

113
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,500
What do you mean you don't know?

114
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,750
Isn't there a rite or
a spell or something?

115
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,666
Dante...

116
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,958
Patty!

117
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,625
Patty!

118
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,916
Dante!

119
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,000
Dante!

120
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,583
What's with those damn demons?

121
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,208
Patty... That pendant
you have...

122
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,083
--Patty!
--Hey, wait, Patty!

123
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,791
What the hell's going on here?
Where did Patty go?

124
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,416
The demon realm, I would think.

125
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,041
The demon realm?

126
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,541
But the pendant Patty has
contains a shard of Alan's Tear.

127
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,625
It doesn't have as much
power as Alan's Tear,

128
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,916
but it should be enough
magic to protect her.

129
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,750
Dante...

130
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,416
Where are you, Dante?

131
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,958
This way?

132
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,083
Man, there's just no
end to these things!

133
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:18,833
Agreed. And it looks like he's
creating these minions, so...

134
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,500
So basically, if we
don't take him out,

135
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,416
this'll just keep on going?

136
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,166
Probably.

137
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,083
Hey, how about
lending me a hand?

138
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,041
Pretty pathetic, huh?

139
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:18,291
So basically we just have
to rely on him, is that it?

140
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,958
Dante!

141
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,625
Dante! Dante!

142
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,375
Dante...

143
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,250
Dante!

144
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,500
Dante, wake up! Run away!

145
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,833
I'll get that out
of you right now.

146
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,625
There's no way you'd die of
a little wound like this,

147
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,000
right, Dante?

148
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,416
Please, wake up!

149
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,000
And then take down the
demons like you always do!

150
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,833
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

151
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,958
It's my fault, isn't it?

152
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,500
I'm sorry, Dante.
Are you mad at me?

153
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,000
But I don't want this!

154
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,791
I can't stand to have
this be our goodbye!

155
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,791
I... I haven't even
said thank you yet!

156
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,125
It was so much fun getting to
be with you, but I haven't...

157
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:02,125
Dante! Dante, please,
open your eyes!

158
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,500
I won't get mad at you for
messing up your office anymore!

159
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,916
And I won't eat your strawberry
sundaes without asking, either!

160
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,541
Please!

161
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,750
Dante!

162
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,458
Dante...

163
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,458
There's no need to be
afraid, little lady.

164
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,666
I just wanted to
say "thank you."

165
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,666
After all, thanks to you,

166
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,750
I was able to get enough
power to rule the world.

167
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,791
Hmph, you're no match for Dante.

168
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,958
When he comes he'll
take you down for sure!

169
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,083
Dante's dead, girl.

170
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,375
There's no way
Dante would die

171
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,708
at the hands of
someone like you.

172
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,708
Mommy... Morrison...

173
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,041
Run, Patty...

174
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,958
Dante!

175
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,291
What?!

176
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,750
Is it... Is it
really you, Dante?

177
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,166
You know another man
as good lookin' as I am?

178
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,833
The correct answer
is no by the way.

179
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,750
Dante, you're hurt...

180
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,916
Oh, this?

181
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,250
It looks like a certain someone
was playing a trick on me.

182
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,250
While I was having myself
a nice little nap.

183
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,791
Perfect timing. The rest
of the show is adults-only.

184
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,291
Well Patty...
If I'm not mistaken,

185
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,833
this is one time I might owe
you a little "thank you."

186
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,666
You wait there.

187
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,083
As a reward, I'll give him
a good lashing from you.

188
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,750
After I deliver mine, that is.

189
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,583
Anybody who pulls
pranks like this

190
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,625
needs to be taught a lesson.

191
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,208
Morrison, I'll leave
the rest to you.

192
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,750
Damn, you make me wait forever,

193
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,916
and then you go making
selfish requests...

194
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,333
Sorry.

195
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,291
It looks like it's
finally going to begin.

196
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,916
Shit, Dante sure
took his sweet time!

197
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,500
Hey... You've grown
since I last saw you.

198
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,083
I'm gonna pay you back.
Make no mistake.

199
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,333
Can you?

200
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,083
After all, right now I
have enough power to rule

201
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:54,166
even the human world,
let alone the demon one.

202
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,791
I've had just about enough
of your arrogant attitude...

203
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,583
You ugly prick.

204
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,958
Child's play like
this is all you got?

205
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,458
You continually
disappoint me, Sid.

206
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,500
Th-This can't be!

207
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,333
You can grow as big as you want.

208
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,416
And you can get
as ugly as you want.

209
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,833
You can even get yourself
world-dominating power,

210
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,791
but I tell ya Sid...

211
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,041
...it's pointless!

212
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,416
What now?!

213
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,375
Wh-Why? Why can't I win?!

214
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:26,750
I got power that was
top-class in the demon world!

215
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,083
I don't care how strong you are,

216
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:32,041
something is wrong
with this picture!

217
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,291
Dammit, this is totally unfair!

218
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,333
Is it decided from the
moment we're born, then?!

219
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,791
That demons born
without much power

220
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,708
are fated to be
stamped out by you?!

221
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,500
I can't believe that!

222
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,666
If this is how things are,

223
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,333
no matter what I do,
it's meaningless...

224
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,583
That's not it. It's about souls.

225
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,583
Huh?

226
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,458
Basically, here's
the story, Sid.

227
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,375
Someone like you
who's let his soul rot

228
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,833
can't measure up just
by getting some power.

229
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,583
Not to someone with a real soul.

230
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,583
That's not how it
works down here.

231
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:12,250
Well then, Lord Dante of the
strong and gentle "real soul,"

232
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,708
you'll let me live
even now, won't you?

233
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,125
Just like you have before.

234
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:23,375
No can do. You went too far.

235
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,541
But you know, I kinda liked you.

236
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,958
Y-You bastard!

237
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,833
And jackpot.

238
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,416
Dante!

239
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,791
Hey, now, go easy on me.
I'm injured, you know.

240
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:57,125
S-Sorry.

241
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,916
--Patty.
--Huh?

242
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,541
You're gonna be staying with
your mother from here on out.

243
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,750
I want you to have a
happy life. You got it?

244
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,208
Hey, Morrison,
drive me to the office.

245
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,708
Your car will still move, right?

246
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,666
You're such a slave driver.

247
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,125
I'm injured here too for
your information, Dante!

248
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,583
I see someone's in a bad mood.

249
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,500
Patty's departure really
did a number on you, huh?

250
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,875
What do you want?

251
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,708
Don't be stupid.

252
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,041
There's only one reason

253
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:08,166
I'd come all the way
over to your office, right?

254
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,250
Then hurry up and
tell me the deal.

255
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,625
You can cut the small
talk, thank you very much.

256
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,416
Apparently a large number
of demons have showed up

257
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
in a certain country.
It's a sweet job.

258
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:23,416
The client's filthy rich,
so the pay will be good.

259
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,583
I hear little Patty's doing
pretty well with her mom.

260
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,250
Sorry, hot stuff.
But I'm on my way to a job.

261
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,791
I really don't have time to
hang out with you right now.

262
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,458
My, what a coincidence.

263
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,625
We too are on our way
to another job as well.

264
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,666
I believe we're all
going to the same place.

265
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,166
So, in other words...

266
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,541
The payment for
this lucrative job...

267
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,958
...goes to the fastest
one, of course!

268
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:02,083
Fine, bring it on ladies!
Go ahead Morrison, floor it.

269
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,416
I knew it.

270
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,041
Really, that Dante trashes the
place as soon as I'm not around!
