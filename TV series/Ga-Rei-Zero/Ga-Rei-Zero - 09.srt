1
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,333
Yomi!

2
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,375
Kagura.

3
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,875
She'll pull
through, right?

4
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,416
She's gotta live!
She's got to!

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,875
Don't worry,
she'll be fine.

6
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,083
I don't think we're getting
rid of Yomi that easily.

7
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,916
Oh, Yomi!

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,625
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

9
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,083
What are these
guys doing here?

10
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,375
It's only a rumor, but...

11
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,375
I heard some big shots screwed
up an exorcism a while back.

12
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,916
The word is they've been
laying it on thick ever since.

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,666
This will probably
complicate things.

14
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,750
What the-?

15
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,208
It's really turning
up the heat!

16
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,500
Fall back! Fall back!

17
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,083
It heated the
rainwater so quickly

18
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,166
the steam pressure
caused an explosion!

19
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,416
Incoming.

20
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Come in disposal team.

21
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,791
Disposal team here...

22
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,791
Target died
before the exorcism.

23
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,208
A singularity has appeared
twenty-eight kilometers north

24
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,750
of your current location...

25
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,083
Get there as fast
as you can.

26
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,916
Yomi... Yomi!

27
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,250
Your friend is incredibly
lucky to be alive...

28
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,958
She has puncture wounds from
sharp, blade-like objects

29
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,000
in one hundred and eight
places on her body...

30
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,375
It's a miracle that no
vital organs were hit.

31
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,875
However...

32
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,916
such a high number of her
tendons and nerves were severed

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,125
that it almost
appears intentional.

34
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,958
She has severe damage
in her right eye,

35
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,250
and her pharynx
has been crushed...

36
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:01,333
It's unlikely she'll ever
be able to speak again.

37
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,791
Doctor...

38
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,333
Do you know how soon she'll
be able to return to work?

39
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,750
Work...?
You can't be serious.

40
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,291
Yomi will never return
to a normal life.

41
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,125
Please, no...

42
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,166
This is where Yomi
Isayama was discovered...

43
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,291
We observed marks from thousands
of sharp objects in the area...

44
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,958
but no weapons
could be found.

45
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:35,541
This is from the scene
of May Isayama's death.

46
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,791
Her body had been
cut up into pieces...

47
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,916
The evidence suggests
Yomi attacked her there,

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,916
killed her,
and fled.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,541
I see.

50
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,666
Were there any clues
pointing to why?

51
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,541
Well, it's just a theory...

52
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,458
but we think it might have
been a fight over leadership

53
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,083
of the Isayama family.

54
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,833
And is there any chance
that both of the girls

55
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,958
were attacked
by a third party?

56
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,083
It's too early
to rule anything out.

57
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,250
But... May's blood was
found on Yomi's sword,

58
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:10,791
and the blade is consistent with
the manner in which she was cut.

59
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,375
Either Yomi attempted suicide
shortly after killing May,

60
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,833
or she hurt herself in an
attempt to make it look like

61
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,166
she was
victimized as well.

62
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,833
We're not sure.

63
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,541
What's going
on here, Dad?

64
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,750
Why the hell would you call
off my engagement to Yomi?

65
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,916
I have a right to know!

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,708
Your engagement was
to the future leader

67
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,916
of the Isayama family...

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,291
Yomi can no longer
claim that honor.

69
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,000
You didn't feel the need
to discuss it with me first?

70
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,041
So what if she doesn't
lead her own family?

71
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,958
She could still
be part of ours!

72
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,041
No.

73
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,583
I will not permit you
to marry someone

74
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,416
who is suspected
of murdering her own kin!

75
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,708
Don't say that!

76
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,791
There's no proof Yomi
was the one who did it.

77
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,041
Noriyuki.

78
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,875
As a man
of the Izuna family,

79
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,541
you have certain
responsibilities.

80
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,625
What?

81
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,875
Think about it...

82
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,250
Have you ever considered

83
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,958
how much care someone in
her condition would require?

84
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,791
Given the extent
of her injuries,

85
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,666
she would hardly be capable
of caring for your child.

86
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,541
Do you really
want her to tie you down

87
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,291
for the rest of your life?

88
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,541
Listen to me: you're young.
The world is your oyster...

89
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,333
I would be derelict
in my duty as a father

90
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,625
if I let my son
so naively burden himself...

91
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:31,625
For all intents and purposes,
it's best to consider her dead.

92
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,666
Hey, Noriyuki...

93
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,916
We haven't played
darts in a while.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,458
If you don't let off some
steam, you're gonna blow.

95
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,125
Hey... The least you
could do is say something.

96
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,083
Moping around isn't
gonna solve anything...

97
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,250
Pull yourself together
and act like a man!

98
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,083
Shut up!

99
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,916
Just shut up.

100
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,333
Yomi!

101
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,333
Shut up!

102
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,000
Yomi!

103
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,416
Happy now?

104
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,958
You're the one who
corrupted May, aren't you?

105
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,125
All I did was show her what
was already in her heart...

106
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,666
But she was always in complete
control of her actions.

107
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,875
A bane stone.

108
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,416
Miss Yomi...
You're finally awake...!

109
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,333
Hold on! Let me go
find the doctor!

110
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,333
It's good
to see you, Yomi.

111
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,875
What a relief...

112
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,500
You had us very worried
for a while there.

113
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,166
Your doctor tells me your
wounds are almost healed,

114
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,250
which means that soon you
can focus on surgery

115
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,083
and rehabilitation.

116
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,791
Uh...

117
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,416
You've been in a coma for
the past two months, Yomi...

118
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,666
We weren't sure
you'd pull through.

119
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,541
Yomi...!

120
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,250
You're awake...!
Thank goodness!

121
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,208
I was so worried...!

122
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,375
Oh, Yomi!

123
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,291
Why isn't Nori
answering his phone?

124
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,083
Alright, Yomi.

125
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,625
I'm afraid I have
a few questions

126
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,166
that I have to ask you...

127
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,083
but you don't have to say
anything if you don't want to.

128
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,541
Just tap your finger
once for 'yes'...

129
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,666
And tap twice
for 'no'... Okay?

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We found your phone and
checked the call history...

131
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,208
On the day that
you were injured...

132
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,708
did May ask to see you?
Meet with you in person?

133
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,708
Did she want your
help with an exorcism?

134
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,916
So... I assume it was
something work-related?

135
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,125
Then it must have
been a private matter.

136
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,750
I see...

137
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,083
Now if I could be
a bit more direct...

138
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,791
It was you who killed
May Isayama... wasn't it?

139
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,750
Was it because... she left
you no other choice?

140
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,333
It was business,
not personal?

141
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,958
Well... Now then.
Moving on.

142
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,166
You resented her,
didn't you?

143
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,166
Mr. sayama.

144
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,375
You couldn't stand that

145
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,166
she was the rightful
leader of the family!

146
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,708
Mister Isayama!

147
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,125
Did you kill May...?

148
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,083
You certainly held
a grudge against her!

149
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,791
Answer me!

150
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,958
You're the Tsuchimiya girl.

151
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm taking the Shishio...

152
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,000
It belonged to my
daughter, after all.

153
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,458
I'm so sorry
about that...

154
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,125
He's going through
a tough time right now.

155
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:58,458
I know you understand.
That's enough for today, Kiri.

156
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,333
Yomi needs her rest.

157
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,625
Don't worry about your duties
while you're recuperating.

158
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,041
We'll handle everything

159
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,500
until you're ready
to come back to work.

160
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,000
And as for Kagura's duties,
she's become quite adept

161
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,000
at seeing to them
without any assistance.

162
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,333
You did a truly stellar
job preparing her.

163
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,541
Bane Stones...

164
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,541
So they must be what's
causing the singularities.

165
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,041
You know about them?

166
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,875
They're fragments of the
souls of nine-tail foxes.

167
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,708
And they're so powerful that
they eat away at the body

168
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,666
of whoever possesses one,

169
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,375
and slowly transform
their souls into phantoms.

170
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,250
The Tsuchimiya family
has been passing them

171
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,833
down through its ranks for
several generations now...

172
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,833
Sealed bane stones are an
effective way for them

173
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,833
to control
their Spirit Beast.

174
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,333
Well, fortunately, mine
has never been sealed...

175
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,708
It's a pure,

176
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,125
crystallized manifestation
of supernatural energy.

177
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,333
It was discovered in the
Vatican about three years ago.

178
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,375
It was supposed to have been
sent to Japan for sealing...

179
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,375
but it went missing.

180
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,708
The government knows
the bane stone

181
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,625
has been found
and activated,

182
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,958
so they've been strengthening
their anti-spiritual response.

183
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,083
All while keeping the scandal
under wraps, of course.

184
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,166
You know how
destructive it is...

185
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,666
and you gave it to May?

186
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,500
That fault hardly
lies with me

187
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,333
if she wasn't
compatible with it...

188
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:29,083
The regenerative capabilities
proved too much for her.

189
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,458
I'm afraid that means I'll
have to continue my search

190
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,333
for a suitable match...

191
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,958
Fortunately, the search might
end here; your own reserve

192
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,375
of spirit energy does a lot to
recommend you as a candidate.

193
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,291
So does your hate.

194
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,125
Now say... "Aah."

195
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,541
Taste okay?

196
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,375
Good, I'm glad...

197
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,375
But next time I'll make
you something myself.

198
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,791
I have to stop by work tonight,
so I'll be a little late.

199
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,458
What's up?

200
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,333
I've got an idea!

201
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,833
Can ya type?

202
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,791
What is it...?
Go on!

203
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,583
Uh... well...

204
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,583
I think Nori's actually
kind of busy now.

205
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,000
But I'll make sure to let him
know he should visit soon.

206
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,791
Gotta run!
See you tonight!

207
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,958
Pardon my intrusion.

208
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,541
I heard what happened...

209
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,708
I can't imagine how terrible
that must have been for you

210
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,166
to go through...

211
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,125
I wish you
a speedy recovery.

212
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:17,333
But I'm afraid this isn't
entirely a social call.

213
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,583
I have something
to say to you.

214
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,708
Something
you won't like.

215
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,833
A hate-brimmed heart -

216
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,083
Is a perfect match
for this bane stone.

217
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,125
But I don't feel any
hatred towards anyone!

218
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,791
Then how do you explain
what happened earlier?

219
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,958
It looked to me like you
sincerely loathed that girl.

220
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,458
Shut up.

221
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,458
Poor thing... And after she
begged you to let her live.

222
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,375
Shut up!

223
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,125
It appears you're more than
qualified to carry the stone.

224
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,791
You've done nothing wrong.
Your hate is natural.

225
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,208
It's everyone
else who is wrong.

226
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,833
You did everything
in your power,

227
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,375
but your new family
was still torn apart.

228
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,500
That was their
fault, not yours.

229
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,958
They betrayed you.

230
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,625
I'm sorry... Please don't
think poorly of Noriyuki...

231
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,458
This was my decision alone.

232
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,541
Open wide!

233
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,916
What's the matter,
Yomi...?

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,208
Aren't you hungry?

235
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,250
Here.

236
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,958
Nori hasn't visited
yet... I'm sorry.

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,958
"Don't worry about
me anymore, Kagura."

238
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,125
"I want you to go...

239
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,666
live life for yourself."

240
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,166
"I'm finished...

241
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,416
Don't waste
your time on me."

242
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,208
That's what you're
thinking, right?

243
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,500
Dummy.

244
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,041
You're the one who's
wasting your time pouting

245
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,250
when you should be eating...!

246
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,750
Hold on, let's get you cleaned
up before we have dessert.

247
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:30,000
Is it good...? I think I'll
buy the strawberry ones next.

248
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,375
Yomi...

249
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,000
Why...?

250
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,833
This isn't right!

251
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,416
Why did this have
to happen to you?

252
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,083
Tell me... Why?

253
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,208
Why couldn't we have
just been normal sisters?

254
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,875
Why couldn't we be real
sisters, in a real family?

255
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:15,375
We'd never have to worry about
destiny, or being Vanquishers

256
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,916
or any of this!

257
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,625
We'd live in the same house,
go to the same school,

258
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,875
have the same dreams.

259
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,541
It's not fair!

260
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,708
Why can't we fight over boys

261
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,250
and argue about the stupidest
things like normal sisters...?

262
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,500
That...

263
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,791
That's what
I wanted for us.

264
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,625
Not this!

265
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,750
Listen.

266
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,833
I want us to be
together forever.

267
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,333
Big sister Yomi.

268
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:32,458
Hey, Yomi? I've gotta
ask you something.

269
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,458
Today at work, Chief Zinguji
called a big meeting...

270
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,708
And she finally told us
what happened to May.

271
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,458
It's sad...

272
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,208
How everyone
suspects you I mean...

273
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,875
But not me.

274
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,708
I know you...

275
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,375
And I know you'd never
kill anybody out of anger.

276
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,375
It's horrible, isn't it...?
That any of them would believe

277
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,500
you were capable of
something like that.

278
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,916
No matter how hard
things get for you-

279
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,625
Just tap your finger
once for 'yes.'

280
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,208
No matter what,
you'd never do anything

281
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,916
you knew in your
heart was wrong.

282
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,958
And tap
twice for 'no.'

283
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,875
Hey, Yomi?

284
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,375
I'm gonna go
use the bathroom.

285
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,875
Don't try to stay awake or
anything. I'll be right back.

286
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,250
You haven't done
anything wrong.

287
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,000
Yet you're the
one who suffers.

288
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,250
This is a stone
of dreams...

289
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,208
It not only has the power
to free you from your pain,

290
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,291
but also to grant
your deepest wish.

291
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,333
However.

292
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,416
You must rely on
me to save you.

293
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,833
There's no reason for
you to wallow in misery.

294
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,375
Just give it to me.

295
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,833
I'll take away your pain.

296
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,625
Amazing... Yes?

297
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,625
Like I thought...

298
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,833
You're far more
compatible than May was.

299
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,208
Just try to keep still...

300
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,541
The pain means that your
nerves are regenerating.

301
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,750
Now...

302
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,458
What do you want me
to fix for you next...?

303
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,375
Your chest...?

304
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,250
Perhaps your back?

305
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,083
Or maybe...

306
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,916
Tell me...

307
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,500
I need to know the source
of your suffering.

308
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,625
The source of my...
suffering?

309
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,958
What is your one,
true hate?

310
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:43,250
What... is my one...
true hate.

311
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,875
That's right...

312
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,583
The cause
of your unhappiness.

313
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,833
Now... What do you hate?

314
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,500
I'm so stupid...

315
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,875
She really
needs me right now.

316
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,750
I should have
more faith in her.

317
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,416
I should.

318
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,333
Yomi!

319
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,125
Yomi!

320
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,875
Yomi!

321
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,291
Yomi?

322
