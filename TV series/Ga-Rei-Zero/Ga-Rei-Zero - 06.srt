1
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,791
Spirit Eater...!

2
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,583
Come forth!

3
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,916
Now feast, Byakuei.

4
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,375
It's possible it
went someplace else.

5
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,500
Ya think?

6
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:33,833
Maybe.

7
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,125
I bet Iwahata's
found it by now.

8
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,291
Let's keep looking
just to be sure.

9
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,291
Hang on...
It's close!

10
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,291
It's close...

11
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,541
Hey! The hell you
doing in the road?!

12
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,708
Hey! The hell you
doing in the road...

13
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,875
What the...?

14
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,083
Hurry, Kagura!
Cover up your ears!

15
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,208
Ranguren!

16
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,833
Oh great...

17
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,500
Category B.
An Echoer.

18
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,458
That's behind all
the signal jamming?

19
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,875
Signal jamming...

20
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,250
We'll attack in alternating
waves... You ready?

21
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,208
Winner gets last pocky!

22
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,583
What the...?!
What the...?!

23
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,250
Look out!

24
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,750
You're kidding me!

25
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,000
You're kidding me!

26
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,666
Get back,
Kagura...!

27
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,250
Ranguren...!
Roar Wave!

28
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,208
No way!

29
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,416
Sis!

30
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,333
I'm alright...
Just go after it!

31
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,375
Hey! Quit copying me!

32
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,166
Hey! Quit copying me!

33
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,166
I'm not playing!

34
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,666
Knock... it... off!

35
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,083
I'm not playing!

36
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,125
Knock... it... off!

37
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,500
Stop!

38
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,166
Stop!!

39
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,375
'Bout time!

40
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,666
Sorry about the hold up.

41
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,833
You okay?

42
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,333
I'm good.

43
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,625
Oh no...

44
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,041
Now what...?
More?

45
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,291
We take them down...
Just don't kill me by mistake.

46
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,708
I'll try.

47
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,083
Hit them
with a Roar Wave!

48
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,583
May?!

49
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,791
Quickly!

50
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,541
Ranguren!
Roar Wave!

51
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,583
Now!!!

52
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,208
Nicely done.

53
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,791
Thank you, May...
For helping us, I mean.

54
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,791
It's great to see you...

55
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,125
Looks like we were after
the same bad guy, huh?

56
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,833
I came here to observe
you in the field...

57
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,333
And I can't say that
I'm impressed......

58
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,125
Echoers move in groups.

59
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,291
Everyone knows this;
it's common sense.

60
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,625
I'm sorry, May.

61
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,500
So much destruction...

62
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,375
All of it preventable with a
little bit of forethought...

63
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,125
"Sorry," indeed.

64
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,416
This beast...

65
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,750
Passed down the Isayama
line for generations...

66
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,708
Powerful though he is,
he will wither,

67
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,958
unless bridled by a
true and proper warrior...

68
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,416
One belongs
to your family...

69
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,041
But not to you.
At least not yet.

70
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,583
Not 'til you slough off
these childish ways.

71
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,791
Good luck to you both.

72
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,375
So, May came
to their aid...

73
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,166
She'd be a fine asset to us...
What do you think, Kiri?

74
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,541
Should we ask her to join?

75
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,833
She has already declined.

76
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,833
Ah... Well that
is quite a shame.

77
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,000
I believe she prefers the life
of a freelancer, ma'am,...

78
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,458
That and no doubt having to
share a workplace with Yomi

79
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,833
would damage the poor woman's
pride beyond all recognition.

80
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,875
True enough...
What other news?

81
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,250
Human-dependent
occurrences are up...

82
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,541
That is to say, Category D
disturbances are increasing

83
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,625
with no sign of abatement...

84
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,041
As you know, such phenomena

85
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,333
are manageably weak in
and of themselves,

86
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,083
but taken together in bulk, the
sheer density of these incidents

87
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,583
lately represents
an alarming trend.

88
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,750
It's as if forces
are gathering...

89
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,291
Spirits are drawn to
such disturbances...

90
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,916
Their power increases
by accumulation.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,750
What we have to ascertain is the
source behind all this activity.

92
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,541
Unfortunately, because
of the latest incident...

93
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,541
Kagura Tsuchimiya
has not been assigned

94
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,916
to any of the
disposal teams

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,166
dealing with
Category D entities...

96
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,291
However the larger
workload may compel us

97
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,083
to reconsider that.

98
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,958
Of course... Although I don't
think she'll be ready soon.

99
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,208
No.

100
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,041
Perhaps Yomi mothers
her a bit too tenderly.

101
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,375
Kagura is a touch on the
soft side... if I may say so.

102
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:06,375
Under the right auspices,
they'd make an excellent team...

103
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,291
If only she were tougher...

104
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,291
One either wakes up
to the reality of this job

105
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,875
or one doesn't.

106
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,750
This last sabbatical was a
long one, even for you, Garaku.

107
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:21,666
Please tell me you're not still
chasing after the same quarry.

108
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,250
Any fool could understand
how you must feel.

109
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:28,291
But I can't in good conscience
approve of this obsession.

110
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,166
Obsession... That is a very
cruel choice of words...

111
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,708
Even so, my wife's killer
is scarcely at the forefront

112
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,625
of my obligations...

113
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,750
I only wish to see everything
dealt with as it should be.

114
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,958
Your first concern ought
to be for those who remain...

115
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,958
More specifically,
those you'd leave behind

116
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,083
should this business
claim your life.

117
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,291
None of our line stays
"behind" for long.

118
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,666
Perhaps so... But if the
unthinkable ever befalls me...

119
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,083
Yomi's ready...

120
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:02,458
The same cannot
be said for Kagura.

121
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,208
She's a lovely girl...

122
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,958
But too frail-
in body and mind-

123
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,625
to bear the weight
you carry.

124
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,875
One belongs
to your family;

125
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,916
but not to you-
at least not yet.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,416
Not 'til you slough off
these childish ways.

127
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
She could've been a
little nicer about it.

128
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:30,416
Kagura...! You going to
come swim with us or not...?

129
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,875
Lunch break
is practically over.

130
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,458
It's not like I'm a
member of the swim team.

131
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,083
Like that matters!

132
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,291
Neither of us is
on the swim team.

133
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,500
Yeah; you also haven't
been injured.

134
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,291
Chlorine's a disinfectant!

135
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,291
Oh that's it...!

136
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,750
You're gonna get it!

137
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,541
Ugh. This gauze
is soaking wet...

138
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,541
That wound will fester
if you're not careful.

139
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,458
I'm really sorry...

140
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,166
It wasn't my fault!

141
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,291
This is a nurse's
office, girls.

142
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,333
Sorry.

143
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:08,250
So then... How exactly
did you get that cut?

144
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,000
I... accidentally walked
through a glass door...

145
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,666
Oh good heavens...
Aren't we the clumsy one?

146
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,416
Sort of.

147
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,708
That reminds me...

148
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,375
They said on the
news this morning

149
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,125
a bunch of office building
windows downtown got shattered.

150
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,041
I heard about that...!
They think it was terrorists!

151
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,750
It may well have been...

152
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,875
The really weird part, though,
was that whatever was causing

153
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,166
all the satellite signals
to fail earlier,

154
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,958
stopped right after the
windows were blown out.

155
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,791
Satellite signals?

156
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,500
Apparently, if they'd
continued to fail

157
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,958
in that particular district,

158
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,833
day-trading would've
ground to a halt,

159
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,333
business deals
would've fallen through;

160
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,250
the whole economy would've
started hemorrhaging money...

161
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,250
Probably sounds pretty boring
to you girls, but just imagine

162
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,791
having to go without
your allowance for a week.

163
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,500
My allowance...?

164
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,666
Well, good
thing it's fixed!

165
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,958
Speaking of which...

166
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,291
Try to keep this one
from getting wet.

167
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,875
I'll try to be
careful... Thank you.

168
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,666
What's with the big
ear-to-ear grin...?

169
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,750
You look stupid.

170
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,375
The only one
grinning is you...

171
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh, come on...

172
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,666
You're just happy Nurse Misuzu
fixed your bandage, aren't you?

173
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,666
Have a thing for
older women, huh?

174
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,583
Girls! Please!

175
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,583
Why've you gotta
be all gross?

176
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,208
That's enough of that.

177
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,416
You're going to be
late for class

178
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,208
if you don't
get a move on.

179
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,625
Oh crap!

180
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,750
Thanks for helping Kagura's
leg and everything!

181
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,916
It's my pleasure.

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,291
Run along now, girls...

183
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,375
Ms. suchimiya...

184
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,750
Yes ma'am?

185
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,666
If that bandage happens
to get soaked again...

186
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,625
Come back and
see me, alright?

187
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,041
Sure...
Thank you very much.

188
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,750
Excuse me, ma'am.

189
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,666
What is it, Kiri?

190
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,000
Latest news from the
Observation Center...

191
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,458
Small, but extremely
active pockets of energy

192
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,583
have cropped up
around the Chiyoda Ward.

193
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,083
The spirit energy fields are
becoming dangerously unstable.

194
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,708
We'll have to put every
member on high alert then...

195
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,416
Have the Observation Center keep
us informed of developments.

196
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,166
Yes, ma'am.

197
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,000
I can't put my
finger on it...

198
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,875
but something's
not right.

199
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:25,333
Hm... I could really go for
some cream croquettes today.

200
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,291
But aren't they
a pain to make?

201
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,750
That's alright; I don't intend
on lifting so much as a finger.

202
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,625
Wait... What are
you getting at?

203
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,708
You're the lackey.

204
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,541
It's not like
I make the rules.

205
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,708
Never thought
I'd say this,

206
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,625
but I miss how you
used to cook for me.

207
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,583
Frozen?
Not on your life.

208
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,083
Don't get choosey...

209
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,583
You're lucky I'm even
willing to make these...

210
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,125
Anything else?

211
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,250
Impulse item aisle!

212
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,750
I second that!

213
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,916
Hey, Yomi?

214
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,458
What's up?

215
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,666
Am I... Am I really
all that helpful?

216
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,791
Where on earth did you
get an idea like that...?

217
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,666
May really got under your
skin, huh...? Oh, sweetie...

218
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,791
Don't let it
bother you...

219
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,250
She has her opinion of your
skills and I have mine.

220
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,750
We're home!

221
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,333
What an entrance...
Thank you...

222
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,125
Kagura, my dear...

223
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,750
Your father has
returned to us...

224
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,666
He's a bit drained
from his journey...

225
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,541
I'm sure it would do him
good to be looked in

226
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,125
on by his precious little
girl now that he's back...

227
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,916
Okay.

228
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,166
Kagura?

229
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,458
Yes, sir...

230
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,875
I'm coming
into the room now.

231
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,000
Can I help with that?

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,250
Will you be alright?

233
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,583
If I can manage
not to die...

234
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:21,208
It's slow to act, but the Bane
Stone does aid with recovery...

235
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,041
There's nothing to fear.

236
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,458
Yes, sir...
It must hurt, though.

237
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,000
Pain is nothing...

238
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,125
When did you
injure your leg?

239
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,458
I, uh...
This morning, sir.

240
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,833
Your guard was down.

241
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,166
It won't happen again,
sir. I promise.

242
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,750
Empty words will be no
surrogate for cold resolve

243
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,583
once Byakuei is
your responsibility.

244
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,500
Sir.

245
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,208
Spirit Beasts are creatures
of terrible majesty

246
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,416
and power, Kagura.

247
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,208
Byakuei,
in particular...

248
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:59,125
Our ancestors used their own
bodies to hold him in check.

249
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,916
They tethered their souls -
their very essence-

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,041
to that awful strength
by a great seal...

251
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,958
This is the heritage
representatives of our bloodline

252
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,291
have passed down and
protected for generations.

253
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:16,291
One summons Byakuei through
a precise loosening of the seal,

254
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,125
careful that his devouring
jaws seek out only spirits...

255
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,375
Take heed, though:
Once a soul is bound to him,

256
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,625
it can never be unbound.

257
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,208
The moment one
lets him free...

258
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,416
One's soul is ripped asunder
and cast into oblivion.

259
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Never, ever forget that.

260
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,125
Do I make myself clear?

261
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,333
Sir.

262
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,333
Grow stronger.

263
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,875
Command to mobile units.

264
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,500
We've got multiple
Category C's running amok

265
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,000
throughout the city.

266
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,833
All units proceed to
the nearest hotspot

267
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,458
and eliminate all
targets on sight.

268
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,666
Okay, this is some
serious B.S...

269
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,666
Where the hell are
they all coming from?!

270
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,000
I've got a clean house
here... What's next?

271
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,291
This upsurge
doesn't bode well...

272
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,875
Something powerful
is on the move...

273
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,083
I'll let SDCD
handle the vermin.

274
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,708
Hey, how're things
looking near you?

275
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,416
Tons of Category Cs...
It's nuts!.

276
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,125
Why are there so many
of them all of a sudden?

277
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,458
Wish I knew...

278
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,958
Whaddaya say we split up
to cover more ground...?

279
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,750
Think you can handle
them without me?

280
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,750
Yes!

281
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,750
I'll catch
you later then.

282
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,291
Now where to?

283
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,416
Wow... It's so creepy
in here after hours.

284
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,750
Oh, grow up...

285
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,916
I would have hit the
one-minute mark

286
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,958
if you hadn't
chickened out on me.

287
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,541
We could've stayed
here all night

288
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,166
and you never
would have hit it.

289
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,250
What the heck...?

290
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,833
Some genius dropped
a hairclip! Ow...

291
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,250
Everyone's already
gone home for the day.

292
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,916
I don't think the
nurse is around.

293
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,583
It's okay. All I need
is a Band-Aid.

294
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,041
But her office would
still be locked...

295
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,791
Right?

296
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,083
You know, at night
this place looks like

297
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,333
it ought to be in a
horror movie or something.

298
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,833
What's wrong with you?

299
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,041
Best be on the
lookout for things that

300
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,833
"go bump in the night"...

301
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,416
I'll bet you anything some
student committed suicide here.

302
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,625
Enough with that...!

303
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,041
Uh... Oh...
Your foot again...

304
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,125
Wait. That's, like,
way too much blood...

305
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,666
'Cause it isn't mine...

306
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,625
Wha...?

307
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,625
Uh... Is that what
I think it is?

308
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,625
Where did it go...?

309
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,208
Have I been tracking
the wrong target?

310
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,500
What?

311
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,291
Show your true self!

312
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,416
Why? Curious?

313
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,083
I must rid the world of spirits
who defile the natural order.

314
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,083
You're funny.

315
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,958
Are you the one responsible
for unleashing this havoc?

316
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,291
That's one way of
putting it, I guess...

317
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,125
Spirits are attracted to
the power of my stones.

318
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,125
Really?

319
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,875
That's right...
My Bane Stones.

320
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,250
You...
You vile thing...!

321
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,791
Ah...

322
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,625
You know I wasn't sure at
first, but I really think

323
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,625
I'm starting
to like you...

324
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,916
Heh... You've
got secrets...

325
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,416
Dark ones...
I can feel it...

326
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,541
Envy... Hatred.
Ambition...

327
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,750
You can't...
How do you know that?

328
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,791
Trust me... I know
evil when I see it.

329
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,291
It gathers around me like
butterflies to a flower.

330
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,375
Stop...
I can't breathe...

331
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:04,458
Latchers are the last
thing we need right now.

332
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,291
Kagura...

333
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,375
Don't make me do this!

334
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,333
Just stay back...!
I'm warning you...!

335
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,125
Please!

336
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,625
My obligation...

337
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,000
Is to rid
the world of spirits

338
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,250
who defile
the natural order...

339
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,125
My obligation...
Is to rid the world of spirits

340
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,083
who defile
the natural order...

341
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,000
My obligation...
Is to rid the world of spirits

342
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,833
who defile
the natural order...

343
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,916
Tsuchimiya?

344
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,666
On the next
Ga-rei: Zero:

345
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,125
Chains of Blame.
