1
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,875
PDCH Command Center
to Section One Mobile Unit.

2
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,125
Targets are moving south

3
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,958
on Metro Expressway
Five near Ikebukuro.

4
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,208
Collateral damage is moderate,
repeat: moderate at present

5
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,666
but a civilian rescue
team is on the scene.

6
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,708
Do you copy?

7
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,458
Copy that.
Section One moving in.

8
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,000
Over.

9
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,666
All on-ramps within
the prescribed radius

10
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,291
have been barricaded.

11
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,166
Advise civilians to leave their
vehicles and vacate the area.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,666
Over.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,416
Local and affiliated
media outlets

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,125
have been ordered to conduct
an information blackout

15
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,666
as per Form Twelve,
Section Three-B.

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,208
You might want to ensure
compliance, though.

17
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,958
Over.

18
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,500
Natsuki.

19
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,833
Sorry...

20
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,500
I'm supposed to be on
shift tonight, aren't I?

21
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,541
Toru...

22
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,541
It's okay. I know she's
not really "here." ...

23
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,875
Of course, that doesn't explain
why I keep doing this to myself,

24
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,708
does it?

25
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,833
Section Four Command Center
to Agent Thirty-Three. Come in.

26
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,500
This is Agent
Thirty-Three, over.

27
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,458
Looks like we've got ourselves
an O-Four-Three on the Metro.

28
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,833
Section One's Mobile Unit has
been dispatched to intercept.

29
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,500
Section Four is now on
Type One Combat Standby.

30
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,708
Do you copy?

31
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,625
Copy that, Command. Out.

32
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,791
Let's get over there.

33
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,416
We're on standby...

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,916
So I heard...

35
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,833
It's him...
I know it is.

36
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,416
Keep those hoses
on full blast!

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,041
We've gotta clear
a path to the injured!

38
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,666
Section One
Mobile Unit on scene.

39
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,250
Commencing sweep operation.

40
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,291
Hey...! Unless that thing's
got a hose and a couple

41
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:22,000
of metric tons of water onboard,
get it the hell outta here!

42
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,541
This area in now under the
command of the Defense Ministry,

43
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,875
care of the Paranormal Disaster
Countermeasure Headquarters,

44
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,500
Section One...

45
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,583
You and your men have done a
fine job, but you can leave now.

46
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,791
Thank you.

47
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,125
We're not just gonna --

48
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,916
What the...?

49
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,416
Everyone spread out...!
We've got Category Cs...

50
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,333
A whole horde of 'em...
Turn your Seekers on.

51
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,166
Now take 'em down!

52
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,750
The hell's going on?!

53
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,583
Spray the holy water!

54
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,375
Clear.
Clear.

55
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,625
Clear.

56
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,625
Category Cs
have been eradicated.

57
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,666
Combat Status
Type One terminated.

58
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,625
Hey...

59
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,166
Are you still here?.
I told you to go...

60
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,791
Don't worry about it;
leave the cleanup to us.

61
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,583
What the hell is that?

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,416
Oh god no...

63
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,416
It's a Category B...

64
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,166
Open fire!

65
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,583
What are you doing?

66
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,041
How many times
do I have to--

67
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,250
Looks like we
have a Category B.

68
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,791
Yeah.

69
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,458
I see it.

70
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,958
Take the injured
and get out of here...

71
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,458
Now!

72
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,875
Hey, Natski...
The Kasha...

73
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,916
We can't take it
by ourselves!

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,375
Wait for Masaki and
Kudo to get here!

75
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,208
Just back me up!

76
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,041
Take a pill, man.
We're almost there.

77
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,041
Masaki?

78
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,750
Who else?

79
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,333
Holy water's
en route, guys.

80
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,458
ETA's approximately
thirty seconds.

81
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,041
Let 'er rip!

82
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,750
You wanna go
another round?

83
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,916
Just keep sprayin' until
there's none of 'em left.

84
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,666
Done.

85
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,125
Ya ready?

86
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,875
Oh yeah.

87
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,500
Section One's entire
Mobile unit was wiped out?

88
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,416
No... Only about half of them
have been confirmed dead...

89
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,708
The rest are still
listed as critical.

90
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,958
What do you think I mean
when I say wiped out?!

91
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,125
Tonight was a travesty...
an outright travesty.

92
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,583
Why did we even bother
setting up the PDCH

93
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,958
in the Ministry of Defense?

94
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,750
Pathetic....

95
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,958
The Ministry of Environment's
gonna have a damn field day

96
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,500
with this.

97
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,583
So looking at the numbers, the
only successful unit to date

98
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,833
belongs
to Section Four...

99
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,375
Must make you
proud, Komparu...

100
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,000
It would me.

101
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,875
Come now...

102
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,750
You flatter me; I just
chaperone a group of misfits...

103
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,750
Really... Our only
advantage is second sight...

104
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,833
That's all, sir.

105
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,875
Just like you fellas at the
Ministry of Environment...

106
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,125
Please forgive me
for bringing it up...

107
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,958
But the Ministry of Environment
has had its share of issues...

108
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,750
One of the SDCD's chief
Vanquishers was incapacitated.

109
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,125
Very unpleasant business.

110
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,666
Paranormal incidents
did seem to level off

111
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,125
after the SDCD's exorcism
sweeps three years ago,

112
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,958
but lately there appears
to have been something

113
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,541
of an inexplicable upsurge.

114
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,875
Do you mean to suggest that
our over-reliance on them

115
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,875
has come back to haunt us?

116
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,875
I don't mean to
suggest anything.

117
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,000
The spirits in question...

118
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,458
may not have been exorcised

119
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,458
to the extent we
were led to believe.

120
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,916
You don't mean...

121
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,458
Mere speculation, sir.

122
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,333
Nothing more.

123
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,000
Wow...

124
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,666
This stuff's
pretty high-tech.

125
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,708
Just a high-tech Achilles'
Heel if you ask me.

126
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:23,250
Hey show some respect.
People have died for crissakes.

127
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,833
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,458
Can you imagine
if everybody was a seer...?

129
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,500
I'd bet you anything
that organized religion

130
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,333
would soar to the top
of the charts again.

131
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,791
Oh, yeah...?

132
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,333
And what denomination
would we all belong to?

133
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,833
Rock n' Roll.

134
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,458
Bad news, guys!

135
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,166
What's up, Mami?

136
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,708
We've got another
O-Four-Three in the city...

137
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,583
Looks like
it's a Category B!

138
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,166
Let's go.

139
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:21,291
These are the enhanced
satellite images.

140
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,833
Whoa...

141
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,666
Much like the one we saw
earlier, except its spirit mass

142
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,708
is roughly thirty times the
density of its predecessor...

143
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,666
A barrier's been put in
place to contain it, but ...

144
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,375
of course there's no telling
how long that'll hold.

145
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,166
What's with all the Kashas
suddenly cropping up

146
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,375
right on top of each
other like this?

147
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,708
Who knows...? But our course
of action is clear...

148
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,750
Holy water to weaken it
and Mani bullets

149
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,375
to put it out
of our misery.

150
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,916
Yeah, but... if my preliminary
calculations are correct...

151
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,208
We'd require over two hundred
tons of holy water in this case.

152
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,458
But they...

153
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,291
They haven't even developed
a delivery system

154
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,500
than can drop that kind
of volume from the air!

155
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,125
Excellent point...

156
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,875
We'll have to be a bit
clever on this one.

157
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,916
Then again...
That is what we do best.

158
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,166
No sweat, guys.

159
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,625
The barrier's supposed
to keep 'em at bay

160
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,125
pretty much indefinitely.

161
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,041
Didn't do much good for
the Mobile Unit earlier.

162
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,833
You know they got
slaughtered, right?

163
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:46,833
Shut up!

164
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,291
Seriously?

165
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,916
Hey!

166
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,166
What the hell...?

167
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,958
Right. I've made contact
with the target

168
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,875
and am currently heading
eastbound on Gaien-dori.

169
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,708
I'll get on Metro
from Hamaski-bashi.

170
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,416
Copy that, Agent
Thirty-three...

171
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,583
Keep it moving in
that direction...

172
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,875
Over.

173
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,916
Agents Fifty-Five
and Seventy-Seven

174
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,416
have been dropped off
at the scene...

175
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,375
I'm heading for Shaft
Three as we speak.

176
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,708
Copy.

177
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,125
Copy that,
Eleven. Over.

178
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,458
I've reached the overflow
levee in Shaft Three.

179
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,250
Prep-work has
been completed.

180
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,083
Over.

181
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,041
ETA to Shaft Two,
approximately ten minutes.

182
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,125
Over.

183
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,208
All systems raring
to go on my end.

184
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,250
Over.

185
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,916
Copy that...
Agent Seventy-Seven?

186
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,000
Ready.

187
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,833
Let's do this thing.

188
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:03,916
I'm in Shaft Two.

189
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,958
Target in pursuit...
Launching cables!

190
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,291
Confirmed...

191
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,875
Target has entered Construction
Tunnel One from Shaft Two.

192
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,541
Compromise the levee!

193
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,875
Say your prayers!

194
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:39,791
I'm transmitting mantra codes
to the capsules, and presto!

195
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,125
Construction Tunnel One
flooding with Holy Water...

196
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,750
Target is... Hit!

197
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,583
Target spotted...

198
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,291
Range...
Nine hundred...

199
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,166
Eight-fifty

200
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,666
Eight hundred...

201
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,541
Seven-fifty.

202
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,375
Seven hundred...

203
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,708
Six-fifty...

204
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,208
Firing.

205
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,000
Misfire!

206
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,833
Agent Thirty-Three?

207
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,750
Natsuki!

208
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,291
Natsuki...

209
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,875
Son of a...

210
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,125
Toru...

211
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,708
Natsuki...

212
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,666
Sorry...
I really screwed up.

213
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,333
First time, huh?

214
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,583
Seventy-Seven!

215
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,833
Brace for impact! Now!

216
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,250
Man, what a rush!
Close enough for ya?

217
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,375
Yeah, sure.

218
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,541
Fifty-Five here.
This one is put to bed.

219
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,958
Copy that.
Nice work.

220
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,333
Ballsy move...

221
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,583
An aqueduct would be the
last place I'd ever think of

222
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,541
to face down a Kasha.

223
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,083
Yeah, but it's the best place
to avoid civilian casualties,

224
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,416
you got to admit.

225
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,083
Besides, what better way
to brew up

226
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,875
the volume of
holy water we needed?

227
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,791
You guys owe
Mami big time.

228
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,583
She's the one who sent
us to your rescue.

229
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,583
Yeah...
You're right.

230
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,750
Of course I am.

231
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,833
Man...

232
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,250
I dropped my--

233
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,166
It's a Category A...

234
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,875
Masaki!

235
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,375
Kudo...

236
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,041
Natsuki!

237
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,416
Son of a bitch!

238
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,750
Crazy right?

239
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,750
Mami!

240
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,083
Don't worry.
Just try to relax.

241
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,166
There's nothing
any of us can do...

242
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,125
Mami! What's going on?!

243
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:45,625
We'll be waiting patiently
in the sweet hereafter...

244
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:50,041
You really won't be
that far behind us.

245
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:54,458
No...! Alright...
We're getting out of here...

246
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
Just take this.

247
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,541
Aoi...!

248
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,958
Aoi!

249
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,083
Stop it! She's not
the person you remember!

250
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,625
You've got to let it go!

251
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,541
Like hell
I'll let it go!

252
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,708
I'm telling you
it's too late!

253
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,833
Move!

254
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,416
Aoi...

255
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,125
Please don't...

256
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,500
Shoot her.

257
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,250
Aoi...

258
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,833
Oh god...

259
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,708
Aoi...

260
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,833
Shoot her!

261
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,916
I told you...

262
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,000
Let it go.
