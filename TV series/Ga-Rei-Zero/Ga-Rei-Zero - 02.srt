1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,583
I told you...

2
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,833
Let it go.

3
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,125
SDCD Command
to Disposal Team.

4
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,875
Repeat: SDCD Command
to Disposal Team.

5
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,916
Two Defense Ministry
units have been dispatched

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,666
and are currently engaged
in the eighteen-hundred block

7
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,000
of Sukiyabashi.

8
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,125
Proceed to area discreetly
and clean house.

9
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,375
Over.

10
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,958
Copy that, Command.

11
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,875
ETA's tomorrow morning
unless you can do something

12
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,833
about this gridlock, though.

13
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,625
First there's Ikebukuro
and now back here...?

14
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,666
Is it just me or are they
running us ragged these days?

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm sick of this traffic.

16
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,916
Not half as sick
of it as Nabu is.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
Not one-tenth as sick
of it as Nabu is.

18
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,000
The roads to Ichigaya
are sealed off...

19
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,041
Looks like we're stuck
here for the moment.

20
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,750
Just turn on the
siren already.

21
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,083
What are we, civilians?

22
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,166
What part of "discreet"
don't you understand?

23
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,500
We can't just put
ourselves on display!

24
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,541
I see it.

25
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,375
Category B. Kasha.

26
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,708
Newly regenerated.

27
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,458
Can't those Defense
Ministry geniuses

28
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,000
handle a simple exorcism...?

29
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,083
So what's happening
with our guys, then?

30
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,625
They're holding the
perimeter at Kasumigaseki.

31
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,208
Meaning we're not
gonna have any backup.

32
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,000
Our plan? Simple...
We go in on our own...

33
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,625
Hold on.

34
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,666
Everybody
in combat mode!

35
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,416
We can't do sirens
but this is protocol?!

36
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,958
We're the last
line of defense, men!

37
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,958
Whatever happens,
stand your ground!

38
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,750
Now what?

39
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,166
Go.

40
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,333
Heads up!
Two on the rear!

41
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,791
Well, hello there.

42
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,375
Wait, they...
They can see them?

43
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,666
Yeah, for starters.

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,166
They're the
Supernatural Disaster

45
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,958
Countermeasure Division.

46
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,750
Get the hell out
of my ride, freak.

47
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,333
Disposal team here...
We have made contact.

48
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,458
Copy that. Lead target to the
Yamate Line elevated tracks.

49
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,708
Are you serious?

50
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,416
Kagura's there on standby.

51
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,250
A simple barrier's
been put in place.

52
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,458
Disengage once target's been
led within the perimeter. Over.

53
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,416
You got it!

54
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,500
We're going to do this
the hard way, fellas...

55
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,958
Hold on to your asses!

56
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:57,041
She's all yours,
Kagura!

57
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,833
Give it hell!

58
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,041
Section One Mobile Unit of
the Defense Ministry's PDCH

59
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,166
engaged a multitude
of both Category C and B

60
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,375
paranormal disturbances
in the Kita-Ikebukuro vicinity,

61
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,916
along Line Five of
the Metro Expressway.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,875
Said disturbances
were terminated

63
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,583
with the assistance
of Section Four,

64
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,708
but at the cost of
approximately eighty percent

65
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,375
of the Mobile Unit.

66
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,875
Section Four later led
another Category B disturbance

67
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,916
into a subterranean
discharge tunnel

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
where it, too,
was terminated.

69
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,916
Shortly afterwards,
however, all contact

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,166
with Section Four was lost.

71
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,416
They're all presumed to be
seriously injured or dead.

72
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,750
Half of the two remaining units
deployed to the Yurakucho Line

73
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,041
were also wiped out
by a regenerated Category B.

74
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,875
As a result, the Defense
Ministry's PDCH has been,

75
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,333
in a word...

76
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,291
Devastated...

77
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,625
I'm truly sorry,
gentlemen.

78
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,041
An elite fighting force
brought to its knees

79
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,750
in just a matter of hours...

80
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,083
And to add insult to injury,
the Ministry of Environment

81
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,916
steps in and takes the reigns
whether we like it or not...

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,666
We're a laughing stock.

83
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,041
There, there...

84
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,916
No need to feel
so dispirited.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,291
The odds preclude
any blame being laid

86
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,916
at the Defense Ministry's
doorstep, after all.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,916
And just who
the hell are you?!

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,041
I'm terribly sorry madam,
but this meeting is

89
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,375
for expressly authorized
personnel only.

90
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,833
Don't worry, gentlemen;

91
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,708
I won't take up
too much of your time.

92
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,958
We're here representing
the Ministry of Environment's

93
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,291
Supernatural Disaster
Countermeasure Division.

94
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,708
I'm Division Chief...
My name's Ayame Zinguji...

95
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,208
And this is my assistant,
Kiri Nikaido.

96
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,791
Division Chief...?

97
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,458
And what, pray tell, does the
illustrious SDCD want with us?

98
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,291
Since you're asking, we've come
to collect any and all records

99
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,791
regarding the incidents
you've just been discussing.

100
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,458
You'll cooperate...
I'm sure of it.

101
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,208
You've gotta be kidding!

102
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,333
Young lady, please...
In so many words...

103
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,958
As a colleague...

104
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,083
I'm certain you're aware of the
impropriety of this request...

105
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,750
All agency records are
strictly classified...

106
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,291
The Defense Ministry--

107
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,166
As a colleague, I'm certain
you're well aware the time

108
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,541
for petty grandstanding
has come to an end.

109
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,333
That's enough, Kiri...

110
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,458
These exchanges are just
the price of living

111
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,041
in a bureaucracy...

112
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,541
For my part...
in the best of all worlds,

113
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,958
the wall of red tape between us
would be a bit more porous.

114
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,458
You see, we may have
separate agendas...

115
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,625
But our objectives
are one and the same.

116
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,958
Of course... We understand any
open cooperation with us

117
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,625
is out of the question,

118
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,125
given that this agency's
foremost purpose is to keep

119
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,083
the Ministry of Environment
under close scrutiny.

120
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:34,166
Kiri...

121
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,000
Now, please... don't
think our organization

122
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,958
wouldn't be grateful
for the help...

123
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,541
We intend to be partners,
not competitors...

124
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,666
Yes?

125
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,833
What is that?

126
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,750
A map of spiritual energy
in the Kanto area.

127
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,333
Judging by the intensity
of the accumulation...

128
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,708
It's highly probable that one
or more Category A entities

129
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,083
are building up their
forces in the region.

130
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,416
But a Category A would be...

131
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,000
We think this is
the common denominator

132
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,708
behind the recent spike
in Category B activity

133
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,208
responsible for the
PDCH's mortifying losses...

134
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,375
Left unchecked, the activity
will doubtless increase

135
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,000
many times over.

136
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,625
To combat this threat...

137
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,375
It is in our best interest
to work together...

138
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,166
Surely you agree.

139
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,541
So we have an
understanding then?

140
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,875
We'll review all
materials on site...

141
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,458
With your consent,
of course.

142
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,958
Of course...

143
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,375
What a friggin' mess.

144
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,791
Say what you will,

145
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,958
Section One may have been
thrown together in a pinch,

146
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,708
but those soldiers
were trained.

147
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,000
And Section Four
had seers.

148
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,041
Seers for cryin'
out loud...

149
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,666
Funny how none of that's
amounted to much lately.

150
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,625
And what's with exorcised
spirits being able to regenerate

151
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,375
on the spot
all of a sudden?

152
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,750
You think something
big's goin' down?

153
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,500
The number you have dialed
has been disconnected

154
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,208
or is no longer in service.

155
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,458
If you feel you've reached
this recording in error,

156
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:17,125
please hang up
and dial again.

157
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,333
Hey.

158
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,875
Nori!

159
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,250
It's alright...
I'm sure she's fine.

160
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,041
Sure, but--

161
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,000
You know her...
Just trust me on this one...

162
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,000
She'll come back.

163
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,166
Yeah.

164
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,458
What's the problem?

165
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,875
Nothing, I--

166
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,791
The bodies!

167
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,375
Ah hell...

168
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,125
Guys we've got Latchers!

169
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,833
Take 'em down with
whatever you've got!

170
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,500
What the...?
This is bad!

171
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,083
Move!

172
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,250
You...

173
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,291
You just killed those
soldiers in cold blood!

174
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,291
Those soldiers were
already dead...

175
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,416
It's my job to make
sure they stay that way.

176
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,333
Kazuki!

177
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,333
Hey.

178
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,041
What is all this?

179
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,166
Same old, same old,
Heh... Buncha Latchers.

180
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,666
They've made their
home in what's left

181
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,666
of the Mobile Squad...

182
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,708
When did they show up?

183
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,416
Long enough ago
to be ripe...

184
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,750
It's been a free-for-all
since we got here.

185
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,666
Really...

186
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
You think someone's
pulling the strings?

187
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,541
Pulling the
strings...? Who?

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,375
Alright... These are all
of the Seeker video files

189
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,500
from Section
One's mobile unit.

190
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,958
A hundred and fourteen
hours' worth, total.

191
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,666
Where do you recommend
we start then?

192
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,500
I think our focus
should be on Section Four...

193
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,041
Granted Section Four
doesn't use Seekers...

194
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,166
But the aqueduct's
security cameras do appear

195
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,083
to have captured the team's
movements up until the end.

196
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,541
Very well.

197
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,375
Switching screens.

198
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,333
In theory, it should
be possible for us

199
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,375
to get a spiritual analysis
out of raw surveillance footage.

200
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,708
Hold on.

201
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,666
Oh dear.

202
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,375
The hell?!

203
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,291
Now what?

204
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,291
Zoom in.

205
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,333
Oh god...
Please no.

206
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,750
Kiri...
We send out the order.

207
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,458
But she...

208
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,541
What the...?

209
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,916
Is this a joke?

210
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,041
Hello...

211
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,833
Sunshine.

212
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,875
Yomi Isayama...

213
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,958
Correct...

214
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,833
One of our own...

215
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,500
Recently gone AWOL.

216
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,000
Yomi.

217
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,708
This cannot be real...

218
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,000
SDCD to Disposal Team.

219
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,250
Yomi Isayama has just
been positively identified

220
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,541
as a Category A level threat...

221
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,708
She's to be
eliminated on sight!

222
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,166
Repeat: Yomi Isayama has been
positively identified

223
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,333
as a Category A level threat
to be eliminated on sight.

224
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,208
Do you copy?

225
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,000
The situation
is unclear...

226
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,208
But...

227
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,916
However it happened,
she's no longer herself.

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,250
She single-handedly
eradicated Section Four!

229
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:00,875
Uh oh...

230
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,208
Everybody scatter!

231
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,000
Kagura!

232
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,291
Crap...!

233
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,083
Don't do it!

234
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,541
Damn!

235
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,375
Are you okay?

236
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,375
Kazuki!

237
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,166
Sorry...

238
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,791
Look.

239
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,375
This just isn't our day.

240
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,416
Who the hell left
the barn door open?

241
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,583
Everybody hold your positions
and get ready to fight back!

242
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,875
Izuna! I want you
to track down Yomi.

243
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,333
Go ahead... We oughta be able
to hold our own without you

244
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,083
for a little while.

245
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,333
Now!

246
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,041
I'm going too!

247
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,291
Kagura...

248
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,208
Please!

249
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,416
Why not...? Hordes of uglies
like this shouldn't take much.

250
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,416
Right...! Let's put the
hurt on these bastards.

251
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Stand firm!

252
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,750
Nobody even think
of dying on me!

253
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,041
Yeah, yeah...
Come on!

254
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,541
What's this?

255
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,708
A utility conduit.

256
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,291
And that is...?

257
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,208
Like a lifeline running
underneath the whole city.

258
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,125
You think
Yomi's down there?

259
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,791
Possibly... In any case,
we'd better check it out.

260
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,541
Wow...

261
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,083
These tunnels
pretty much connect

262
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,333
every major
facility in town...

263
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,250
Perfect place to
mobilize her forces.

264
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,875
What forces...?

265
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,500
That mountain of
corpses back there.

266
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,166
But she...

267
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,166
Why? It doesn't
make sense.

268
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,750
She's after us.

269
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,541
The Ministry
of Environment, I mean.

270
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,791
We don't have
much time.

271
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,166
How do we know
which one to go down?

272
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,916
I think we're gonna
have to split up.

273
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,916
Wait, what?

274
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,583
Don't worry
about it, Kagura.

275
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,958
You go down that one...

276
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,833
If anything happens,
I'll come running.

277
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,958
Same goes
for you, okay?

278
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,458
So what are
your thoughts...?

279
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,541
Do you think
he's gonna find her?

280
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,791
Or is she closer to us?

281
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,958
Poor guy...

282
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,416
I wonder if he could
bring himself to fight her

283
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,750
if it came to that...

284
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,625
What am I
babbling about...?

285
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,750
He's the only
person in the world

286
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,000
who likes Yomi
more than I do.

287
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:13,291
I mean, they were
engaged and all...

288
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,666
If we find her,

289
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,291
you'll help her go back
to the way she was, right?

290
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,708
Sorry. I don't think
he'll be much use.

291
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,833
Yomi...

292
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,833
What are you
waiting for? Draw.

293
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,416
Alright...

294
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,125
I'll just force you!

295
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,083
Yomi!

296
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,791
Someone's been
practicing...

297
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,500
Good for you.

298
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,500
I'm impressed...

299
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,708
We're not cut from the
same cloth at all, are we?.

300
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,291
I hit my ceiling years ago

301
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,083
and you're still soaring
high as you please...

302
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,958
Kill me.

303
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,708
That's your job,
isn't it?

304
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,916
To dispose of ugly
little secrets like me...

305
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,875
It should be easy...

306
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,250
A second is all
it'll take to end this...

307
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,750
Just do it...

308
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:47,000
Or is it hard when
it's someone you know?

309
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,291
That bleeding heart'll lead you
down a painful road, sweetie...

310
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:54,291
But... it's also probably what
makes you better than most.

311
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,083
Little Miss Perfect.

312
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,083
But we had
a few laughs...

313
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,083
Too bad we couldn't
have one or two more.

314
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,458
Yomi.

315
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,375
Hatred turns them sour.

316
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,791
Kagura...

317
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,625
Kill me!

318
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,291
Stop it, Yomi...!

319
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,791
This isn't you!

320
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,583
Help...! Nori,
she's here! Hurry!

321
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,666
He won't come...
You can take my word for it.

322
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,833
Let's just say...

323
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,791
He doesn't
have the guts.

324
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,458
How could you?!

325
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,458
Well now...

326
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,416
That put you in the mood.

327
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,583
Kagura!

328
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,250
What the...?

329
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,541
Kagura.

330
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,208
Thought you'd shake me
that easily...?

331
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,750
Poor thing.

332
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,666
How can you be so naïve?

333
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,708
Please... I...

334
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,291
Hurts like hell...
doesn't it...?

335
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,666
Could be a lot worse,
though. ...

336
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,500
I could let you
suffer indefinitely.

337
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:10,375
But why...
Why me?

338
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,625
I don't understand.

339
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,083
Why are you
doing this to me?

340
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:21,375
You were my...
Big sister...

341
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,000
You little tramp.

342
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,666
Don't call me that...!

343
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,291
Ever!

344
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,583
On the next
Ga-Rei: Zero -

345
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,666
The Time of
Chance Encounters.
