1
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:32,125
I wish I could say these
were unfamiliar things...

2
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,166
An afternoon dampened
by the pouring rain...

3
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,916
The sense of someone dear
to you being wrenched away.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,375
The fear of what they've left
behind for you to deal with.

5
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,250
The kind of pain that
leaves you so helpless

6
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,000
you can barely force a tear;

7
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:52,833
feeling like the only reasonable
thing left to do is endure...

8
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,458
I'd felt all this before.
Three years ago.

9
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,750
He took me under his wing
after I'd lost my family...

10
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,000
He made me who I am...

11
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,291
You could live
a thousand years

12
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,208
and never meet
someone so kind.

13
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,166
Heaven knows I certainly
didn't deserve to...

14
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,708
I never even
bothered to tell him

15
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,375
how much he
really meant to me.

16
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,541
And now...
I'll never get the chance.

17
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,125
Are you ready?.

18
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,625
The clan leaders
have assembled

19
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,958
to discuss the best
course of action...

20
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,833
Yomi... You ought to go
and welcome them.

21
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay.

22
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,500
Where is the damn thing?

23
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,625
Hey take it easy,
man... Slow down...

24
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,375
Let me ask you
a question, though...

25
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,250
Whatever took out
Yomi's father...

26
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,500
Do you really think it
could've been a ghost?

27
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,208
The scene had
a bad energy to it....

28
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,625
And that singularity
cropped up...

29
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,041
Yeah, but still...
Not for long...

30
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,458
I mean, c'mon...

31
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,208
It could've
been a coincidence.

32
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,541
Look, either way

33
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,958
we have to assume the
incidents are related...

34
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,583
The main thing is no
one's seen it leaving...

35
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,500
Chances are we can
still catch this thing.

36
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,000
The Bane Stone is
resonating yet again...

37
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:50,791
Somewhere out there is one large
enough to devour a human soul.

38
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,791
Thank you all for coming
here on such short notice...

39
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,833
It's much appreciated.

40
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,833
I presume by now you've
heard the devastating news...

41
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,958
My elder brother Naraku
was slain last night

42
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,916
by an evil spirit.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,666
Unfortunately, we don't
yet have all of the facts.

44
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,708
But, if it was powerful enough
to subdue someone of his rank...

45
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,000
Each and every one of us must
exercise the utmost caution...

46
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,458
This is clearly not a
force to be trifled with.

47
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,625
That said, though I
recognize the circumstances

48
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,000
would tend to mitigate any
additional points of order,

49
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,708
nevertheless...

50
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,833
As I am myself unable
to assume full leadership...

51
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,208
In accordance with my late
brother's final wishes,

52
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,375
I announce that the duty will
be shared, for the time being.

53
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,708
Until further notice, I am
head of the family in name only.

54
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,666
It falls to my daughter May
to act as Chief Vanquisher.

55
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,916
I trust you'll all do your part
to help ease her into the role.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,041
Uncle, I...

57
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,750
What is it, child?

58
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,125
Please forgive me if this
sounds disrespectful, but...

59
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,041
That's my father's wish?

60
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,708
Yes...

61
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,166
He outlined the details quite
specifically in his Last Will

62
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,541
and Testament.

63
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,708
Wait, you read it...?

64
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,708
Uncle...! How could you read
it without me present...?

65
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,666
I am his only daughter!

66
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,083
We haven't even mourned
him properly yet...!

67
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,666
Is your only concern who's
going to succeed the man...?!

68
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,833
Do you see his death
as an opportunity?!

69
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,458
Silence!

70
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,375
Such bold words hardly suit the
one responsible for his death!

71
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,125
I am not the one who
let the murderous spirit

72
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,208
slip into Naraku's home!

73
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,791
Nor, for that matter, am I the
one taking issue with his wishes

74
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,958
from the comfort of that home
while his murderer roams free!

75
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,541
Ingrate!.

76
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,166
You'll never understand the pain
he went through on our behalf...

77
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,500
The man's battle scars are
what bound our clans together...

78
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,958
The only thing he expected
from you was to be protected

79
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,125
from the fate that befell him!

80
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,916
Would you prefer to sit back and
let his legacy die as well...?

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,166
How dare you question
which of us is fit to lead?!

82
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,750
You, a Vanquisher,

83
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,958
who while my brother
was being brutally executed,

84
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:57,625
were out gallivanting
with some boy!

85
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,416
Clearly your
reputation as a prodigy

86
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,375
has clouded your
good judgment...

87
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,166
Is resting on your laurels
the only thanks my brother gets

88
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,625
for raising you as his own!

89
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,625
Yomi!

90
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,125
Pretender...!
His wishes my foot...!

91
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,500
I know for a fact

92
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,250
he fully intended to hand
the reigns over to Yomi.

93
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,083
My apologies if Naraku's
wishes aren't to your liking...

94
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,375
But rest assured...

95
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,875
They are indeed my
brother's wishes, sir,

96
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,791
and I will follow
them to the letter.

97
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,083
Nonsense, sir...

98
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,833
He and I discussed
Yomi's future many times...

99
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,833
For heaven's sake, the girl's
been betrothed to my only son

100
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,250
for years!

101
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,291
Yomi and Noriyuki's marriage
is of no concern to me...

102
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,791
I'm no blood
relation to her

103
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,291
and from this point forward
her life is her own...

104
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,458
I am decidedly
not her father.

105
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,458
As you've made abundantly
clear... In light of that...

106
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,541
I've no choice but to
reconsider their union.

107
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,250
Yomi?

108
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,916
Kagura, hi...

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,333
What's up?

110
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,375
Are you alright?

111
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,375
Yeah.

112
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,833
Lovely room.

113
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,500
May... Just enough sunlight
for it to be comfortable...

114
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,208
Yomi... Might I...

115
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,791
use this room
as my own, please?

116
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,541
It's a bit intrusive...

117
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,666
But then again, where
father goes so must I...

118
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,208
This is where we'll
be living from now on.

119
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,166
The two of you
are moving in?

120
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,833
Personally, I would have been
content with a guestroom...

121
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,666
But I'm afraid I do have
something of an image

122
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,458
to uphold for his sake.

123
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,666
Yeah, but...
Where will I stay?

124
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,083
The room Kagura's
been using seems nice.

125
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,583
And I think
the young lady here

126
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,208
is more than ready to stand
on her own two feet...

127
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,125
Isn't it time to
leave the nest?

128
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,625
What are you saying?

129
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,708
Even among the branch
families your exploits

130
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,250
are highly regarded...

131
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:05,000
You're a prodigy, dear...
Just as Yomi once was.

132
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,208
Everyone feels you should
shed the yoke of dependence...

133
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,625
Be your own woman, Kagura;

134
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,041
put your childish
conceits behind you.

135
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,250
Okay...

136
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,208
Oh, yes... And Yomi...

137
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,291
Would you give me
Shishio, please?

138
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry... Father wishes
it returned to the family...

139
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,333
He says that after
what happened to Naraku...

140
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,958
You are no longer
fit to wield it.

141
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,708
He said what?!

142
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,958
Please don't make a fuss.

143
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,916
I wish you well.

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,416
Thanks.

145
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,666
Oh, Yomi...

146
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,125
It's okay. Really.

147
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,458
But, they...

148
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,083
Kagura.

149
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,791
At last...
The sword... is mine.

150
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,208
What have I...?
Oh no... This is...

151
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,500
What's going on?
What have I done?!

152
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,916
Stay back!
Don't touch me!

153
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:33,750
Relax.
Just accept it.

154
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,500
Wha... What are
you doing to me?

155
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:39,708
They're useful, you know:
Anger, hatred, ambition.

156
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,708
Embrace them
for what they are

157
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,791
and there's no limit to what
the stone can do for you.

158
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,375
I never...
I never wanted this...

159
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,750
Too bad. There's
no turning back now.

160
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,291
From here on, the only path left
open is the one you created...

161
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:03,625
See...This is
what you wanted.

162
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,833
Why else do you think
I'd have given it to you?

163
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,000
Please, no!

164
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,416
Come here.

165
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,166
So... How are you doing?

166
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,541
I'm fine... Things are back
to what they used to be...

167
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,166
I mean... It's not like
I had anything to begin with.

168
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,291
Yomi...

169
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,541
It'll be okay...
Really.

170
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,791
At least this time around
I have a little sister.

171
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,041
Another singularity
has appeared, ma'am!

172
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,250
There's a massive
accumulation of spirit energy

173
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,000
that appeared at
Twelve Hundred Thirty hours

174
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,666
moving in a
northeasterly direction.

175
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,541
The reasonable assumption
is a Category B.

176
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,000
We also very briefly
picked up a dense energy field

177
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,833
flanking the mass's
projected course.

178
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,166
The singularity's attracting
a very powerful spirit,

179
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,041
it would seem...

180
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,666
But what type?

181
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,291
Category... A

182
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,458
Where it's headed
to doesn't bode well.

183
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,000
No, ma'am.

184
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,625
The location's still crawling
with malevolent energy.

185
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,416
Alert the Disposal
Team... Immediately.

186
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,583
This is a good way
to catch a cold.

187
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,583
I'll get you a blanket.

188
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,041
Attention Disposal Team:
A large paranormal disturbance

189
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,666
has been detected moving
northbound on Tohoku Expressway.

190
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,416
Several Category Cs
are traveling with it

191
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,000
at about eighty
kilometers per hour.

192
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,583
Details will be forthcoming.
Proceed with extreme caution.

193
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,041
We've got multiples again...
This oughta be fun.

194
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,000
I can't help wishing Yomi
was handy right about now.

195
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,916
We'll have to make
do without her...

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,958
Focus on what we've got.

197
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,708
Way ahead of you, bro...
Check this out....

198
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,000
Heh... Nice
and high tech...

199
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,041
The Tomioka 23
Vanquisher Suitcase...

200
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,250
This baby comes equipped with
a triple Mani Disc CD changer

201
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,541
that can blast holy mantras
at an ear-shattering

202
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,500
five hundred and twenty
revolutions per minute--

203
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,791
You wanna dance...?

204
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,708
This little bad boy spins
at six-thousand RPMs.

205
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,375
Yeah... What are you gonna do,
build a highway on me?

206
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,458
The man goes hi-fi and suddenly
he's too cool for school...

207
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,375
There it is!

208
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,416
What the hell?

209
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,833
It's a Category B...
A Kasha.

210
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,958
Get nice and close
so I can blast 'er...

211
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,958
And back me up!

212
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,708
Hold on.

213
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,875
Ah, great...
Where're they from?

214
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,041
Ichigaya...
The MoD's PDCH...

215
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,416
Just what we need right now...
A friendly pissing contest.

216
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,500
Hey, there.
Ministry of Environment.

217
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,250
You guys need to
clear out right now...

218
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,250
This is adults-only here.

219
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,791
Hey...! Who the hell are
you to talk to us like--

220
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,541
The singularity...!
It's gone...!

221
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,708
Wait...
Is that...?

222
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,083
It's another one...
What in the world is going on?

223
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,500
Yeah?

224
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,166
It was good of
you to come, Yomi.

225
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,416
What is this?

226
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,875
Ranguren! A Roar Wave!

227
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,041
Yomi?

228
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,375
First tag,
now hide-and-seek?

229
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,458
Ranguren!
Take her down!

230
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,541
Ranguren!

231
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,583
I'm impressed...

232
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,000
I wondered what
it might feel like.

233
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,750
What have you done?

234
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,666
Embraced the means
by which to really live.

235
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,208
Something I don't expect
you to understand.

236
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,750
Moralize all you want;
the power to do as I please

237
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,875
is simply a fact
of my existence now.

238
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:56,041
And watching you die...
Is what pleases me most of all.

239
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,666
Your death...
is my deepest wish.

240
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,125
Always in my way
at every turn!...

241
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,750
How I've resented you...!

242
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:12,666
How I've absolutely
hated the sight of you!...

243
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,000
Ever so talented...!
Ever so fawned over!

244
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,958
Ever so ... perfect!

245
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,583
It should've been me...
I should've been the one...

246
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,125
But no... Uncle had to have
such a soft spot for you...

247
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,083
What should've been rightfully
mine fell to an outsider...!

248
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,500
My future gone...!

249
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,708
My whole life spent
in your shadow!

250
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,833
For that... I hated him...

251
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,916
Hated him more than
I hated even you!

252
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,458
Which made killing him easy!

253
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:54,125
Sadly... He didn't beg
for his life as I'd hoped...

254
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,708
Rather selfish of him,
don't you agree...?

255
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:01,250
It'd have been so much more fun
if he'd screamed, after all...

256
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,458
He did shuffle off this mortal
coil in agony, though...

257
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,791
Of that I made sure.

258
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,375
Huh... Feels good,
doesn't it...?

259
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,166
Letting the hatred
take control.

260
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,583
It's my turn now.

261
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,125
No!. Not now...!

262
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,291
Please... You can't...

263
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,833
God, this can't be happening!

264
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,625
What? Yomi...

265
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:18,333
Wha...
What's going on...?

266
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,541
Why are you
pointing that at...?

267
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,416
No, wait! Please!.
It's not what you think!

268
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,416
Shut up.

269
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,458
It's-- No...!
Don't even try!

270
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,166
Yomi...

271
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,833
I said shut up!

272
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,791
Yomi!

273
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,666
Happy now?

274
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:27,000
Who are you...?

275
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,791
Are you the one who
led May into darkness?

276
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,250
She led herself...

277
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,291
I just pointed her in
the right direction.

278
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,291
The color of a person's
wings is their choice...

279
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:43,333
The only thing I really do is
help break open the cocoon...

280
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:45,625
With a Bane Stone.

281
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,500
Well, yeah...
Want one?

282
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,791
On the next
Ga-rei: Zero:

283
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,916
Spiral of Sin.
