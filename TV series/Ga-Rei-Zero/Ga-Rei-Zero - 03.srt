1
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:45,291
You were my...
Big sister

2
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,500
You little tramp.

3
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,375
Don't call me that...!

4
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,416
Ever!

5
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,916
On that day,
three years ago...

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,041
I met someone
who was very dear to me.

7
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:10,666
Watch your step, Dad...
Here, let me help.

8
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,083
On that day,
three years ago...

9
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,083
I met a young girl
who was consumed by grief.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,750
It was an afternoon dampened
by the pouring rain.

11
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:37,500
And on that afternoon, destiny
brought these two girls...

12
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:42,083
these causalities
of fate... together.

13
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,875
It was... the beginning
of a story.

14
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,916
Master Tsuchimiya!

15
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,666
Master Tsuchimiya...!

16
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,500
Master Tsuchimiya!

17
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,458
As you are all aware,

18
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,291
our most recent task was
particularly difficult.

19
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,083
It was devastating, in fact,
both to our clan of Vanquishers

20
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,875
and to everyone
who resides among us.

21
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,375
In the end, all of the
phantoms were eliminated...

22
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,833
but unfortunately, Master
Tsuchimiya's wife passed away

23
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,500
in the process.

24
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,208
Even as we speak,

25
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,541
Master Tsuchimiya is
performing the sealing ritual

26
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,291
with the Spirit Eater he
inherited from his late wife.

27
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,750
When he completes the ritual,

28
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,750
Byakuei will be permanently
bonded to his spirit.

29
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,458
As our organization's leader,

30
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,250
Master Tsuchimiya
has always served

31
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,458
as something of a coordinator
for each of the family branches,

32
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,208
but now that he is
host to a Spirit Eater,

33
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,166
he will be of much more
use on the front lines.

34
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,541
This is why it has
become necessary for me

35
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,250
to assume Master
Tsuchimiya's position.

36
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,958
I will try to serve you as
honorably as my predecessor.

37
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,250
Hi, there.

38
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,916
Is it okay
if I sit next to you?

39
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,416
You're Kagura... right?

40
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,375
It's nice
to meet you...

41
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,291
And my name
is Yomi Isayama.

42
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,333
Your father is
the 27th generation

43
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,875
of the Tsuchimiya family
to seal Byakuei to his body...

44
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,750
Control of the Spirit
Eater passed to him

45
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,125
when your mother died,
just as she inherited Byakuei

46
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,625
from the generation
before her.

47
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,958
It's a very important role

48
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,208
that you'll take
on yourself someday.

49
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,291
And as a fellow clan member,
I've been assigned

50
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:08,333
to do everything I possibly
can to help you prepare.

51
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,500
Since your father will be
a lot busier now,

52
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,166
we think you should come live
at our place for a while.

53
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,333
So let's be friends.
What do you say?

54
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,375
Ah, you certainly
have grown, Kagura.

55
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,958
It's been ages since you last
visited us, do you remember?

56
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,041
No, sir.

57
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,291
That's alright...

58
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,666
As young as you
were at the time,

59
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,333
it would be surprising
if you did.

60
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,208
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,958
Right after the meeting
was over, Dad told me

62
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,333
that he was having
second thoughts

63
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,041
about being in charge
of a clan of Vanquishers...

64
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,458
Isn't that ridiculous?

65
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,458
It is a very
honorable position!

66
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,875
And you deserve it,
so stop doubting yourself!

67
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,250
In any case,
we're glad to have you...

68
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,833
Your father has been a dear
friend for a long time...

69
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,500
and that makes you
like family,

70
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,666
so please make yourself
right at home.

71
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,125
Yes, sir.

72
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,958
Come on, I wanna
show you something.

73
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,208
So this is where
you'll be staying.

74
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,916
It's your room now.
I hope you like it.

75
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,000
We can go get the rest
of your things tomorrow...

76
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,750
I'll ask Dad to drive us.

77
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,458
That's okay.

78
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,250
Don't worry,
it's no trouble at all.

79
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,250
You're going to be living
here for a long time...

80
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,333
Think of all you'll need...
like your video games...

81
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,708
and...
your books...

82
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,416
I won't.

83
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,583
I need this.

84
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,208
Just this.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,791
I told you I'd be fast!

86
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,708
Sorry the room's
still kinda messy.

87
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,875
We'll get it spruced up.

88
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:56,875
Okay.

89
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,541
So what'll it be,
tea or juice?

90
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,333
Uh... You pick.

91
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,708
Fine. Tea it is, then.

92
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,708
What about
for your snack...?

93
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,041
What will you have?

94
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,041
Well have a few
potato chips, at least.

95
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,708
We should play a game...
Do you have any favorites?

96
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,875
Not really.

97
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,291
Then what do you
like to do for fun?

98
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,708
When you're alone, I mean.

99
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,125
Oh... I train.

100
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,541
Yomi?

101
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,125
Yeah, what is it?

102
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,291
Your dojo...

103
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,875
Do you think
I could use it?

104
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,000
Master Tsuchimiya
trained you, alright...

105
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,458
That's some serious talent!

106
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,666
That means a lot, thank you.

107
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,958
Want to spar a little?

108
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,250
For practice, of course.

109
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,333
Don't go easy...

110
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,208
I want you to give it
everything you've got.

111
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,416
Y'know for someone your age, you
really have incredible speed...

112
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,000
With a little more training,
you could be unstoppable!

113
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,958
I'm not good.

114
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,083
I'm not very good
at all... Yomi.

115
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,166
You beat me
fair and square.

116
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,666
Don't act like that...

117
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,958
We're only training,
it's nothing serious...

118
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,916
Just try harder
to beat me next time.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,458
On the battlefield,
there is no 'next time.'

120
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,875
What battlefield...?

121
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,541
Don't feel bad
because I beat you.

122
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,625
I'm actually pretty
skilled... no big deal.

123
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,750
In a battle, you never get
to choose the skill level

124
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,333
of your opponent...

125
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,041
My father says...

126
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,166
"To lose is to die".

127
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,208
When warriors allow
themselves to be beaten,

128
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,791
the lives of countless
others are jeopardized...

129
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,041
He says that's

130
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,958
why a Vanquisher's
greatest responsibility

131
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,208
is to stay alive for
as long as possible.

132
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,541
Losing is shameful.

133
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,750
And my father says that it
should never be taken lightly,

134
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,041
even if it happens
in training.

135
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,458
That's pigheaded.

136
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,541
As a matter of fact, that's
one of the most pigheaded things

137
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,291
I've ever heard!

138
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,541
It is?

139
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,208
And he sounds
like a real crank!

140
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,541
A crank?

141
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,291
It doesn't matter
if you won or lost,

142
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,125
if someone says you're
talented, say 'thank you'!

143
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,166
Now it's my turn to
pick what we do next.

144
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,541
Hey. Heads up.

145
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,833
So what food do you hate more
than anything in the world?

146
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,500
Hate...? I was told to be
grateful for what I get.

147
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,708
Your father tell you that?

148
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,458
You hate something.
Spit it out!

149
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,375
Uh...

150
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,541
Century eggs.

151
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,083
Perfect. If you lose,

152
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,500
we're having century egg and
vegetable stir-fry for dinner.

153
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,916
But if you win,

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,166
then I'll make you
something you like instead...

155
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,625
Ready, set, go!

156
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,375
Wait!
I wasn't ready!

157
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,875
On the battlefield, no one
asks you if you're ready!

158
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,791
But... that's
not fair, Ms. omi!

159
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,583
Big Sister Yomi.

160
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,750
I'm not a 'Ms.'

161
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,541
Those century eggs
really hit the spot, huh?

162
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,916
You think...? Good. We can
have them tomorrow night, too!

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Huh?!

164
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,208
Calm down!
I'm messing with you.

165
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:03,083
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's go to my room.

166
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,416
You can stay with me 'til
you're comfortable here.

167
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,416
But...

168
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,833
Bad idea?

169
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,291
Then that settles
it...! Roomie.

170
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,375
But first go change
into your pajamas...

171
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,625
Ready for a rematch?

172
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,750
I didn't know your mother was
in the hospital. Is she okay?

173
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,416
That's a call code we use...

174
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,875
It comes in handy when I need to
get out of class or something.

175
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,208
What's a call code?

176
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,541
It's for my job...

177
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,333
They still only have
me working part-time.

178
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,875
Sorry, Kagura...

179
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,083
but I really have
to be going now.

180
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,458
Don't worry,
I'll be okay.

181
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,208
I know you will...

182
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,958
I'll probably be home late,
so don't wait up for me.

183
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,958
Okay.

184
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,958
Yomi!

185
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,875
The disposal team
is en route now...

186
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,791
They should be
converging on the target

187
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,958
at roughly twenty-one
hundred hours.

188
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,208
Good...
Thank you very much.

189
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,541
I took the liberty
of finding the activity log

190
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,666
for the foreign dispatch team
that died in the plane crash

191
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,291
last month.

192
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,666
It would appear that the team
leader, Professor Mitogahwa,

193
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,375
was searching for
something in Vatican City.

194
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,541
Professor Mitogawa.

195
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,541
His family
practices Shamanism...

196
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,625
And evidently his
area of expertise...

197
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,500
is Bane Stones...
Did he locate any?

198
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,750
No. I've contacted someone
via Foreign Affairs

199
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,791
that may be able
to assist us.

200
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,750
I hope to have
more details soon.

201
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,250
I see. Please continue
to investigate.

202
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,625
I will...

203
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,333
And as for the exorcism
operation the other day...

204
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:14,291
Unfortunately, we're still
unable to confirm purification.

205
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,333
The phantom appears to have
been fully eliminated,

206
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:20,250
but we've yet to find
any hard evidence.

207
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,500
That particular entity was
difficult, even for Byakuei.

208
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,125
It would be unwise of
us to make assumptions.

209
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,000
Don't overlook even the
faintest residual energy.

210
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,875
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,875
So many tragedies since
taking over this position...

212
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,500
Oh, Auntie...

213
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,083
You certainly chose the
optimal window for retirement.

214
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,833
Sorry I'm late.
Been waiting long?

215
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,958
Shall we go?

216
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,916
How was school?
Did you have fun?

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,333
Yeah!

218
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,458
In science class we learned
all about how levers

219
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,666
make it easier to lift things
by using a fulcrum point.

220
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,583
Oh, that's interesting!

221
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,166
School is really important
now because I need to learn

222
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,541
as much as I can in
my developmental years.

223
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,833
My father says.

224
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,791
Hey, Kagura...
What's your favorite food?

225
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,041
Why?

226
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,041
I wanna make something
you love for dinner.

227
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,625
You know, to make up
for the century eggs.

228
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,875
Really?

229
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,541
Your choice.
What would you like?

230
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,916
I'll make
anything you want.

231
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,583
I want cream croquettes!

232
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,333
Did you say
cream croquettes?

233
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,333
You had to pick something
impossible to make, didn't you?

234
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,333
Too hard?

235
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,500
If you want cream croquettes,
that's what you get...

236
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,333
But you've gotta help
me make them, okay?

237
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,333
Sure!

238
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,083
Let's get to the
supermarket, then!

239
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,708
Okay.

240
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,333
I'm sorry, Kagura...
I have to go.

241
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,166
Okay.

242
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,625
Think you can find your
way home from here?

243
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,875
See you tonight?

244
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,291
Depends on how late
I have to work...

245
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,291
Maybe.

246
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,375
Sorry...

247
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,708
Probably not.

248
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,125
Okay.

249
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,958
I'll be home soon.

250
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,250
My mom used
to say that, too.

251
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,583
She told me to wait...

252
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,666
that she'd be home soon.

253
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,541
When she left,
I told her,

254
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,791
that I'd be good
while she was gone.

255
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,333
I told her
to come back soon.

256
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,958
But then...

257
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,041
Mommy!

258
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,166
I'm so sorry...

259
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,916
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,000
I won't ever
leave you alone.

261
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,000
I will always be here
to protect you.

262
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,041
Let's get going...
I'll show you what my job is.

263
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,500
Unless...
you don't want to.

264
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,291
Come with me... We'll go
to work together this time.

265
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,083
Together?

266
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,833
Yeah!

267
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,875
Hop in!

268
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,583
You're late!

269
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,416
Are you crazy, yelling
at a little kid...?

270
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,666
You're going to scare her!

271
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,125
Who is this chick,
anyway...?

272
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,708
You know you can't
bring citizens

273
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,041
on confidential
assignments!

274
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,166
She's not a citizen,
she's a Tsuchimiya.

275
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,375
Wait... like-...

276
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,916
As in the Tsuchimiya family?

277
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,125
These are the Nabu brothers-
Nabu and Nabu.

278
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,291
Nabu... It's a pleasure
to meet you.

279
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,000
Nabu... It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

280
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,208
In case you can't tell,
they're twins.

281
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,125
One's the younger Nabu,
the other's the older Nabu.

282
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,041
Is there a reason they
both have the same name?

283
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,416
Yeah, it's some kind of
custom where they're from.

284
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,708
You're recruiting
new members...?

285
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,333
I'm Kazuki Sakuraba...

286
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,250
You seem a little
young to me, but...

287
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,041
We need all the help we
can get. Welcome to the team!

288
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,916
Noriyuki Izuna.

289
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,416
It's good to have
you on board...

290
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,625
I was just saying
we need more pretty girls.

291
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,791
Oh, were you...?
You lay a finger on her

292
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,166
and I'll snap your neck!

293
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,583
I'm being friendly...
c'mon, Yomi...

294
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,000
You know I only
have eyes for you.

295
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,916
What do you think
you're doing? Knock it off!

296
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,291
Here.

297
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,416
What?

298
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,916
Just take the sword.
That's Michael 12.

299
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,958
It's a pneumatic
Vanquisher's sword.

300
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,708
The master's latest
work. Came today.

301
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,666
You shouldn't be
telling her all this.

302
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,083
If she's a Tsuchimiya,

303
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,916
she should be able
to handle it easy enough.

304
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,750
I didn't say she
couldn't handle it!

305
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,750
If you hold down the trigger
when you draw the sword,

306
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,375
the pressurized air
in the sheath

307
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,541
will triple its cutting
force. Remember that.

308
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,708
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought her along.

309
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,541
Countermeasure Division
to disposal team.

310
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,333
Disposal team here.

311
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,500
We have reports that another
supernatural disturbance

312
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,166
has cropped up in the
Kanda area of Chiyoda Ward.

313
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,333
Proceed to scene.

314
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,250
Copy that.

315
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,166
What's that?

316
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,541
Impressive eyes for
someone so young...

317
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,375
She's a Tsuchimiya, alright.

318
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,250
It's definitely a
leftover from yesterday.

319
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,000
Let's take care of it while it's
still sealed inside the barrier.

320
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,333
We don't want to have to deal
with it if it regenerates.

321
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,916
I'll do it.

322
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,291
But, Yomi...

323
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,500
I want you to watch
carefully, okay...?

324
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:39,583
This is the job
I was telling you about.

325
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,916
We're the disposal team...

326
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,041
a secret branch of the
Ministry of Environment...

327
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,291
We work with the

328
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,583
Supernatural Disaster
Countermeasure Division.

329
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,666
It's our obligation
to rid the world of spirits

330
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,333
who defile
the natural order.

331
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:54,041
That is: to seek out and destroy
phantoms who curse the living.

332
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,541
Ranguren!

333
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,833
Ranguren
is a chimera.

334
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,291
A what?

335
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,416
It's a spirit beast
that resides in Shishio,

336
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,708
Yomi's sacred family sword.

337
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,916
Spirit beast...? Wow.

338
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,791
You fool!

339
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,791
Kagura has been in our care
for less than a week,

340
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,000
and you decided to take her
with you on a field assignment?!

341
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,791
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,750
I only agreed to take
her in in the first place

343
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,375
because you insisted on it!

344
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,375
This will never happen again...
Is that understood?

345
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:36,875
Yes, sir.

346
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,375
I got in trouble.

347
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,500
It's all my fault.

348
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,208
Oh, it's no big deal...

349
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,916
This is the norm
around here... Forget it.

350
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,583
Can I ask
you a question?

351
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,916
What your dad
said earlier...

352
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,500
He said you insisted
that I come stay with you.

353
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,166
Yeah...

354
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,166
But why?

355
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,916
Oh, that's actually
a good question...

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,833
Maybe I just wanted
a little sister.

357
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,875
Really?

358
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,291
Haven't you ever wished you
had a brother or sister?

359
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,833
I don't know...

360
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,625
I'd like having an older sister,
if she was like you, though.

361
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,916
So. Let's be sisters, then.

362
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,416
You mean it?

363
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,000
Of course I mean it!
Starting now, you're my lackey!

364
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,250
I thought
I was your sister!

365
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,958
You are!

366
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,833
And the younger sister's job is
to be the big sister's lackey!

367
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,125
What?!

368
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,333
I want you to have this.
It's a good luck charm.

369
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,625
Really?

370
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,083
Yep... You can keep it
as long as you promise me

371
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,750
that you won't start
working with us part-time

372
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,375
until you're older, okay...?

373
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,166
Otherwise, my father
will yell at me again.

374
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,916
Thank you, big sister!

375
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You're pretty lucky having
someone around to yell at you.

376
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,708
Why is that?

377
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,375
Because... I don't think
I can remember the last time

378
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,708
my father even
talked to me.

379
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,625
Well, he talks during training,
but he's really strict.

380
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,250
The rest of the
time he ignores me.

381
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,666
I see...

382
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,666
But at least you and your
father got to live together.

383
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,333
Some people would say
that's pretty lucky.

384
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,625
My parents are gone...
Have been for a long time.

385
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,250
I thought...

386
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,625
They were both
possessed by phantoms...

387
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,291
I was young at the time...

388
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:15,208
and the phantoms ended
up destroying them.

389
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,375
Luckily, Naraku was there
to eliminate the phantoms

390
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,000
before they could hurt
anyone else...

391
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,916
Then he adopted me
into the Isayama family.

392
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,958
You see that?
That's Shishio.

393
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,291
It's a sacred sword that the
Isayama family has passed down

394
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,583
from generation
to generation.

395
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,750
Even though I'm not
actually a blood relative,

396
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,375
Dad took me in and raised
me like I was his daughter.

397
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,250
And he passed it down to me.

398
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:43,666
Someday I'll prove to him
that I'm worthy of the honor.

399
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,041
I'll accept the same fate as
every Isayama before me...

400
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,666
by proudly taking on the
duties of a Vanquisher.

401
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,208
Vanquisher...?
Duties?

402
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,791
Yes...

403
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,375
Becoming a Vanquisher is the
entire reason for my existence.

404
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,208
Omaht soonman ga

407
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,000
Excuse me, sir...? I just
heard from the hospital;

408
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,125
they said my mom's
condition has changed.

409
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,333
Sure. You can leave early
to see her... I understand.

410
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,416
Thank you again, sir.

411
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,083
Sorry to pull you
out of class again.

412
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,500
Well... It's okay,

413
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,291
but I hate having to lie
to my teachers all the time.

414
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,708
Kagura

415
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,125
You've got slobber
on your face.

416
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,000
This one's going in my "The Many
Faces of Kagura" collection.

417
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,458
I really wish
you'd delete those!

418
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,333
Here, have some pocky.

419
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,833
Smile for the camera!

420
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,375
Here we go!

421
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,083
On the next Ga-Rei Zero...

422
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,875
"The Cause of the Duty."
