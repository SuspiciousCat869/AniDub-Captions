1
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,833
Man... Just when I figure
he's lost his nerve,

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:42,250
suddenly he's knee-deep
in the investigation.

3
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,083
Still, now that
Yomi's conscious,

4
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,625
the least you'd think
he could do

5
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,708
is bring her a get-well
bouquet or something...

6
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,250
He's playing it safe...

7
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,875
Between their engagement
being broken off

8
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,500
and all the other crap happening
the past couple nights...

9
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,833
Hell, can you blame the poor
guy when his former fiancé

10
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,375
is the focus of a
murder investigation?

11
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,375
Then of course there
was the coma...

12
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,750
Let's not forget
that detail.

13
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,125
He might hail from a tough
clan, but anyone's heart

14
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,500
would be brittle under
the circumstances.

15
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,458
It's going to take some
doing before he can see Yomi

16
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,208
as the mother of his heir.

17
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,541
He'll stick by her...

18
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,625
Nori's not the kind of man
who turns tail and bolts

19
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,041
when the going gets tough.

20
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,958
My point exactly...

21
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,375
That's why this is
so difficult for him;

22
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,541
he doesn't do anything
in half steps...

23
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,375
He can't face her again
'til he knows the truth.

24
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:34,625
So they did all come from
the same direction...

25
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,500
Yomi...

26
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,125
Who did this to you?

27
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,666
Wait, that's...

28
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,791
No.

29
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,166
Yomi?!

30
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,208
Where did you go...?

31
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,208
What's going on?

32
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,083
Yomi?!

33
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,291
Attention SDCD...
This is an emergency...

34
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,250
We've got a
Category B disturbance

35
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,375
in the Metro Five vicinity.
Near Kita-Ikebukuro.

36
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,833
The Disposal team
is to-- Yomi's gone!

37
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,875
I don't know where she is!
It's all my fault.

38
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,500
Oh god, it's
all my fault!

39
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,500
Try to calm down,
Kagura...

40
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,791
Focus on explaining
it to me, okay?

41
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,750
Proceed to the
scene immediately.

42
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,291
I see.

43
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,583
We'll dispatch an investigative
unit to the site at once.

44
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,375
Alright.

45
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,416
Don't worry; we're going
to find her, I promise.

46
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,791
None of this
is your fault.

47
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,791
Yomi.

48
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,958
No! That's not
what happened!

49
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,000
Come on...
Pick up...

50
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,625
Please pick up...

51
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,041
The number you have
dialed has been...

52
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,750
Yomi...! Tell
me you're okay...!

53
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,750
Please, I...
I just...

54
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,166
I just need
to hear it...

55
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,375
What is with
this traffic?

56
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,958
Ironically, the freeway's
backed up from the disturbance

57
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,333
we're en route
to deal with, so...

58
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,500
Sounds like we've
got ourselves a race.

59
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:00,083
The Ichigaya
guys again?

60
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,500
That's new.

61
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:06,333
Scenic route!

62
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,791
It's just...

63
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,250
If only she knew how much
I looked up to her, y'know?

64
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:15,541
I fight like I do
because of her.

65
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,958
When my mother died,
she did everything

66
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,083
she could to try
to get me through it.

67
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,000
And here, when she
needed me the most,

68
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,958
what do I do but
just make things worse...

69
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:25,958
Kagura...

70
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,500
I...

71
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,208
I betrayed her...

72
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,375
That's why she's gone.

73
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:35,875
Look, you've always said the two
of you were like sisters, right?

74
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,125
Well there you go;

75
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,416
what sisters don't fight
every once in a while?

76
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,416
Just try to be
patient... Trust me.

77
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,916
She'll see your
side of things.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,166
She's probably mulling
it over right now.

79
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,500
Really...?

80
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,958
You think so?

81
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,333
Of course we do...!

82
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,000
And when the smoke clears
between the two of you,

83
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,000
things'll be even
better than before!

84
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,833
Just think
about it, Kagura...

85
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,708
She obviously cares
a lot about you

86
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,125
or she wouldn't have
gotten so upset.

87
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,333
C'mon... Stuff your face
and focus on the now.

88
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,708
I think someone's got
a job to do, right?

89
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,458
Someone who's
totally awesome!

90
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,500
Who's there?

91
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,333
Yomi, wha...?

92
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,125
What are you doing?

93
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,500
Beg for your life.

94
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,500
What...?
You're mad...!

95
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,583
Fine then...
This is a surprise...

96
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,375
Sorry about what happened
to your wife, by the way.

97
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,833
I presume you're the one
behind the foul turn things

98
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,500
have taken lately?

99
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,083
I presume you
want revenge?

100
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,750
My duties as a Vanquisher take
precedent over my emotions...

101
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,000
I've simply come
here to do a job.

102
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,000
You bore me old man.

103
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,500
You coward!

104
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,166
I'm not here to fight.

105
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,416
I'm just curious to see how
this "foul turn" will play out.

106
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,125
How ass-backwards is it that
those jerks from the MoD

107
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,250
get to tool around in a chopper
while we're sitting in a car...?

108
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,833
It's friggin' medieval.

109
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,708
It's not like this stuff goes
down enough to warrant one...

110
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,000
Helicopter's just
for show, anyway.

111
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,416
You said the same
thing about bikes.

112
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,666
Now he shows up...! Dude...!
Ever consider giving us a call?

113
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,583
Any word on Yomi?

114
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,875
No, nothing yet...
But she's bound to turn up.

115
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,416
Well the good news
is I've got a lead.

116
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I'm going to prove
her innocence.

117
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,125
I'm sure you are.

118
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,250
First things first;
we've got work to do.

119
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,916
All right...
This is your sacred duty.

120
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,833
The number you have dialed
has been disconnected

121
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,958
or is no longer in service.

122
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,583
If you feel you've reached
this recording in error--

123
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,583
Hey.

124
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,458
Nori!

125
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,000
It's alright...
I'm sure she's fine.

126
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,458
Sure, but--

127
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,458
You know her...
Just trust me on this one...

128
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,875
She'll come back.

129
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,375
Yeah.

130
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,875
Nori...

131
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,583
How come you're able to
put so much faith in her?

132
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:24,250
Because there's an enemy
we know nothing about.

133
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,375
They've done
this to her...

134
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,791
I don't have enough proof just
yet, but I know it in my gut.

135
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,083
So then...

136
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,541
So then... I'm a fool
not to have seen it.

137
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,291
I'm a fool, too.

138
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,791
And it's my fault;
not yours.

139
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,875
Kagura...

140
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,166
The...
The bodies!

141
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,875
Guys, we've got Latchers!

142
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,208
Take 'em down with
whatever you've got!

143
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,333
Kazuki!

144
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,333
Hey.

145
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,625
What is all this?

146
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,041
Same old, same old...

147
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,625
Buncha Latchers.
They've made their home

148
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,375
in what's left of
the Mobile Squad...

149
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,458
When did they show up?

150
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,083
Long enough ago
to be ripe...

151
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,375
It's been a free-for-all
since we got here.

152
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,375
Really...

153
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,541
Ya think someone's
pulling the strings?

154
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,916
Pulling the
strings...? Who?

155
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,916
You know exactly who...
The bastards who attacked Yomi!

156
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,250
The hell?!

157
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,875
Now what?

158
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,250
What the...?

159
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,375
Is this a joke?

160
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,333
Hello...

161
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,083
Sunshine.

162
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,416
Quit playing around, Yomi...
This isn't funny...

163
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,041
She's not...
I think she means it.

164
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,833
Yomi...
This isn't you.

165
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,541
Uh oh...

166
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,583
Everybody scatter!

167
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,583
Yomi, I...
Kagura!

168
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,250
Crap...!

169
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't do it!

170
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,833
Damn!

171
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,708
Are you okay?

172
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,291
Kazuki!

173
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,166
Sorry...

174
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,875
Look.

175
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,583
This just isn't our day.

176
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,583
Who the hell left
the barn door open?

177
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,791
Everybody hold your positions,
and get ready to fight back!

178
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,083
Izuna!

179
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,958
I want you
to track down Yomi.

180
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,291
Go ahead...

181
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,833
We ought to be able
to hold our own without you

182
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,375
for a little while.

183
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,541
Now!

184
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,375
I'm going, too!

185
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,791
Kagura...

186
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,458
Please!

187
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:51,208
Why not...? Hordes of uglies
like this shouldn't take much.

188
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,750
Right...! Let's put the
hurt on these bastards.

189
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,750
Stand firm!

190
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,750
Nobody even think
of dying on me!

191
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,125
Yeah, yeah...

192
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,166
Come on!

193
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,000
What's this?

194
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,708
A utility conduit.

195
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,458
And that is...?

196
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:19,875
Like a lifeline running
underneath the whole city.

197
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,291
You think
Yomi's down there?

198
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,583
Possibly... In any case
we'd better check it out.

199
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,000
Look behind you!

200
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,875
So, what's going
to happen to her?

201
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,291
I mean you...

202
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,375
you really think
she's gone rogue...?

203
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,916
If she has...

204
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We can bring her back,
right...?

205
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,000
Nori?

206
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,166
Stop it!

207
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,666
Sorry...

208
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,666
Let's just leave it.

209
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,333
Yeah, sure.

210
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,833
How do we know
which one to go down?

211
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,458
I think we're gonna
have to split up.

212
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,583
Wait, what?

213
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,083
Don't worry
about it, Kagura.

214
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,458
You go down that one...

215
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:26,625
If anything happens,
I'll come running.

216
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,125
Same goes for you, okay?

217
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:47,125
So you don't come
to the hospital ...

218
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:51,125
But you've got no problem
with tracking me down here.

219
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,416
Yomi...

220
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, it's okay;
I get it...

221
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,916
Your conscience is eating
away at you, I'm sure...

222
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,500
You had to work
up the nerve...

223
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,041
I mean, no one expects you
to want to walk down the aisle

224
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,833
with a homicidal
mute-slash-cripple,

225
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,875
but you can't just come
right out and say it.

226
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,000
I had to know...!

227
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,541
I needed to find
who did this to you...

228
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,166
I just...

229
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,375
I didn't wanna come
and see you empty-handed...

230
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,083
I'm sorry.

231
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,208
Sweet as that is, it's
really a moot point now.

232
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
For that matter...
Mostly everything is.

233
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,291
You have to kill me.

234
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,791
Last I checked...

235
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,083
It's your sacred duty
to dispose of spirits

236
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,875
whose presence defiles
the natural order.

237
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,250
And like it or not, love...
I fall into that group.

238
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,583
Come on...
Just do it.

239
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,750
You're out
of your mind...

240
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,333
Kill me.

241
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,541
Kill me.

242
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,416
You are
so predictable...

243
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,625
Ranguren, come.

244
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,875
Kazuki!

245
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,833
Hey...
How's it goin'...?

246
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,958
Sorry.

247
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:33,250
Why don't I make your job
a little easier for you...?

248
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,541
Kill me,
or I kill him.

249
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,166
No...! He's got nothing
to do with this!

250
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,291
Don't deny it;
of course he does...

251
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,375
He was always coming
between the two of us.

252
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,458
Frankly, I lost count of how
many times you preferred

253
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,333
his company over mine.

254
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,958
Don't!

255
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,041
Yomi!

256
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,708
You're doing
this to him.

257
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:02,500
You can put an end to it
by doing your job...

258
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,833
But... I've gotta say,
I don't think he's going

259
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,583
to hold out
for very long.

260
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,500
Stop!

261
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,250
Come on, man...

262
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,291
The hell you
waiting for...?

263
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,208
Kill her...!

264
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,583
It's...

265
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:19,208
It's too late...
There's no going back!

266
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,541
Couldn't have put
it better myself...

267
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,166
You've got the means
right there at your feet.

268
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,458
I suggest you hurry.

269
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,541
Oh hey, here's
a thought...

270
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,458
Let's pretend
it's all a game.

271
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,833
Your favorite
in fact: ...

272
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,708
Darts.

273
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,333
Noriyuki...

274
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,458
Please.
Help me.

275
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,916
Here's the
single point...

276
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,333
The double point...
The triple...

277
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,208
Please!

278
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,250
No! Don't do it, Yomi!

279
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,833
Don't do it!

280
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,166
Yomi! Stop this!

281
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,583
Poor guy...

282
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,291
I wonder if he could bring
himself to fight her

283
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,541
if it came to that?

284
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,083
If you have to spill
someone's blood, kill me!

285
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,791
What am I
babbling about...?

286
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,333
He's the only person
in the world

287
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,500
who likes Yomi
more than I do.

288
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,500
It's a good game.

289
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,500
Listen to me!

290
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,208
If we find her...

291
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,791
you'll help her go back
to the way she was...

292
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,791
right?

293
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,166
I can see why
you got hooked...

294
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,416
Kill me.

295
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,041
Nori... yuki...

296
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,375
Kill me now.

297
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,166
Yomi...

298
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,291
Kill me!

299
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,500
Help. Me!

300
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,166
He won't come...
You can take my word for it.

301
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,208
He doesn't have...

302
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,541
The guts.

303
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,416
Kagura!

304
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,875
What the...?

305
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,000
Ranguren!

306
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,583
Thought you'd shake
me that easily...?

307
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,208
Poor thing.

308
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,875
How can you
be so naïve?

309
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,041
Please... I...

310
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,625
Hurts like hell...
doesn't it...?

311
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,041
Could be a lot
worse, though...

312
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:45,000
I could let you
suffer indefinitely.

313
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,375
But why...

314
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,416
Why me?

315
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,750
I don't understand.

316
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,833
Why are you
doing this to me?

317
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,416
You were my...
big sister...

318
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,458
You little tramp.

319
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,458
Don't call me
that...! Ever!

320
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,250
Well, well, well...
Good timing.

321
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,000
Father?

322
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:24,125
What a shame... To think
you'd be led astray.

323
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:33,333
You call it a shame,
I call it a blessing.

324
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,875
On the next
Ga-rei: Zero -

325
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,791
Turmoil of Fates.
