1
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,291
Nori's taken off.

2
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,333
Don't blame him.

3
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,708
Fighting would've sapped
his will to live...

4
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,375
If you have to die,

5
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:51,625
best do it while you've still
got a sense of purpose, right?

6
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,208
Death's purpose
doesn't worry me...

7
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,958
It's life's.

8
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,625
Kagura.

9
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,083
I'm here for you, Sis....

10
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,708
Talk to me.

11
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,625
Pursuit Squad Team
Two is unresponsive!

12
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:42,333
Team Three's offline
as well; what do we do?

13
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,416
The transmitter.

14
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,375
This is the Ground Team.

15
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:52,500
We've lost contact with the
squad tracking Yomi Isayama...

16
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,750
Apologies for fudging it.

17
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,750
Come on, don't
sound so bleak...

18
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,500
You fellas did a
bang-up job on the wrapping.

19
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,125
Hell, our team'd still be white-
knuckling it through traffic

20
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,125
if you hadn't swooped down
and plucked us out of there.

21
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:10,541
Far as I'm concerned,
you're guardian angels.

22
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,166
Hey...
The briefcase guy...

23
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,125
He still around?

24
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,750
I owe him
an apology at least.

25
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,625
You missed your chance.

26
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,875
Damn...
Sorry to hear that.

27
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,833
I've got
some bad news...

28
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,833
Yomi's wiped out all
of the Pursuers...

29
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,750
Which means we can't get
a lock on her aura...

30
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,875
If either of you have any ideas
how to find her, I'm all ears.

31
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,375
The stone is resonating...

32
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:46,750
Hang on... I think
I can get a fix on her.

33
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,083
We're close...
We have to be.

34
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,416
I'm losing...

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,041
control of my mind.

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,041
This surge...

37
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,666
It's too much...

38
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,208
I can't take it...

39
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,666
The sadness...

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,166
The hate...

41
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,291
All at once...

42
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,041
No, they...

43
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:26,583
They can't be the only
thing I've got...

44
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,333
Please stop...

45
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,583
This is not
what I signed up for...

46
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,416
Oh yes it is...

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,208
Someone didn't read
the fine print, did they...?

48
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,208
The Bane Stone thrives
on the strongest part of you.

49
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,208
Raw emotion...

50
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:46,333
You'll get the hang of it
in no time, believe me.

51
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,166
Why should
I believe you...?

52
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,750
Unless...

53
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,916
Unless I'm just too stupid
to know what I really want...

54
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,250
What I want...

55
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,666
What I need...

56
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,083
There she is...

57
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,416
Take us down.

58
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,958
We finally got a lock...
Bring us in low.

59
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,750
Yomi.

60
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,083
Okay. Where to?

61
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,916
She's near...
I can feel it.

62
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,208
Well, these guys
look hospitable...

63
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,833
Ten to one they're attracted
to the Bane Stone.

64
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,208
Whaddaya say we give
'em a little dance?

65
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,916
Nabu...
I like this tune.

66
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,291
Nice one.

67
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,500
Category... D.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,458
Go on... He and
I've got your back.

69
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,166
Nabu... We'll
worry about them.

70
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,125
Are ya ready?

71
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,625
Yomi...

72
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,750
Well it's about time...
Kagura...

73
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,666
I figured we'd both
live to see this moment.

74
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,833
How's your dad
by the way? At peace?

75
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,916
I...

76
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,125
We were able to have
a long talk about things.

77
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,875
It was a good talk.

78
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,291
He showed me a side of
him I'd never seen before.

79
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,833
In fact, for the first it
felt like we were a family.

80
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,000
A real family.

81
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,708
Huh...

82
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,750
You know my family
was taken from me

83
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,208
when I was
really little, too.

84
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,875
My adoptive father became
my family. My whole world.

85
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,750
Then there was you:
my little sister.

86
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,416
But then I guess that's
not a real family, is it?

87
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,333
That's not what I meant.

88
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,291
Please forgive me...

89
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,291
I believed in you...

90
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,458
I really did...

91
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:44,208
But... I realize
that wasn't enough.

92
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,583
It's my fault... because I
refused to accept the truth...

93
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,083
I was selfish, I ...

94
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,541
I needed you to be
something you weren't,

95
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,125
when if I'd just looked -

96
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,541
really looked-
at what was going on,

97
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,750
I might've been able
to be what you needed.

98
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,250
I'm sorry, Yomi.

99
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,875
It's too late.

100
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,458
I know...
Believe me, I do.

101
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,916
Famous last words?

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,416
Or maybe... Just the
last words I'll hear?

103
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,750
Yomi...

104
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,750
Important distinction,
dontcha think...?

105
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,250
Ranguren!

106
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,125
Hear me...
Lend me your strength...

107
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,750
Eater of souls...

108
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,291
Come forth!

109
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:07,041
You've finally
drawn your sword...

110
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,458
So... use it.

111
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,041
What are you doing?

112
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,208
You are so pathetic...

113
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,916
Roar wave...!
Hit her now!

114
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,416
Byakuei!

115
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,625
Stop...! Please!

116
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,750
I want you to beg
for your life...

117
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,291
That's right...

118
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,041
It'll make hearing you beg
for death that much sweeter.

119
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,125
May begged for her life
like a little coward.

120
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:20,458
Uncle Yu flopped around the
room like a hooked marlin...

121
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,750
Kazuki shrieked like
a twelve-year-old girl.

122
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,291
Zinguji cried out.
Nikaido pleaded.

123
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:31,833
Hmph. Both with their chins
to the ground, I might add.

124
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,875
Was your beloved father
any different...?

125
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,500
Did he writhe...?
I bet he did...

126
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,041
Good for you though,
right...?

127
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,458
It's not every day
you inherit a Spirit Beast...

128
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,541
Level with me;
in all honesty...

129
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,958
To see him die...
You'd have settled for less.

130
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,916
What a farce...!

131
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,166
Come on...!

132
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,125
You've got
what you need:

133
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,541
Byakuei!

134
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,833
Strength!

135
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,916
Take this seriously!

136
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,791
Oh, God...

137
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,083
Noriyuki.

138
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,083
Nori.

139
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,750
Go.

140
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,250
Ranguren...

141
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,125
Roar Wave!

142
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,333
C'mon, let's get
you outta here.

143
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,083
Thanks for that.
I mean it.

144
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,916
It's okay, y'know...
I couldn't.

145
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,875
Great then.
We're both cowards.

146
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,708
Just because we can't bring
ourselves to kill her,

147
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,666
doesn't mean she'll do us
the same courtesy.

148
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,791
I ran into her in
the utility conduit.

149
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,125
I... I coulda
done it then...

150
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,166
She wanted me to.

151
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,958
She begged.

152
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,291
Nori...

153
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,750
It's not okay...

154
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,458
I deserve
all the blame I get.

155
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,750
Are you ready
to do this?

156
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,541
As I'll ever be.

157
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,875
It's a Vanquisher's duty
to dispose of spirits

158
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,458
whose presence defiles
the natural order.

159
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,833
Good...

160
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,708
Spoken like a pro.

161
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:00,083
Thank you... Yomi.

162
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:09,875
It's nice to meet you...
And my name is Yomi Isayama.

163
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,166
So. Let's be
sisters then!

164
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:19,041
You're so adorable!

165
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,083
Kagura...

166
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,666
Kagura...

167
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,166
Kagura...

168
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,166
Kagura...

169
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,875
It'll be okay...

170
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,291
Really.

171
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,875
At least, this time around,
I have a little sister.

172
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,041
I love you.

173
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,041
I do...

174
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,416
And I always will.

175
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,250
Predictable...!

176
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,916
I thought I taught you
a shared strike is a loss!

177
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,875
This ends now!

178
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,166
Bane Stone...

179
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,375
If it's true you feed off
of the raw emotion

180
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,000
gnawing away
inside of me...

181
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:12,291
Then you must know what
it is I really want...

182
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,250
My deepest wish...

183
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,041
My only wish...

184
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,291
Is to protect Kagura...

185
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,875
From unhappiness...

186
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,500
From the cold, cruel
whims of hard luck...

187
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:31,833
From liars,
users, cheats...

188
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,041
From high-minded idiots...

189
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,166
who'd think nothing of
putting her in harm's way...

190
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,500
From heartbreak
and disappointment...

191
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,958
From herself...

192
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,458
But...

193
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:48,208
most of all...
whatever it takes...

194
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,541
protect her....

195
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,583
from me...

196
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,750
Protect Kagura from me!

197
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,291
You've gotten good...

198
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,791
Really good.

199
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,458
Yomi...

200
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,958
And strong...

201
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,625
Wow...

202
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,791
Who'd have thought...?

203
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:55,250
My little sister...
How proud am I?

204
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:03,125
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry...

205
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,458
I love you, too.

206
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,208
No...

207
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,416
Not this...

208
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,125
Not now.

209
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,625
I...

210
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,750
I won't hold back!

211
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,208
Byakuei! Devour!

212
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,791
Kagura's slain the one person
who meant the most to her...

213
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,166
From this moment on...
She's changed...

214
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,666
That's the price we all
pay as Vanquishers...

215
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,291
We trade our feelings for the
ability to do what's right.

216
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,083
Nabu -you're wrong.

217
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,166
Duty. Feeling...

218
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,500
What difference is there...?

219
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:33,375
After tonight, for her,
there will be none......

220
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,541
That is the price we pay.

221
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,333
Nabu.

222
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,791
Her heart is
still so young...

223
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:43,500
Yet never again will she
bring it close to someone.

224
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,916
Well... She does have to protect
herself from the pain...

225
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,458
whatever her age is...

226
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,875
That said...

227
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,750
Maybe it's
not so simple.

228
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,291
Everything turned
on its head...

229
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,375
All over a simple
little wish...

230
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,791
Could it be that she
mastered the Bane Stone...?

231
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,958
Or was the Stone
just playing along?

232
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,958
Who can say...?

233
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,791
But at least this is
hardly the last word.

234
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:30,333
There's still time...
More than enough, I think...

235
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,916
I'll just wait
in the wings...

236
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,833
Pick my moment.
As always.

237
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,541
Ah, Miss Zinguji.

238
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,416
Hello there...
Have you seen Kiri?

239
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,666
As a matter
of fact, I have...

240
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,708
She's sitting out
in the courtyard.

241
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,791
Big Sister Ayame!

242
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,666
Well someone seems very
lively today, don't they?

243
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,583
I had a really
bad nightmare.

244
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,875
You did?

245
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,791
There was this mean
girl in black...

246
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,666
She stabbed me right
in the tummy...

247
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,750
You were there;
she'd got you too...

248
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,833
You said you'd see
me again in heaven.

249
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,125
Ah...
So, then...

250
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,750
What did this
girl in black do?

251
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,541
She left
to go somewhere...

252
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,375
It felt...

253
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,583
Like she was in pain.

254
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,875
Hey... Are you gonna stay
with me all afternoon?

255
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,583
I can think of
nothing I'd like more.

256
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,250
Really?!

257
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,666
See? I told you breaking
things off was the way to go.

258
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,708
From now on, you're officially
the only psychic I'll ever see.

259
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,750
I predict great things
for you, then.

260
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,541
Seriously.
How do you do it?

261
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,958
You have to tell me!

262
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,250
I'll tell you what...
Take me to lunch...

263
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,916
and you've got a deal.

264
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,458
That's two of these
damn things this month.

265
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,875
New orders from HQ...
They want us to move.

266
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,750
Come on...!
This is ridiculous!

267
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,791
Are we retired
or aren't we?

268
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,333
'Kay, here's
a weird one for you:

269
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,083
you think it was real?

270
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,500
Huh?

271
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,333
I'm talking about the
whole ghost hunter thing,.

272
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,333
It's been two years since she
fell off the face of the earth.

273
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,291
Sometimes I think there really
was something to all that stuff.

274
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,541
You know?

275
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,750
Maybe.

276
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,166
I wish her all the best.

277
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,791
Yeah. So do I.

278
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,291
Wherever she is.

279
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,625
Ugh... Really...?

280
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,791
You can eat at
a time like this?

281
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,166
Well yeah... I've gotta make
sure I'm on top of my game.

282
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,291
I don't get how your stomach's
not churning right now.

283
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,291
I'm used to it...

284
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,333
Which is a pretty good thing
to be in this line of work.

285
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:07,500
The legendary Michael Thirteen
pneumatic Vanquisher sword...

286
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,958
It's all yours...

287
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,666
Think of it as
a Christmas gift...

288
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,041
Ho-ho!

289
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,250
Thanks...

290
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,916
I'll treasure it.

291
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,625
Why do these things

292
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:23,166
always have to pick
major landmarks to haunt?

293
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,541
If this is truly
our duty... Let's go.

294
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,208
Heh...
I have a feeling

295
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,958
that attitude is gonna
take you places, Kensuke...

296
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,541
Now let's do what
we came here for.

297
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,541
Come Byakuei...

298
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,791
Release!
