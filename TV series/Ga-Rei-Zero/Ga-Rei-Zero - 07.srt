1
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,416
The... Ministry
of Environment?

2
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,750
Yeah... We're
government agents...

3
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,416
The Supernatural Disaster
Countermeasure Division.

4
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,541
Basically, it's our job
to dispose of any ghosts

5
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,333
in the area.

6
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:53,083
Kagura!

7
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,375
Yomi... Yomi!

8
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,125
I'm so sorry!

9
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,250
Yomi... Yomi...

10
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,333
I had to.

11
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,458
I'm sorry!

12
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,541
Yomi!

13
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,041
Tsuchimiya!

14
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,291
Yatchin?

15
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,416
What the heck
is going on?! Tell us!

16
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,166
Her first Category D
was someone she knew?

17
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,166
That must have
been hard on her.

18
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,750
Not only that,

19
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,958
but it was a Latcher controlling
her acquaintance's dead body.

20
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,416
Not a simple phantom.

21
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,208
I see.

22
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,041
Since the incident,
paranormal activity has declined

23
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,291
and spirit pressure

24
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,666
has returned to normal
in all areas.

25
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,208
What about
the singularity?

26
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,125
There haven't been any
reports of it being seen

27
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,208
since it last appeared
near the Arakawa River

28
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,541
at nineteen hundred
fifty hours.

29
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,500
That makes me nervous...

30
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,583
I want the disposal team
downgraded to standby...

31
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,875
Have the observation
team keep a close watch.

32
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:52,875
Right.

33
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,250
And also...

34
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,333
Tell Kagura that I'd like
her to take some time off.

35
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,666
That's a good idea...

36
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,750
As much as we might like
to keep her around to help

37
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,375
with the workload, someone
in her fragile mental state

38
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,500
could easily make mistakes

39
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,500
that would put
the whole team at risk.

40
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,250
What a cold way
of putting it.

41
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,916
I could try to make this easier
for Kagura if you'd like.

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,666
If you have any ideas,
I'd love to hear them.

43
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,916
What do you think about

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,250
giving Yomi Isayama
some time off, too...?

45
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,833
If Kagura believes she's
being given special treatment,

46
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,416
she won't be able to relax
during her time away...

47
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,125
Yomi can keep her company
while providing mental care.

48
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,375
My.

49
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,375
What is it?

50
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,833
Oh, nothing...

51
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,333
I just didn't realize your
coldness could be so sweet.

52
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,333
Excuse me?

53
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,625
As I'm sure you've all
heard, Nurse Nakabayashi

54
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,166
was recently killed
in a car accident.

55
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,666
A new nurse, Itabashi, has
been assigned to replace her.

56
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,166
The Health Committee
will have a short meeting

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,791
right after school...

58
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,833
Are you paying attention,
Miss Manabe?

59
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,250
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,708
Make sure you
remember to attend.

61
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,291
You wanted to speak
with me, Brother?

62
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,083
I've decided to transfer
responsibility

63
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,000
for the family to Yomi...

64
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,041
a bit...
sooner than expected.

65
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,458
But Naraku...
Don't tell me-

66
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,916
No, don't worry, Yu.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,041
I'm not dying... At least,
not that I know of, anyway.

68
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,375
Of course, when you're as old
as I am, anything can happen.

69
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,666
I'll be able to breathe easier
if the transfer takes place

70
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,291
while I can still walk.

71
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,875
I understand.

72
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,916
I've decided to make
everything official

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,583
when we have
the next clan meeting...

74
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,000
I simply
don't see the point

75
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,250
in delaying the
inevitable any longer...

76
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,791
Yu... I want you to make the
arrangements for the ceremony...

77
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,541
Will you?

78
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,708
That's quite an honor...

79
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,250
May.

80
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,333
Yes, Father?

81
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,166
You heard what
your uncle said...

82
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,541
I'll need your help
with the preparations.

83
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,125
Yes, sir.

84
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,750
Takahashi.
Here.

85
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,291
Tamiya.
Here.

86
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,291
Tsumura.
Here.

87
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,500
Tsuchimiya...

88
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,750
Is Tsuchimiya
absent again?

89
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,125
Oh...
Please, come in.

90
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,250
Is there something
I can do for you today?

91
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,791
No...
Not really...

92
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,166
Thank you.

93
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,208
I see. In any case,
I'm the new school nurse.

94
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,958
You can call me Nurse Itabashi.
It's nice to meet you.

95
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,916
Um... hi.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,208
May I ask what
happened to your leg?

97
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,250
Oh... it was...

98
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,541
just some glass.

99
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,458
Come here.

100
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,833
Have a seat.

101
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,666
Yes, ma'am.

102
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,541
Glass, huh?
What happened?

103
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,208
I... broke a window.

104
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,416
How dangerous.

105
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,791
It looks like it's
healing up nicely...

106
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,958
I doubt you'll
even have a scar.

107
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,750
You should
be more careful.

108
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,708
Girls are delicate.

109
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,583
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,083
All set.
Good as new.

111
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,250
Thank you
for your help.

112
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,416
If it needs to be changed
again, please come see me.

113
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll put a fresh
one on for you.

114
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,583
Oh, no. I didn't
hurt you, did I?

115
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,291
No...
It's not that...

116
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,250
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,833
I'm sorry...

118
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,375
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,875
I'm so sorry...

120
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,166
I just...

121
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,250
I'm sorry!

122
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,208
I'm so sorry...

123
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,500
Please...

124
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,916
I'm sorry!

125
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,666
Please, forgive me.

126
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,416
Why are you crying?

127
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,041
You're the one who
killed her, remember?

128
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,708
Yatchin!

129
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,833
You did kill her, didn't you?
So what are you crying about?

130
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:12,125
Don't just sit there;
say something!

131
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,333
I said say something,
murderer...!

132
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,541
What are you crying for?

133
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,625
Yatchin...

134
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,250
Who are you going
to kill next, Kagura? Me?

135
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,291
Take it easy...

136
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,166
I'm right, huh...?

137
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,916
You're going to kill Miku
and me both, aren't you?

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,375
Stop it!

139
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,291
And I liked you!

140
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:33,333
I liked you, Kagura...
I liked you and her.

141
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,125
Why did it have to
turn out like this?

142
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,916
Don't just stand
there, staring...!

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,250
Don't you have anything to say
for yourself after what you did?

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,625
Open your mouth
and say something!

145
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,208
Stop it!

146
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,000
Go ahead...
Hit me.

147
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,291
I don't blame you...

148
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,500
You can hit me
as much as you want.

149
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,375
I deserve it...
It's my job...

150
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,375
but that doesn't
make it right.

151
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,083
It isn't like
I wanted to kill her...

152
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,125
I just wanted to
protect her...

153
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,375
I don't know why it
happened this way!

154
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,083
Tsuchimiya...

155
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,916
It's because...
I was wrong.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,041
I shouldn't've done it.
I was wrong; I know that now!

157
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:31,083
So go ahead...! You're
right to be mad at me!

158
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,583
Just hit me...
as much as you want.

159
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,875
I won't stop you.

160
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,500
You... big dummy.

161
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,791
Yatchin...

162
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,666
I'm home!

163
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,041
Yomi, hello.

164
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,041
Uncle Yu. May.

165
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,416
Hello. Are you here
to see my dad?

166
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,291
No... Our business
is done for the day.

167
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,291
Naraku tells me you're doing
excellent work... Yomi.

168
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,291
Excellent...?
I wouldn't say that.

169
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,500
Don't be so modest.

170
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,458
You're carrying the
Shishio, after all...

171
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:22,625
It only stands to reason you
would make a name for yourself.

172
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,375
That weapon is our most
sacred family heirloom...

173
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,250
Under normal
circumstances,

174
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,583
you never even would
have held it, so-

175
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,416
You would do well to
remember that. Are we clear?

176
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,250
Yes.

177
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,416
What's wrong... Yomi?

178
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,083
It's nothing.

179
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,833
Take care of yourself.

180
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,083
Yeah...

181
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,041
I guess the Tsuchimiyas have
always been a Vanquisher family.

182
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,250
Someday it'll be my turn

183
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,666
to become a full-fledged
Vanquisher, too...

184
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,166
which means that I'll bond with
our family's Spirit Beast.

185
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,416
Its name is Byakuei

186
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,916
and it's been in our
family for generations.

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,333
I'll have to bind Byakuei to
my soul in order to keep it

188
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,750
sealed to us.

189
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,625
Every Tsuchimiya
before me has done it,

190
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:15,208
and it won't be long
before the duty passes to me.

191
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,791
Wait, so then all those times
you were absent from school,

192
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:18,875
and those texts
from the hospital

193
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,041
that got you out early-

194
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,458
Yep...They were all part of my
responsibilities to my family.

195
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,208
That is really messed up.

196
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,958
I just can't believe
there's a family out there

197
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,375
that forces a kid to
take on that kind of job!

198
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,208
I'm only doing the work
my family has always done.

199
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,916
That's even more messed up.
You didn't ask for this.

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
How can they drop
all that in your lap?

201
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,750
I don't know...

202
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,750
I just know
this is my fate.

203
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,458
That's the worst part...!

204
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,916
All this 'duty' and 'fate'
talk, it's ridiculous!

205
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,916
But I guess if it's
something you really feel

206
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,541
like you have to do,
then I can't stop you.

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,875
Well, I don't want to...
It's just how things are.

208
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,708
Something wrong?

209
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,041
No... Sorry,
it's nothing.

210
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,708
Hey...

211
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,083
You don't really want to inherit
that family job someday, do you?

212
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,416
Well, I-

213
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,333
Ma'am.

214
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,250
Oh, hello, Kiri.

215
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,416
Look at this.

216
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,833
We received a report from the
spirit energy observation team.

217
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,250
The singularity
has reappeared.

218
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,416
Oh, dear... It seems
there are two now.

219
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,958
We've tracked its progress,

220
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,916
and the larger one's energy
field is smaller than it was.

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,875
You're suggesting...
the singularity has divided.

222
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,833
Well, ma'am.
It's a possibility.

223
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,875
Good job...

224
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,958
It's too bad you're dead.

225
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,500
You would've been
sliced in two.

226
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,208
A shared strike is a loss...

227
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,000
It doesn't do you any
good to gain an opening

228
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,166
if it means you lose
an arm in the process.

229
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,291
Try to remember that.

230
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,666
I will.

231
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,916
Still... You've
gotten much better...

232
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,250
I'd been training
a lot longer than you

233
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,833
before I learned to deflect
like you just did.

234
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,500
Yomi...

235
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,875
I just...

236
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,083
I don't know if I should
keep training like this.

237
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,083
Kagura...

238
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm scared, Yomi.

239
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,125
I don't think I really
understood what it meant to do

240
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,958
this kind of work...

241
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,916
I was so amazed when I saw
you use your Spirit Beast...

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,375
It all seemed so cool,
fighting evil spirits

243
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,583
and protecting people
all the time...

244
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,125
But now...

245
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,541
I don't know...
I'm not sure.

246
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,625
Kagura.

247
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,958
Whaddaya think
I should do?

248
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,458
I don't know either.

249
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,958
I can tell you to keep at it
or that you should quit...

250
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,250
but either way, it's
your decision to make...

251
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,500
Nobody else can
make it for you...

252
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,708
You'll have to choose.

253
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,916
You can worry about it
all you want for now...

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,083
But it doesn't matter
what anyone else says.

255
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,125
All that matters is you follow
what you truly believe

256
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,625
in your heart...

257
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,208
I don't think I would have
been able to make it this far

258
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,333
if I hadn't.

259
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,250
You wouldn't?

260
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,166
And whatever it
is you decide to do,

261
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,750
even if that's not working
with us anymore...

262
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,958
I'll stand by you, okay?

263
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,500
I swear...

264
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,958
I'll always be there
to support you.

265
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,791
Ah... It's Yatchin.

266
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,250
One of your friends
from the other day?

267
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah... She wants
to take me out to lunch.

268
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,583
Great...! Sounds like
a pretty good friend...

269
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,583
She must appreciate what
you're going through.

270
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,958
Not entirely...
Maybe some.

271
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,541
That's enough... Hey,
at least she's trying...

272
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,833
Now go get some lunch.

273
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,333
Bye! See ya later!

274
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,375
Hi, Noriyuki.

275
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,000
Yomi?

276
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,833
May...

277
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,000
I am a little
relieved, though.

278
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,416
About what?

279
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,208
Kagura seems to be
cheering up a little.

280
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,583
Yeah, I shoulda guessed you
were thinking of Kagura.

281
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:12,250
She reminds me a lot of
myself when I was her age.

282
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,750
How so?

283
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,791
A Spirit Beast
killed her family.

284
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,833
She really had no choice
but to become a Vanquisher.

285
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,666
That's hard to go
through alone.

286
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,708
All I wanted to do
was protect her...

287
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,250
to keep her from having to
feel the same pain I did.

288
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,208
Yomi...

289
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,583
I wanted to keep
her safe forever.

290
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:33,416
Maybe I thought
I could... But...

291
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,250
I guess that's over now.

292
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:40,708
I'm starting to think Kagura
doesn't need me anymore.

293
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,083
You should see the girl train.

294
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,833
She's picking up techniques
in a few minutes

295
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,000
that took me years to learn.

296
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,041
It won't be much longer before
she's the better warrior.

297
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,000
Kid's got a knack for combat.

298
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,333
It's not just a 'knack.'
It's in her blood.

299
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,583
She was born to the
Tsuchimiya family,

300
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,000
which holds the
strongest Spirit Beast...

301
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,416
And it's obvious that
she has the innate talent

302
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,125
that comes from such a long line
of incredible Vanquishers...

303
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,416
Kagura has something
in her that I never will,

304
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,833
no matter how much I try.

305
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,333
Yomi...

306
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,208
And in spite of it all,
she hasn't decided

307
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,291
if she even wants the job
she's inheriting...

308
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,208
It's ironic.

309
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,833
You've worked hard preparing
to be the successor

310
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,166
to the Isayama family...

311
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,708
There isn't anybody who's
more skilled with a sword...

312
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,250
Plus, people've been calling
you a prodigy for years now.

313
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,958
You're right...

314
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,208
but there are still some
people I just can't satisfy.

315
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,250
You don't need to keep proving
yourself over and over...

316
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,791
You should be
more confident.

317
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,166
I guess you're right.

318
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,125
And if anybody puts you down...
They'll answer to me.

319
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,791
You say worse things about
me than anyone I know.

320
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,458
I could say the same
to you... couldn't I?

321
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,291
Hello?

322
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,916
Hi, Yomi! It's me.

323
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,625
I'm with Yatchin and Miku.

324
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,708
Good... Are you
girls having fun?

325
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,958
Remember how she said
she'd pay for me...?

326
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,250
Well, I lost a card game
so now I have to pay!

327
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,583
Is that right?

328
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,041
I was just calling to see
what you wanted to have

329
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,291
for dinner tonight.

330
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,583
I don't know.

331
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,916
I can cook
if you want me to.

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,041
Yeah...? You don't mind...?
Are you sure?

333
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,666
I'm sure. I just feel
like making something.

334
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,791
What do you want?

335
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,666
I'll be okay with
whatever you decide.

336
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,458
But I want you to pick!

337
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,333
Okay then...
How about...

338
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,541
Vegetable curry
is always good.

339
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,583
Great!
I'll see ya later!

340
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,750
Kagura!

341
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,416
Well, here they are!

342
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,208
The parfaits here
are delicious...!

343
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,791
Let's-

344
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,041
You haven't eaten.

345
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,250
Are you full...?

346
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,333
Kagura...
You should've told us.

347
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,916
No...

348
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,750
Sorry, I must've forgotten
to mention I'm on a mini-diet.

349
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,500
You want it?

350
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,791
What the hell...?!

351
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,541
You didn't have
to use the corner!

352
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,041
You're lucky I didn't bite
your tongue off instead.

353
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,750
Turning it off?

354
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,833
I'm off the clock. They'll just
have to make do without me.

355
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,416
Okay. I'm home,
everybody!

356
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,125
I hope you're still
in the mood for curry!

357
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,083
Yomi...?

358
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,500
Uncle Naraku?

359
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,083
Uncle, I'm home...!

360
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,291
Are you here?

361
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,333
Uncle!

362
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,958
Uncle, no!

363
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,208
Hey...!
Sorry I'm late.

364
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,875
What are you doing out here?
Is dinner not ready yet?

365
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,875
Yomi!

366
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,833
Kagura...
What's wrong?

367
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,833
It's your father...
Yomi, I'm sorry!

368
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,041
Where is my dad...?
What's happening?

369
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,666
There you are...!

370
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,416
You picked a fine time to run
off and play with your friends.

371
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,208
We couldn't contact you...
We've been looking everywhere.

372
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:54,750
May.

373
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,333
Now is not the time.

374
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,625
Go to your father...
and say goodbye.

375
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,958
On the next
Ga-Rei Zero...

376
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,625
"Whereabouts of Revenge."
