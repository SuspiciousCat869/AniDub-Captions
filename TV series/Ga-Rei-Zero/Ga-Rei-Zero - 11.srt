1
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,333
You little tramp.

2
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,041
Don't call me that...!
Ever!

3
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,750
What a shame...

4
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,625
To think you'd
be led astray.

5
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,333
Of all the
Spirit Eaters,

6
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,958
Byakuei is clearly
the mightiest...

7
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,625
He's an invaluable asset to
the proud Tsuchimiya family.

8
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,916
I don't know which
annoys me more...

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,291
Honestly...

10
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,500
I don't think
I'll ever understand

11
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:10,166
what made me
look up to them.

12
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,541
However...

13
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,708
Both family
and Beast die today.

14
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,250
Go, Byakuei...

15
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,250
Feast!

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,958
Ranguren!
Hit him with a Roar Wave!

17
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,333
Yomi...
and Father!

18
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,416
Stop it. You don't
have to do this...

19
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,708
Please just stop...
Stop fighting!

20
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,833
Kagura!
I need your help!

21
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,250
Kagura!

22
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,291
Ranguren!

23
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,125
Byakuei!

24
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,416
Prepare yourself.

25
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,000
I've seen enough of this.
You're dealing with me now.

26
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,416
Father, no!

27
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,208
Kagura...!
Are you alright?

28
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,500
We have to help my father!
We have to do something!

29
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,416
It's you.

30
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,708
Is that-?

31
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,000
It's a Bane Stone.

32
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,416
Dad, no!

33
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,583
I can't believe it.

34
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,458
I couldn't do it.

35
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,500
I tried...

36
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,250
but I couldn't
kill her.

37
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,375
Izuna.

38
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,416
She didn't kill Kazuki...

39
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,166
I did.

40
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,375
If I'd stopped her
when I had the chance...

41
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,583
he'd still be alive.

42
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,833
It seems a Bane Stone has turned
Yomi Isayama into a phantom.

43
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,208
As you are aware...

44
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,916
they're made from the souls
of nine-tail foxes...

45
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,833
crystalized forms
of pure energy.

46
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,000
Whoever possesses one
will have limitless power

47
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,416
until the Stone
devours their soul...

48
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,416
and turns them
into a phantom.

49
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,916
When they synchronize with the
hatred of the nine-tail foxes,

50
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,708
they attempt to destroy
everything in existence.

51
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,625
In the incident
with May Isayama...

52
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,333
the use of a Bane Stone
explains a lot, don't you agree?

53
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,625
I do.

54
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,916
But that would mean...

55
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,583
that our treatment
of Yomi was the catalyst

56
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,166
that led to
this transformation.

57
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,458
No... Bane Stones
are forbidden...

58
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,000
no matter what the reason
for acquiring one...

59
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,875
She knew the rule and
decided to break it.

60
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:11,208
Let's go back... There's one
more thing we still have to do.

61
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,250
What-...

62
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,208
What am I doing...?
Why can't I stop this?

63
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,750
No...

64
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,375
No...

65
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,375
No!

66
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,625
So there's no way out...
not even in death.

67
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,875
Stay on high alert.

68
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,208
The singularity
must be found.

69
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,625
Quickly, ma'am...

70
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,958
Look at the spirit
pressure map.

71
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,958
What's this?

72
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,791
We've lost radio contact with
Observation Teams One and Two...

73
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,791
Team Three is the only team
still sending spirit signals.

74
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,000
Of course. Yomi's hiding,
call Team Three at once...

75
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,333
Tell them to evacuate.

76
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,083
I'm coming, too.

77
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,500
But, ma'am...

78
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,500
Now... SDCD Disposal Team,
emergency mobilization...!

79
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,125
There's not much time!

80
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,916
Let's move.

81
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,708
Izuna...
We're going.

82
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,458
Hey, Nori!
Leave the kid alone.

83
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,708
In his current condition,

84
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,458
he'd probably end up
getting himself killed.

85
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,208
If you pull yourself together,
you know where we are.

86
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,916
Come on.

87
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,500
Dammit!

88
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,541
Are you alright...
Kagura?

89
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:01,583
I'm okay...
Are you alright, Father?

90
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,583
Don't concern
yourself with me.

91
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,125
I know that
I let you down.

92
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,666
I'm sorry I'm
so inexperienced.

93
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,416
What's wrong?

94
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,708
What is it, Father?

95
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,666
What's going on?

96
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,250
Bad idea... You should
have stayed at your posts.

97
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,625
O-maht soon-man ga
haas-ver-gun soon-nah.

98
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:08,000
Had-ash-na-gah voe-ter-ya
oon-tra-ta coom gah-nah.

99
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,166
Be strong, Father!

100
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,750
It would appear...
that I've reached my limit.

101
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,166
Byakuei...

102
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,541
is trying to break free
of the seal that binds him.

103
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,541
I'm no longer strong
enough to hold it.

104
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,958
You're wrong...! The Bane
Stone can help you recover!

105
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:36,000
The stone's power was muted
in the sealing process.

106
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,791
By the time it heals these
wounds, it will be too late.

107
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,666
Listen to me, Kagura...

108
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,833
It won't be long before
my soul is ripped apart...

109
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,708
and I die.

110
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,958
You can't.

111
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,541
Before my spirit
leaves this earthly plane,

112
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,333
there's something important
I must tell you.

113
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,666
Yes, sir.

114
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,708
I want to apologize.

115
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,333
Forgive me, Kagura.

116
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't understand.

117
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,000
Those born into
the Tsuchimiya line

118
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,875
will one day inherit
our Spirit Eater, Byakuei.

119
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,666
And those who are capable of
bonding and handling Byakuei

120
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,125
are not destined to live
long and happy lives.

121
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:36,666
It was true for your mother.
It is true for me.

122
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,166
And someday our fate
will prove true...

123
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,041
for you.

124
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,208
I'm sorry.

125
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,000
The last thing I want is for
your life to end as abruptly

126
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,916
as your mother's.

127
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,958
I have always dreamed that you
would live a long, full life...

128
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,875
For that to happen,
you had to grow stronger.

129
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,333
I had no way of foretelling

130
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,750
when my own life
would come to an end...

131
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,375
That is why I pushed you

132
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,208
to improve and mature
as quickly as possible.

133
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,875
I understand it must have
been difficult for you...

134
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,166
spending your entire
childhood in training.

135
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,791
Don't, Father...
Please, don't!

136
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,791
I hope you can
forgive me, Kagura.

137
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,083
I'm so sorry.

138
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,458
Don't talk like that!

139
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,958
Look who's here.

140
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,916
You're too late, you know...

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,125
Every eye you had watching
me has been gouged out.

142
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,750
Now you won't be able to use
spirit energy to track me.

143
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,125
I'm surprised...

144
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,208
I never imagined you
would become a Category A.

145
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,791
Why didn't you bring
everybody else...?

146
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,958
They scared...?
Or perhaps they're dead.

147
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,375
Not that it makes
any difference.

148
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,041
You see, it's only
a matter of time

149
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:12,083
before I kill every last
living being on the planet.

150
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,791
Ah, you want
some of this?

151
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,791
We can't let
him get away!

152
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,500
Zinguji!

153
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:06,916
I never thought you would
see active duty again.

154
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,791
No...? Well, that's a
rather rude thing to say,

155
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,458
don't you agree?

156
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,833
You would kill one
of your subordinates?

157
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,666
Former subordinate,
you mean.

158
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,750
You're heartless.

159
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,500
Heartless...?

160
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:25,083
I've killed people dearer to me
than you could ever hope to be.

161
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,041
I'm not one
to play favorites.

162
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,291
Those who choose evil
are not worthy of mercy!

163
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,791
Can you kill me?

164
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,583
We know what the Bane Stone's
made you capable of.

165
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,750
And you think
you can stop me?

166
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,666
Easily... You've met
your match.

167
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,958
You know something, Father?

168
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,666
This is the first time...
we've had a real conversation.

169
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,916
I suppose so.

170
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,583
Do you think
if I had trained harder

171
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,000
and learned how to be
a Vanquisher sooner...

172
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,291
that maybe we would've been able
to talk like this a lot more?

173
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,750
I don't know...

174
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,750
There's no way
of telling that now.

175
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,000
What does that mean?

176
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,166
I'm not sure I would have
known what to say to you.

177
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,708
I wish I could
say otherwise.

178
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,000
Is that funny?

179
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,166
Maybe a little...

180
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,250
It's just...

181
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,416
we're family.

182
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,833
Yes, you're right...

183
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,791
We are family.

184
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:06,083
Father...? Do you think you
could tell me about Mother?

185
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,583
Well?

186
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,833
We got her...
I think.

187
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,666
Watch out, Ma'am!

188
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,375
Kiri, no!

189
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,375
Ma'am!

190
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,875
Yomi... See you
in the afterlife.

191
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,625
Iwahata!

192
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,750
What do you think,
Father...?

193
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,083
What should I do now?

194
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,375
Kagura...
Do you feel love?

195
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,208
Yes.

196
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,625
And sadness?

197
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes.

198
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,750
What about hate?

199
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,083
I don't know.

200
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,916
Kagura... Forget everything
you've ever known.

201
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:38,583
Clearing your mind is the best
way to feel entirely at peace...

202
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:42,750
Everyone with a responsibility
to bear must learn to do so.

203
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,833
However.

204
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,375
The truly strong carry
the weight of their duty

205
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,125
on their shoulders.

206
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,750
But why?

207
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,875
As one person who is responsible
for the lives of many,

208
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,541
you should never
abandon your feelings...

209
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,708
no matter how painful to
face those feelings may be.

210
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,208
So you bear it...
all of it?

211
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,666
There are few paths more
excruciating to follow

212
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,125
than that one.

213
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,791
Only you can choose
the one you take.

214
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,458
It's up to me?

215
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,250
Are you okay, Father?
What can I do?

216
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:27,250
It seems... the moment
has finally come.

217
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,333
Kagura... Take it.

218
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,583
No...! Please,
Father! Not yet!

219
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,458
I've lived a long time...
Perhaps long enough.

220
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,625
Goodbye...
Kagura.

221
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,833
Don't go, Father!

222
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,625
Nabu...

223
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,333
Hang on, Kiri.

224
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,208
Ma'am, is...
that you?

225
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,625
I'm here, Kiri.

226
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,416
Where did Yomi... go?

227
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,500
You called?

228
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,875
Do you wanna keep going?

229
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,250
Let's see if Ranguren
has an opinion.

230
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,666
It's my choice...
No one else's.

231
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,708
Are you to be going
then, Young Kagura?

232
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,541
Master Michael.

233
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,916
In my wisdom, I have forged a
thing meant especially for you.

234
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,000
My latest creation...

235
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,583
The night birds sing it
as Michael Thirteen.

236
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,666
Michael Thirteen.

237
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,833
Exactly the same
as Michael Twelve,

238
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,916
save for being new
and superior.

239
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,583
I think your soul and
it can dance together.

240
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:22,833
My soul...?
I don't know.

241
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,958
I wonder what my
soul does want,...

242
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,500
Maybe I'll never
know the answer.

243
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,875
Young Kagura.

244
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,916
On the next
Ga-Rei Zero...

245
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,750
"Yearning Prayer."
