1
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:35,541
Hello, Father.
You called for me?

2
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,291
Open the box
in front of you.

3
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,500
It's beautiful!

4
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,208
My wife used to wear it...

5
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,916
You can try it
on if you'd like.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,541
Are you sure you don't mind?

7
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:54,875
Oh don't be silly.

8
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,208
It should fit you by now,
if I'm not mistaken.

9
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,250
Thank you...!

10
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,291
Oh, it's so soft.

11
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,958
So, tell me.
How are things at school?

12
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,083
Oh... It's about
the same as usual.

13
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,916
And work?
Is that going well?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,666
I'd hardly call it work...

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,833
Not until
I'm full-time, anyway.

16
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,125
How do you like
working with Noriyuki?

17
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,875
Do the two
of you get along?

18
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,500
I need to talk
to you, Yomi.

19
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:23,458
It's about the marriage
talks with the Izuna family.

20
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,500
I know neither of you
were overly enthusiastic

21
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,083
about the idea.

22
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,875
And I wouldn't want to proceed
without taking your feelings

23
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,750
into consideration.

24
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,583
So I wanted
to ask you once more:

25
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,500
How do you really feel
about the arrangement?

26
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,500
When I lost everyone
close to me,

27
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,375
you took me in and raised
me like I was your own.

28
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,000
You made me
who I am today.

29
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,833
You've always wanted
what's best for me,

30
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,875
and this marriage
isn't any different.

31
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:56,250
If anything, it makes me even
more a part of your family.

32
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:59,291
How could I say no...?

33
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,083
Father- I will accept...

34
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,958
the arrangement.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,041
Grow stronger.

36
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,458
Yo!

37
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,250
What's with the
sad-puppy look?

38
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,375
Nori!

39
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,375
I'm fine...
And how are you doing?

40
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,375
That pipe fox is
just a baby, huh?

41
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,083
He's only a couple
weeks old...

42
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,250
but I thought it was time
for him to learn the ropes.

43
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,083
Taking care of Spirit
Beasts sounds tough.

44
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,250
I'll be passing these
guys on someday.

45
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,291
It's important to my family.

46
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,958
The Beast you're in line
for will probably

47
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,333
be more trouble
than mine are.

48
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,625
Hey. Don't give it
too much thought...

49
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,083
That won't be
for a long time.

50
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,375
I'm home.

51
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,166
Aw...!
My lackey...!

52
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,833
Hi!

53
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,166
What the heck...?
What's gotten into you?

54
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,458
Nothing.
Nothing at all...

55
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,708
For a big sister, she sure acts
like a little kid sometimes!

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,166
Good morning!
I'm sorry I'm late.

57
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,083
Hey.
Yo.

58
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,583
How is everything?

59
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,333
Nabu...
Pretty good.

60
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,375
Nabu...
Pretty good, too.

61
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:04,166
That's nice...
I'm glad to hear it...

62
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,625
Uh... I brought the latest
spirit energy map...

63
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,250
Wait...

64
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,000
I could've sworn there was a
strange energy here yesterday.

65
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,416
The stationary front
over KaMaydo disappeared

66
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,208
this morning.

67
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,750
It did?

68
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,333
I guess someone must
have exorcised it...

69
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,458
There been a lot of freelance
Vanquishers popping up lately.

70
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,583
Could be the M.o.D.; they've
been stepping up their efforts.

71
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,958
Or maybe the ghost
is just laying low.

72
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,291
GOTCHA!

73
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,041
Yomi...
Good morning.

74
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,541
Why don't you share
with the class

75
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,958
what you got on your
language arts test?

76
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:36,958
Hey...! Who told?

77
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,208
Nobody told.

78
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,083
I just know everything
about you... Here it is!

79
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,250
Gah! Give that back!

80
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,708
If you know everything, why
do you need to see it, dummy?

81
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,875
Oh, your teacher said
you had a smart mouth!

82
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,791
Ow! Lemme go...!

83
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,000
Wait... What?

84
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,166
You...
smell nice...

85
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,958
Are you wearing perfume?

86
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,666
Of course not...
I'm naturally fragrant.

87
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,625
Nabu.
I smell perfume, too.

88
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,458
Nabu.
Sweet perfume for-

89
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,666
I knew it! There's no
fooling the Nabus' noses!

90
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,791
Okay,
you caught me...

91
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,083
Satisfied?

92
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,833
I just bought it today.

93
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,583
Now what?

94
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:20,500
Your eyelashes. They look
longer than they usually do.

95
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,958
I used mascara... Is it a crime
to wear makeup once in a while?

96
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,833
I've got it! You have a date
with Nori tonight, don't you?

97
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,041
I do not...! That's the
dumbest thing I've ever heard!

98
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,083
Hey.

99
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,958
Hey...! Nori!

100
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:37,625
Whoa... Is it just me
or does it reek in here?

101
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,208
Smells like a cosmetics
factory exploded.

102
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,541
Ooh.

103
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,583
Oh, that's just me.

104
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,458
I'm trying out
a new perfume...

105
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,708
Here!
Whaddaya think?

106
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,708
I think you went a
little overboard...

107
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:51,208
Besides, this is a workplace.
You can play dress-up at home.

108
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,333
It's just my sense of smell
is more sensitive than most.

109
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,458
Right!
I understand.

110
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,708
No one has ever shown you how
to put on perfume, have they...?

111
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,166
I can tell. It's okay,

112
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,375
a lotta little girls use way
too much their first time.

113
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,916
Just spray a little...
then walk through it...

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,375
Any more than that and
you'll wind up smelling

115
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,666
like an old lady trying
to cover up cat stink.

116
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,750
Oh, god!

117
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,500
Sorry...
My hand slipped.

118
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,500
Liar! You did
that on purpose!

119
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,125
What are you trying
to do, kill me?!

120
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,666
Not really.

121
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,916
Oh, that's
your thing now?

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,708
Going around throwing
hot coffee on people?

123
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,875
I get it... So you're the one
I've been smelling, aren't you?

124
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,250
And here you are making
poor Kagura take the blame.

125
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,250
You should have
owned up to it.

126
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,750
I'm not
wearing perfume!

127
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,083
Sure, you're just wearing
a ton of eye makeup.

128
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,875
Hey.

129
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,041
Okay,
that does it!

130
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, no...
You're mad.

131
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,666
Now what do you
wanna do about it?

132
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,708
Oh... I'll
think of something.

133
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,416
That's enough.

134
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,958
You know Spirit Beasts
aren't allowed in the office.

135
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,333
Both of you put your
little ones away.

136
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,541
They can play with
each other after work.

137
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,000
Good to see
you again, Chief!

138
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,791
Would either of you
like to tell me

139
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,250
why you almost
killed each other?

140
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,916
We were only
playing around.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,958
Yeah, they were
just trying out

142
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,625
a new kind
of conflict resolution.

143
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,750
Now that that's been
settled, Sir Norisada,

144
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,125
do I have your
permission to proceed

145
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,708
with the
arranged marriage?

146
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,083
I have no objections
whatsoever.

147
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,541
Not only are we marrying
into the Isayama family,

148
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,791
but this union will bring
the clans together...

149
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,125
As a matter of fact,

150
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,916
I wouldn't mind holding
the wedding right now!

151
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,750
Don't get ahead
of yourself...

152
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,083
No one is going
to be getting married

153
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,583
until after Yomi has
graduated from high school.

154
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,375
Of course.

155
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,750
He seems more interested
in power and influence...

156
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,500
than he does in the
happiness of our children.

157
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,000
Hello, Brother!

158
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,458
Brother Yu...
It's been a long time...

159
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,791
too long. It has indeed...
You're looking well, as always.

160
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,541
I heard about the
marriage you've arranged

161
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,583
with the Izuna family.

162
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,166
Is that so?

163
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,708
I also heard a rumor that
when this marriage takes place,

164
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,958
Yomi will become the head
of the Isayama family.

165
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,208
That isn't a rumor.

166
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,625
I realize she's
still very young.

167
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,541
But even now, the level
of skill she's achieved

168
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,833
is worthy of the family name.

169
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,541
She will make the
Isayamas proud.

170
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:52,708
Do I have to remind you
that Yomi is adopted?!

171
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,708
That never bothered
you before.

172
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,333
You didn't complain when
I entrusted her with Shishio.

173
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,000
You should have known I
intended for her to succeed me.

174
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,250
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think you'd hand control

175
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,500
of the family to some orphan
you took in off the streets!

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,375
Yu... Are you suggesting after
all the years you've refused

177
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,208
to fight for our family, that
I pass control over to you...?

178
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,041
Because we're
connected by blood?

179
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,000
That's not what
I'm suggesting at all...!

180
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,041
But why don't you consider
the family first...?

181
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,083
Think about it...!
The family line- Out with it!

182
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,208
It's true, I'm a disgrace
to the Isayama name

183
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,291
for rejecting my duty.

184
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,250
But don't punish my
daughter for my mistakes!

185
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,666
May is highly skilled.

186
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,166
In fact, she's more than
capable of leading the family.

187
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,833
Please, Brother-
I beg you to reconsider!

188
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,125
Forgive me, Father,

189
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,250
but I must
respectfully disagree.

190
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,875
May...

191
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,291
Out of all of the
active Vanquishers,

192
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,583
there's no doubt
in my mind

193
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,583
Yomi possesses the most
talent with a sword...

194
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,958
And it was her idea to
care for the Tsuchimiya girl

195
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,916
whose mother was lost...

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,458
I'm aware of no
one more dependable,

197
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,500
related or otherwise.

198
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,083
I know you think
the world of me,

199
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,958
but Yomi is the
logical choice...

200
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,458
Wouldn't you agree?
Uncle Naraku?

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,958
Engaged?

202
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,833
Yep. They're getting married
once she's out of school.

203
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,000
Her dad arranged
it with his dad.

204
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,541
That's so romantic!

205
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,458
It's like something
out of a girls' manga.

206
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,708
If he was ugly, yeah,

207
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,375
but they're both
attractive and smart,

208
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,708
so it's more
like a TV drama.

209
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,750
Wait, he's cute?!

210
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,958
The only problem is that

211
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,333
they haven't been
getting along lately.

212
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:34,791
I wish there was a way to get
them to make up somehow.

213
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,833
In that case-
We know just the thing!

214
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,291
To pull this off, it's gonna
take everyone working together.

215
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,791
Is everybody with me?

216
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,916
Yeah.
Nabu.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,416
First, Kazuki will dress up
like a thug and attack Yomi,

218
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,458
stealing her purse.

219
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,083
I will?

220
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,500
We'll time it so Nori passes
by at that exact moment.

221
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,000
Then he'll beat up
Kazuki and save the day!

222
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,750
She'll be blown away
by his manliness...

223
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,291
they'll fall in love...

224
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,083
and they'll live happily ever
after before you know it!

225
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,916
So your big plan is
for me to... mug Yomi?

226
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,833
Can't you think of a way
for me to help out

227
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,416
that won't get me
slaughtered?!

228
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,583
Okay, then we'll stick
with the same basic plan,

229
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:21,416
but the Nabu brothers
can attack Yomi instead.

230
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,541
Give us the purse, lady!

231
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,625
Nabu says a big fat no.

232
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,625
Nabu says fat no, too.

233
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,708
You'll attack Yomi
for me, right, Iwahata?

234
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,458
You can count me out...

235
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:39,000
I try never to get involved in
other people's relationships.

236
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,500
Besides, there's
still a chance

237
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,541
they'll call off the
wedding altogether.

238
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,583
And I'll finally get a
shot at Nori's sweet ass.

239
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,000
That's a terrible excuse!

240
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,791
Hi! What are we
talking about?

241
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,000
Once again, I do not understand
what my brother is thinking.

242
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,416
Being angry with him
won't help the situation.

243
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,000
Well...

244
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:09,083
Keep in mind that a Vanquisher's
life is often a short one.

245
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,291
If Naraku had decided
to pass control

246
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,041
of the Isayama
family to me,

247
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,291
and if I were to lose
my life in the line of duty,

248
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,916
Yomi would stand to
inherit the position.

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,750
What are you saying?

250
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,625
But as things stand now...

251
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,833
I'm next in line if,
heaven forbid,

252
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,375
anything happens to Yomi.

253
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:32,333
So it's only a matter of time
until I take my rightful place.

254
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,458
I see...

255
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,250
If it's gotten
as bad as you say,

256
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,541
their bickering is eventually
going to have a negative effect

257
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,916
on their work performance.

258
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,541
We have no choice, then...

259
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,291
Dealing with both of them
at once won't get us anywhere.

260
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,625
So for now, let's focus on
getting Yomi to like Nori.

261
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,541
But do you have
any idea how?

262
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,916
Actually, I do.
It's the perfect plan.

263
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,916
Nabu...
is in position.

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,791
Nabu... is also in
the same position, too.

265
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,916
Target number one
is in sight.

266
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,208
This operation is a-go...
Kiri, are you in position?

267
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,625
Making my move... now.

268
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,666
Ms. ikaido... Hi.

269
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,916
G-G-Good afternoon...!

270
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,250
How are you today?

271
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,666
Are you on patrol...?
Or enjoying personal time?

272
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,875
You're too stiff!
Loosen up!

273
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,500
You have to act more
natural, Ms. ikaido!

274
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,125
We've known each
other a long time...

275
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,125
but I don't think I've
ever seen you in a skirt.

276
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,791
Oh, I had something to do
I wanted to look nice for.

277
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,666
Anyway, you look fantastic.

278
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,333
You should wear that
to work sometime.

279
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,791
Beautiful girl like you would
really brighten up the place.

280
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,625
He's turning on the charm.

281
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,416
Wow, Nori's really
a flirt, isn't he?

282
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,333
Step one is still going
according to plan,

283
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,916
more or less...

284
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,208
Now all we have to do is get
Yomi to see them like this-

285
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,625
Then she'll finally realize
how much she likes him!

286
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,583
Stay sharp, everyone.

287
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,833
Target number two
is approaching.

288
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,333
So how about all
these phantoms?

289
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,875
Hey.

290
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,000
Target two made contact...
No response so far.

291
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,333
Commence the attack...
Phase one...

292
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,708
Get him, Kiri.

293
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,833
Commencing phase one.

294
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,000
Hit confirmed, but still
nothing from target two!

295
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,750
It's time to move
to the next phase...!

296
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,125
Increase the
level of contact...

297
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,666
Turn up the heat...
Let's go!

298
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,750
Target number two is...
still completely unresponsive!

299
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,833
She is affected... we just have
to get her to realize it...

300
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,583
It's time to commence
phase three!

301
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,333
Uh, Miss Nikaido...?
You okay?

302
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,416
My darling... We can't
go on like this...

303
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,666
I can't keep our love
a secret anymore.

304
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,125
Wha-What are you
talking about?

305
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,208
Target number two is
leaving the battlefield!

306
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,875
Phase three was ineffective!

307
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,833
Repeat, phase three
was ineffective...!

308
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,750
Wait, hold on!

309
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,916
Hey... uh...

310
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
did I miss something...?
What was that back there?

311
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,875
I'd explain it, but it's
actually pretty complicated-

312
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,875
Phase three was effective,
after all...!

313
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,666
The target is responding!

314
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,125
But isn't this the exact
opposite of what we wanted?

315
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,208
Yomi looks like she hates him
even more than she did before!

316
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,833
Whoa.

317
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,625
Not that I care, but what the
hell do you think you're doing?

318
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,208
I'm not doing anything!

319
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,916
You just groped Kiri right
in front of your fiancée,

320
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,333
and now you're gonna lie
about it to my face?

321
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,291
Groped...? You're so jealous,
you're seeing things!

322
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,333
Oh, that's funny.

323
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,083
Me? Jealous?
No way!

324
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,083
Yes, way!

325
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,458
In case you've forgotten,

326
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,541
this stupid engagement
was all my father's idea...

327
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,166
The only reason
I'm even considering

328
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,541
going through with it is
to make him happy, okay...?

329
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,750
So don't let it go
to your fat ugly head!

330
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,458
You think
I'm happy with it...?

331
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:38,208
You think I'm glad my father
stuck me with a nagging cow?

332
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,125
That'll teach you to
hit a defenseless girl!

333
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:00,125
You may be a girl...
but defenseless, never.

334
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,958
So, uh...

335
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:10,166
it's gonna be like this for
the rest of our lives, huh?

336
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,125
I guess so.

337
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,875
I don't know what it is...

338
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,125
but we've never
been able to get along.

339
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,416
I know.

340
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,958
No...

341
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,791
What are they saying?

342
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,875
There's no reason to think
we'll suddenly act differently

343
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,083
towards each other
once we get married.

344
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,291
Fighting'll pretty
much be the norm.

345
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,541
Do you think you
can live this way?

346
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,208
I was about to ask
you the same thing.

347
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,916
It's not too late
for us to reconsider.

348
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,250
You're right. We could
still call it off.

349
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,833
Yeah...
I guess we could...

350
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,041
Noriyuki...
I think I-

351
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,250
Wait!

352
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,250
Kagura?

353
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,541
This is all my fault!

354
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,458
I don't want you to be
mad at each other...

355
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,291
It was all my idea!

356
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,958
I'm sorry!
What was your fault?

357
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,375
It's just that... Yomi is
like a big sister to me...

358
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,291
And if you got married, then
you'd be like a big brother,

359
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,583
Nori...

360
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,000
I only wanted
you to get along

361
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,208
so that maybe someday we
can be like a real family...

362
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,666
one that loves each other.

363
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,166
Be mad at me
if you want...

364
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,416
but...

365
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,916
I was only
trying to help!

366
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,166
You didn't do anything
wrong, Kagura.

367
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,916
Yeah... It was a stupid
fight and now it's over.

368
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,250
You're sure?

369
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,250
Promise?

370
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,208
We promise.

371
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,625
Kagura...

372
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,666
If seeing us fight upsets
you, we won't do it anymore.

373
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,208
You're not mad
at each other?

374
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,291
We're not.

375
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,416
Then prove it.

376
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,333
Prove it...?
But how can we do that?

377
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,750
By kissing each other.

378
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,833
I want the two of you
to kiss and make up!

379
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,416
And it better be good!

380
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,958
Isn't that
a little extreme?

381
00:19:59,041 --> 00:19:59,958
We're not going to-

382
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,333
No problem...

383
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,416
I mean, if that's what
it'll take to convince you.

384
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,750
Are you crazy?

385
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,250
No!

386
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,791
N-... Nori...

387
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,500
The operation wasn't as
successful as we had hoped.

388
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,250
That's wonderful news.

389
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,791
But... they went right
back to fighting again.

390
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,750
I thought they might...
It'll be fine.

391
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,958
Quite a day we've had.

392
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,375
That was Kagura's unique
way of showing affection.

393
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,583
Yeah, I guess so...

394
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,291
You, look
really beautiful.

395
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,416
Enough to love?

396
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,541
Yeah... sure.

397
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,958
It's been a long time

398
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,333
since you've sent one of your
pipe foxes to spy on me.

399
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,166
I wasn't trying
to spy on you...

400
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,333
Once they're old enough,
I pretty much let 'em go

401
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,916
wherever they want.

402
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Liar... I've seen
them out before...

403
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,500
but never once
at my home.

404
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,041
Of course not.
They're experts at hiding.

405
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,125
You don't really think I'm
that oblivious, do you?

406
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,666
No, I do not.

407
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,041
You don't spy on me

408
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,875
because you're scared of
what you might find?

409
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,500
No, that's
not it at all.

410
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,375
I don't spy on you because I'd
rather see you with my own eyes.

411
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,125
Shut up.

412
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,250
Do you think we'll
always be like this?

413
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,500
Always fighting?

414
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,083
Absolutely. 'As long
as we both shall live.'

415
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:29,041
If death is only a
matter of 'when'...

416
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,083
It makes no difference
who leads the family.

417
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,708
On the next
Ga-Rei Zero...

418
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,666
"Beautiful Enemy."
