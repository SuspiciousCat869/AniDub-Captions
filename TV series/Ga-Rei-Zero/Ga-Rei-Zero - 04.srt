1
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,291
Hey, Miku...

2
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,750
Do you mind if I copy off
your English homework?

3
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,875
No one told me we had
a homework assignment....

4
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,291
You could've picked up
the phone and called me...

5
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,500
I was out sick all day
yesterday, don't you remember?

6
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh yeah... Crap!

7
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:49,166
What am I going to do now?
I depend on you!

8
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,875
Tsuchimiya!

9
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,791
Did you do your
English homework?

10
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,833
Yeah...
Of course...

11
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,041
Really...?!
Mind if I "borrow" it?

12
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,500
Um... Okay.

13
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:07,041
Sweet...!
Thank you!

14
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,208
Is it cool if I kind
of glance at, too?

15
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,250
Yeah. Sure.

16
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,333
Someone texting you?

17
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,375
Uh-huh. The hospital.

18
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,291
Oh, that's right.
Your mom. I forgot.

19
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,125
Is she okay...?

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,333
I mean, it's not like it's
any of my business, but...

21
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:29,333
It's nothing serious...
I do have to go, though.

22
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,166
You guys mind leaving my
English notebook in the desk

23
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,375
when you're done?

24
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,416
Thanks!

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,958
Nothing serious, huh?

26
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,958
Bet she's got it rough.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,708
Sorry to pull you
out of class again.

28
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,416
Well... It's okay,

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,291
but I hate having to lie
to my teachers all the time.

30
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,333
Kagura.

31
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,791
You've got slobber
on your face.

32
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,791
This one's going in my "The Many
Faces of Kagura" collection...

33
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,583
I really wish
you'd delete those!

34
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,666
There's been a lot of paranormal
activity lately, hasn't there?

35
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,291
Yes...

36
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,333
And I've got a feeling things
are only going to get worse.

37
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,875
It's been over three years
since it was this noisy...

38
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,000
Just the calm before
the storm, I guess...

39
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,041
I hope not.

40
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,583
One pocky left!
I call it!

41
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,958
Hey! That's not fair!

42
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,916
Hey, if you snooze
you lose, sweetheart!

43
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,583
I couldn't agree
with you more.

44
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,541
Maybe sharing's not
so bad after all...

45
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,875
Ew! Stop it!

46
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,125
Oh, come on!
Don't be such a prude!

47
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,708
Get off me!
You're disgusting!

48
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,250
You love it and
you know it...

49
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,375
I swear, I'm gonna
bite your lip off!

50
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,208
Does this look like
a peep show to you?

51
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,166
I repeat...

52
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,458
Sorry we had to pull you
both out of class today.

53
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,125
Oh, that's okay.

54
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,583
What with it being our
"sacred duty" and all...

55
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,916
What? Why's it okay
if the Mohawk watches?!

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,166
'Cause he doesn't bat
for the same team.

57
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,250
That's right.

58
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,916
So he gets carte
blanche, then...

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,333
Sit down,
pretty boy...

60
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,875
Your ass...

61
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,833
Is distracting me

62
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,916
C'mon! Not cool,
man! Not cool!

63
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,083
So what exactly
are we up against?

64
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,666
The pipe foxes
have its scent.

65
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:23,250
Category B.
An Earth Spider.

66
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,375
One of the biggest
I've ever seen.

67
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,041
Have the pipe
foxes clear out.

68
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,750
The chimera and I will
deal with this one...

69
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,416
The rest of you
will back me up!

70
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,875
Back up again?

71
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,208
Don't start. You're not
ready for anything else...

72
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,791
Master Michael
Twelve one of these days

73
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,166
and maybe -
maybe- we'll talk.

74
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,708
I have mastered it!

75
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,291
Oh... Well then you'll have
to prove it to me sometime.

76
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,958
Now Ranguren!

77
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,041
Come with me!

78
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,625
Let's give her
some backup, boys.

79
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,208
On it!

80
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,875
Hit it with a Roar Wave!

81
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,833
Crack it!. Now!

82
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,750
Kagura...

83
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,375
She's a civilian?

84
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,375
Uh-huh.

85
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,833
You okay?.
Are you hurt?

86
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,750
That thing...
You saw didn't you?

87
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,083
Okay, then that'll
make this simple...

88
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:45,500
We are a special division of
the Ministry of Environment.

89
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,833
It's called the

90
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,125
Supernatural Disaster
Countermeasure Division.

91
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,625
Ghost hunters...?

92
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:54,166
Spirits often target people
with psychic tendencies.

93
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,625
Evil spirits aim to drive
you out of your mind...

94
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,708
Lure you to join
the ranks, so to speak.

95
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,333
Word of advice...

96
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:05,458
Stay away from
places like this.

97
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,166
And don't ever talk about what
you've seen here tonight...

98
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,250
We've got a nondisclosure
form for you to sign.

99
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,000
Hey... It's not as bad
as you might think.

100
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:22,583
At least not bad enough
for these... Right?

101
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,750
I guess not.

102
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,583
Looks like the area's
ghost-free for the moment.

103
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,625
Good. Mission
accomplished then...

104
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,625
Everyone clear out.

105
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,125
How did you know she'd come
here to try to kill herself?

106
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,541
A hunch....

107
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,458
You sort of pick things up
after a while in this gig.

108
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,416
Tsuchimiya!

109
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,125
It's for yesterday.

110
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:54,333
We made a box lunch
for you... You hungry?

111
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,333
Yes!

112
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,458
It's delicious.

113
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,625
So I've gotta ask...

114
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,375
What is it your mom
is so sick with?

115
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,625
Yatchin...!

116
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,125
Like I said, it's
nothing really serious.

117
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,000
Still, though.
How do you deal with that

118
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,625
and manage to get all
your homework done?

119
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,916
Oh, I've just always been really
good at multi-tasking, you know.

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,375
Does your dad help?

121
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,000
Uh, well...
He travels a lot for work

122
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,875
so I don't actually
see him that much.

123
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,416
I'm living with relatives
until mom gets back on her feet.

124
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,166
That sounds
completely tragic!

125
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,666
It's anything but...

126
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,416
I got a new big sister
out of the deal

127
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,125
who lets me tag along
with her to work...

128
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,125
She's awesome.

129
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,416
Work?

130
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,583
Uh, well, it's...
It's just...

131
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,083
A family business...

132
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,333
So wait, you also
hold down a job?!

133
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,875
As best I can.

134
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,208
I'm not that good; they just
consider me an apprentice.

135
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,541
Oh, please...

136
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,583
You don't have to downplay
it; that's incredible!

137
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,833
Really?

138
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,333
Really.

139
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,708
Stop!

140
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,000
Abomination!

141
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,833
Only the essence undiluted
of the Japanese people

142
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,375
is fit for the caring
of a katana!

143
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,791
Tea seed oil or clove oil
is all the blade may drink!

144
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,750
Do I even wanna ask?

145
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,958
Look...! This creep
just ran in here!

146
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,125
Ah, Master Michael.
I wasn't expecting a visit.

147
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,500
An honorable pleasure
to see you again, young Yomi!

148
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,125
Who is this?

149
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,583
Someone I think you should
introduce yourself to.

150
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,791
Uh... My name's Kagura...

151
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,041
Ah...!
I have been attacked

152
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,791
by the daughter of great
Master Tsuchimiya, yes?.

153
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:14,333
Please know me
as Michael Kohara!

154
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,458
You're Michael Kohara?

155
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,708
If the name
sounds familiar,

156
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,708
it's because he
forged that katana.

157
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,250
Yes.

158
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,583
The man who made
Michael Twelve... Is you?

159
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,958
Yes.

160
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,750
There isn't a piece
of SDCD equipment

161
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,958
that Master Michael
here hasn't constructed.

162
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes.

163
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,833
But why is he naked?

164
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes.

165
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,166
That's not an answer!

166
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,708
May I, please...?

167
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,875
Ah-ha... He smiles
at me as bright as ever...

168
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,083
Like a newborn
jewel of the sky.

169
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,041
Because the only thing
they ever let me do with it

170
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,375
is haul it around.

171
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,291
After I've decided
you're ready for battle,

172
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,750
I'll let you do more.

173
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,875
Young Yomi... Kindly may I
inspect the Shishio, please?

174
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,666
It too smiles at me
as a brother...

175
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,000
The halo of energy surrounding
this katana bathes our world

176
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,500
and the next in the song
of night birds... For now.

177
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,958
Oh?

178
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,875
Its power ebbs...

179
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:17,375
Unless tended to quickly,
the smile will fade.

180
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,958
Guess you'll have to fight
without Ranguren

181
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,708
for little while, huh?

182
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,083
I'm sorry.
That totally sucks.

183
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,208
Well I guess everything
needs a little upkeep...

184
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,583
I'll be fine.

185
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,333
I wish I had a Spirit Beast
at my beck and call...

186
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,625
It'd be pretty handy while
yours was in the shop.

187
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,875
Come on, doll...
Let me scrub your back.

188
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,041
Have you seen much
of your dad lately?

189
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,750
Not really.

190
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,583
I'll bet you he's
feeling pretty lonely.

191
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,583
Why don't you pay him
a visit sometime?

192
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,083
Well I might if I ever thought
I could catch him at home.

193
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:05,041
I could leave
if you want me to.

194
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,125
You've gotta be sick
of playing babysitter.

195
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,333
Never!

196
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,041
Oh, not this again!

197
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,958
You're so adorable!

198
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,875
Come on! Cut it out,
that tickles!

199
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,875
You realize
I'm adopting you one day...

200
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,875
Really?. And the purpose
of Master Michael's visit?

201
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,583
He felt the Shishio needed
a few minor repairs...

202
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,916
He also passionately insisted on
taking most of our arsenal back

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,875
to his shop for
routine maintenance.

204
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,208
Did he...?

205
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,416
Then we'd better submit
them to him en masse.

206
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,791
En masse...?

207
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,958
But if something were
to happen in the meantime...

208
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,958
We'd have cause
to fully initiate

209
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,875
the team's newest
addition, wouldn't we?

210
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,208
But... she...

211
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,416
There's no better training
ground than combat...

212
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,000
And besides...

213
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,458
As much as we rely on him,
poor Rannie deserves a vacation.

214
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,500
I guess you're right.

215
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,291
Indeed.
Adjust their shifts.

216
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,750
Right away,
ma'am...

217
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,833
As you wish...
Oh, and...

218
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes, Kiri?

219
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,416
Why is... Master
Michael always naked?

220
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,791
Good question.

221
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:24,791
Watch it!

222
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,333
You watch!

223
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,791
That old man is
something else.

224
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,666
How does he not get arrested
walking around like that?

225
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,208
Oh, we've had to bail
him out plenty of times.

226
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,125
Looks like we got ourselves
some paid time off,

227
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,541
doesn't it Yomi?

228
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,333
I can fight just as well
with or without the Shishio...

229
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,250
So what do we have lying
around the backup stockpile?

230
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,833
Not much, I'm afraid.

231
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,541
What you see is more
or less what you get.

232
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,041
Hey, lookie here.

233
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,958
You think this one
might tide you over?

234
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,500
Is that an iron?

235
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,250
More like a Vanquisher Knuckle:
The Douglas Twenty- Eight.

236
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,333
Steam the wrinkles
out of any evil spirit

237
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:02,375
with good old
fashioned holy water!

238
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,208
No dice...? Don't fret;
there're always options...

239
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,708
Like the Pare Eleven
Vanquisher Chainsaw!

240
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,416
Our Vanquisher Jackhammer,
the Jackson Thirty-Three!

241
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,166
Or the J. Fox Fifty-Five,

242
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,416
our top-of-the-line
Vanquisher Boiler...

243
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,750
Nice, huh?

244
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,375
For an appliance.

245
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,875
How's anyone supposed
to carry this thing?

246
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,083
Guess I'll take you...
Hey, Nori...

247
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,166
Wanna play house?

248
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,291
Can't... I've got
a prior engagement.

249
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,541
Again?

250
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,666
Kazuki promised
me a rematch...

251
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,041
You'll have a
blast without me.

252
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,500
Come on, Big Sis.
Let's practice!

253
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,208
That's a great idea!

254
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,833
Think you oughta be here?

255
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,541
Do what?

256
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,708
Dude, you're gonna have to make
time for Yomi sooner or later...

257
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,666
Whether you like it or not.

258
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,541
I've got the rest of my
life to make time for her.

259
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,666
That's the spirit.

260
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,000
I like her
and all... I just...

261
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,625
wish I'd had some
say-so in the matter...

262
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm sure she'll
make a great wife.

263
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,833
And great mother...
Just look at Kagura...

264
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,125
Hup!

265
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,000
I feel your pain, though...
It's gotta be tough...

266
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,958
Having your parents
prearrange everything

267
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,708
kind of kills the romance,
if you ask me.

268
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,458
This board and
I are not friends.

269
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,250
I'm just trying to enjoy
my freedom while it lasts.

270
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,750
Sure. Fine.

271
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,916
Whatever; just don't set
me up as your enabler.

272
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,500
My what?

273
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,875
Yomi will hold
this against me ...

274
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,416
She scares me as it is.

275
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,416
Me too.

276
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,750
At least I can finally hit
something with this thing.

277
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,958
Is it really even
all that powerful?

278
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,291
Any weapon forged by Master
Michael will be powerful...

279
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,750
And when you add that to the
wielder's inborn psychic energy,

280
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,125
you've got yourself
an unbeatable combination.

281
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,750
Just like the Michael
Twelve will be for you.

282
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,666
You've got an iron
with a chain on it.

283
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,916
Think of it as modern art.

284
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,208
It's headquarters....

285
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,750
There's been some kind
of massive energy flux...

286
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,750
It's fairly close
by, isn't it?

287
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,083
Right.

288
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,958
Where are we?

289
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,916
It's Shimbashi Station
on the Ginzu rail line...

290
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,791
These days they just use it
as a night train depot, though.

291
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,083
Do me a favor: unless you
want a really bad hair day,

292
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,750
don't touch the
conductor's rail.

293
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,291
Why has there been
so much activity lately?

294
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,791
Evil spirits are drawn
to places with bad vibes,

295
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,500
which makes those
places more powerful

296
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,250
and winds up attracting
more evil spirits...

297
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,541
It's how hot spots are created;
like a psychic feedback loop...

298
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,583
Still...

299
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,125
Still what?

300
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,375
The original "bad vibe"
always has an outside source.

301
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,000
Whaddaya know...?
It works.

302
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,916
Ceiling Lickers...
Category C.

303
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,125
The little creeps do have kind
of a thing for concrete stains.

304
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,958
That's too bad.

305
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,166
Don't do this to me!

306
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,041
Yomi!

307
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,208
You okay?!

308
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,041
Sorry... I ran out
of holy water.

309
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,666
Yomi...

310
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,833
What the...?

311
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,916
Wait a sec, is that...?

312
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,083
Do not go near her!

313
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,416
Category D...

314
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,083
The reanimated body
of a dead human being.

315
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,125
Oh, god!
You mean she's...?!

316
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,375
What'll we do?

317
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,791
What else?

318
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,791
But they're...!

319
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,416
They are not human.

320
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,916
But they were
at one point!

321
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,583
We have a duty to
purify this site!

322
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,125
I don't know if I...

323
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,833
It'll put them out
of their misery.

324
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,083
Kagura!

325
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,750
A Vanquisher's first obligation
is to rid the world of spirits

326
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,000
who defile
the natural order!

327
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,166
I know...!

328
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,833
It's just...
They're all...

329
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,458
How the...?

330
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,416
Kagura!

331
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,791
I don't believe it.

332
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,666
My father.

333
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,791
Spirit Eater...

334
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,791
Come forth!

335
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,500
Byakuei.

336
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,041
Feast!

337
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,291
That's your
family's Ga-rei...

338
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,708
Its ultimate
source of power.

339
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,250
Ga-rei...

340
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,833
Byakuei.

341
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,625
Kagura...

342
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,458
Hold out your hands.

343
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,375
Yes, sir.

344
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:04,291
I presume you're aware of
what a Vanquisher's duty is?

345
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,458
Yes, sir.

346
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,541
Then I presume you
also know its gravity.

347
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,708
Sir.

348
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,083
Very well then...
Purge yourself of fear.

349
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,041
Sir.

350
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,875
Master, please...

351
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,833
Grow stronger.

352
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,791
On the next
Ga-Rei: Zero:

353
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,500
Obstinate Feelings.
