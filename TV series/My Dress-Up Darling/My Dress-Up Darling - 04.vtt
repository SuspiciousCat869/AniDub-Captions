00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:16.766 position:50% align:center
Oh, here.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center
Looks like it's
in exactly two weeks.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I mean, what?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
Two weeks?

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:25.066 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to build
an entire outfit in two weeks?

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Is she insane?

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
It already takes me forever
to make clothing for <i>hina</i> dolls.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.117 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's gonna take
at least twice as long

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
to make something
for a real, live human!

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.873 position:50% align:center
Then again, I've never
actually done it before,

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.833 position:50% align:center
so I have no frame of
reference to even estimate

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:44.586 position:50% align:center
whether it could be
possible or not.

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
This sucks.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
I have to find a way. I have to.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa's looking
forward to this so much.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.888 position:50% align:center
I can't disappoint her!

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.766 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'll get on it
as soon as I'm home.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
I'll make the patterns first,
and then start cutting.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.852 position:50% align:center
Oh, jeez.

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.979 position:50% align:center
How long is that gonna take?

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
None of the pieces can be
cut in a straight line,

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center
they're all curvy.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.943 position:50% align:center
I'll need at least
two or three days.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.028 position:50% align:center
It's no use.

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.197 position:50% align:center
There's not enough time!

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.156 position:50% align:center
There it goes.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.991 position:50% align:center
My mind has been lost.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.118 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Of course, <i>Slippery</i>
<i>Girls</i> could've had something

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.120 position:50% align:center
to do with that, too.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.132 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm home.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.175 position:50% align:center
Oh good.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
I was worried.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.596 position:50% align:center
You're, uh, home pretty
late today, aren't you?

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
I just got distracted
and forgot to call.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:04.684 position:50% align:center
It was fun.

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:06.227 position:50% align:center
I went out shopping
with a friend.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
A friend, huh?

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
That's excellent news, Wakana!

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
What were you shopping for?

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.567 position:50% align:center
Some new books, maybe?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
Or those little record-CDs?

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
Huh? Grandpa! Are you okay?

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.839 position:50% align:center
There you are!

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.132 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Thanks for coming.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
It's late. I'm sorry.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
[MIORI]
Mm.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:40.345 position:50% align:center
How's Grandpa?

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] They're putting
a compress on him now.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Thankfully,
it wasn't too bad of a fall.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR]
And that's it.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
We'll get you
something for the pain.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
You be careful
and watch your step.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Doctor.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.235 position:50% align:center
I appreciate all your help.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Grandpa!

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.322 position:50% align:center
Don't scare us like that!

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] Hmm? What on earth
are you doing here, Miori?

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Just take it slow, okay?

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
Well, I had a
blank spot in my schedule.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
What? I was worried about you!

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50% align:center
So they want you to stay
in bed for two weeks?

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
Dad suggested that
you come stay with us

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
until you're feeling better.

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
I'm here to bring you
home with me.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good idea.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
Plus, their house is closer
to the hospital, anyway.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
[MIORI] We also have a car
in case we need to take you.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
Just hope I'm not a burden.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
Why don't you come spend
the night with us tonight?

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
We've got a futon for you.

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Mm.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
All right. I'll bring you
fresh clothes tomorrow.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Thanks, sorry about this.

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
Oh, but...

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
My brushes.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
Could you bring them?

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center
[MIORI] Maybe we should take
you to an acupuncturist, too.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.249 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Sure.

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.835 position:50% align:center
[MIORI]
Are you okay?

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] All this shaking,
it's just got me shook up.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
[MIORI]
No. Not okay.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
Sure, sounds great!

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.217 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I see.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
So that's why you weren't
at school yesterday.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.597 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh-huh.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50% align:center
So, um...

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
I'm going by there again
today to check on him.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
You must be so worried.

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
I'd be.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
I hope he starts
feeling better soon.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gojo.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
Let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
I can't sew, but I can cook
and do house stuff.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Kitagawa.

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
But I think I should be fine.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
Still though, it's nice of you.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.210 position:50% align:center
Right. I get it.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
Well then, let's
trade numbers, at least.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
We ought to have a way
to reach each other

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
if something comes up.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.092 position:50% align:center
Uh, cool?

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.604 position:50% align:center
I'm so far behind.

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
I didn't work on the outfit
yesterday or the day before.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50% align:center
I need to do something today.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
By the way,

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
I got the wig cut
and it looks super sick!

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
I brought it to give you.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you there?

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:09.285 position:50% align:center
Huh? Of course, sorry.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Ugh...

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
That's right,
gross midterms are next week.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.208 position:50% align:center
Could this be more poorly timed?

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
Especially since I'm the
type that needs to cram...

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No. No, no, no, no, no!

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50% align:center
Midterms?

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
I completely forgot!

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
Somehow, between visiting
Grandpa and studying for tests,

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
I have to find time
to make an entire outfit.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:31.558 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hey, Gojo.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.226 position:50% align:center
--Huh?!
--You okay?

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:36.563 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes. Yes I am!

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I think I might be in trouble.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
Hello, Gojo Dolls.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
How can I help you?

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50% align:center
You mean a tour of our workshop?

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER]
Yes, that's right.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center
I was told that you
offer tours, but if not--

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am. We sure do.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER]
Oh, that's fantastic!

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
My friend is very
interested in hina dolls,

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.340 position:50% align:center
so I think he would
really enjoy the opportunity.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.883 position:50% align:center
When are you guys
wanting to come in?

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER] Well, um, this is
kind of a last minute request.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
We were hoping
we could do it May sixth?

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:12.599 position:50% align:center
Uh, that's tomorrow!

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50% align:center
Um, I'm terribly sorry.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
We're actually closed
until next Saturday,

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
but we can fit you
in after that.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50% align:center
Anytime you'd like.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER]
Oh gosh, I wish we could.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
But you see,
my friend is here visiting

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
all the way from France.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
He's actually flying home
the day after tomorrow.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
So unfortunately,
that was our only option.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
Anyway, sorry to bother you!

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
I appreciate your help--

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
No, wait! We can do it!

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.456 position:50% align:center
Come in!

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER]
Oh, really, you can?

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.250 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
The shop owner's out,

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center
but if you don't
mind me doing it,

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
I can give you a
tour after four-thirty.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER]
Are you serious?

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
That's great, thank you so much!

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Of course!

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
Then, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What've I done?

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
What am I gonna do?

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with me?

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
What do I do?

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
What do I do?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.791 position:50% align:center
Pencils down.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT BB] Hell, yeah!
We are free, my dudes!

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
We're done!

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.177 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I should
probably finish the apron

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.846 position:50% align:center
and headdress first.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
Hey, Marin! How'd it go?

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
Uh. Fine I guess?

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.192 position:50% align:center
He's weird.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:32.614 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I figured
he'd be home by this point.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.991 position:50% align:center
I guess I thought wrong.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
Maybe now
that midterms are over,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
he can relax and
be with his Grandpa.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
Oh, Gojo. I hope he's okay.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:51.174 position:50% align:center
I guess it's a
lonely dinner for one.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
My head hurts.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
I feel sick,
like I'm gonna throw up.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
I can't focus on anything.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
When was the last time
I really slept?

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
The outfit.

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
It's not even
close to being done.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
I've let her down.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa was
so excited about it.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
She's gonna be heartbroken.

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:38.471 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
My brushes.

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
Could you bring them?

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Why are you bringing
your brushes on the trip?

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Hmm?

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
Well, I have to keep
these hands moving,

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
or they'll get rusty
and won't work.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
If I skip even a day,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
it takes another three days
to get the hang of it again.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I don't even know
how to use them properly yet.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:03.663 position:50% align:center
Been so long
since I've touched them.

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center
Maybe, I'm not cut out
for it after all.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.544 position:50% align:center
Just because you
love to do something

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean you do it well.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
You can work hard, but that
doesn't mean it'll pay off.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
What am I going
to do with my life

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.096 position:50% align:center
if I can't become a <i>kashirashi</i> ?

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What will Kitagawa say

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50% align:center
when she hears the
outfit's not done?

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.271 position:50% align:center
Why can't I do anything right?

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:29.689 position:50% align:center
What a joke.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I am such a pathetic failure.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
I'm just limping along,

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
half-assing my way
through my entire life.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
[cries]

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
Hey, Grandpa?

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Hmm?

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
Isn't it hard making
<i>hina</i> dolls every day?

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center
Don't your hands hurt?

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
Aren't you tired
of working so much?

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
Well, you're right, it is hard.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
Loving something
doesn't make it easy to do.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
But then again, it's because
you love working on it

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.956 position:50% align:center
that you can stick it out
when things get rough.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
Whenever I see
our customers smile.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful I chose to do this.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
Look.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
When what you do
makes someone happy,

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:47.350 position:50% align:center
that makes you want to keep
going even if it's hard.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hey, Gojo?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.779 position:50% align:center
You're the best.

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:01.448 position:50% align:center
It's fine not to compromise.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:04.784 position:50% align:center
I've got some things
I'm pretty hardcore about, too.

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah!

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.913 position:50% align:center
Where's the first place I should
wear it once it's complete?

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
You've saved me so
much time and money, too.

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I need scissors.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
Where are they?

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me they're missing.

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.791 position:50% align:center
It was a close call,
but it's finished somehow

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
and you can go to your event.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:37.836 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:38.795 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:44.676 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] You thought I wanted
to cosplay at today's event?

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
What? So you mean you're not...?

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I mean, I-I
had absolutely no idea

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:54.811 position:50% align:center
how long it takes
to make clothing.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center
And there are actually quite
a few cosplay events around

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center
if you search for them.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.900 position:50% align:center
Since I didn't know
what our timeline was,

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
I was just gonna wait
until you were finished.

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:07.824 position:50% align:center
I am so sorry!

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.826 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize I wasn't clear!

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.537 position:50% align:center
Now you're exhausted
because of me.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, wow.

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
That's such a relief.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:18.626 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.087 position:50% align:center
I was so anxious
about not finishing,

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
so I rushed through it.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:26.426 position:50% align:center
I'm thrilled that
there's still some time.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
For real.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
[MARIN cries]

00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
Wha...? Wait! What'd I do?

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center
No, it's just.

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
Back during exams,
you said you went home to study,

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
but I thought you were
visiting your grandpa.

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
I-I didn't know!

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:49.824 position:50% align:center
I'm such an idiot.

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
I should've realized.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.996 position:50% align:center
You've been dealing
with so much.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
And somehow you still
made time to finish the outfit.

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I promise.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
I had no idea you were
doing that for me.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
Please. Forgive me.

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
Hey. So, uh, I'm sorry, too.

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
I should've let you know
what I was doing.

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
That's why we
exchanged numbers, right?

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
This is all my fault
for not being clear.

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
No, it's not. I'm sorry.

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:34.828 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry! Really!

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
Aw, come on.

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center
Hey. Please. Don't cry.

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
So, um, why don't you try it on?

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
Let's make sure it fits.

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:48.591 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Now that there's more
time, I can tailor it properly,

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:53.388 position:50% align:center
and see if anything
needs taking in.

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:54.848 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
We should also see how
everything looks all together.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
Put your wig on and makeup, too!

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
What?

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
You want me to do it right now?

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
But you're totally
exhausted, aren't you?

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Listen to me.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
We gotta focus.

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:10.947 position:50% align:center
You want to become
Shizuku-tan, don't you?

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.782 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yeah. You know I do.

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Then you need to try it on.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center
I can't be satisfied
with my work

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
unless I know you're happy
with the final product.

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
It's really the only thing
that matters to me.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
So... Tell me the truth,

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
are you happy with it?

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
Of course! I love it so much!

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
It's perfect.

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.220 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
I'm more than happy.

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Gojo.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.102 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'm serious.

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:43.396 position:50% align:center
It means so much to me.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
I swear, I'm gonna
wear the hell out of it.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.150 position:50% align:center
I'll make you proud.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
Great!

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
Get it all out.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
Got it.

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:56.785 position:50% align:center
I feel much better now, thanks.

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
There ya go.

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
So, how you doing?

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
Got your makeup off?

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.757 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yup.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] In that case, we'll
draw your brows kinda droopy,

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
and then do a
red eyeshadow look.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:18.181 position:50% align:center
Your blush should come right
underneath your eyes,

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.767 position:50% align:center
and then we'll do a neutral lip
to make them stand out.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
But just that part'll be soft,
everything else

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
will be more dramatic to help
tie it in with the outfit.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
So it's like that
"sick girl" makeup?

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.067 position:50% align:center
Sick girl?

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
First, stretch out the eye tape.
Then, gently place...

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.321 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh wow.

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
Who would ever think to change
the shape of their eyelids?

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
I would. I even have
the same eye tape.

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
Huh? What for?

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I wanted to
try it for a while there,

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
but I never got around to it.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
I see. You know,
falsies would be great.

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center
The winged ones that
are longer on the ends

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
would also give you
that droopy look.

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.257 position:50% align:center
Then you would definitely
look like Shizuku-tan!

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
That sucks.

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
I don't have false lashes.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
I tried them once,
but they were hard to put on.

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
That's okay,
I have some you can use.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.059 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
We have a few different styles.

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
Oh perfect.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
Winged ones, too.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
So, are these your girlfriend's?

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
No! Of course not!

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
Some <i>hina</i> dolls are made
with lashes these days.

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center
It's like, a whole thing.

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:16.489 position:50% align:center
I got these to try it!

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
It makes a difference, see?

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.784 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Aww! She's adorable!

00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
I would've been psyched
if someone got me a doll

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
that looked like this
when I was little.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.582 position:50% align:center
And her kimono's
got roses on it.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] There are
some that are painted

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.460 position:50% align:center
with pink or
orange lipstick now.

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
Some are wearing blush.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.296 position:50% align:center
Some of them even have
light brown highlights

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
in their black hair,
and I've even seen blonde ones.

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:35.550 position:50% align:center
It's amazing the way
they're evolving.

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Wow, that one is so cute!

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
I love her style.

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
<i>Hina</i> dolls can be
hard to tell apart.

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
But, Grandpa, he can
tell you who the maker is

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
just by the way
the eyebrows are drawn.

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Impressive!

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] But, if you see a
<i>hina</i> doll that looks like this,

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
you immediately
know who made her.

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I hope--

00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
I hope one day,
I can do it, too, ya know?

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
Make dolls that
look this beautiful.

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center
Ah! Uh.

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
Not that this is of any
importance right now!

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
It'll happen.

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:17.550 position:50% align:center
Trust me.
You'll get there, Gojo.

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.803 position:50% align:center
I know you will.

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
Wow, thanks for saying that.

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:33.817 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Oh. So that's what it
looks like when you smile, huh?

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] This is the first time
I've seen you do it for real.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:40.365 position:50% align:center
Huh? What? That's not true.

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
My smiles are always real, see?

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
I'm smiling now.

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
So um, what do you
want to do for eyebrows?

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
Shizuku-tan's aren't
shaped like yours,

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
so we might have
to get rid of 'em.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hmm...

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
[electric shaver buzzing]

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Well, good thing
hair grows back, am I right?

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
She shaved them off?

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hey, uh, Gojo?

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
You ready to see it?

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:34.669 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:49.059 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
What do you think?

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:55.565 position:50% align:center
Did it work?

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:58.651 position:50% align:center
Do I, do I look
like Shizuku-tan?

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:01.738 position:50% align:center
Yes! You really do!

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.615 position:50% align:center
You're the perfect Shizuku-tan!

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:07.202 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right?
I am, I can feel it!

00:22:07.285 --> 00:22:08.244 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Gojo.

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:10.246 position:50% align:center
I'm totally
Shizuku-tan right now!

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.123 position:50% align:center
You are! You are!

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:14.793 position:50% align:center
You're totally
Shizuku-tan right now!

00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:48.845 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Next time!
