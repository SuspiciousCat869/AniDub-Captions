00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:14.431 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You're right.

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa, you looked
so beautiful today.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.586 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Um, are you
sure you want to do it?

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't mind.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:46.838 position:50% align:center
Oh, totes!

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
I'm the one
who sweat in it, not you.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.134 position:50% align:center
Trust me, it's all good.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.218 position:50% align:center
If you say so,

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.636 position:50% align:center
but let's wash it now.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.763 position:50% align:center
If we let it sit for too long,

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.098 position:50% align:center
the sweat salt
can ruin the style.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Mm-hmm.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.645 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] "Pour fabric softener
into cold or warm water.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
After it's combed through,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.441 position:50% align:center
gently press
the wig to wash it."

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.234 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Does this look right?

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:09.527 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yep.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.571 position:50% align:center
Oh, but it says not to rub
or squeeze too hard,

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.823 position:50% align:center
you can damage the wig.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
"Next up, change the water
and keep pressing.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.952 position:50% align:center
Then towel wrap
to absorb moisture.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.372 position:50% align:center
And lastly, place it
outside to air-dry."

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
Oh, sweet.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.415 position:50% align:center
That's not hard at all!

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.583 position:50% align:center
I was thinking it'd---

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:24.876 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
"Be sure to hand wash
the outfit, too.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.756 position:50% align:center
It can develop
sweat stains." Cool.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
Oh, apparently washing
your wig too often

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:32.926 position:50% align:center
is bad for it.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.177 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.648 position:50% align:center
[MIORI]
Are you kidding me?

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
That's what
caused you to fall over?

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.902 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] You say that like
smuggling ladies' undies

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:51.778 position:50% align:center
is normal!

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.363 position:50% align:center
They were just stockings, right?

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:56.116 position:50% align:center
Those are more along the
lines of socks than underwear.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.201 position:50% align:center
Plus, it's pretty
natural at that age.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:02.205 position:50% align:center
If anything, I'm surprised you
didn't find more of a variety.

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:05.291 position:50% align:center
That's not helpful at all.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.546 position:50% align:center
Hi, I'm home.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.339 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Oh hey, Grandpa.
How's it going?

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:13.049 position:50% align:center
[KAORU sighs]

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.678 position:50% align:center
Sorry you had to man
the shop alone for two weeks.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hi there, welcome home!

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.515 position:50% align:center
[KAORU gasping]

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50% align:center
Wakana!

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.399 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:32.360 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm relieved
that that's all it was.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:33.653 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about that.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:35.905 position:50% align:center
I hope I didn't embarrass
you back there.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Nah, I don't get
embarrassed that easily.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
So I see. I just figured...

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.913 position:50% align:center
We didn't do anything
inappropriate.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.040 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
I know.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:48.001 position:50% align:center
It was pretty obvious
when I saw that.

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
Still, weirdness aside,
this is fine work.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.505 position:50% align:center
You made it?

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.799 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Yeah, but it's
still a work in progress.

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:55.800 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Oh, really?

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:56.968 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
Looks great to me.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.014 position:50% align:center
You see this spot over here?

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
My stitches are so bad,

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.017 position:50% align:center
I was about to
pull out the glue gun.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.810 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Okay, I see it now.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:09.230 position:50% align:center
Well, it certainly is a
different beast than <i>hina</i> dolls.

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.940 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah. There are so many...

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.359 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
What's happening?

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
You see? It's almost impossible
to get the right shape.

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.112 position:50% align:center
Oh, and then
there's all of this.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, shit.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.323 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] Can't be easy
when you're used

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
to cutting straight lines.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Mm-hm.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.951 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, shit!

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
This one thousand percent
cannot be true!

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
Am I really falling
for Gojo right now?

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.708 position:50% align:center
What? No! No frickin' way! How?

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.460 position:50% align:center
I like him. But do I like him?

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
Do I love him? Ew! No! Shut up!

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
There's no way
I'm in love with the dude

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
who's besties with grandpa!

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
That doesn't work for me!

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
Oh, look at him just standing
around being adorable!

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50% align:center
I love him!

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
I can't do this.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.264 position:50% align:center
It's too exhausting!

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
I've got a life to live.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:49.020 position:50% align:center
I can't be obsessed with
the cute little seamstress boy!

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.690 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
We've got food. Are you hungry?

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
What? No!

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] Why don't you stay
for dinner with us tonight?

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah, you're already here.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
Make yourself at home.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
This looks so good!

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center
Gojo, shut up!

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
You're a good cook, too?!
You rule!

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
It's not a big deal.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
I just learned how to cook
'cause my parents are gone.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.262 position:50% align:center
Gotta eat something.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
Oh. So you're like me, then.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
--[WAKANA] Huh?
--[KAORU] Hmm?

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay, kinda.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.769 position:50% align:center
My mom got sick
and passed a while ago,

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
so then it was
just me and my dad.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.440 position:50% align:center
But when I got into high school,

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
he had to transfer for his job.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.068 position:50% align:center
With him away
for work all the time,

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
I pretty much
live on my own now.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
I'm obsessed with
this <i>kabocha</i> squash!

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's gotta be hard.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
Are you getting
all your meals in?

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Yup! The convenience
store is where it's at!

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
But I do cook for myself
when I can.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.168 position:50% align:center
Check it! Natto fried rice!

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
I got fancy with the fried
chicken and wieners.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
It was so good, I ate some
every day for a while.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
I can't sew, but I can cook
and do house stuff.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
And you're sure you're okay?

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
You get enough nutrition
from that stuff?

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.266 position:50% align:center
Totally!

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
I also drink milk
and eat yogurt every day.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
Does my body good!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.651 position:50% align:center
Marin, why don't
you start coming over

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
for dinner from now on?

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
You mind, Wakana?

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Of course not.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
What do you think, Kitagawa?

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:27.410 position:50% align:center
For real? Is it my birthday?

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
Score! Thanks!

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] So chivalrous of you
to walk me to the station.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50% align:center
Thanks. But it's the least I can
do for keeping you out so late.

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:42.133 position:50% align:center
Oh, whatever!
Dinner was totes amazing,

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
and I had so much fun
talking to your grandpa.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gojo?

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What's up?

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
So, um, I'll see you
tomorrow, right?

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:10.620 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sure!

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.208 position:50% align:center
See ya!

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
What the...? Why am I like this?

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
I didn't say anything awkward.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
Why do I feel like
I ruined everything?

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
We didn't do anything
inappropriate.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.741 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Nothing inappropriate. Huh...

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.456 position:50% align:center
Would it be so bad if we did?

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
And what if
I actually said that?

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Oh for cryin' out loud.

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
Of course it's gotta rain
when I want to get out.

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] What's a little girl
like her doing here

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.665 position:50% align:center
all by herself?

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center
Another friend of Wakana's?

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
Pardon me. You okay?

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.773 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm home.

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Oh, hello. Welcome back.

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna head out.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
'Kay.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] And you've got a
friend waiting for you inside.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
Soaked down to the bone.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
So I let her use our bath.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
Be a good host.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
Make sure you've got
a drink ready, at least.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
That's weird.

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:52.676 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Who could Grandpa
have let into the house?

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty certain Kitagawa
said she had work today,

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:59.641 position:50% align:center
and it's not like I have any
other friends besides her.

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Huh? Oh no!

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
What if it's a con artist?

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
Or someone trying
to rob the store?

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
Did they trick him somehow?

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
Huh? A kid?

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.250 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Uh?! What'd you--

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hey, Grandpa?

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
How come this <i>hina</i> doll doesn't
have any hair on her head?

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Well, that's the process.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
We do their face
and hair separately.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
First we draw the face,
then we apply the hair.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, wow! I get it!

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
That's why she's
so silky smooth!

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.578 position:50% align:center
Uh... uh... uh...

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
Uh... I.... Uh...

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA, JUJU scream]

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
I-I'm so sorry again.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:19.804 position:50% align:center
So, um, did you wanna see
something in the shop?

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50% align:center
Yes. Sort of.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
I wanna see
the outfits you made.

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh! That's it!

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
She's into <i>hina</i> dolls and
wants to learn how they're made.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
How cool!

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
She came here by herself,

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
so I bet that's why Grandpa
assumed we were friends.

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.074 position:50% align:center
Just give me one moment, please.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Here we go.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
All I need is your name
and your school's name.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
I'm Sajuna Inui.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
I'm a second-year
at Sakuranomiya High.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What? She's older than me.

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
What's wrong?

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
Nothing. Nothing at all.

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:55.882 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Who are you?

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
My name is Wakana Gojo.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
I'm a first-year in high school.

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
So, um, if you really want
to see the outfits,

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
I can show you now.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:04.766 position:50% align:center
Just some, though.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
Wait. You can?

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
Like, right this second?

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:12.107 position:50% align:center
Here they are!

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to look
as long as you'd like.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
What an amazing feeling.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
It really lifts me up
to meet others

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
who love <i>hina</i> dolls
the way that I do.

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Are those dolls broken?

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
They don't have heads.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.086 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sure they do. Look over there.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
They're crafted separately,

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
and then we combine them later.

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
'Cause that's
not creepy or anything.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
Oh, whoa.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.640 position:50% align:center
But this kimono
has Swarovski crystals.

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.475 position:50% align:center
And that one has lace.

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:49.769 position:50% align:center
Okay, I guess these
dolls are kinda cool.

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
We've got all kinds.

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
Both traditional ones
and modern ones.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
Can I look at them up close?

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.610 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry.

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
I won't touch them.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.408 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they're valuable.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.244 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I appreciate you
being so considerate.

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] Wow. These ones
are extra pretty!

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
They might be my favorites.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
Hey, good eye!

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
Those are some of the
most popular ones we have!

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet!

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
Look how striking they are!

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
So cool!

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
Aren't they though?

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.592 position:50% align:center
I love them, too!

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:23.136 position:50% align:center
Oh, you have to check out
these ones over--

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.847 position:50% align:center
Is there any particular reason
we're looking at dolls?

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
I-I guess because
this is a <i>hina</i> doll shop

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
and dolls are what we sell?

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
I know that's what you sell!

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
I was asking you about
your cosplay outfits!

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
Like this!

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
You made it, didn't you?

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
I came to order a cosplay,
not some random doll!

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean
you want to order one?

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, I don't actually make
those outfits professionally.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
You saw, didn't you?

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:50.830 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.417 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Earlier in the bathroom,

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
when you barged in,
you saw my... my...

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
That's voyeurism.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.676 position:50% align:center
And you're a peeping Tom!

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
That's illegal
and if I report you,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
you're gonna get arrested!

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Arrested, what?

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
No one else has ever
seen me like that before.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
Only you.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
And if you don't want
the police to find out,

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
then I suggest you get to work!

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
You're making outfits
for Juju now!

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:30.245 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Juju?

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Her name is Juju.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
Isn't she offensively cute?
I'm basically obsessed with her.

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I know that name.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
She's the cosplayer that
Kitagawa said she liked.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
But is that really her?

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Wow. She looks
really young, though.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
How old do you think she is?

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Hmm. She might be
in middle school?

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
Or at the end of grade school.

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
Please forgive my ignorance.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.898 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
About what?

00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] So tell me,
Juju, what brings you here?

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
And how did you find out
where I lived?

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:08.074 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, I, uh...

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
I saw that Marine
girl's cosplay photo

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.038 position:50% align:center
going around online, and...

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:16.541 position:50% align:center
Huh? Who the heck's this?

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
...she tweeted
that she was going

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
to a cosplay event after that.

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
So I went because I wanted

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:24.299 position:50% align:center
to see her outfit up close,
and then...

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:25.759 position:50% align:center
And I feel like
I'm about to burst.

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.260 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah, you probably are!

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
That outfit was measured
and sewn to fit you perfectly!

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] When I found out you
were the one who made it,

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:35.393 position:50% align:center
I went a little stalker-sauce

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
and followed you home.
I'm sorry.

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
These cosplayers are nuts!

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.613 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
For real?

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
This is Sajuna In--

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
Bro! Don't go telling
her my real name!

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
I use a cosplay name
for a reason--

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center
My Juju's name is Sajuna?

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
--Your what?
--Damn, that's cute!

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
My name is Marin Kitagawa,

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
and I'm obsessed
with everything you do!

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
I love you so much!
I'm your biggest fan!

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
--[JUJU] Too close!
--[MARIN] Oh em gee!

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
You're just
as gorgeous in person

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:04.422 position:50% align:center
as you are in your photos!

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.007 position:50% align:center
You're so cute!

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
And look at your skin!

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:08.218 position:50% align:center
Who does your hair?

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
Wait, is Juju short for Sajuna?

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] Look, I didn't pick
the name, it's just--

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
Actually, Inui told me she saw
your cosplay photos, Kitagawa.

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.352 position:50% align:center
That's why she's here.

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.690 position:50% align:center
This cosplay goddess...

00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
...saw my pics?
She looked at me?

00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
You have no idea how ecstatic
that makes me, Juju!

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
Holy crap you
really know I exist?

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
It probably popped up because
you follow me online now

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
get out of my personal space!

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
I can't handle this,
like, at all!

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
Neither can I, you're too close!

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:38.873 position:50% align:center
I'm not here for you, moron.

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:40.250 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to get hooked up

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
with one of Wakana Gojo's
custom outfits, so move!

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
Oh my god, you have,
like, the prettiest eyes!

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Something's wrong with you!

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
So what do you think?

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.512 position:50% align:center
Are you in? I need you to make

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:55.223 position:50% align:center
Shion Nikaido's
Black Lily outfit for me!

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.017 position:50% align:center
Wha... Shion-tan?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
Wait, that girl you showed me?

00:16:58.435 --> 00:16:59.936 position:50% align:center
The one with the blue dress?

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.480 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Yep! Shion-tan
from <i>Flower Princess Blaze</i> !

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] It's popular with
young girls. You've seen it?

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:06.443 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I don't watch much anime.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Princess Lily!

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] Like she said,
Shion Nikaido is a character

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
who appears in the shojo anime
<i>Flower Princess Blaze</i> .

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
She and the protagonist
Mirai decide to fight together

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
by becoming the
Flower Princess Magical Girls.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
And that's the end of you.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
Never again will you stand
before the proud lily.

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
Magical Girl...

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
...Princess Lily!

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:32.927 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
But then...

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
No. It can't be true!

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:37.766 position:50% align:center
This whole time I've
been fighting my sister?

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] She finds out
that her older sister Neon

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
is actually the enemy.

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.395 position:50% align:center
But how could you?

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:43.980 position:50% align:center
We're sisters!

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
[SHION'S FLOWER PET] This flower
is totally opening up to you!

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:49.611 position:50% align:center
Shion. We know
the truth is cruel.

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
And the truth is happiness
doesn't last forever.

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:55.992 position:50% align:center
[NEON]
Our false family.

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
The people who always
looked down on us.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.455 position:50% align:center
Is that truly
who you fought for?

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
Who you wanted to protect?

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:06.252 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
No. Please stop!

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
[NEON]
What I wanted was destruction.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
I want to destroy you all.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
Please. No!

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
[SHION'S FLOWER PET]
Uh-oh, here comes Black Lily,

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:22.268 position:50% align:center
we've got trouble!

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
Tell the truth.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
You wanted to ruin
everything, didn't you?

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
[NEON] You wanted a world that
matched the hue of your heart.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.367 position:50% align:center
As dark as the abyss.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Omigod, the drama!

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
Neon was originally
created as an enemy

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
after her flower
jewel was tainted

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
from the shock
of a broken heart.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.209 position:50% align:center
It's so unbelievably tragic...

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I guess she does know her stuff.

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:49.754 position:50% align:center
I thought she was the type
that fanned over what's popular

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
without researching anything
about the original work

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.592 position:50% align:center
and just cosplayed characters
because their outfits were cute.

00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
Heartbreak is no joke.

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:58.346 position:50% align:center
Sounds like Neon had
a pretty bad case of it.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.848 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
She totally did!

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
It turned out that two
of her childhood guy friends

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
were secretly dating!

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not
officially written anywhere,

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.023 position:50% align:center
but if you're paying attention,
it's super obvious.

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Yup.

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:10.650 position:50% align:center
One hundred percent can confirm.

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] The relationships
in <i>Blaze</i> are complicated.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
Mirai and Shion-tan are super
in love with this dude, Sakuya.

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
They actually
hardcore fight over him!

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
But Sakuya is
totally dating Soma,

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
so those crushes
doomed from the start.

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
And let's not forget that
Neon had it bad for Soma, too.

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.207 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, that's crazy.

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:27.083 position:50% align:center
Kids watch this?

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:28.710 position:50% align:center
Shion is a genius, by the way.

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
She's just messed up
because she had a rough life.

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.007 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't get her down.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.800 position:50% align:center
The fact that she's always
smiling like she's

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
tricked someone no matter what
is what made me love her

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
more than any of
the other magical girls.

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.682 position:50% align:center
So yeah, I have to cosplay her.

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:45.185 position:50% align:center
But even if you buy the
official Black Lily outfit,

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
it's super difficult to alter.

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
That's why.

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
I want you to make a custom one
for me that fits perfectly.

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] My sweet Juju
is gonna be Black Lily?

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
I would kill to see that!

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] As you can tell,
Kitagawa loves Shion, too.

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center
She even has her
all over her bag.

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
Well, if you like her so much,

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
then why don't you cosplay her?

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:06.873 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, I'd rather not do that.

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:07.957 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Why not?

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'm way too tall.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
Not to mention,
I'm pretty far off

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
from Shion-tan's small
and delicate demeanor.

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.506 position:50% align:center
Although, I do believe it's
okay to ignore all that

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
and just cosplay the
characters you love anyway.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center
But in my case,
I love her so much,

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
I don't want
to destroy her image.

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
If I'm actually
gonna cosplay someone,

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.517 position:50% align:center
I'd wanna do a good job with it.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
Besides, if it's <i>Blaze</i> ,
I'd totally wanna be Neon!

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
What the hell is happening?

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.193 position:50% align:center
Whatever! You're just
stating the obvious!

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
This sucks so bad!

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center
She's exactly the kind of
cosplayer I absolutely love!

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:40.573 position:50% align:center
I hadn't heard of her before,

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center
so it seemed like
she was just some idiot

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center
who didn't know what
cosplaying actually was,

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
but she does!

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
She's really not some
annoying bitch at all

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:49.165 position:50% align:center
and I hate that!

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry! Please forgive me!

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:53.503 position:50% align:center
Why? What'd you do?

00:20:58.258 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'm going home.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Right.

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
I'm sure your uniform is
dry by now. I'll go grab it.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Wakana Gojo.

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes?

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
Give me your
contact information.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:10.687 position:50% align:center
I'll send you more info on
Black Lily and my measurements.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
Okay, sure.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.481 position:50% align:center
Don't get all weird about it.

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
It's just
so we can talk outfits.

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
Huh? Get weird about what?

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Y'know, this whole thing.

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:21.156 position:50% align:center
I'm not trying
to steal your boyfriend.

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:22.407 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.700 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.995 position:50% align:center
I'm not her boyfriend,
and she's not my girlfriend!

00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:28.997 position:50% align:center
I've never had a girlfriend
in my entire life!

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
She's just a friend-friend.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.791 position:50% align:center
Friend-friend-friend.

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:34.294 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
So yeah, I guess I was wrong.

00:21:34.377 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
Sorry, bro.

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
All good.

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
Friend-friend-friend-
friend-friend.

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.173 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:42.135 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
Aw, you don't have
a girlfriend, Gojo?

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:45.972 position:50% align:center
That's so sad.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Is she making fun of him?

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
Maybe she is an
annoying bitch after all.

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:52.103 position:50% align:center
Hold on! Uh, Juju?

00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what?

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:55.148 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hmm...

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:58.526 position:50% align:center
So, uh, you know
how I said I'd want

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.695 position:50% align:center
to cosplay Neon from
<i>Blaze</i> instead of Shion

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
because I'm so
tall and kinda loud?

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:04.699 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:22:04.783 --> 00:22:06.868 position:50% align:center
I thought that now might be
the perfect time to try it,

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.578 position:50% align:center
like fate or something.

00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:09.829 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Hmm?

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.290 position:50% align:center
So, will you cosplay
<i>Blaze</i> with--

00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:14.292 position:50% align:center
--Hell no!
--[laughs]

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:16.795 position:50% align:center
You shot me down
before I finished asking!

00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:49.137 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Next time!
