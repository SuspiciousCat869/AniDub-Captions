00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.210 position:50% align:center
Yeah. What's wrong with it?

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
Nothing. I was just wondering.

Hmm.

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:17.697 position:50% align:center
It's like when nothing

but that's what's
so great about it.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50% align:center
Just a nice, tranquil story
with cherries on top.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.745 position:50% align:center
So the characters
just do normal things,

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
and people like
to read about that?

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.207 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Exactly right!

Slice-of-life stuff is
all warm and fuzzy,

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
so it makes for great
bedtime reading.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
In <i>SuccIDK</i> , the main guy,

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50% align:center

her mini pigtails are!

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center
That's like a ginormous
weakness of mine,

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
I always fall for characters
who have them.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center

You mean her hairstyle?

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] That's why
I have such a crush on Juju!

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center

Liz something fierce!

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
I love her so hard!

I mean, look at her,
she is adorbz!

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
Veronica does
show a lot of skin.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
I promise to be more sensitive
when I pick the next character.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] At least there's more
to this cosplay than Veronica's.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Not saying I'd
actually do it, but ya know.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Huh? Why wouldn't you?

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
The amount of skin she shows?

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:15.630 position:50% align:center

[MARIN] I mean,
I love the heck out of Liz,

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.845 position:50% align:center
but her mini pigtails
are a problem.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
They're what make
her so adorable,

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.057 position:50% align:center
but I couldn't pull 'em off.

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.643 position:50% align:center
Only little pixie-like
girlies can rock that.

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center

Uh, what?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
Why the psycho-stare?

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.193 position:50% align:center
Is there something on my face?

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
I just...

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center

I know you didn't think

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
you could cosplay Shion- <i>tan</i>
since she's a little kid,

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center

a hairstyle, right?

Mm-hmm.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
So why not go for it, then?

Couldn't hurt to try.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center

seem to love her.

S-So maybe for you.

You should.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
She really did look amazing

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
as both Shizuku- <i>tan</i>
and Black Lobelia,

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
so I know she doesn't have
anything to worry about.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
By the way,

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
you said Liz was something
called a succubus?

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
I've never heard that term.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
Well, the short explanation is
that they're lady demons.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
Cool.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
They make dudes
have sexy-time dreams,

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center
and then they suck out all
their man juice and kill them!

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Totally awesome, right?

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
I knew you'd get hooked!

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.275 position:50% align:center
I think there's
one nearby, let's go.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
There's also a clothing store.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
You got some new <i>jinbei</i> !

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
Perfect for this hot weather.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
Good choice.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
I actually got two sets.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
This one looks great on you.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.803 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Grandpa, I...

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
I can't believe this.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:37.267 position:50% align:center
It doesn't feel real.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
I am currently at a love hotel.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.646 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The previous day.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I bought a swimsuit
that looks like Liz's outfit

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
and it's super cute.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm finished on my end as well.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
F'Real?

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.612 position:50% align:center
Then, you wanna do Liz's
photoshoot at a studio?

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
Your place is
all Japanese-style,

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
and the posters in
my room are a bit yikes.

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
Hold up.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
I found a studio that
looks like Kaname's place!

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
And it's super
close to you, Gojo!

00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
Oh, damn!

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
It's only 59 hundred yen.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
So cheap!

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.543 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I had no idea there was
a photo studio near my house.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.128 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I reserved it so fast.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
Can you meet me
at the station tomorrow?

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
All right.

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center
Are you sure there's
really a studio in here?

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.514 position:50% align:center
Yeah, why not?

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
You gotta pay first,
so I'll go make that happen.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
We're in room 303.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:21.936 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Wait.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
They have more
than 300 studios?

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Here we are.

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
Oh, damn!

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
This bed is huge!

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
Like emperor-size!

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
I mean, if you're a
famous light novel author,

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.291 position:50% align:center
your bed better be this big!

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
There's so much room,
but it's, like, simple, y'know?

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.755 position:50% align:center
It looks just like
Kaname's room!

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
Oh em gee, is that
what I think it is?

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
Yeah, dude, pretty sure we've
got a room in a love hotel.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
Oh well, whatever works!

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
What's the matter with you, bro?

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, uh, nothing at all.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.727 position:50% align:center
It's just that
for a second there,

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
I thought you said
we're in a love hotel?

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
Yup! Isn't it cool?

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Y-Y-You didn't tell me that!

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
These are things
I like to be aware of!

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
Why are we in a love hotel?

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
Do you know what goes on
in these places?

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50% align:center
Not photography!

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
Guess I got too excited.

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
I saw Kaname's bed online
and just clicked!

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center
It said we could
take cosplay photos.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
And it's stupid cheap!

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.832 position:50% align:center
So I insta-reserved,
'cause hello?

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
And that brings us to now!

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize what it was

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
until we were outside
looking at the place!

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:29.713 position:50% align:center
And now we're locked in!

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
Sad emoji!

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
I guess it pays to read
the fine print, huh?

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Of course.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
This is classic Kitagawa!

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
But besides that oopsie,
I'd say we lucked out!

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
I mean, look around, is this
not totes Kaname's style?

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.024 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I can make this work.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.526 position:50% align:center
All I have to do is
imagine it's a studio!

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
If only that were possible!

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
I'm not creative enough
to ignore all of this!

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
The abandoned hospital
I could deal with.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
But I can't just pretend
this stuff isn't here!

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
This room is crawling with.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center
adult paraphernalia!

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
Ahhh.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
I can't take it anymore.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
I'm getting dizzy.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:10.837 position:50% align:center
Just thinking about
being in a love hotel

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center
with Kitagawa is
more than I can handle!

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
To be honest.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
I've been curious about
what these places are like.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.097 position:50% align:center
I know some cosplayers
who have sleepovers here,

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.682 position:50% align:center
and it sounds like a blast!

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
Girls' night at a love hotel?

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.477 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yeah!

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
See, doesn't that look rad?

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
You can even get a discount
if you bring a large group.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I guess you're right.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
They do look like
they're having fun.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
For sure!

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.695 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Is that a bunch
of bread underneath?

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yup!

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
I think they have it here, too.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
Do you have a sweet tooth, Gojo?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.993 position:50% align:center
Well, sometimes I eat candy.

00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
But it's usually
just when I'm working.

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
Chocolate's good when
you're working on stuff

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
that takes brain power.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
That's why Kaname
eats it so much.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
Ah, I was wondering why he was
always eating those things.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
Let's order some food.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
Okay, thanks.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
That actually sounds...
like a horrible idea!

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] That performance
was a ten out of ten.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Look, I know it
was an honest mistake.

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:01.596 position:50% align:center
But we're both minors,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.056 position:50% align:center
so we're not even
supposed to be in here.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
Well, that might be true
if we were normies.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What? We are normies!

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.311 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay, fine, you win.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:10.647 position:50% align:center
Sometimes my ideas suck.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
Now that that's done,
I'll go change!

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What? Why?

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
Because the whole point
was to cosplay!

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
It would be a
huge waste of money

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
if we didn't do it now, right?

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're serious.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
Omigod, look at this bathtub!

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
It's outta control!

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's a bougie jacuzzi too!

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
Wanna hop in with me?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.085 position:50% align:center
[MARIN giggles]
I'm totally kidding, dude!

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
Just sit back and chillax!

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.384 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Nope. Can't do it.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
Relaxation is not possible.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
I agree that letting all
that money go to waste

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
is not the ideal situation.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
But, still...

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa, please!

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
We have to go.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
This is not good!

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:55.859 position:50% align:center
I'll just watch TV.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
That should make
the time go faster.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center
[moaning]

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:02.240 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Stupid, pervy, love hotel.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
[ACTRESS]
We can't.

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
[moaning, giggling]

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hmm...

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] What kind
of animal watches this?

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Omigosh, Gojo!

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What? I was just changing it!

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I am freaking out!

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
This is the cutest one yet!

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:38.026 position:50% align:center
I am so hyped right now;
you are the best!

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
You really mean that?

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I look super hot!

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
You are a for-real genius!

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
The pearls for buttons
are mega cute!

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
And I am obsessed with the back
of this collar being a heart!

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:49.621 position:50% align:center
It's ridiculously sweet!

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
It's all so perfect,
I might throw up!

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
To make the collar, I just
matched the shape of Liz's tail.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
I embellished with both
chemical and cotton lace.

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
Oh, I've always wondered
what that fabric was!

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
Also, I, um, I did some
research on the succubi.

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
Since I was committed
to making this,

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
I figured I should face
the creatures head-on.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.016 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
You're hardcore, man!

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] They seem
to be all about seduction.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
I saw a lot of characters in,
uh, revealing outfits.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.024 position:50% align:center
But that's not the
main focus in <i>SuccIDK</i> .

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
So I made it more wholesome.

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'm so proud of you!

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
But then, I noticed
her height changes.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.284 position:50% align:center
So I imagined what
the simplified portions

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
would look like if
Liz were a real person,

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
and I ended up adding more
details than I'd anticipated.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
I guess it's my own
interpretation.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
If the goal was to match
the author's design

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.796 position:50% align:center
as closely as possible,

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.716 position:50% align:center
then technically,
what I did would be wrong.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
This totally works, though.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Huh?

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
Seriously.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
It's like how designs change
from manga to anime.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.099 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Mm-hmm.

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.475 position:50% align:center
Nothing wrong with
cosplaying the anime

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
if you like it better.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.145 position:50% align:center
It's whatever floats your boat.

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
Cosplayers work hard on
their outfits, but in the end,

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
they're all doing their
own unique interpretation.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
That's what makes it
such an amazing hobby.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
Being free to explore the world
on your own terms makes it fun.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center
So this costume is
your interpretation,

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
and that's totally
the way to roll.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
Besides, you can do no wrong.

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:16.374 position:50% align:center
Your cosplays
are always flawless.

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
You do an incredible job!

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
You have to know that, right?

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
Uh, thank you so mu--

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right!

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
I heard this
urban legend about how

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
if you keep a condom in your
wallet, you'll get hella rich!

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
You wanna try it?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.808 position:50% align:center
I've never heard
that before in my life.

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I saw it on TV a while ago.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
Cosplay is expensive,

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
so I could use some extra bread
if you know what I mean.

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.150 position:50% align:center
Bingo! Here's yours, Gojo!

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.234 position:50% align:center
Good luck!

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:44.569 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Wait, I have to do it, too?

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.863 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Unless you wanna be
the worst friend ever?

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.032 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uhh... Huh?

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
How do the mini pigtails look?

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.885 position:50% align:center
Are they weird on me?

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.261 position:50% align:center
No, not at all.

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
You look like Liz just
hopped out of the manga!

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.766 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.812 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I feel so
self-conscious right now.

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
Wow. How beautiful!

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.192 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
The wig. The color is
subtle but still bright.

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:29.447 position:50% align:center
The wig?

00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:31.199 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's cute, but what?

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Huh?
Did I say something wrong?

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:34.828 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Aw, yeah!

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
The instant I put on
these fierce demon wings

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
is when this bad boy really
starts to come to life!

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
I'm so hyped!

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
Okay, I've been thinking.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.254 position:50% align:center
and I wanna recreate
some scenes.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:45.797 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Like what?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I made sure
to mark all my favorites.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] It looks like you
marked every page.

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I even brought some props!

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:56.182 position:50% align:center
We're totally gonna get some
baddy bad photos with these!

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
Your eyes are getting heavy,
and you're very sleepy.

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:04.357 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you warn me?

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center
That would've been
such a good shot!

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
[MARIN laughs]
Jeez, you're dramatic!

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
I can do it again, goober.

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:19.122 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes, that's perfect!

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
Hold it right there!

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
Oh I love the mask!

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.418 position:50% align:center
It's so random, yet so Liz!

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
Let's get some shots
of you eating chocolate.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sounds good!

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
Mmm!

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
Can I have another one?

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.386 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Kitagawa.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.888 position:50% align:center
I think that's good, Kitagawa!

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
I promise, we've got plenty
of shots with the chocolate!

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
We took so many photos.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
We sure did!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
Okay, last one.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
I wanted to get a shot of
her singing the lullaby to him.

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
Oh, for sure!

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
That scene is a huge must!

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
Let's take it right now!

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Great! We're on the same page!

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hmmm...

00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh my god, you hate it.

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I don't hate it,

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
but something's
definitely not right.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
We need to see the eye-contact,
but I'm not quite sure how.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
So you want it like Liz is
looking at the viewer?

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's it!

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa. Think you
can get on top of me?

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.637 position:50% align:center
The lens can be
Kaname's point of view!

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
What if you can't breathe?

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
Is that safe?

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I'll take it quickly.
It'll be fine.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.893 position:50% align:center
Well, if you're sure.

00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
If I'm too heavy,
just tell me, okay?

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I will, but you're not.

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.151 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna sit down,
so brace yourself.

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm braced!

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Ready? Tighten your abs.

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
Good to go whenever you are!

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna start shooting.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay!

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.834 position:50% align:center
That's so good!

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I know!

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:48.586 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Like, perfection!

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
It's amazing what a difference
the angle can make.

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Don't stop.

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:56.511 position:50% align:center
It's so fun!

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
I love getting ready

00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
and seeing the gorgeous
cosplay come to life!

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
And then taking the photos

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
and looking at them together!

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
It's just the best!

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50% align:center
I can't think of one thing

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50% align:center
I don't love to death
about cosplay!

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:10.358 position:50% align:center
There's nothing better
in the whole world!

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:11.693 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
I'm having fun
shooting with you.

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
[distant moaning]

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I just heard a
voice coming from next door.

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
It sounded like...

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.792 position:50% align:center
Oh god. I totally forgot!

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
I'm in a love hotel!

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
What have I done?

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
I was so caught up
in the photoshoot.

00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
I told Kitagawa
to get on top of me!

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
And she did!

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa!

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
I need you to get off
of me right now!

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:57.906 position:50% align:center
[distant moaning]

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Hello, Gojo Dolls,
how may I help you?

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
I mean, sorry.

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
Hi. Excuse me?

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
An extension of what?

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:50.959 position:50% align:center
Oh, oh no no no, that's okay.

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm quite sure, thank you.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Uh. Apparently,
someone else needs this room!

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:02.887 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh. Right. Okay.

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
I guess I lost track of time.

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go change now.

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:37.881 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
That was way too close.

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
Sorry, you go ahead!

00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
[GUEST B]
My goodness, how old are we?
