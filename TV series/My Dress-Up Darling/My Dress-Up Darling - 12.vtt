[phone beeps]

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.279 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:47.751 position:50% align:center
Thanks for teaching me
how to do this, Gojo.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.711 position:50% align:center
You're seriously my hero.

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No problem.

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.964 position:50% align:center
I wanted to make sure the
ribbons were in the right place,

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:54.758 position:50% align:center
so it worked out.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.176 position:50% align:center
But I'm really sorry
that you didn't get to go

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.345 position:50% align:center
to the festival with your dad.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.304 position:50% align:center
Why are you sorry?

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:01.389 position:50% align:center
He's the one who canceled on me.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50% align:center
But I'm glad at least
you have a soul.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.061 position:50% align:center
Homework?
Of course I haven't done it.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:09.314 position:50% align:center
I still have two whole weeks
of summer vacay left.

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:12.901 position:50% align:center
What? What are you talking
about? That's plenty of time!

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.819 position:50% align:center
Wait. We're not going
because of homework

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.738 position:50% align:center
that's not even due yet?

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that was a real thing
I went through.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
Not sure why
he wouldn't believe me

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.994 position:50% align:center
since I'm the one
who actually goes there.

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
He's been asking me to send pics
of my homework as proof

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:26.706 position:50% align:center
that I'm doing it.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
That's micromanaging!

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
Warden!

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
[sighs] This totally sucks.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
I haven't gone to a
single festival this year.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
Almost forgot.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.718 position:50% align:center
Iwatsuki had their fireworks
festival yesterday.

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:41.262 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] What? And you didn't
even think to invite me?

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
Worst friend ever!

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Well, you couldn't go
anyway because of your homework.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:48.853 position:50% align:center
Okay fine.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
I've been out there busting A
on a bunch of jobs I got,

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
so I guess I just blocked

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
the whole "summer
homework" thing out.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
That reminds me,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
I've been wanting to ask
what it is you do for work.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
Oh, ya know.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.032 position:50% align:center
Just stuff.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.742 position:50% align:center
See?

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What? Seriously?

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.499 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa, you're in a magazine!

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
Are you like a new celebrity
I hadn't heard about?

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
No, I'm a model.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
Mostly just catalogue.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
How did that happen?

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I was at the salon
and this one editor

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
thought I had a
good look or something

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
and asked me
if I was interested.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
I said sure, why not?

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
It's cool!

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
I've just been doing way more
shoots than usual lately.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
That almost doesn't
look like you!

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
What an amazing shot.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Right?

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.858 position:50% align:center
It's 'cause I've got an actual
makeup artist beating my face.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] So why are you doing so
many additional shoots lately?

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
You're exhausted.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Well...

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
DSLRs are top dollar.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
Gotta write that check!

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, wow.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa's seriously
planning on buying

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
one of those
mega-expensive cameras.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Ugh, I call break time!

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:56.546 position:50% align:center
Ooh, do you feel
like watching a movie?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] You really
like watching scary movies,

00:04:58.798 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center
don't you?

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
"Like's" a strong word.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
More like FOMO since
part three's coming out.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
I wanna know what
the hype's about!

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
Plus, it's what you
do in summer!

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
Okay. I don't usually
watch horror films so,

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
how scary are these exactly?

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just a movie,
so it won't be that scary.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
You can do it!
I believe in you!

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
[ACTRESS]
What? A voicemail?

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
Who could it be from?

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
[MOVIE MONSTER]
Oh, hello.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
Let me see your eyes.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
Turn around.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
I'm right behind you.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
[ACTRESS screams]
No! Stop! Please!

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:43.968 position:50% align:center
Why are you doing this to me?
Stop it! No! No!

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.855 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Wow, what an ending!

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
That was a great movie!

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
Meh. It was okay.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
But it wasn't scary,
like at all, though.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
There was one scene
that was brilliant.

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.990 position:50% align:center
You don't mind if
we watch it again, right?

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50% align:center
Why would we do that?

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Maybe I can figure out

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50% align:center
how they did their costumes
and special effects makeup.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
I mean, check out that fabric.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center
It looks old, yeah?

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
And do you think they're
using contact lenses?

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
It's probably CG.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Look at that! Oh, cool!

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
There's so much
to learn from each scene!

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay, Dad.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
Here's some
homework pics for ya.

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
And donezo!

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
Ugh, that was rough.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
If there was math, too,
I couldn't handle it.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
We have math.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
But I already
finished mine, though.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:40.900 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
But I don't have my...

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center
I'm seriously gonna die.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
I think I left
everything at school!

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] They weren't happy
that we showed up

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
out of uniform, huh?

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I'm so sorry
I made you come with me.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It's fine.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
It's on my way home, anyway.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad you found
your assignments.

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Yeah. But seriously,
the school looks hella creepy

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
after watching that movie,
doesn't it?

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
It's so dark and spooky.

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.723 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Not to mention
our footsteps are echoing.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.058 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
If we got here any later,

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
this would've been a
full-blown test of courage.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA chuckles]
That's true.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.690 position:50% align:center
Oh, I need to go get some
things to make dinner.

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
I know, how about you
eat with us tonight?

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd
never ask me again!

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I'm pretty sure
she's only been eating

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
that sad fried rice.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
So, whatcha got on the menu?

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.162 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I was thinking
cold <i>somen</i> noodles

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.748 position:50% align:center
with some shrimp, onion,
and <i>mitsuba kakiage</i> .

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.750 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Omigod, that sounds amazing!

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.794 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
you can make <i>kakiage</i> !

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.505 position:50% align:center
You've got some
mad skills, Chef Gojo!

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.507 position:50% align:center
I can't fry anything
to save my life.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
That's like expert-level.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.344 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.430 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oooh!

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.640 position:50% align:center
I never took swim class,

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
so I haven't gotten
to check out this beaut!

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.103 position:50% align:center
It's ginormous up close!

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
I don't know if it's a such
good idea for us to be here

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
when we're not on the swim team.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
I'm sure regular
students are allowed.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
I gotta dip
my feet in, for real.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
Testing.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I don't think
you should do that!

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.700 position:50% align:center
Just let me try it!

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.536 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Kitagawa!

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Kitagawa!

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
Thanks bro.

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
I seriously thought
I was a goner.

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
Yeah! So did I!

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
Do you really not
know how to swim?

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
Nah, dude. Can't even float.
It just looked so nice and cool!

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Huh, wait a minute,
didn't you say you went

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
to the beach with your friends

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
around the
beginning of the month?

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
Did you actually have fun?

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
You mean 'cause I don't swim?

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.198 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, yes.

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Hmm... I don't mind
missing out on that part.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
I basically just go to
the beach to eat, hang out,

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
and take pics, so that's
how my socks are rocked.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
Huh. Ah, I can see that.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
It's so nice.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50% align:center
I love sitting on the sand,
listening to the crashing waves,

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
and I love watching
the ocean get sparkly

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.594 position:50% align:center
when the sun starts
to set behind it.

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
It's really magical, y'know?

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
Even if I can't swim, I always
jump at the chance to go.

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:29.027 position:50% align:center
[MARIN laughs]

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.030 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that must sound
a little crazy to you, huh?

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
Like, who does that?

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
What's funny?

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
What did I say?

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
It's not crazy.

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
I understand you.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
I feel the same way.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
Even though I still can't paint
<i>hina</i> dolls very well.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.390 position:50% align:center
I love them! It's fun.

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:01.184 position:50% align:center
Exactly!
That's totally what I mean.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we all feel
that way about something.

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:04.938 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.690 position:50% align:center
But not being able to swim
could lead to drowning,

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
so let's not take it that far.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.403 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Yeah, I promise
I'll be more careful.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gojo?

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:15.865 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes?

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna look for festivals
that're still happening.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
Wanna come if I find one?

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
But what about homework?

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
You still have a lot to do.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that's right!

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:29.004 position:50% align:center
Uh. Okay, I'll finish
the rest super-fast!

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:30.505 position:50% align:center
Just help me
with the hard parts?

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA laughs]
Sure! You got it.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
[phone beeps]

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] I'm so proud of Marin
for finishing all her homework!

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.330 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah. Okay, see ya!

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
Right! You be careful out there.

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:15.592 position:50% align:center
Have a great time, Wakana!

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
There are so many people.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
I didn't know it
got this crowded.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:50.085 position:50% align:center
Man, it's gonna be tough
for her to find me in this mess.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:51.002 position:50% align:center
Where is she?

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
I hope she's okay.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Ah!

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
There he is!

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.592 position:50% align:center
I finally found you!

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:04.724 position:50% align:center
The crowds here are crazy,

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
so I had a hard time
getting through.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
It's cool.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
You're wearing your new clothes!

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
See, I told you
they'd look great on you!

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
Who's hot?

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50% align:center
Thanks. And you
decided to wear a yukata?

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
I went all out and
had someone do my hair

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
and get me into this thing.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:27.747 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.251 position:50% align:center
Oh, I think I know!

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:33.878 position:50% align:center
You're a back-of-the-neck
dude, arencha?

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.215 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:41.219 position:50% align:center
Um. Well, uh,
I wouldn't say that.

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
Uh, uh.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.600 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
No way! For real?

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
For really, really, really,
really, really reals?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
[MARIN gasps] I could choke
on how hyped I am right now!

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad I wore a yukata!

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
I'm def dropping
neck bombs out here!

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.827 position:50% align:center
So, any idea what time
the fireworks show starts?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.870 position:50% align:center
Seven!

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
Are you excited
or angry right now?

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
[MARIN gasps]

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
Look, they have
candy apples there!

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
I'm goin' in!

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
Everything here looks great.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
Oh! <i>Okonomiyaki!</i>

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE A]
Thank you!

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
This looks amazing!

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.895 position:50% align:center
Huh? Huh?!

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
They have <i>yakitori</i> , too!

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
Nice and hot!

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
We're not done yet?

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.537 position:50% align:center
This is a lot of food.

00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
Had to get enough
for two people!

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
Let's go slam it
down in the plaza.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:58.171 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
Thank you for your patience.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
We're excited to announce
that the fireworks show

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
will start momentarily.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
Please enjoy.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.011 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Crap. We better hurry up, Gojo.

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Right.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
You know, this is actually
my first time coming down

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.975 position:50% align:center
to the plaza to watch
the fireworks.

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
Seriously? No way.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:16.022 position:50% align:center
You never went to the
fireworks festival at Iwatsuki?

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:19.359 position:50% align:center
That's sort of a waste when
you live so close, isn't it?

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:08.783 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I can smell the
gunpowder and the smoke.

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:11.578 position:50% align:center
I can hear people cheering.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
Seeing everything so close.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center
Feeling these sounds resonate
through my whole body.

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Last year, the year
before, and even before that.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
Every year that I can remember,
I'd be alone in my room.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center
Fireworks were just
some loud, echoing noise

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
I'd hear off in the distance.

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.613 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
But this year it's different.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
Ah! Your tongue's blue!

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
What happened,
are you dying right now?

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:35.662 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I ate a Blue Hawaii, goober!

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:36.996 position:50% align:center
It turns your tongue blue!

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
And you ate it knowing that?

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yup! Lookatit!

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.043 position:50% align:center
Lookatit! Come'ere!

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.211 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Stop!

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
Ow.

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] The straps did
a number on your feet.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.388 position:50% align:center
You must be in so much pain.

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
There's a convenience
store nearby.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
I'll get you some bandages.

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
Nah.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
No point going there just
to come all the way back.

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
But you're hurt.

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:01.271 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'm not dead.

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
So just take me with you.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
Take you how?

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.361 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Look how high I am!

00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:09.904 position:50% align:center
Is this what your life is like?

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center
I'm so jealous of
your giraffe view!

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.367 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
She smells really nice.

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
But f'real, how tall are you?

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
Um... A 180, I guess?

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa! It's dangerous
if you move too much!

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.794 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Whoops, my bad!

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:26.588 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd be
about that tall.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.343 position:50% align:center
The last part of the fireworks
was out of control!

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
They were beautiful.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
Pretty funny that you
can't see them in the smoke.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I didn't know
that could happen.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
I'm happy that I came.

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:44.647 position:50% align:center
Me too. Well, mostly anyway.

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
Kinda lame that my shoes decided
to become piranhas in the end.

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
What jerks.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
You're not used to wearing them,
so it makes sense.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
I know but, when this
sort of crap happens,

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
it sucks the life out of
the day you were having

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:59.954 position:50% align:center
and leaves you with
a weird sense of "meh."

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
So, I'm sorry Gojo.

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:08.046 position:50% align:center
I promise that I'll be
more careful next year.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
She said next year.

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:18.598 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, and next year,

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
we should go to Iwatsuki's
firework festival, too.

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah. Let's do it!

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Actually, why don't we

00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
just hit up all the fireworks
festivals in the Kanto region?!

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Really?

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
You think we could do that?

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] You can do anything
with the right attitude!

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:33.196 position:50% align:center
And someone to help carry you.

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA yawns] I guess
it's time to call it a night.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:18.968 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kitagawa?

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
Everything okay?

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hey, Gojo.

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:24.057 position:50% align:center
What are you doing right now?

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
I'm going to bed.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
It's pretty late.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.186 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Well, no.

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
I mean, not exactly.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
I-I was just thinking of you
and wanted to hear your voice.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
Also, I'm sort of
afraid to go to sleep.

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:44.577 position:50% align:center
I ended up watching <i>On-Den Two</i> !

00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, that's the sequel, right?

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
But wait, didn't you say you
weren't scared of that movie?

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but that was just
because you were over here

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
with me that time,

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
so I was mostly fine with it.

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center
But I'm by myself now

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
and every little sound
is freaking me out!

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
[MARIN screams]

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:15.525 position:50% align:center
I would seriously die if
someone came up behind me,

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
so I've been on high alert!

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
I took a shower,
and I didn't shut my eyes once.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.282 position:50% align:center
C'mon, I'm sure nobody's there.

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's a
fictional plot, right?

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:25.910 position:50% align:center
You don't know
that for sure, Gojo!

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:27.996 position:50% align:center
It could be a true story,
you ever thought about that?

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.414 position:50% align:center
Like what if there's
a zombie voicemail

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
on my phone right now
and I get murdered?

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
I seriously can't with all this!

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50% align:center
I just watched a movie
about smartphones

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
and now I have a voicemail

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:37.339 position:50% align:center
and there's nothing
I can do about it!

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center
Please, Gojo.

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
It doesn't have to be for long,

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.885 position:50% align:center
I just need you
to keep talking to me.

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
You can even put your phone
on speaker and fall asleep!

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center
Um. Okay, sure.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center
[MARIN laughs]
So, that's what happened!

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:55.774 position:50% align:center
How is Nowa so super strong?

00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:57.192 position:50% align:center
That girl is unreal.

00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:59.402 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I had no idea she was like that.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
Crazy.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
[MARIN sighs] Y'know, I feel
like I'm not as scared anymore.

00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:07.410 position:50% align:center
Thanks for being a boss, Gojo.

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:08.953 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm glad it helped.

00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:10.372 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're tired.

00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:12.791 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
school starts tomorrow.

00:22:12.874 --> 00:22:13.750 position:50% align:center
It's not fair!

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:16.002 position:50% align:center
Summer vacay was way too short.

00:22:16.086 --> 00:22:18.380 position:50% align:center
There's still
so much I didn't get to do!

00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:20.924 position:50% align:center
Like watch <i>PrezHost</i> . Heh.

00:22:21.007 --> 00:22:23.551 position:50% align:center
Do a little more modeling.

00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:24.928 position:50% align:center
Oh, and!

00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:27.639 position:50% align:center
I wish we'd gone to one
more cosplay event together!

00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:29.974 position:50% align:center
There's not enough time
in one day!

00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:35.980 position:50% align:center
Right. One day. One day.

00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:38.108 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Sounds like
he's about to pass out.

00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:42.529 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I think this
year was really fun.

00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:45.448 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Mm-hmm.

00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:48.535 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
It was. We did so much together.

00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:51.496 position:50% align:center
Every day has been so amazing.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.098 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gojo.

00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:14.352 position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:23:22.694 --> 00:23:24.487 position:50% align:center
He's out like a light.

00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:28.074 position:50% align:center
Well, that was pointless.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.618 position:50% align:center
I should try to sleep, too.

00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:42.672 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'm gonna hang up, okay, Gojo?

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:51.139 position:50% align:center
G'night, goober.
[giggles] See you later.
