00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:17.851 position:50% align:center
You know, if we're both
gonna do <i>Blaze!!</i> characters

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.352 position:50% align:center
for our next projects,

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
we should turn this
into a group cosplay!

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
Nope, not happening.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.482 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
A "group cosplay"?

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.942 position:50% align:center
Must be when people
do different characters

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.569 position:50% align:center
from the same series.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
I prefer to cosplay
for myself, by myself,

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
and knock out photoshoots
without interference.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.325 position:50% align:center
I have no plans to work
with other cosplayers.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.037 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I did notice
your photos are pretty detailed.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
Especially for Black Lily,

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:41.249 position:50% align:center
since I intend to go all-out
and rent out a studio space.

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.792 position:50% align:center
A studio?

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
Holy crap! So cool!

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.053 position:50% align:center
Can I come with you?
I wanna see!

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.055 position:50% align:center
I told you,
I'm not doing group cos--

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
What if I split
the studio fees with you?

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I've heard some
of the swankier places

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.728 position:50% align:center
will totally clean you out.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.021 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, really?

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:04.397 position:50% align:center
Want me to pitch in, too?

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.565 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Huh?

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:07.650 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you saying
you'll want to come?

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:08.651 position:50% align:center
She'll need me.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.153 position:50% align:center
I help Kitagawa
put on her makeup.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.364 position:50% align:center
Fake eyelashes are hard for her.

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:13.656 position:50% align:center
Is he serious?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.991 position:50% align:center
Tell me that's a joke.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.576 position:50% align:center
Nope, it's the truth!

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.995 position:50% align:center
It's pretty goofy
though, isn't it?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I'm making fun of you.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:56.885 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Let's think about this.

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:59.763 position:50% align:center
Studio fees tend to run
about 15,000 yen an hour.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:03.099 position:50% align:center
But if I split the cost, I can
spend the rest on my outfits.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.851 position:50% align:center
That's worth it, right?

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:10.482 position:50% align:center
Okay. You can totally
ignore all of that.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:11.900 position:50% align:center
No hard feelings!

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:14.235 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for
bothering you with this.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.905 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to your
Black Lily photos either way!

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I...

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
I could be persuaded.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50% align:center
If you wanted to come,
just this once, you can.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.626 position:50% align:center
Hell, yes!

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
A cosplay duet with Juju!

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Just this once, though!

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
You heard me say that, right?

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
This should be fun!

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.635 position:50% align:center
But I'd better watch
the show first.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
Why, what good'll that do you?

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't reference
photos be enough?

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
Well, they're a pretty good
jumping off point for sure.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.229 position:50% align:center
But understanding the
source material will help me

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:53.233 position:50% align:center
pick exactly the right
fabric for each character.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
I played <i>Slippery Girls 1</i> and <i>2</i>
to make notes on Shizuku- <i>tan</i> .

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.905 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
What?

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It was surprisingly moving.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
When the protagonist
enters the club  room,

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center
the president's naked,
and in her anu--

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
Stop! That's enough, I get it
already, you did your research!

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.207 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Let's see,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.585 position:50% align:center
<i>Flower Princess Blaze!!</i>
already finished airing, right?

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
Do you know if there's
anywhere that I can stream it?

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center
I own the entire series,
I can just lend you my box set!

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that would be great!

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.427 position:50% align:center
But are you sure that's okay?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.847 position:50% align:center
It's so much fun,
and you can totally binge it!

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
It's only a 126 episodes!

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
A hundred and what?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
[KAORU laughs]

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
Y'got a new project, do ya?

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's an anime thing.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
But the DVDs are heavy,

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center
so I'm gonna go pick it up
from Kitagawa tomorrow.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
Ah! I'll watch the shop, then.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
Go have fun.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What's taking him so long?

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
Did I do that bad a job?

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
It's true I haven't practiced
much lately, so I guess...

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Hmmm

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Wakana.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hmm? Yes?

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
Your work has improved!

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
Huh? Really?

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes!

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] Your lines used
to be a bit stiff and jagged.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.966 position:50% align:center
But here, they're
looking much softer!

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
I can't really tell, myself.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Hmm...

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
You know what I think did it?

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
Making that outfit for Marin.

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] You even did her
makeup, didn't you?

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Mm-hmm.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] And I'm sure
you approached it

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.864 position:50% align:center
with the exact same care and
concentration you would

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
when painting
a <i>hina</i> doll's face.

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
See that?

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.496 position:50% align:center
To be a great dollmaker,

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:14.624 position:50% align:center
you can't only look
at dolls, you know.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50% align:center
Look for beauty everywhere.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
Do that.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:20.797 position:50% align:center
And I guarantee it'll pay off.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes, sir.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:35.020 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.983 position:50% align:center
Wait, I didn't get
here too early, did I?

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
I swear this was
the time she gave me.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
Sorry! I just woke up!

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
I started watching
<i>Blaze!!</i> last night

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
and just couldn't stop.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
Totally my bad.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
Why don't we grab my bust point?

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center
Twenty centimeters!

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.507 position:50% align:center
You could find out!

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
Uhh, Gojo?

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50% align:center
Uhhh!

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
You good, bro?

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry!

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:13.767 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hmm?

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.609 position:50% align:center
[MARIN splutters]

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.611 position:50% align:center
I don't have
my color contacts in!

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] That's what
you're worried about?

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center
We're all good now.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
Sorry to keep you waiting

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
Uh. No worries.

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.874 position:50% align:center
A-As long as you're comfortable.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.542 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Come on in.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
It's not much, but...
these are for you.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.090 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
No way!

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
You didn't have to do that!

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I wanted to.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
I've been given
these before, so...

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:50.845 position:50% align:center
Well, thank you!

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:53.973 position:50% align:center
Oh dope, little puddings!

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
That almost made
my heart explode.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
Seeing me without
makeup is one thing,

00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:59.479 position:50% align:center
but without my contacts?

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.481 position:50% align:center
Can't handle it.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.484 position:50% align:center
Oh cool, these are from that
shop that always has a line.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50% align:center
Sweet!

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I am freaking out!

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
What do I do?

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:14.953 position:50% align:center
I know I'm just picking up
research materials,

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
but I've never been to
a friend's house before.

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
Not to mention someone
like Kitagawa's house!

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
I'm so nervous, I'm gonna puke.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
I need to get these
DVDs from her

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
and get the heck out of here.

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
Gojo?

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.804 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What can I do for you?

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Since you came all this way.

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
We should watch a few episodes!

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
Ah! Like, here? But why?

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.271 position:50% align:center
If we can knock out
a couple volumes,

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
you'll have less to carry home.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.190 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I-I guess?

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.984 position:50% align:center
So let's go, ya goof!

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay, thanks for inviting me in.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
Don't puke,
don't puke, don't puke.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
Here! This one is my room.

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.581 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
K-Kitagawa's bedroom.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
You can go ahead
and sit wherever!

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout the mess.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.421 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, I'm sure it's...

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
Yep, this is totally your room.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Huh? Yeah?

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:21.311 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Wakana's
anxiety vanished in an instant.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
[NEON]
Mom. Dad.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50% align:center
Was I that much of
a burden to you?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
Would you have been better off
if I'd never been born?

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
[NEON'S FLOWER PET]
Neon.

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50% align:center
[NEON] I... All I ever
wanted was to be loved!

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50% align:center
And Soma- <i>kun</i> .

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
Even Soma- <i>kun</i>
didn't want me in the end!

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
[NEON'S FLOWER PET]
Neon, no!

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
If you unleash any more
darkness, you'll--

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
[NEON'S FLOWER PET]
Neon. Neon!

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.965 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Wow. So when
Neon becomes Black Lobelia,

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
her personality and
her appearance change.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
It rules, doesn't it?

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.318 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, Neon?

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
No, it can't be!

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:55.238 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
Indeed, Shion. It is I.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:13.256 position:50% align:center
[SHION]
But why, Neon? Why?

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
So even Shion- <i>tan</i> had no idea

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.634 position:50% align:center
that was actually her sister.

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I see, And
that's her Flower Jewel?

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's pitch black now.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
Yeah 'cause she's off
the deep end!

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:23.892 position:50% align:center
Tragic, right?

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
Oh, please. Go away, Mirai!

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
I told you I don't associate
with the other Princesses!

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.275 position:50% align:center
[SHION'S FLOWER PET]
Yeah! Get lost, loser!

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
Look how cold she is!

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
She acts like that with
everyone, except for Neon.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.532 position:50% align:center
She's so cute it
makes me wanna die.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:40.909 position:50% align:center
Look, Shion- <i>chan</i> ,

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
you keep saying that
happiness won't last forever.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.997 position:50% align:center
But you're forgetting
something important!

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
Sadness doesn't last, either!

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.085 position:50% align:center
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
Don't talk about things
you don't understand!

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:58.343 position:50% align:center
You're just a cheerful
little space cadet.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
You don't know how I feel!

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] This is a
"magical girl" show, right?

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
So why are they just
punching each other?

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
Ooh! Look!

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
Here it comes! The Ship!

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Oh, are these
the boys you mentioned before?

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:29.249 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Yeah! That one
with the silver hair is

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
Shion- <i>tan</i> 's crush,
Sakuya- <i>kun</i> .

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
And the one with the black hair

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
is Mirai's older
brother, Soma- <i>kun</i> !

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:35.797 position:50% align:center
Do you see?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
Do you see how close they are?

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
You were right, they
are both really handsome.

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
Look at their uniforms!

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
They kinda look like
our school's, don't they?

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Hold up, does
this count as a home date?

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
Omigod, omigod, omigod it does!

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
It totally does!

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50% align:center
I mean we've hung out
"at home" before

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.318 position:50% align:center
but that was different 'cause
his grandpa was always around!

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
But now...

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.323 position:50% align:center
Now we're alone together.

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
I wuv him. Holy crap.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
I'm having so much fun with him!

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
[splutters]

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center
A home date with the guy
I wuv is the best.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
Like seriously, the best,
the best, the best!

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
I want this moment
to last literally forever.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
[SHION'S FLOWER PET]
Not on my watch, bi-atch!

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.327 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Oh, I guess you
haven't eaten anything

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.917 position:50% align:center
but pudding today, huh?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.210 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Mm.

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
Kill me now.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I can run and grab some takeout.

00:13:58.755 --> 00:13:59.756 position:50% align:center
Want me to go real quick?

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:00.840 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Nuh-uh.

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:03.009 position:50% align:center
No, you're good,
I can whip something up.

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:04.386 position:50% align:center
I'll make enough for both of us!

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center
Oh! Will you really?

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:08.473 position:50% align:center
A homemade meal from Kitagawa!

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
A homemade meal from Kitagawa.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
Why don't I cook?

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Huh? No way.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:21.653 position:50% align:center
You cook for me all the time,
and you're a guest here!

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center
Let me handle this one.

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
All right!

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
Now what should I make?

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
Oh, whoops. Forgot a bra.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:43.216 position:50% align:center
Ah it's fine.
Not like he noticed.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
Mmkay, I have some eggs,
some onions, leftover chicken.

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
Huh... I could make
omelet rice. Actually...

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
No, holy crap.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:02.819 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
Wait, am I really gonna do this?

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center
That is so freakin' girly,
oh my god!

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
Ugh! I'm blushing.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
Okay! Hurry up and cook,
you doofus!

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Chop, chop. Chop.

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.922 position:50% align:center
Gah, this sucks!

00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center
My eyes are on fire.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:26.468 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Screw you too, onions.

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:29.512 position:50% align:center
Damn. What'd I ever do to you?

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
Hey, this looks
pretty good so far!

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Tasty!

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
Oh my god,
this is like, gourmet!

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
I'm a frickin' genius!

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
Who knew making omelet rice
was such a cinch?

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
Now to wrap this baby up
in a lil' egg blankie

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.620 position:50% align:center
and call it good!

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.003 position:50% align:center
Thank you for cooking.

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I, uh... I'm sorry.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:11.680 position:50% align:center
It was looking pretty good
till I sorta ruined the omelet.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
But I used up all my eggs,
so I couldn't try again.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
No! You don't have
to eat that! Just...

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:23.858 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Did you use anything
other than salt and pepper?

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh. Yeah.

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center
I cooked it with chicken stock,

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
and there's some
soy sauce in there, too.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I see.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.539 position:50% align:center
That was a really
good idea; it's delicious!

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
Weirdly. I've never
tried that before.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
But I like it.

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're not
just being nice?

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What? No, I mean it.

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
It's very good!

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.228 position:50% align:center
Well, okay! Thank goodness.

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:01.938 position:50% align:center
I guess I should eat, too.

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:04.065 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50% align:center
Come to mama, you!

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:08.111 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I should make this sometime.

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
It's a nice change from the
more traditional Japanese food

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.199 position:50% align:center
we usually eat at home.

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:16.327 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa must really love...

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:17.912 position:50% align:center
...fried rice.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
[MIRAI] Even if that's true,
I'll never give up!

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm a Flower Princess!

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
You can do it, Mirai!

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
Need some tissues?

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
I gotchu.

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hi, it's Gojo.

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to check in on
the multi-view sketch I sent.

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
Anything you want me to revise?

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Nope. It's great.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Thank you! I'm glad.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
But, hey, are your sketches
always this detailed?

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:57.994 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, pretty much.

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's impressive.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
I can go ahead and
send funds for the fabric.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
How much do you
think you'll need?

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh. I'm not quite sure yet,

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
would you be willing to wait
until it's complete to pay?

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll do my best
to keep the cost down.

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Oh. No problem. I can do that.

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Do you want me to
take care of hair and makeup?

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.933 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] Nah, don't worry
about it, I can do that myself.

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a plan.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
But speaking of, I went
through all your cosplay photos,

00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
and I wanted to pick
your brain about something.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Uh, sure. Go ahead.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Thanks. So I know
how to reshape the eyelid.

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
But for some of
these characters,

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
the shape of your eyes
looks totally different overall.

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
How do you pull that off?

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Oh, I use face tape.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center
"Face tape"?

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Here, lemme turn my camera on.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
Can you see me?

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.129 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Crystal clear.

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I use this.

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.257 position:50% align:center
Cosplay tape can
totally change your look

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
if you place it right.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
For example, if you want
your eyes to look bigger,

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
anchor your tape mid-forehead
or above each eye

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
and pull it back
over your wig cap.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:02.434 position:50% align:center
You'll look more
bright-eyed and doll-like,

00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
and you won't have
to think about it.

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:05.937 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Wow.

00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Some cosplayers will use tape

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
to sharpen their
cheekbones or jawline.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
But you get the most bang
for your buck like this.

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:14.738 position:50% align:center
Matching a character's eye shape
is always a great detail.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] We could've
made Shizuku- <i>tan</i> look

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center
more droopy-eyed that way.

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
Thank you!
This is really informative!

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
You've really
never heard of this?

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:24.706 position:50% align:center
No. That was my first
cosplay experience.

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
You're kidding, right?

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
That outfit, that was
your first time making one?

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:33.381 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Yeah. I still have
a lot to learn, obviously.

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] I guess that explains
why Kitagawa's photos

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:39.929 position:50% align:center
were taken with a smartphone,
rather than a real camera.

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
I don't get you. You're so...

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Okay.

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.772 position:50% align:center
We should maybe plan on
taking photos with <i>our</i> camera.

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
Wait, whose?

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Oh, did I not mention this?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
My little sister's
the one who takes my photos.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.904 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's cool.

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
Your sister's a really
incredible photographer.

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
The colors in all
of these are amazing.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] Well, we do finish them
with photo-editing software.

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
That way we can
touch up blemishes

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
or even perfect eye color.

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Still incredible.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] You guys should totally
invest in a nice camera, too.

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Um, Inui?

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
What?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
If it's not too much trouble,

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
could your sister give me
a crash course in cameras?

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:19.928 position:50% align:center
There's so much
I don't know yet.

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Prob'ly.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
but she is still
in middle school,

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center
and if we meet all the
way out at your place,

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't get home till late.

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
I would be happy
to meet you somewhere!

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Okay.

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:31.606 position:50% align:center
There's a family
restaurant near my place

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:32.816 position:50% align:center
if that works for you.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes, that's perfectly fine.

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Cool. I'll text you.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
Great! Thanks so much, Inui!

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
A camera, huh.

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
There were a lot
of fancy-looking ones

00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
at that event we went to.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
Y-Yes, hello?

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I wanna come with you!

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:57.465 position:50% align:center
I'd love to learn how to use
a real camera for this stuff!

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Uh, sure.
Just lemme ask Inui first.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
Thanks, bud!

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
Marin!

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
If I don't put food
in me right now,

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
I'm literally gonna die.

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
Be right there, Nowa!

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:09.436 position:50% align:center
Go get us a table, 'kay?

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
I had no idea Juju
had a little sis!

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
I bet she's way cute.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
like a total clone of Juju.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.571 position:50% align:center
But a little teeny tiny
baby version!

00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Yeah,
I can definitely picture that.

00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
I'm so freakin' excited now!

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:29.998 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
I-It's very nice to meet you.

00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Hey, don't slouch.

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:32.292 position:50% align:center
C'mon, sit up.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
'Kay. Sorry.

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:36.963 position:50% align:center
She always gets nervous
when she meets new people.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
I, uh, I'm... I'm Shinju Inui.

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
And it's, uh, it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance!

00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:55.315 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Well, she's
certainly not what I pictured.

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:57.817 position:50% align:center
And she's...

00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.319 position:50% align:center
She's in middle school?

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:01.446 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Omigod girl,
like I dreamed of being

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:02.989 position:50% align:center
that huge in middle school!

00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:04.657 position:50% align:center
Just how big are you?

00:22:04.741 --> 00:22:06.076 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa!

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.952 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I'm five-four
and a half on a good day.

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:08.995 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
I'm um, I'm five-foot-ten.

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:13.500 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
No way, shut up!

00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:14.876 position:50% align:center
I am so jealous.

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Of course that's what she meant.

00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:48.887 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Next time.
