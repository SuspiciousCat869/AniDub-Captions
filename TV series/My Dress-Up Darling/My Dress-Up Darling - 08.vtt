00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:14.305 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
No way.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center
Am I awake?
Is this real right now?

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.728 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] And, um, this is
one of my favorites, too.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.563 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.440 position:50% align:center
That is ridiculously cute!

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.233 position:50% align:center
You look like a literal angel.

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
Like an angel!

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:27.986 position:50% align:center
Omigod, Shinju.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
Did you take all of these?

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.364 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I did.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.699 position:50% align:center
You're so talented!

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
You've got such a great eye.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.493 position:50% align:center
I mean it, like wow!

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
Oh. What a nice thing to say.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
All I wanted was for
her to take photos for me,

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
but then she decided
to create an account

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.044 position:50% align:center
and give me a cosplay name.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Really?

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:46.880 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What made you do that?

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Well, uh, she just,

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:52.510 position:50% align:center
she never wanted to
show anyone her photos.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.846 position:50% align:center
And I was so proud of
how adorable she looked

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center
and wanted other people
to see her like I did!

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.185 position:50% align:center
So I asked her if I could
make an account to post them,

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center
and she said yes.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.605 position:50% align:center
She got so many
likes and comments!

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:05.148 position:50% align:center
It was amazing!

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.858 position:50% align:center
People were posting
tons of nice things

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
about her on all the photos.

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
The problem was that it
got to be so overwhelming

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.408 position:50% align:center
I had no idea how
I was supposed to respond.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.203 position:50% align:center
So I just ended up
ignoring all of them.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:20.663 position:50% align:center
That's why no one ever
got a response from her!

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.040 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Mm-hmm.

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:24.417 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] I'm not cosplaying
for their approval.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.128 position:50% align:center
I do it for me;
I don't care what they think.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.463 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know that.

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:30.256 position:50% align:center
But look at the amount
of followers you have now.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.093 position:50% align:center
Isn't it amazing that
people love what you love?

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.553 position:50% align:center
I know how happy it
makes me to see it.

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.222 position:50% align:center
That's so sweet!

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:38.098 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
What is?

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.599 position:50% align:center
How much you love your sister!

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you have each other.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.602 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center
I love her so much!

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.108 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Ohhh.

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:51.319 position:50% align:center
And I can tell you feel
the same way, Juju!

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:53.738 position:50% align:center
Ew. Don't tell me how I feel.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
This is what we use.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.877 position:50% align:center
Our dad's DSLR.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.337 position:50% align:center
Nice!

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
Is your dad a professional
photographer or something?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
He just does it for fun.

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
So fancy!

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
I love this camera

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:41.429 position:50% align:center
because you don't
have to change the lens

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
for effects or
different lighting.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
That's interesting.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
But when would you
switch out the lens?

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
It really depends on
what you're going for.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center
It's fun to experiment!

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.481 position:50% align:center
Each lens makes it
look totally different,

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.358 position:50% align:center
even when it's the same shot.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
Question.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Yes? What is it?

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
Is it that much better
to use a camera

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.281 position:50% align:center
than it is to use a smartphone?

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
Yes. The camera gives you
a higher resolution,

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
and there's so much
more you can do.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.998 position:50% align:center
For example, if you take a photo
with flowers in the background.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
You can blur those flowers a bit

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
to make the cosplayer
stand out more.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.462 position:50% align:center
Or you can blur the foreground

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:17.257 position:50% align:center
and give the photo
a softer vibe overall.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
If petals or leaves are falling,

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
you can adjust the
shutter speed to keep them

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
from looking blurry.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's amazing!

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
Yeah, for real!

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
It sounds so fun!

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
It is!

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
I love getting a picture
to turn out exactly how I want

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
or capturing a unique
expression out of the blue.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center
It inspires me.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.109 position:50% align:center
I always want to learn more

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
so I can take
even better photos.

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
Plus, you're
taking pics of Juju!

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50% align:center
She's, like,
the best model there is!

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Yeah!

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.325 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Just curious.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
Why don't you ever
do cosplays, Shinju?

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're pretty much
around them all the time.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
Don't you wanna try it, too?

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.959 position:50% align:center
There's no way
you can watch Juju do

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center
so many adorable ones and
not want to get in on the fun!

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
Tell the truth, do you want to?

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.474 position:50% align:center
No, no. I don't want to do it.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
I just love taking
pictures for my sister.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
I could never cosplay myself.

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
That's cool, I guess!

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Thanks.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] So, uh, can
I try your camera for a sec?

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Sure.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.654 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Whoa, this thing rocks!

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
I would love to learn
how to take a shot

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.241 position:50% align:center
with all the fuzzy
background tricks!

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.702 position:50% align:center
I'm so saving up
for one of these!

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You said it's a DSLR?

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center
How much do those
typically cost?

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.667 position:50% align:center
Oh, here we go.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.799 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Huh? Huh? Huh?! Huuuuh?!

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
Why would they sell
the lens separately?!

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.095 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
Dude, you're so loud!

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
You can add a flash, a tripod,

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
and the rest of it
if you wanna go broke.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
You look funny when
your mind's blown.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50% align:center
But at the cosplay event,

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
pretty much everyone
had a camera like that.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
How do people afford them?

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I know, it's crazy!

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
It might take a
while to save up,

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
so let's keep taking pics
with our phones for now.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
Guess she's determined
to get one regardless.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
There are other
cameras, you guys.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you can
find one in your budget.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, we're
gonna scout a location later

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50% align:center
if you want to come with us.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] This is the first time
I'm renting a studio,

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
so I want to know what
options are out there.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50% align:center
O-M-G that sounds
like so much fun!

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
I'm in!

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center
I would actually
love to go, too.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
Word.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
Let's meet up at Shim-Misato
Station this weekend.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay!

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.606 position:50% align:center
Just as a warning.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.401 position:50% align:center
The space is in
an abandoned hospital.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
Oh wow, I didn't know
there were studios like this.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
I know, right?
My first abandoned building!

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same!

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
Cool, I'm so excited!

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50% align:center
I couldn't even sleep
last night because of it!

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
No frikkin way!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
It's like a horror
flick in here!

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] Yeah, I was
thinking the same thing!

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
This is great.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.382 position:50% align:center
Especially since there is an
abandoned hospital scene.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
Black Lily hides there after
Princess Daisy defeats her.

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's super depressing,

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.140 position:50% align:center
but I really like
the scene where Shion

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
starts to question
her own sanity.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
But, what's most important

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
is that you really did
watch the whole thing.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gojo! We're going upstairs!

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center
Don't get killed!

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'll try.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
I guess this place is a little
on the creepy side, isn't it?

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.493 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You okay, Inui?

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Yeah. Of course.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
You don't sound too
sure about that.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.168 position:50% align:center
Do places like this
make you uncomfortable?

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] What? Why would
you even ask me that?

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
I shoot in dark locations
all the time!

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
You're slowing
us down, let's go!

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'll take that as a "yes."

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.677 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I mean,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
so what if it has
murder vibes, amiright?

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
I'm just worried it might
be too dark to shoot.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.061 position:50% align:center
Nah, we have a flash. It's fine.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
You're such a superhero.

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
Flashes and reflectors
are the heroes.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
They can be used in
outdoor shoots as well,

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
so they're important to have.

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:06.986 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Even if it's sunny?

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
Natural light is awesome.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
But it's hard to keep
your eyes open in the sun.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
That's why we make it
the backlighting.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.293 position:50% align:center
It creates a beautiful soft
light on your skin.

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
Though, it also casts dark
shadows all over your face.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, I know!

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
Then you use reflectors
to bring your face back!

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:29.968 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
It also makes the
wigs nice and shiny.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50% align:center
And improves
your complexion, too!

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
That's so lit!

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
Like literally,
I gotta tell Gojo!

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center
Backlighting is the best.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hmm?

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
It looks like it's gonna rain.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.274 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Yeah.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
Man, I'd love to do
a shoot outside someday

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.904 position:50% align:center
when the weather's not so blah.

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
where do you guys usually
go to take outdoor photos?

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Just our back yard.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.041 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It's really coming down.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hey, what's going on?

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.010 position:50% align:center
Inui?

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
It's fine! Everything's fine!

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
I'm just a little tired!

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] That's not
even a little convincing.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
Would you rather wait
by the entrance?

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.893 position:50% align:center
Heck no!

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] I'm going to cosplay
Black Lily no matter what.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.150 position:50% align:center
I just have to get
comfortable with the location.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
Or I'll have an awkward
expression in every photo.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
Want me to take
a look around for you?

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, you can go on back.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
Seriously?
I can handle this myself!

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
But it seems like a lot.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center
Is there a reason
you're pushing so hard?

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.173 position:50% align:center
My dreams.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
Don't you ever
plan for the future?

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.970 position:50% align:center
Yes. I want to be a <i>kashirashi</i> .

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
It's a kind of artist that
designs the faces of <i>hina</i> dolls.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
That's a lovely dream.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
Good luck making it come true.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
I couldn't.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
I always wanted to
become a magical girl.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.951 position:50% align:center
I admired their strength,
optimism, and confidence.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.037 position:50% align:center
Fighting battles in
cute, frilly outfits.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
I've looked up to them
since I was little.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
I was obsessed!

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
I really thought I could
become one when I got older.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
But, once you start school,
you learn the truth.

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
It's all make-believe.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
None of it's real.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
I learned that no matter how
hard I worked or prayed,

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
my dream of being a magical girl
would never come true.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:50.734 position:50% align:center
Then one day,
when I was in middle school.

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
I discovered that I could

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:55.238 position:50% align:center
at least look like
them for a while.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I'd never cosplayed before,

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
so I had no clue
how to style the wig.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
I didn't even put makeup on,

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center
and the outfit wasn't tailored,
so it was way too big.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
To be honest, my first attempt
at cosplay was a mess, but...

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
...I didn't care.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
Just wearing it
made me so happy.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center
I found a way to make all
my dreams come true,

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
even if it's make-believe.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.479 position:50% align:center
The way I feel is real.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Can I ask you something?

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.734 position:50% align:center
Sure. What?

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.986 position:50% align:center
This outfit is important to you.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
So why'd you ask me to make it?

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
There are so many people
who're better at this than I am.

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.202 position:50% align:center
People with real experience.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you
pick one of them instead?

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's because of
the photos Marin posted.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
I was jealous.

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I know how pathetic

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
and lame that sounds,
believe me.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
But it's the truth.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
I couldn't stop
obsessing over it.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.474 position:50% align:center
I felt like the only way
to calm my inner rage

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
was to have an outfit
made by the same person,

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50% align:center
no matter who they were.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
And you're right,
there are many others

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
who can make the same outfit.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
I'm not explaining
this very well.

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
It's not logical.

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
Seeing that outfit was like,

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
love at first sight.

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
There's something about it
I can't explain.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
I know how this
must sound to you.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm surprised
my feelings are so strong.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
But I've heard
that jealousy's something

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
you only feel about things
that truly matter.

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
These are called <i>hina</i> dolls.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
Pretty, aren't they?

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
I made 'em with
some of my old pals.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
Do you like them?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Mm-hmm. A lot. I love them.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
They're so beautiful.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
The most beautiful
in the world, I say!

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
At this shop, we work
hard every single day

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
to make sure our dolls
catch the eyes.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
We want our customers to think

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
they're the best ever made.

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
Because they are to us.

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.295 position:50% align:center
So I'm glad that you like them.

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
Very glad.
[laughs]

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
What's "catch the eyes"
mean, Grandpa?

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Hmm? Uh...

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
That's a tough one to explain.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
I guess we want people
to fall in love

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
with them at first sight.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Me, too.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Hmm?

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to grow up.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:36.483 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna make <i>hina</i> dolls
just like these ones.

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
I want to be like you, Grandpa.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
Ahhh...

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.075 position:50% align:center
With plenty of practice,

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
you can make these someday,
just like your grandpa.

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Grandpa.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.131 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Whoa! Wait! What's happening?

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
Why are you crying, you weirdo?

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.093 position:50% align:center
Is this about the outfit?

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
You don't have to do it

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
if you're gonna be
dramatic about it!

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.305 position:50% align:center
Say something, damn it!

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
That's one of the most amazing
things I've ever heard.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:18.316 position:50% align:center
Because of you, I now understand
how happy Grandpa was back then,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
how much his art meant to him.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
I never imagined it felt
anything like this!

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful to you, Inui.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:25.990 position:50% align:center
I promise to never forget...

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
At 17, Sajuna Inui went through

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.744 position:50% align:center
an awakening of
her own that day.

00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
As a student at
an all-girls' school,

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
this was the first time she'd
ever held hands with a boy.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50% align:center
So her brain short-circuited.

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:39.796 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh no! Inui? Are you okay?

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.424 position:50% align:center
Wake up! Speak to me, Inui!
Can you hear me?

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:43.883 position:50% align:center
Hello? Help! Someone help!

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.846 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT]
We did it! We're done!

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hey, Gojo!

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
It's beach time, dude!

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] It's not quite warm
enough to swim yet.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.154 position:50% align:center
That's why there's,
like, no one around.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.530 position:50% align:center
Pretty cool, huh?

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
It's almost like
our own private beach!

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What are we even doing here?

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.210 position:50% align:center
So, um, did we come here

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center
to take some photos
or something?

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
Well, the other day,

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
you said you wanted to
try backlit photos, so...

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
...is that why
we're at the beach?

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.349 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
No, it's not about that, silly!

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
We're done with finals,
aren't we?

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
--[WAKANA] Yeah.
--And, it's July, isn't it?

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.108 position:50% align:center
And that's summer, right?

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:43.735 position:50% align:center
So I wanted to go!

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:46.154 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.574 position:50% align:center
Straight from the classroom
to the edge of the ocean!

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
We have the epic power of youth!

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:54.371 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Of course her
reason for bringing us here

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center
is totally random!

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.582 position:50% align:center
That's Kitagawa for you.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
Definitely eating
from this place again.

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center
Gojo, are you gonna eat
all of your fries?

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
No.

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Gimmie some,
gimmie some, gimmie some fries!

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
Ahhhh!

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:08.385 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Huh?!

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hmm?

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.179 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hey!

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
Gimme back my burger!

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
Is that klepto buzzard
following us?

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Maybe we should go
find somewhere else to eat.

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'm not scared
of some fat bird.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
Let's have bubble tea
by the ocean!

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
It'll be so adorable!

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.368 position:50% align:center
We even brought a mat!

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
Screw that beach pigeon!

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center
Live on the edge, Gojo!

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.711 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay, that's it.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
You're quitting already?

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Leave us and
our French fries alone!

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center
Now's our chance.
Let's make a break for it!

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
We can't let him
get our last burger!

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
Oh! I shouldn't
have littered, sorry.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:06.526 position:50% align:center
C'mon!

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Later, Mister Ham-bird-lar!

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Here you go.

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
That one's yours.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Very.

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Well, thanks.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
It's super good.

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Thank you.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You weren't kidding.

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
This is really delicious.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Right?

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yo, this bubble tea is legit!

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
Try it, Gojo!

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Huh?
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Your loss.

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
I could sit in this
breeze forever.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:05.085 position:50% align:center
Yeah, feels great.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
'Kay! This is the moment!

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:11.299 position:50% align:center
Here. Hold this. Thanks.

00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:12.676 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Wait, are you going to swim?

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Ew, no!
I'm just gonna soak my feet!

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
I didn't bring a swimsuit!

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
It was a last-minute thang!

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:22.143 position:50% align:center
I'm goin' in!

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
It's so frikkin cold!

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
I feel like a snow otter!

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
She's such a free spirit.

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:31.319 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
No way?

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
Bro! Look!

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.864 position:50% align:center
I just caught
two wiggly seaweeds!

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
Check it out!

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
They're so slimy and cool!
Look at 'em.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:41.871 position:50% align:center
I'm looking.

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.082 position:50% align:center
Gojo, let's gogo!

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
Don't stay on the beach
like a crabby crab!

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Right, coming!

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:54.718 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hurry up! Come on!

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
I'm trying.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.387 position:50% align:center
Just gimmie a minute!

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.987 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Ahhh. You weren't
kidding; it's really cold!

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
Wow. Wait, what's happening?

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
It feels like
my feet are sinking!

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
Okay, easy. Just breathe.

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
Not like it's your
first time, right?

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Well, yeah, it is.

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.583 position:50% align:center
No way. Really?

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess Saitama
is pretty landlocked.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But it isn't exactly that.

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I just don't get out much.

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:37.052 position:50% align:center
Ever since I was little,

00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
the only things
I've done for fun

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
are look at <i>hina</i> dolls
and practice painting them.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
I loved it so much.

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center
I never wanted
to do anything else.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
So now, there are a lot of
things I haven't done yet.

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.529 position:50% align:center
Grandpa was right.

00:19:56.613 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
He told me I should
get out and explore more.

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:02.786 position:50% align:center
I wish I had listened.

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
This is nothing like what
I've seen on TV or in photos.

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
Turns out, I love the beach.

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.547 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful.

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
Well, then we've got
a lot of catching up to do!

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
And summer vacation's here!

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
So it's on!

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
You're coming
with me everywhere!

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.652 position:50% align:center
I mean it! Let's go!

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
Just, you and me!

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
Huh? Are you sure?

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
Cause I would love to!

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:44.244 position:50% align:center
I'm excited.

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Oh, wow, um, I'm a
little thirsty all of a sudden.

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go have some more tea.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay.

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Why am I like this?

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.931 position:50% align:center
I just told him he's coming
with me everywhere!

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center
Ahh! "Just you and me?"
Seriously?

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad he can't
see how red my face is!

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
I look like a loser lobster!

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
Hold up.

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
Omigod, this means I'm gonna
be with him all summer break!

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
I literally cannot.
But I will. Holy crap.

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Wow. She wasn't joking.

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:47.932 position:50% align:center
He looks amazing.

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Whoa, Gojo! Are you okay?

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:58.735 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What's on me? Oh, gross!

00:21:58.818 --> 00:21:59.944 position:50% align:center
It's seaweed!

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:02.489 position:50% align:center
It's slimy and sticky
and all over me! Ew!

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:03.907 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Gojo!

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.950 position:50% align:center
It's not gonna eat you,
ya doofus. It's just a plant!

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.494 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I just wanted
to go a bit further.

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:10.038 position:50% align:center
And then I slipped on
this stuff and fell in and--!

00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:12.207 position:50% align:center
[MARIN laughs]
You look like a drowned sea rat!

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.584 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Oh, great!
I can't go home like this!

00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:16.628 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
You'll dry off by then! Maybe!

00:23:47.635 --> 00:23:48.887 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Next time!
