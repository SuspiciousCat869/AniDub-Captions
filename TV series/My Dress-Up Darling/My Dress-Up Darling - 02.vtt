[WAKANA]
I'm sorry, what?

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.561 position:50% align:center
Sorry, did you not get all that?

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
It's like a super long title.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
Shizuku-tan is
my favorite character

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
from <i>Saint Slippery's</i>
<i>Academy for Girls--</i>

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.737 position:50% align:center
<i>The Young Ladies of</i>
<i>the Humiliation Club:</i>

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
<i>Debauched Miracle Life</i> !

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
She's the cutie
I wanna cosplay as.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.369 position:50% align:center
She's specifically
from <i>Slippery Girls 2</i> !

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.341 position:50% align:center
What's up?
Is something wrong?

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:16.302 position:50% align:center
Not exactly. I'm just lost.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.431 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of
<i>Slippery Girls 1</i> or <i>2</i> .

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
For real?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.350 position:50% align:center
'Kay, I'll give you
the basic rundown.

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:25.311 position:50% align:center
<i>Slippery Girls 2</i> is an eroge
that came out last year

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.730 position:50% align:center
and did crazy numbers.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.314 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
An eroge?

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.400 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] It got so popular the
game's even getting an anime.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.985 position:50% align:center
Like, what?

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:34.738 position:50% align:center
So, the MC is this
principal's grandson.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.282 position:50% align:center
And he enrolls in this all-girls
school, 'cause reasons.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
Basically it's your
run-of-the-mill harem setup,

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:40.869 position:50% align:center
you get it.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.454 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] A guy enrolling
at an all-girls school is

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.164 position:50% align:center
"run-of-the-mill"?

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.832 position:50% align:center
The super emotional
in-game events

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.668 position:50% align:center
are what really get ya, assuming
you're into hardcore stuff

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50% align:center
like humiliation play.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.629 position:50% align:center
Or sex slaves.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.048 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sex slaves?

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.175 position:50% align:center
But the sex slaves in
<i>Slippery Girls 2</i>

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
are all doing it for love,

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.804 position:50% align:center
so when you look at it that way,
it's all pretty vanilla.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
"Vanilla." Right.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.934 position:50% align:center
So anyway, the MC is ordered
to join the Humiliation Club

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.354 position:50% align:center
by the principal, and all the
girls in the club wind up--

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What is she talking about?

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'm just not
familiar with video games,

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.525 position:50% align:center
but this sounds insane to me.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
Humiliation Club? Sex slaves?

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
Games like this don't
really exist, do they?

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
Ah! Wait.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's messing with me?

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
Wow, how long are you
gonna let me keep talking?

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.414 position:50% align:center
I'm obviously kidding,
how gullible are you?

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Of course.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
I tend to take people
at their word,

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50% align:center
so it makes sense
I wouldn't notice

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
she's making a joke, right?

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:34.631 position:50% align:center
But if you pick the last option,

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Nope. I take it all back.

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa isn't joking
in the slightest.

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:43.014 position:50% align:center
I mean, look at her eyes!

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
All that to say, the first
<i>Slippery Girls</i> ruled,

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
so once they announced
<i>Slippery Girls 2</i> ,

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center
I was immediately
hyped about it.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
'Cause like even if it sucked,
it'd still have Shizuku-tan!

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
But it doesn't suck!

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
In the beginning, Shizuku-tan
doesn't smile at all.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
She's this total ice queen,

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.656 position:50% align:center
and you're like,
"What's this girl's whole deal?"

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50% align:center
But then as you get
more and more events,

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
it's like "Wow, so this
is who she really is!"

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center
I wasn't even halfway
into the game yet,

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:09.874 position:50% align:center
and I'd fallen head-over-heels
in love with her.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
I was totally and
completely obsessed.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
And then suddenly...

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
...I realized.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
I wanted to become Shizuku-tan.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
So, yeah! You get me?

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Not even a little bit.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
She's my all-time favorite,
I love her...

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] But I do get that
she's genuinely having fun

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
telling me about all this.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
I mean, she's lit up
like the sun.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center
It's obvious
how passionate she is.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
It actually turns out
to be a super happy ending.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50% align:center
Get it now?

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Not quite.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. 'Kay, where'd I lose you?

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
I think I got the basic
idea but, I wanted to ask.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
What? Shizuku-tan's birthday?

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.377 position:50% align:center
No, that's not gonna help me.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center
It just sounds like
<i>Slippery Girls</i> might be,

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
like, an adult game?

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's what "eroge" means.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
But it's totally epic.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
But, isn't that like
age-restricted content?

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
Maybe! But, like, who cares?
Am I right?

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Huh?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm just surprised that
girls even play games like that,

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
much less enjoy them.

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, of course we do!

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.569 position:50% align:center
Literally everyone does.

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
Besides, like,
when you find something

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
that you're really excited
about, does gender matter?

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.207 position:50% align:center
No, it doesn't!

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
That's what I'm sayin'!

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.168 position:50% align:center
All right, let's get rollin'.

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
Sure thing!

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward
to working with you!

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
Whoa, Gojo,
are you crying right now?

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:43.468 position:50% align:center
I'm fine.

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
I guess I better
do some research

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:46.888 position:50% align:center
so I can figure out
where we need to start.

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh! I got you.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Lemme see. Aha!

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
Ba-ba-bada! <i>A Beginner's Guide</i>
<i>to Making Cosplay!</i>

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:01.111 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Wow. I didn't
know books like this existed.

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Oh yeah!
This thing totally rules.

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
Look at this!

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.533 position:50% align:center
There's a whole section on
how to pick the right fabrics

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50% align:center
and draft your own patterns!

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:08.743 position:50% align:center
Yup, yup, yup!

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
This thing is super handy.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
Wow, and they even break down
how to use a sewing machine!

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's great!

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:20.880 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] She has a book
that's crystal clear,

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50% align:center
and she still couldn't
do this on her own?

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'm embarrassed.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
All right.

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
We can talk
about materials later.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
We should start with
your measurements.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.393 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's do that now!

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, no.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
It's already
getting pretty late,

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
and I have stuff
to do this weekend.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
Why don't we meet up
again on Monday?

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
Right. Monday works.

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:46.489 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gojo?

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
You're the best.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
I'll see you on Monday, okay?

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Knock, knock.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.136 position:50% align:center
You're going to bed already?

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.220 position:50% align:center
That's unusual.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Mm.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] I'm gonna go buy a
sewing machine tomorrow,

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
so you don't need
to open up the shop.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:16.436 position:50% align:center
Works for me.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] Better take
a bath before you conk out.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
That really happened.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I really want
to do right by her.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA gasps]

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.303 position:50% align:center

[door bell rings]

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.101 position:50% align:center

Yes, I'm coming!

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
I'll be right there!

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.021 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,
but we're closed toda--

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
Hey! How's it goin'?

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa?

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
Wh-What are you doing here?

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:14.119 position:50% align:center
A-And h-how did
you know where I lived?

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50% align:center
Don't be a doof.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:16.871 position:50% align:center
There was no freakin' way
I was gonna wait

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50% align:center
through the whole weekend
to become Shizuku-tan!

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
So, I just searched for "Gojo"
plus " <i>hina</i> dolls" and yay!

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
There you were.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.172 position:50% align:center

Someone's proactive!

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
So can I come in, or what?

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh... Like right now?

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
--No?
--Well, I mean...

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Bee-tee-dubs.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
This is for you!

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wow, thank you.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
You didn't have
to do that for me--

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oops, I'm inside!

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait just a second!

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, is your room upstairs, Gojo?

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
--[WAKANA] Yeah.
--[MARIN] I wanna see!

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Wait, no!

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Ope! Wait, Wait, Wait.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
This is totally
your room, isn't it?

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:52.490 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Kitagawa!

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
Ooh!

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
Yep, this looks like a
Gojo kinda room to me!

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50% align:center
[giggles] C'mon, put your
futon away, messy!

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
Are these for the dolls?

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you can paint

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.300 position:50% align:center
with these
itty bitty little brushes.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
Damn.

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.178 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry.
I won't touch them.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
But seriously,
these are so tiny--

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Oh, no.
My heart's beating so loud

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
that I can't hear
a word she's saying.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.397 position:50% align:center
I mean, the only person
who's ever been in my bedroom

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
is my own grandfather.

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:28.443 position:50% align:center
But now there's a girl!

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.071 position:50% align:center
And it's Kitagawa!

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
This is bad.

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
Nothing like this has ever
happened to me before,

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
what am I supposed to do?

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
Calm down, Wakana Gojo!

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
You can do this, just chill out.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
I need to get a grip.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
I need to make sure
I'm not rude to her.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
Hello, Earth to Gojo!

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
Hi! Sorry!

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
Would you mind repeating that?

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I was just saying.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna hurry up and do it?

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.808 position:50% align:center
Eh... Uh. Wha...?

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Take my measurements, duh.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
You're the one who said we
had to do that first, so c'mon.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
Let's get measuring!

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.110 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Right,
I wanted to bring that up.

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
I think you might actually
need to find someone else

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
to do that part for you.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.740 position:50% align:center
Wait. Are you for real?

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
Do you not want
to do this anymore?

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
No.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
I mean, yes, I do.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
In the book
I borrowed yesterday,

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.003 position:50% align:center
i-it said that for measurements.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Y-You...

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
You have to be
in your underwear.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
So that's what
you're worried about.

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no problem!

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hey, let's not be too hasty!

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:55.363 position:50% align:center
Ta-da! I wore a bathing suit!

00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
So relax!

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
I figured you might get all
flustered about this part.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
But then I thought of this,

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center
and I was like,
"Whoa, dude, I'm a genius!"

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.627 position:50% align:center
Well? Now it's
not awkward, right?

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Gojo? Hey, dude.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
You good?

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
Nope, I don't need you
to touch me right now!

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
Whoa, freak-out! Sorry!

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll start with
your head measurement.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
Please be patient with me.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
Sure thing!

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
Here, does it help
if I close my eyes?

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Calm down. Breathe. Concentrate.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:53.922 position:50% align:center
And whatever you do, do not
actually touch Kitagawa.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Peek!

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:04.182 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Are you okay?

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
That wasn't a good sound.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
I need to measure
the width of your shoulders.

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
So, could you
turn around for me?

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Mm-hmm.

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What a nightmare.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
I can't keep my composure
when I'm facing her.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
But if I have her turn away
from me, then maybe...

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
Nope, that's actually worse!

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.708 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] My hair's prolly
in the way, huh?

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.001 position:50% align:center
How's this?

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh, may
I ask you a question?

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.632 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hmm?

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.384 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
We're practically strangers,

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
but you're in a bathing suit
in my room, so...

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
Are-Aren't you even
a little bit embarrassed?

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:48.727 position:50% align:center
What? Embarrassed? No way.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
I mean, if I'm gonna
become Shizuku-tan,

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:53.064 position:50% align:center
then we need to follow
that book to the letter!

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:56.818 position:50% align:center
[slap]

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.778 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what the heck was that sound?

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center
Uh, is everything okay?

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Right. Of course.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
This project means
so much to her.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50% align:center
It's rude for me to have
any indecent thoughts!

00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
Everything's just fine!

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.084 position:50% align:center
You've nothing to worry about!

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I dunno, I kinda feel like I do.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
She's relying on me, here.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
So she deserves.

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:25.096 position:50% align:center
Absolutely everything
I have to give.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
Heart and soul!

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:37.650 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I just need to
concentrate on doing the work,

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
to the best of my ability.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.034 position:50% align:center
Everything look okay?

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:46.868 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yep.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
Oh, hold up!

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
Before I forget, would you mind
helping me measure my feet, too?

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Your feet?

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
Sure, but I can't make
shoes from scratch.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.170 position:50% align:center
I thought we could just
buy some for us to use

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.922 position:50% align:center
as a base and build around them.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Right, but even then,
I have problems.

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:02.717 position:50% align:center
Some heels and
stuff can start hurting

00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:05.970 position:50% align:center
even if they're the same
size as all my other shoes.

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Well, that could just be

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.641 position:50% align:center
an issue of circumference
or something.

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Like here?

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
But we'll get your width, too.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
Hang tight for a sec, okay?

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.107 position:50% align:center
I'll go grab a chair for you.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Wait! How 'bout I just?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
Check it out,
totally perfect, yeah?

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
No! No, it is not!

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
--[MARIN] Why?
--[WAKANA] Well, you know,

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
I mean, I haven't washed...
It's, you know! It's...

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
It's... It's dirty, okay?

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
Doesn't bother me any,
it's all good! See?

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA shrilly]
No!

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa, I'm begging you,

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
please get off that
filthy thing immediately

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
and let me get you a real chair.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
But why? It's fine.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.090 position:50% align:center
You're not listening to me.

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center
It's not fine.
You'll get dirty! Please!

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
The longer we argue about this,
the less measuring we get done.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:51.599 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I'll... I'll...
I'll run and get you a chair.

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
It won't take more
than a second.

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
Please. I'm so sorry.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:12.537 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Gojo.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
Relax already. It's fine.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:20.628 position:50% align:center
[gulps]

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:25.800 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay.

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I see! Cool!

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
I'll have to remember
this next time I shop.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:34.642 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
Moving right along.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
Next up is my bust!

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
I should probably tie
my hair up for this, too.

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:45.028 position:50% align:center
Great! Here we go, let's do it!

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sorry, you're not saying,

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:51.326 position:50% align:center
I-I-I'm supposed to
measure them, are you?

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:52.660 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course I am.

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
I mean, who else is gonna do it?

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You could do it.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:58.291 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?

00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
When you do it by yourself,

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
you have to lean,
like, way forward.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
And I wind up with a different
result pretty much every time.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
It's actually way harder
than you'd think.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
So come on! Get over here, Gojo!

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
Do... Do I have to?

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:14.849 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Huh?

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
Yes! You do!

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
I don't get why you're
so constantly freaked out.

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.481 position:50% align:center
I, uh, I just...

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
I really don't think I should.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
The sooner you do it,
the sooner it's done.

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:28.446 position:50% align:center
And besides,
my arms are killing me.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center
Right! I'm so sorry!

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center
I'll measure them right a...

00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:36.037 position:50% align:center
...way.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sh-She's so close!

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
This is exactly why
I didn't want to do this!

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
She's just so...

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, no, no, shut up!

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
Don't think about anything else!

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
You're only getting
her measurements.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.760 position:50% align:center
That's it! That's it!

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:53.304 position:50% align:center
Just concentrate on
making her clothes!

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
You got this.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.474 position:50% align:center
Right, I need you
to lower your arms

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
and stand up straight
for me, please.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
Sure thing!

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Concentrate. Concentrate.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
Concentrate. Concentrate!

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I know, right?

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
Crouching like that for too long
is rough on your knees.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
But whatever position makes
you the happiest is fine by me.

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I wanna die.

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
I think we're done.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Woohoo!

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
But hey, as long as
we're still here.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.435 position:50% align:center
Why don't we grab
my inseam and bust point, too?

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No.

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
This again?

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to make the perfect boob bag

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
if I don't have the
right measurements?

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Um. Boob bag?

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Yeah. I really want to
give this part some extra love,

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
so Imma need you
to psych yourself up.

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm sorry, but, I-I just can't.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
Aw, what's your deal?

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
Seriously, why can't you?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Just. How?

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
I c-- H-How am I supposed to?

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to instinctively know

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
where your nipples are?

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
You see? I can't, okay?

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Well, hey!

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
You could find out!

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, I'm totally kidding,

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
you don't have to freeze up
like that, you know!

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center
But, yeah, you're right.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
I can't show you those
without it getting real awkward.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. We good?

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
Here, gimme the measuring tape
and I'll take care of it myself.

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Thank you. I'm sorry.

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center
Okay. Let's see.

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:49.504 position:50% align:center
So it's just straight
across from here to here.

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
Or, wait.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
Not the outside, the middle.

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.428 position:50% align:center
Twenty centimeters!

00:18:56.511 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
[echoing] Twenty centimeters!
Twenty centimeters!

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
"Twenty centimeters."

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
How is it that one number

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
can blast everything
out of my brain?

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
And that just leaves
the inseam, right?

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.531 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, right.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] At least
I don't have to look at her face

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
for this one,
so I shouldn't be as nervous.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
I'm sorta done with myself.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
I keep getting all
flustered and panicky.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
Talk about lame.

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I wish I could be more like her.

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:42.390 position:50% align:center
It's like she's never lost
her cool even once in her life.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Did you
just say something?

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to zone out,

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
I got lost in thought
for a second,

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.442 position:50% align:center
so I must have missed--  Huh?

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:55.195 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa?

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You... You're bright red.

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
Huh? No, I... Am I?

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
H-Hey, don't get the
wrong idea or anything!

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
I'm just...

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hmm?

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
Oh! Did it get too
hot in here for you?

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.963 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry
I didn't notice sooner!

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:16.299 position:50% align:center
I'll go turn on the AC.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
Got warm out early
this year, huh?

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
That's the last of 'em.

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yay!

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
Can I get dressed now?

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.448 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yep.

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:42.325 position:50% align:center
Oh, but first...

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
... do you have references
from <i>Slippery Girls</i> ?

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.246 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna draft patterns,

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
so it'd help to see
the outfits in the game.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah, do I ever!

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.669 position:50% align:center
Here, check it.

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
Boom! <i>Slippery Girls 1</i> and <i>2</i> !

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.382 position:50% align:center
--Here!
--Oh. Perfect,

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.300 position:50% align:center
thank you so much.

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
T-Two of them?

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.513 position:50% align:center
I thought that maybe the
second one would be enough,

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
but you really need
to play the first one

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.267 position:50% align:center
to understand all the lore!

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] And we got
plenty of weekend left,

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:11.521 position:50% align:center
so give 'em a shot!

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
I promise they're super cute.

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:16.943 position:50% align:center
Yikes, you okay?

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I didn't mean to interrupt

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
while you were changing.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center
No, that's fine but, you good?

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
Stomachache, or?

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
Nope, I'm completely fine,
please don't worry.

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
It's literally
just a bathing suit!

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.874 position:50% align:center
I'm so pathetic.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Wakana, I'm back.

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center
I got the new sewing m--

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU moans]
I'm bewing watched!

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
You're watching me.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
Oh... If-If I do thish...

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gramps. Welcome back.

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:50.518 position:50% align:center
Dinner's ready downstairs!

00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Eh, oookay.

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:55.357 position:50% align:center
I bought the new sewing machine.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.108 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Nice. Thank you!

00:21:57.192 --> 00:22:00.403 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU moans]

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:03.323 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] Well,
I suppose he is at that age.

00:22:03.406 --> 00:22:05.742 position:50% align:center
This sort of thing
is natural, right?

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:08.286 position:50% align:center
But why does he look
so serious in there?

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.537 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:11.956 position:50% align:center
So that's how it
looks from the back.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.042 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
And he's taking notes?

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:16.836 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU squeals]

00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:49.596 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Next time!
