00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
You look so adorable!

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:22.856 position:50% align:center
Absolutely perfect!

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.482 position:50% align:center
Look this way.
Omigosh, yes!

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.568 position:50% align:center
You're so good at this!

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.486 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Inui is a
great photographer;

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
it's obvious she loves it.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:32.240 position:50% align:center
We should do a shot
of both of you next!

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.700 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah!

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.995 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
I think we should get the shot

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.413 position:50% align:center
where Shion first
turns into Black Lily

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
and Black Lobelia
tries to find out

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.083 position:50% align:center
whether she's
really on her side!

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.626 position:50% align:center
It'll be amazing!

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
So. Down.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.546 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
What do you think, Sis?

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
Is that okay?

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.510 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I'm all right so far.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.095 position:50% align:center
The abandoned hospital
is a little creepy,

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.389 position:50% align:center
but at least there are enough
of us here to be distracting.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center
I guess it's manageable,
let's just make it quick.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.997 position:50% align:center
Wait, something's
not right here!

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa, what are you doing?

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.001 position:50% align:center
Black Lobelia always
has a sad face!

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50% align:center
You're smiling way too much!

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
You're so, so, so cute!

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.426 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, I bet
I totally ruined that shot!

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.844 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
It's fine, I guess.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.305 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I'm having hella fun,
you guys, I'm so sorry!

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.766 position:50% align:center
It's like I'm possessed by
this stupid grin on my face!

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.017 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
I totally get it!

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.977 position:50% align:center
It feels like you just
can't help but smile!

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.145 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Well, we've
got plenty of time...

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
What is wrong with her?

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.566 position:50% align:center
She's goofing off and she's
totally out of character!

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.486 position:50% align:center
It's ridiculous and it's
cutting into our shoot time!

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.905 position:50% align:center
I can't bear to watch this.

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:56.825 position:50% align:center
Cosplayers like her
are the absolute worst!

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:01.204 position:50% align:center
What am I supposed
to do with you?

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.712 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] Let's get some solo
shots with you now, Marin.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'm all about it!

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.172 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Wakana Gojo.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.841 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hmm? What's up?

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.428 position:50% align:center
Thanks for doing this.

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.638 position:50% align:center
You've made Shinju very happy.

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.223 position:50% align:center
I didn't do much.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.808 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I know that's not true.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:23.059 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you only had her pay

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.895 position:50% align:center
for the extra material
for her outfit, right?

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.230 position:50% align:center
I knew it.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.274 position:50% align:center
There are other
costs incurred here.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:32.318 position:50% align:center
Transportation, tools,
and props for example.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.695 position:50% align:center
I'll pay you back for it.

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
She said she just gets
an allowance, so it's fine.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.034 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
No, it's not.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.786 position:50% align:center
Good artists need
to be paid for their work.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.497 position:50% align:center
Thank you, though.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
For giving her such a
great experience today.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.253 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I had
no idea she loved Soma

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:54.174 position:50% align:center
so much that she
wanted to cosplay him.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.592 position:50% align:center
It makes me wonder
why she felt like

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.428 position:50% align:center
she had to hide it from me.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
I've failed her, I guess.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.933 position:50% align:center
You didn't do
anything wrong, Inui.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.852 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
It's just that...

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
It takes a lot of
courage, you know?

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50% align:center
Telling others about
the things you love,

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
things you want to try.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
It can be scary sometimes.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.655 position:50% align:center
I know how that feels.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] You took something
that's so precious to me.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
And you, you handled it with
such care and consideration.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
There's something about you.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center
You're wonderful.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
Uh, did you say something?

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Who me?

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
Not a word.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
That's the last thing
I need you to hear.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
Perfect. Now turn this way.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
Slowly.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
I got the most gorgeous
shot of you just now!

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center
--F'real?
--Yes!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.324 position:50% align:center
[fabric ripping]

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Hmm?
What was that noise?

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Shinju?

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
Uh. Not to make it awkward,

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
but your bongos
are going bonkers.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU screams]
Omigosh, my B-Holder just broke!

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
All I had was the natural
light spill in the studio,

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
but it ended up
working out perfectly.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.895 position:50% align:center
I really love this
shot in particular.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I agree.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
It looks great.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.649 position:50% align:center
She nailed the character.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
The outfit looks perfect on her.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's nice.

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
She brought more depth
than I expected her to.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
I thought I felt
love at first sight

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
with the outfit
Wakana Gojo created.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
But I guess it was
about more than that.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.420 position:50% align:center
Did you like my cosplay?

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
Or was it too weird for you?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.548 position:50% align:center
What? No, not at all!

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
Why would you ask that?

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center
It's just that I could never
pull a cosplay like that off.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:05.805 position:50% align:center
So I'm in awe.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.266 position:50% align:center
Guess I got a
little jealous, too.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center
Okay, what was that?

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
Are you possessed or something?

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
My whole world just
turned upside down!

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.359 position:50% align:center
There's a cosplay
that you can't pull off,

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
and you're jealous of me?

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:21.821 position:50% align:center
I'm human, too.

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.031 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
But you always look
amazing in everything.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Nope. That's not true.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
I pick from the
characters I like

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
that have the same shape
and size as I do, that's all.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'd love to cosplay
Black Lobelia or Soma, too.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
But they're tall characters
and it wouldn't look right.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
I don't want to wear
something that isn't perfect.

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
It's not like I have low
self-esteem or something.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
It's just that sometimes I wish
I could change my appearance,

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
or I feel like I could've
done things better.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] Like if I had a more
feminine figure like you,

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
I could knock off so many
other cosplays on my wish list.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center
And I'm sorry.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
I really am quite
jealous of you.

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
My point was,

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.658 position:50% align:center
we don't always know how
someone really feels.

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50% align:center
But, well,
we all have struggles.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.997 position:50% align:center
Here's the plan.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
When I'm in high school,
I'll get a job to save money.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
And then we can do it.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
Cosplay, together.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:20.714 position:50% align:center
Yes, please!

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
Do you mean that, really?

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] I spent way
too much money this time,

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:28.680 position:50% align:center
so it might take a
minute to save up again.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.598 position:50% align:center
But once I do,

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.018 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna take a break
from group cosplay.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.310 position:50% align:center
I definitely learned

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.646 position:50% align:center
that I prefer doing
photoshoots with just you.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
Today was so exhausting.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it was a lot,
but I had so much fun.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we did
this group shoot.

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah. Me too.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
I mean, I guess it
wasn't the worst thing.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
Maybe someday,
I might like to try it again.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:07.802 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Omigosh, Gojo!

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
Did Shinju send
you the files yet?

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
I'm dying over here!

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] They're amazing;
I'm looking at them right now.

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.018 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I know, right?

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
I'm so frikkin hyped about 'em
that I'm watching <i>Blaze</i> again!

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
For the 800th time.

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:20.398 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
But back to the important stuff!

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50% align:center
Gojo, was that your first time
doing dude-makeup?

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
You are a god!

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I just read a magazine
on how to do cosplay makeup.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yeah, I've read 'em, too,

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
and I can't do what you did.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
Juju was super cute as per uzhe.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
But Shinju was so hot,
I almost died, it was the best.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
And I totes called it on
Shinju wanting to cosplay.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.210 position:50% align:center
It was awesome
seeing her let loose,

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
and it seemed like she had fun.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah, it did.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.214 position:50% align:center
Lots of fun.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] That's totally
your uniform, isn't it?

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It is.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
When she told me how she felt,
I couldn't help but relate.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
So yeah.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.184 position:50% align:center
That's why I wanted to help her.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.603 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Wait, are you saying
you want to cosplay, too?

00:07:58.687 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
You've got some
'splainin' to do.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
I'm hurt, bro.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
Like I'd ever make fun of
your sweet Gojo dreams.

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Thanks,
but that's not what I meant.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
Also, I had no idea

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
that you were even building that
Soma cosplay, you little ninja!

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
When did you plan that?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Not long ago, actually.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.122 position:50% align:center
It was right after
we went to see the studio.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
She came over and we
started planning that night.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:21.835 position:50% align:center
[NEON'S FLOWER PET]
That's not true, Neon!

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.169 position:50% align:center
You can't give up now!

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
The three of you have been
best friends forever!

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
That's what I thought, too.

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.800 position:50% align:center
But I was wrong.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
It's done.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
After seeing the way those
two look at each other.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.388 position:50% align:center
Just you two?

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.475 position:50% align:center
And she was so embarrassed
she asked me not to tell anyone.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center
[NEON]
Honestly. I'm a fool.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, 'kay. I get it now.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
It all makes sense.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50% align:center
Mm-hm. Sure does.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.779 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Are you still there?

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.032 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa? Is something wrong?

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:53.700 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
No, why do you ask?

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
Why would anything be wrong?

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.965 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA yawns]

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
Summer vacation's the greatest!

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
So much time all to myself!

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.513 position:50% align:center
I can practice
painting doll faces

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
and then build the next cosplay!

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay that's her!

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
Veronica, my love!

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
I just can't!

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50% align:center
How can anyone not be
obsessed with her?

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
Like, what a debut!

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Her sweet tan.
Those shark teeth.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
Her look of repulsion.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.218 position:50% align:center
Her face is genius!

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
Ugh, and her underboob!

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
No one can hate on
a tasteful underboob.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
In fact, looking at
underboob is good for you.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50% align:center
It gives you like,
dopamine and stuff.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What is she talking about?

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, I can make
this one pretty quickly.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:31.733 position:50% align:center
Are you for real?
That's amazing!

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Some of the details
might be tough, though.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.278 position:50% align:center
Should we retouch
them digitally?

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:37.572 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
That's a great idea!

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I finished
that one in record time.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
Maybe because
there's not much to it.

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
Shizuku- <i>tan</i> , Black Lily,
and Black Lobelia.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
It's amazing to think

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
that there are so many
unique designs in the world.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't started
making cosplays,

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.675 position:50% align:center
I would've never
gotten to see them.

00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
[door bell rings]

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Gojo, are you home?

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm coming.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
Pretty hot out there, huh?

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
Want to come in and
have something cold to dri--

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center
I sure do!

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center
Hook me up, dude!

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
It is stupid hot!

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.191 position:50% align:center
I'm a sweaty mess!

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
What the...? You're so tan!

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
How does anyone get that tan?

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
You like?

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
I'm one step closer
to being Veronica!

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
You might be too
committed to this!

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:25.203 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Ha ha! I'm kidding, goober.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:26.746 position:50% align:center
It's totally foundation.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
But you can put it
on your whole body!

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I've never heard of that before.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
It's a thing!

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:32.669 position:50% align:center
Hey, I know this is weird,

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
but can I take a swim
in your shower?

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:37.340 position:50% align:center
I'm sweating so much
and the soup-stank is real!

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.174 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sure.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Thanks, man!

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
You're a saint!

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:45.515 position:50% align:center
It's so hot!

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
Ew! This is disgusting!

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:49.936 position:50% align:center
I really need to be careful

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
or I'm gonna get heatstroke
in here and die naked.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
I heard you can even get it
inside if it's majorly hot out.

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
Crazy stuff.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:58.737 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Kitagawa?

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
Did you bring
a change of clothes?

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
If not, you can
use some of mine.

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
I'll leave them
by the door, okay?

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:04.993 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Shut up!

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute,
is this your sneaky way

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
of checking me out in the buff?

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.624 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I would never do that!

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.668 position:50% align:center
[MARIN laughs]
Oh, my bad!

00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
But if this were a manga,
you totally would!

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
And I'd be all "Kya!
Gojo, you're such a perv!"

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:20.842 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I don't want to talk about this.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I'm just messin'
with you, dorkus!

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.019 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the shower!

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
I feel brand new.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:34.606 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
I know I'm the one
who let her borrow it,

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
but it's still strange
to think about.

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
She's wearing my PE uniform.

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:44.074 position:50% align:center
The same one
that touched my body!

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
And she also
used my soap in there,

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
all over her body,
which means she smells like me.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
What...

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50% align:center
What is this feeling
happening inside me?

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Gojo, you're red.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] No, I'm not.
You're seeing things.

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay, whatever.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
I brought these so
you could look at them.

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] This is the
foundation I used earlier,

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
and check out
this white mascara!

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
Now I can even have
Veronica's eyelashes!

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
Wow! Good find!

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:11.393 position:50% align:center
These are great.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
Sorry you're the one
who has to buy this stuff.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly.

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
Emptying my wallet is

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
how I can help support
the cause, remember?

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
Check these out!

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
Only 800 yen in the
Halloween section!

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
I feel like a bandit, for real!

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:26.241 position:50% align:center
They're also way lighter
than they look, it's wild!

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.368 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go ahead
and slip these on.

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
Okay, what is that?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Oh, this?
It looks cool, doesn't it?

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
It's basically like a
giant decal for the wall.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
Just roll it on like so.

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
Ta-dah!

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh...

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Looks like a prison now, huh?

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.799 position:50% align:center
Who's awesome?

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.218 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I mean, yeah, it does
change things up quite a bit.

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
And they had
all sorts of designs.

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
We can totes do anything!

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
I tried to find the teeth,

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
but all I found were
some cheesy wolf fangs.

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:55.895 position:50% align:center
We might have to add them
"in post," as they say.

00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:57.564 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I actually have some for you.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Gojo, are we in
a horror movie right now?

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.027 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What? No.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
I found out
you can make these

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center
from fake nails at the 100-yen
store, so I tested it out.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.283 position:50% align:center
Can I try 'em on?

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Go ahead.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.829 position:50% align:center
How do they feel?

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
They're in!

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.500 position:50% align:center
Here they are. Look good?

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
Wow! They look
amazing, Kitagawa!

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:21.629 position:50% align:center
And they're so
much more realistic

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:23.131 position:50% align:center
than I thought they would be!

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:24.424 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Dude, chill!

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:25.467 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.761 position:50% align:center
It's just, I was
worried about those.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.637 position:50% align:center
It's pretty exciting, right?

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50% align:center
I so feel that.

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
Okay, lemme get changed.

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I need to get this
foundation happening first.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.813 position:50% align:center
Gojo, could you help me
get it on my back later?

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
That part took forever the
first time and I'm not about it.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What was that she said

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
before about underboob
and dopamine?

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
So, I guess, that must be
what's happening to me?

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
It hurts.

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
What the heck?

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
You're bright red again, man!
Are you dying?

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:57.582 position:50% align:center
--Oh, no!
--No. I'm fine.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.084 position:50% align:center
--What do we do?
--What do you mean?

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
Let's get you some water!

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
Ow, that hurts!

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
I hit my head really hard!

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Are you okay? What day is it?

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] How am I supposed
to wear a wig over this thing?

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
Veronica, love.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll just have
to meet another time.

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
[MARIN laughs]
Why are you so freaked out?

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't ever
come to Shibuya,

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.235 position:50% align:center
so... I just feel out of place.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
I promise, you're okay.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.864 position:50% align:center
Wh-What are we gonna buy today?

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.367 position:50% align:center
Normal clothes?

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
It's a men's store.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
I don't think anything's
gonna fit you in here.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
We're here for you.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
You were worried about not
having more clothes, so...

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
Time for a change!

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.923 position:50% align:center
Come on! Let's hit it!

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
I'll be your
own personal stylist!

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
Which style would
you say is most "you"?

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, um... I don't know.

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:55.765 position:50% align:center
I've never really
thought about it.

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.810 position:50% align:center
Also, I'm not exactly sure
how to pick out clothes.

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:00.311 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Starting from zero, then, huh?

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:01.396 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
Let's experiment
with some looks.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:04.441 position:50% align:center
How 'bout this?

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.109 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and try it on.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, sir!

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE]
Yes?

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Done yet?

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No, not yet.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:12.782 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Can I peek?

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Um, I'd rather you not!

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE]
Whoa, she's insanely hot.

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
Seems pretty cool, too.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
Is that doof in
there her boyfriend?

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:21.458 position:50% align:center
Nah, no way.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I, uh, I'm done.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Come and show me!

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:26.755 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE] He sounds so timid.
Maybe he's younger?

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center
That looks amazing on you!

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
I am gonna die
from not laughing.

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
Let me know if you
need anything else, okay?

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:36.014 position:50% align:center
Okay, thanks.

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go grab a few
other pieces for you to try on.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
Cool?

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Holy crap.

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
How would a calm person respond?

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
He looks totally
freaking amazing

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
in every single one
of these outfits!

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center
But seriously, what the eff?

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.161 position:50% align:center
How does this dude look hot
in everything he wears?

00:17:58.244 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
I can't get rid of any of these!

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
A guy this hot actually exists?

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
I mean, I know he does

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:04.167 position:50% align:center
because he's right
in front of me, but...

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.752 position:50% align:center
I can't! I can't! I can't!

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
I love him!

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:10.590 position:50% align:center
I wuv you, Gojo-wojo, I love
your widdle face to death!

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa,
can I take this off now?

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
What? Why, though?

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
Well, I feel kind of awkward.

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
It's a really nice shirt,
but I'd never actually wear it.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:20.850 position:50% align:center
You know what I mean?

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
No, not really.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
'Kay, then how 'bout
a plain Jane t-shirt?

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
Less intimidating, right?

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:29.067 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
It's so cute.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go
try on the same one.

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be
too big for you, though?

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
Actually, I wear men's clothes

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:35.532 position:50% align:center
anytime I want something
a little baggy.

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
I didn't know that was a thing.

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I hope he likes it!

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
Because then we'll
have matching shirts!

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
I'll have a shirt that
matches the boy I love!

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
How cute would that be?

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
What, matching outfits?

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious, can you?

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
That's so silly! Stop!

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
Omigosh, you're embarrassing me!

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
Did you try it on yet?

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, yeah, I did.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'm gonna wear it like this!

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
What about you, Gojo?

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
Show me. You likey?

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
I likey.

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I can see your face!

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
You suck at lying!

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
That hat would
look great on you!

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
Why are you freaking out?

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.025 position:50% align:center
It's not alive!

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
I'm getting a bit hungry.

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
Wanna take a break somewhere
and have a snacky-snack?

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
Ramen maybe?

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.157 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Ramen's not a snacky-snack.

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm so sorry.

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
And you picked out so many
good options for me, too.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
If it doesn't feel right,
it doesn't feel right.

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.640 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way,

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
that monster bump on
my head's almost gone now.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
So when do you wanna do
the Veronica cosplay?

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
Um, I think
I'm gonna pass this time.

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
You'll have to do that
one yourself, Kitagawa.

00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.366 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Huh?

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:04.287 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Why, though?

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
You know I can't
cosplay without you, Gojo.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
I mean, like,
what are you saying?

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
Please say something!

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sorry, I just can't this time.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.928 position:50% align:center
It's not you, I promise, but...

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:21.721 position:50% align:center
...I hadn't really thought
about how I would feel when you,

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
when you put on something
like that around me.

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
It's different from
the other cosplays.

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
Um... It's very revealing.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
There's less fabric
on your chest, okay?

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
I couldn't look at you.

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
[inhales]

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
Ah! Hey!

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:52.502 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's all?

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.129 position:50% align:center
Why'd you make it
sound all serious?

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
Ohmigod, stop it!
You're so bad!

00:20:57.841 --> 00:20:59.426 position:50% align:center
You scared the crap outta me!

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
Wait, so all this drama

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
was just you getting embarrassed
thinking of my underboob?

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
Ugh! You are such a giant perv!

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
Do you really have
to say that so loud?

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:14.190 position:50% align:center
Y'know.

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
I guess I never
really dwelled on it.

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:19.404 position:50% align:center
But Veronica does
show a lot of skin.

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Kind of an understatement.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
I didn't really notice it

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
when I saw her in
the game for some reason.

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Tell you what.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.872 position:50% align:center
I promise to be more sensitive
when I pick the next character.

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Thank you.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
But I mean, you did go through

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
all the trouble
of making it for me,

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:35.670 position:50% align:center
so maybe I'll wear it at home.

00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh. Sure.

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center
Why not? It's yours.

00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I can send you
a picture of me wearing it.

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:09.120 position:50% align:center
What?! I just told you
I couldn't look at it!

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:10.705 position:50% align:center
Why would you even go there?

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:11.915 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'm totally kidding!

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:13.458 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't do that.

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:14.542 position:50% align:center
Promise.

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:48.928 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Next time.
