00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.141 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm home, Grandpa.

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:17.684 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
And I'm with him!

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
So that's it?
Shopping's all done?

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.606 position:50% align:center
Also, the mannequin I ordered
should be here later today.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.401 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
For real? I'm supes excited!

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50% align:center
Gojo, check it out!

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.740 position:50% align:center
How does this look?

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA screams]

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
Dude, that was so frikkin loud.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.244 position:50% align:center
What's the deal?

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] You're
showing me your underwear!

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
That's "the deal"!

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
First of all, no.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
It's the swimsuit
I bought earlier today!

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
Remember that time we were
texting about the outfit,

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
and I sent you swimsuit selfie
and you left me on 'read?' 

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.592 position:50% align:center
That was brave,
son and way rude.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, I uh.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
A lot happened
after I saw that photo.

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Anyway, there
was so much drama trying

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
to find the high-waisted ones,

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
I finally had to go
the imported route.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:02.312 position:50% align:center
Nice, huh?

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.521 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.649 position:50% align:center
Could you just, uh...

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.777 position:50% align:center
Leave me alone for a bit?

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:11.821 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, yeah?

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.281 position:50% align:center
You want me to leave?

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:15.367 position:50% align:center
And why is that, she wondered?

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.536 position:50% align:center
Aww, is someone a bit too
excited at the moment?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.537 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm fine, really.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:20.955 position:50% align:center
And the swimsuit is great.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.291 position:50% align:center
You just absolutely cannot
touch me right now, okay?

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Whoa, are you mad?

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.377 position:50% align:center
Like mad-mad?

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.711 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No, I'm not.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.631 position:50% align:center
I'm just suddenly in need
of some personal space!

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.267 position:50% align:center
This is totally random,

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.061 position:50% align:center
but do you ever find
yourself blowing on cold food

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.062 position:50% align:center
like it's hot?

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sometimes?

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.691 position:50% align:center
And then you're like totally
embarrassed once you realize it?

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.443 position:50% align:center
Okay, now that
is some genius art.

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.945 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy!

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.196 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's quite a smile.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.615 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I think my face is gonna break!

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.033 position:50% align:center
I was useful!

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.120 position:50% align:center
I can't tell you how incredible
just saying that feels!

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:01.830 position:50% align:center
Don't judge me!
I know it's a bit extra

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:04.749 position:50% align:center
to get all emo over
some paint, but wow!

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.589 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Maybe today,
I was actually useful.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:13.341 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
It's so frickin' pretty!

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:15.677 position:50% align:center
I'm even more hyped
for this cosplay now!

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.179 position:50% align:center
I can't help it,
I need to try it on!

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.764 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No! Kitagawa, wait!

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.141 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh it's fine, we're bros.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.225 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No. Not happening.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.685 position:50% align:center
Just let me know
when you're done!

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.103 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
You can look, I don't care.

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
I actually have
a cute bra on today.

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
Check it!

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:33.028 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Crap. This is not
the one I thought I was wearing!

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.547 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Ohh!!

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.840 position:50% align:center
I am in love!

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
So, what do you think, Inui?

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I absolutely love it.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.432 position:50% align:center
And it fits me perfectly.
Gorgeous.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
You're so hot!

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
Is it comfortable enough?

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Yeah. It's perfect.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
Good, that's important.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
You wanna change anything?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Maybe.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure
that the skirt design

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
is supposed to be poofier.

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, you're totally right.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
We could add some wiring?

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I think it'll be fine

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
if I just wear a
firm tutu underneath.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
I have one at home.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
Okay, cool.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.039 position:50% align:center
Wanna try the cape on with it?

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Sure.

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:50.999 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yeah, she does!

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.209 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
No way!

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
You used embossed
fabric for the lining?!

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
So cool!

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] The only thing
I'm not too keen on

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
is that it's a bit thick,

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
so you can't get those
nice wind-blown shots.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
I was thinking that,

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
but if we use a multiple shot
setting while moving,

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50% align:center
the cape will look
like it's waving,

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
and the heavier fabric could
add some nice dimension

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
to the photo.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
She sounds so cool

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
when she gets all
serious about cosplay!

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
I wanna talk like a pro, too!

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Does yours fit well, Kitagawa?

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
Um... Mm-hmm.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Well,
this part's kinda tight,

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center
but, like, looks hot, so...

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
It's fetch!

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.159 position:50% align:center
And I'm digging these
gold thingies up here.

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50% align:center
Mega fetch!

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
And this flowy part flows!

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
Super-duper-mega fetch!

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
Careful there,
don't hurt yourself.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I'm glad you like it.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.380 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa, I think
we should do your makeup

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:39.881 position:50% align:center
and see how it
looks with the wig.

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
Can I help you pin your hair up?

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.967 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Totes magoats!

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
Marin Kitagawa.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.224 position:50% align:center
Is this the only shade
of foundation that you own?

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yeah, why?

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] Some wigs look better
on different skin tones.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
A lighter shade with that one
will look more realistic.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
Color correcting concealers
can help modify tones, too.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
A blue one will lighten
your skin for Black Lobelia.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
You have one?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
If not, then you can
use mine for the shoot.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.825 position:50% align:center
That'd be so awesome!

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.743 position:50% align:center
We can change your
eye shape with this.

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Wait, what?

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It's cosplay tape.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.956 position:50% align:center
Inui swears by it,
so I got some.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.375 position:50% align:center
Black Lobelia has
a distinct eye shape.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure we could emulate
it with just false lashes.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.046 position:50% align:center
And I wanted
to see how it worked!

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Noice! I'm down!

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Take the corner of
the eye and lift up diagonally.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center
Did that work?

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:28.680 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Feels weird.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
Use bobby pins to keep the
face tape and wig cap in place.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Should I shave
my eyebrows, or what?

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:36.646 position:50% align:center
No, your eyebrows
should be even this time.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.064 position:50% align:center
So you can leave 'em.

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] Wait, you seriously
shaved your eyebrows off?

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
And... that's done.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
Yeah, looks great.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
For real?

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
Gimme a mirror. I wanna see!

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sure, here you go.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Holy crap!

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
My face has never looked
like this in my entire life!

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
This is nuts. Is that really me?

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
Have I been Black Lobelia
this whole time?

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:06.676 position:50% align:center
Nope, just you.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center
The wig's a great color.

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
Where's it from?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
A place called Swallowtail!

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
They do great work.

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Ya know, I'm not even gonna ask.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
I'm so frikkin hyped right now!

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.568 position:50% align:center
Our group cosplay is
gonna be so sweet!

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
Our group cosplay
was gonna be so sweet!

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
Random acts of monsoon-ing

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.409 position:50% align:center
are common around
this time of year.

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
It sucks, but at least
the gloomy lighting

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center
will look good in pics.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.539 position:50% align:center
It makes everything
so depressing.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
But I guess you're right.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
That corset is amazing.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hmm?

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.214 position:50% align:center
For real.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
I've always loved
Black Lobelia's outfit.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Omigosh, same!

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50% align:center
Corsets are my jam in general!

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.887 position:50% align:center
I love them so much!

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
I love that it looks
like part of the dress,

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.849 position:50% align:center
and that it's frilly and gothic!

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
Ever since I was little,

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
I've loved how different

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.771 position:50% align:center
Neon and Black Lobelia's
characters are, ya know?

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
I cannot tell you what
a dream come true this is!

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.608 position:50% align:center
For sure.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Actually,
I have a teeny tiny request.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.654 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:12.409 position:50% align:center
I was, um, wondering if maybe
we could get a picture.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
Like, together.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Okay. I mean, it's whatever.

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Are you serious?

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.290 position:50% align:center
Omigosh you're the best!

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
I can't handle this right now.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.171 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
Would it be okay if I posted it?

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
If you want.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.301 position:50% align:center
But your makeup's
a little runny.

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
Shinju's running crazy late.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
It usually doesn't take
her this long to get ready.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Gojo's not back yet, either.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Ohmigod, I'm getting
so many likes!

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
No one ever likes
my photos that much!

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
Juju, you're a
social media angel!

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
[JUJU] You could do it if
you stopped posting pictures

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
of everything you eat.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.779 position:50% align:center
That fried rice with
the whole kitchen sink

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
in it was a bit much.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.490 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh yeah, I made that!

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:53.867 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
You're not serious.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Look at all these comments!

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:58.163 position:50% align:center
This one says,
"Wow, Juju actually exists."

00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Of course, I exist!

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center
What the heck?

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:00.999 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] When you
never go to live events,

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center
people start to wonder!

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hey, you guys.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the wait.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.298 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yeah, what took you so long?

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
No way!

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:20.101 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Inui? Can you hear me?

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
Inui, what's wrong?

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.396 position:50% align:center
Hey! Wake up!

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I did that.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who wanted to go,

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:30.528 position:50% align:center
and then I ended up
fainting like a loser.

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.197 position:50% align:center
It's totally cool, Juju!

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
Shinju and I still went
and checked it all out.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.700 position:50% align:center
Yeah. And I took pictures,

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
so we can look at them
together when we get home.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Thank you.

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
You were worse off
than I realized.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.040 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
I should've noticed.

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
Well, I feel much better now.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Awesome! So are
we ready to call it a day?

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I think so.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:53.593 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay, cool!

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
I'm meeting up with Nowa
and some friends,

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
so I'm gonna bounce for now!

00:09:57.347 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
We figured we'd hype ourselves
up for finals with some karaoke!

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Or you could just study.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Later days, you guys!

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.688 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
See you!

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
We should probably
head out, too.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] I've never been
to Shim-Misato before.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
Would you mind if I looked at
the shops by the station first?

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:12.946 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
You do you.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50% align:center
I'll just see you at home, then.

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:15.740 position:50% align:center
Don't be too late.

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.661 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
So, um...

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Yeah, what's up?

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center
Did you have any more questions
about the camera before we go?

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:25.834 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, no, thank you.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
I apologize in advance
if I'm wrong.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:34.050 position:50% align:center
But, I kinda feel like,
I-I dunno.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
Maybe you might be interested
in cosplay after all?

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] When we were
at lunch the other day,

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.933 position:50% align:center
I wondered if it was
too hard to admit it

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
in front of your sister.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
Uh! I'm so sorry!

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.524 position:50% align:center
I don't know what I'm saying!

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.151 position:50% align:center
Please forget I mentioned it.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
I'll leave you alone.

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] Wait. I would
like to try it, actually!

00:10:58.616 --> 00:10:59.951 position:50% align:center
There is one.

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:02.037 position:50% align:center
A character that I love.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
I thought maybe someday.

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
Marin was right, you know?

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
I see how much fun
my sister has cosplaying,

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
and it's hard,
watching from the sidelines.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
--Then why--
--I can't!

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.093 position:50% align:center
It's complicated.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I wouldn't
be a good fit at all.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
My sister might,
but I'm not cute like her,

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center
and my body type's all wrong.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:30.774 position:50% align:center
I'm basically different from
this character in every way.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
I'd look so ridiculous
if I dressed up like that.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
It would feel like
I was being insulting.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
That's why I've never tried.

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
Well, that, and...

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
...if I ever did a
horrible cosplay,

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
I know I would
embarrass my sister.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:49.209 position:50% align:center
And I wouldn't be able
to handle it if she hated me.

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm too scared.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.800 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
That's confusing to me.

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
When I was at the live event,

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:02.806 position:50% align:center
I saw so many people enjoying
cosplay for the first time.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
And I remember thinking that
the best thing about cosplay

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50% align:center
is that you can
become anything you want.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
So I say, if you're
curious about it at all,

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
you should try it!

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.697 position:50% align:center
And I'll help you!

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.158 position:50% align:center
Also, I've seen how much
your sister loves you,

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
and I don't think she
would ever judge you, Inui.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Thank you, Gojo.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.376 position:50% align:center
That means a lot.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.503 position:50% align:center
I would really
appreciate your help!

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
Great! Then let's do it!

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.717 position:50% align:center
So tell me, what series
do you want to cosplay from?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.677 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Actually, I hope you don't mind.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.264 position:50% align:center
My character is also from
<i>Flower Princess Blaze</i> !

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Really? That's cool!

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
I wonder which one it is.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
She said it was someone
totally different from her,

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
so maybe it's
the heroine, Mirai.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Okay, don't laugh.

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted
to try cosplaying Soma.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.360 position:50% align:center
Wait, you mean the brother?

00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.779 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] I've always looked up
to him for so many reasons.

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center
He's strong, he's cool.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.408 position:50% align:center
And whenever his little sister,
Mirai is in trouble,

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.578 position:50% align:center
he's the first one
to step up and help her.

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
I think he's my favorite

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
because he reminds me
so much of my sister.

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.042 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
You know, I bet you could be
part of the <i>Blaze</i> cosplay group

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
with the others.

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.088 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they'd both be
thrilled to have you.

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Oh! That would be fun!

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
But could you keep it
a secret until the day of?

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
Since it's my first time,
I'm a little embarrassed.

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Of course.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] So, um, do you
really think I can pull it off?

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah, why not?

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
Because I, um, I have
a hard time finding clothes

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
that can fit me right on top.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.692 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Yeah, those might be
hard to work around.

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:40.153 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Also, I only have my allowance,

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
so I don't have
a lot of money to spend.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
That's right, I forgot!

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
She's still in middle school!

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
She looks so much older,
but she can't even work yet!

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
That's going to be rough.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.790 position:50% align:center
Materials cost a lot.

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
What am I thinking?

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
Cosplay doesn't
have to be expensive.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
It's all about creativity
and imagination.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
Everyone should be able to do it
even with limited funds.

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.967 position:50% align:center
There has to be a way
I can do this for her.

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.011 position:50% align:center
Think, dummy. Think!

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
If that sounds too difficult,
please don't worry about it.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No!

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
I'll figure it out, don't worry!

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.816 position:50% align:center
Let's start with
the outfit first.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Okay.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
We can easily use this
uniform for the base.

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
Is this your uniform, Gojo?

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah, I thought about it,

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
and I remembered watching
<i>Flower Princess Blaze</i>

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
and thinking the uniform
Soma and Sakuya were wearing

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:31.246 position:50% align:center
looked a lot like
the one from my school.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:33.123 position:50% align:center
You're right, it totally does!

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
You're sure it's okay
if I borrow it?

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.169 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Yeah. I don't know
if it'll fit you as-is, but...

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Let's see.

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It's a good thing Kitagawa

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
wasn't the one wanting
to cosplay Soma.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
Dude, these are huge on me!

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.848 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] There's no way
she'd fit into my uniform.

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Gojo, it works!

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
I'm wearing it!

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50% align:center
Great!

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
How's it--

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry about the buttons!

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.412 position:50% align:center
I'll pay for it!

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Inui, please! Cover up!

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.875 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
I'm so sorry, Gojo.

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It's fine.

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
I'll have these sewn
on in no time.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
It seemed to be around
the right size, though.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
I'll just hem it a bit for you.

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.091 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Yeah.

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:27.260 position:50% align:center
He wears his sleeves rolled up,
so the length was great.

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
My main concern
is your b-- body,

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
and what we can do to help
make it look more like a guy's.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Right.

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:37.103 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] At this point, she's
just wearing a guy's uniform.

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
That doesn't feel much
like cosplay.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.483 position:50% align:center
I have to find a way to make
her chest less noticeable

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
and her physique
look more like a boy's.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
I never had this issue
with hina dolls.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.866 position:50% align:center
Of course, they're all wearing
kimonos, so no buttons.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
Kimono! That's it!

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
Let's try a <i>sarashi</i> wrap!

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.539 position:50% align:center
We can use it to give you
a straighter shape.

00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
It'll help with the illusion
of being a male character.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
What do you think, wanna try it?

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Sounds good to me!

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Now that I think of it,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa wore two of those

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
padded bra-things
for Shizuku- <i>tan</i> .

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
These cosplayers are willing
to change their face, body,

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:14.307 position:50% align:center
or entire appearance,

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.060 position:50% align:center
just for the sake of
looking like a character.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
But...

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.232 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
It's the ultimate form of love!

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:26.027 position:50% align:center
I love her so much
I want to be her!

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I think I understand why now.

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
It's because they love
these characters so much.

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] My stomach doesn't
stand out as much anymore,

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.924 position:50% align:center
but my chest is still there.

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
Oh, is it?

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.344 position:50% align:center
Actually, the shirt is
highlighting your curves,

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
so you are still
looking a bit girlish.

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:55.890 position:50% align:center
Let's alter the
shoulders to be squarer.

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Soma is really athletic,

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
so that would make him
look stronger, too.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay, perfect.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
That should help a bit.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center
But her chest is
still a problem.

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
How did those girls dressed
as guys at the event handle it?

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:13.324 position:50% align:center
A B holder? What is that?

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] What? It really
flattens it that much?

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
Look, they have my size, too!

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Okay. But I bet
that's gonna be expensive.

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
--Or maybe it won't!
--Or maybe it won't!

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
Inui, we can make
a man out of you

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.421 position:50% align:center
without breaking the bank!

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
I'll buy it right now!

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.343 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
All that's left is the wig.

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
I'd like to get it next time
I'm out shopping.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
So would it be okay
if I measured your head?

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center
Of course you can.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
'Kay, sit up straight.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
and keep looking forward.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA gasps]
I'm so sorry!

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.862 position:50% align:center
I promise,
I didn't mean to do that!

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
No, it's totally okay!

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!
Let's not talk about it!

00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:58.661 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Thanks for coming out here.

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
I know it's a bit
of a hike for you.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:01.581 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
I don't mind!

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:04.000 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Come look, I got your wig!

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
Since you want your cosplay
to be a surprise,

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center
I thought we should
cut it ourselves.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Wow.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.680 position:50% align:center
He's never cut a wig,
and he's not hesitating at all.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh...

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
Heh...

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:36.199 position:50% align:center
It's kinda nerve-racking.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
Ohh...

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.038 position:50% align:center
I'm freaking out a little bit;
I don't wanna mess it up.

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.873 position:50% align:center
--[SHINJU] Hah.
--Huh?

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
No! It's fine!

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
I'm just so relieved that you
feel that way sometimes, too.

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.588 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I-I definitely do!

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] But you make
the most incredible outfits!

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
How could someone so
talented ever be insecure?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Are you kidding?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
There's so much I can't do!

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.889 position:50% align:center
I'm still trying
to figure it all out!

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
Do you really mean that?

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:05.395 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah.

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
I actually wish I could be more

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
like this classmate
I look up to.

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
She's always so positive.

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
Everyone who meets
her loves her.

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
She's strong, and fearless, and
says whatever is on her mind.

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
I always thought
her life must be so easy.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
There was no way she
had problems like me.

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:24.581 position:50% align:center
But then,
one thing lead to another,

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
and I ended up spending
a lot of time with her,

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
and I realized...

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
...she also had things she
wanted to do but couldn't.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
And things didn't
always go her way.

00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.384 position:50% align:center
She even messed up at times.

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
She has the same issues I do.

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:43.433 position:50% align:center
But she always looks happy.

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
And sometimes
she's even kinda cute.

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
Hold on! Did I say cute?

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
If-If I did, I swear,
I didn't mean it like that!

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
Anyway. What?

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:53.777 position:50% align:center
Did you say something?

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
I forgot what
I was talking about.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:56.946 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
My point was,

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center
we don't always know
how someone really feels.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.205 position:50% align:center
But, well,
we all have struggles.

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
Anyway. Haircuts!

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
We all have struggles. Even her?

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.425 position:50% align:center
I never thought
about it that way.

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:19.678 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay, let's do your makeup!

00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:21.805 position:50% align:center
I found everything you need
at the hundred-yen shop.

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
I got this entire bag
for under ten thousand!

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Wow! Thank you so much!

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.816 position:50% align:center
Looks good,
let's do your eyes next.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.859 position:50% align:center
To make your eyes look
a little more masculine,

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
we'll extend the eyeliner
a bit further than normal.

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.531 position:50% align:center
And the last thing we'll
do is adjust the wig.

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:42.325 position:50% align:center
Oh! There he is!

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
No. Shinju?

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU] Hi. Um, I, um,
I wanted to, I guess...

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
Just try...
sorta try cosplaying.

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
No way. I just... I can't
believe it. You look amazing!

00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
Omigosh! What she said!

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
I couldn't
tell who you were at first.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
[MARIN, JUJU
clamoring with excitement]

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
Just so good. I mean it.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
Perfect. I'm so impressed!

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
Do you like it?

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:31.791 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:32.959 position:50% align:center
So, question.

00:21:33.043 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
What'd you do with your yabbos?

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
They're like MIA!

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:37.464 position:50% align:center
I strapped them down

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
with a compression band
and a <i>sarashi</i> wrap.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.593 position:50% align:center
Then Gojo sewed in
some shoulder pads for me!

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
You still have a girl face!

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:45.013 position:50% align:center
Girl face?

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
You've got like this
powerful presence of a dude,

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.892 position:50% align:center
but your face still
looks so girly,

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
the contrast is so cool,
and I seriously can't with you!

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
Omigosh, Shinju, can we
take a few selfies together?

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:56.483 position:50% align:center
Pretty please!

00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:01.404 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Sure!

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.157 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay, cute. One more!

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.283 position:50% align:center
And this time.

00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:06.076 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I think we
should get started

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:06.951 position:50% align:center
before our time runs out.

00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:08.078 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Oh, that's right!

00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:09.329 position:50% align:center
I forgot we're paying hourly!

00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:10.872 position:50% align:center
Shinju, can you get the camera?

00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:12.332 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
Yep! On it!

00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:13.458 position:50% align:center
[EVERYONE screams]

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.960 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
That camera is really not cheap!

00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:17.629 position:50% align:center
[SHINJU]
It's fine, you guys.

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:48.887 position:50% align:center
[MARIN, SHINJU, JUJU]
Next time.
