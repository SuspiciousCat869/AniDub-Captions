00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:17.684 position:50% align:center
Ohh...

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
These are called <i>hina</i> dolls.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
Pretty, aren't they?

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
I made 'em with some
of my old pals.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.402 position:50% align:center
Do you like them?

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:31.531 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm. A lot. I love them.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:36.411 position:50% align:center
They're so beautiful.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.040 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
With plenty of practice.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:44.419 position:50% align:center
You can make these someday,
just like your gramps.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.264 position:50% align:center
You're a freak!

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you, Wakana?

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
Dolls are for girls; boys aren't
supposed to play with them!

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
You're not my friend!

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center
I hate you!

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.450 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:34.469 position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.522 position:50% align:center
Beautiful as ever.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
Hey, Grandpa. Morning.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
Oh. Good morning, Wakana.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
You have a long night?

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.903 position:50% align:center
I thought I heard you
up working late again.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:59.781 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're
getting enough rest?

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.909 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I just lost
track of time last night.

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50% align:center
I was really in the zone.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
I swear, my brush
wouldn't stop painting.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
But still, not
one doll I've made

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.751 position:50% align:center
is as perfect as
yours are, Grandpa.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50% align:center
And do you know how many
years I've been doing it?

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.716 position:50% align:center
Um, about 47?

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.343 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
No, 48! Now, let's eat.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:21.553 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Thanks, looks good.

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:24.347 position:50% align:center
So, about your dolls,
the faces need work,

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
but the clothes are great.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
But that's all I'm good at.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.978 position:50% align:center
I've got so much
I still need to practice.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.022 position:50% align:center
Well, no reason to rush.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.940 position:50% align:center
You're still young, after all,

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
and I'm sure you've
got a lot going on.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way,

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
have you managed to make
any friends at school yet?

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50% align:center
Yeesh, you okay there?

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
But why would you even
ask me something like that?

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.626 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, you know.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
It's just that you
spent all your free time

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
in grade school and middle
school working on your dolls,

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
but have you had any time
to make real friends?

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
Of course I have friends!

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
Lot's of 'em, actually.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
But they're in different clubs,
so it's hard to plan stuff!

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
I swear!
Stop looking at me like that!

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
Well, good,
that certainly is a relief!

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, you
had me a little worried.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm heading out.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
All right.
Be careful out there.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I will.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A] Come on! Why
can't we just skip first period?

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.881 position:50% align:center
Are you serious? Your grades
are bad enough as is!

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
What up, loser?!

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:50.016 position:50% align:center
Whoa! My bad, bro!

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
I thought you
were someone else!

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.566 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
I lied.

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
I still haven't made
a single friend.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:06.950 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It's impossible at this school.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
Not like there's
a <i>hina</i> doll club

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:10.245 position:50% align:center
where I can talk
crafting with other guys.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
I have nothing in
common with anyone.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.251 position:50% align:center
All I ever do these days
is work on my dolls,

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
stare at my dolls,
and talk to my dolls.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
No one here understands,

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
so talking to
people is pointless.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT BB]
You see episode six yesterday?

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:27.429 position:50% align:center
<i>Chiretsu?</i>

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.680 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT DD]
Yeah man, it was freakin' epic!

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
Like, god-tier animation.

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
The tournament
the other day was insane.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
Our coach completely lost it.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I wish I did, but...

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:44.070 position:50% align:center
...I have no common
interests with anyone here.

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT HH]
What's up, man?

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
If people found out what I do,

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
they would either laugh
at me or hate me.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
So I stay quiet.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Maybe it would be better...

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
...if I wasn't here at all.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Whoa, wait!

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Ow!

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
[NOWA]
I'm so sorry, Marin!

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
That looked rough!

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
[RUNE]
Yeah, are you okay?

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Ouch. Yeah, great. Never better.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:31.159 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout your desk! Huh?

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
Gojo, right?

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It's Marin Kitagawa!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
Oh, um... I am, yeah.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
You good?

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, yes, I'm... I'm fine!

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
Oh, yikes.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.925 position:50% align:center
Whoa, dude, what's your story?

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
Looks like some
pretty hardcore action.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
Sorry, does it hurt to touch?

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, no! This is, uh...

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
It's chill. I mean,
not chill, but cool!

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
Just shut up, dude!

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
Cool. You're free to go, then.

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:08.697 position:50% align:center
[NOWA]
You good, Marin?

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.740 position:50% align:center
No, girl, didn't
you see me die?

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
--[DAIA] Oh, whatever.
--[MARIN laughs]

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.746 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Ink. I didn't even notice it.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Did that just happen?

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:30.552 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] That's the first time
I've ever talked to her.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
Marin Kitagawa.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.973 position:50% align:center
She's beautiful,
popular, and outgoing,

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
which means she's always
the center of attention.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
We live in two
completely different worlds.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
she just spoke to me.

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
So, I had fun
with you yesterday!

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.985 position:50% align:center
Cool, we don't need
to talk about it now.

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
Sure we do, I wanna know how

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
she got you
to hang after school!

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.573 position:50% align:center
You always hide from me.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
[NOWA]
It's not that deep.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
She had a hair modeling gig
and I wanted a haircut.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center
There it is!

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
[NOWA]
But guys!

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
There was this dude who was
like stalking Marin outside

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
even after his hair was done.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.000 position:50% align:center
[DAIA]
My dude, just go home.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
[RUNE]
Creeper! Was he cute at least?

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
[NOWA]
Oh, yeah. He was stupid-hot.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
Then he opened his mouth
when we were about to leave.

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he was just trying to
"look cool" or whatever, but...

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:14.137 position:50% align:center
[GUY] Hey, isn't that thing on
your bag from some anime?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
Wow, you're a nerd!

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
A hot nerd, though!

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
Least I'm not a stalker.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.981 position:50% align:center
[NOWA] Then she just walked away
from the scene of the murder!

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.649 position:50% align:center
[DAIA]
You brutal queen! Way to go!

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
[RUNE]
Yeah, ouch!

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.027 position:50% align:center
[NOWA]
I swear, the dude froze

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
and his soul spilled
out of his mouth.

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
I dunno, Marin.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center
If he was hot, why didn't
you give him a chance?

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
[RUNE] Because Marin's
heart turns to stone

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
anytime someone
dares to like her.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.038 position:50% align:center
Like I care what
he looked like.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
He was a huge jerk.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:42.874 position:50% align:center
I mean, clearly
it's something I'm into

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center
if it's on my frikkin' bag!

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
Why be rude about it?

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.963 position:50% align:center
Making fun of the things
people like is not hot!

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:50.298 position:50% align:center
--[DAIA] Right?
--[RUNE] Preach, girl.

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:51.758 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Also, did he
seriously point to Shion-tan

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
and call her "that thing"?

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
[NOWA] Here we go.
"Leave Shion-tan alone!"

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.430 position:50% align:center
[DAIA]
Look, we don't understand you

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
when you get all
dork-a-saurus on us either.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Right here in this classroom.

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
There's someone who lives in
the exact opposite world as me.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
In the world she comes from,

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
she's accepted for who she is.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
It must be really nice there.

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT FF]
For real? You can do it again?

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
Sure. Why not?

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
You're a lifesaver!

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
Come on.
You should do it today.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
Don't be a jerk.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
Why? Gojo already
said he'd do it for us,

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
and I don't wanna
be late for work again.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
You're a good friend, bro!

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.966 position:50% align:center
See you later!

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Sorry, Gojo.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
I'll buy you a soda
or something someday!

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Honestly, staying
after to do this on my own

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:47.105 position:50% align:center
is pretty rough,

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
but it'd be worse if
someone else were here,

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
then I'd have to fumble
through a conversation.

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I can tell people
don't know what to do with me.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
If those guys had stayed,

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
I would have just made
them uncomfortable.

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.496 position:50% align:center
That's why it's best
for me to do this alone.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
[door slides open]

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:05.790 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It's Kitagawa.

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
I wonder what she forgot.

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Huh? Uh, nothing.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:32.442 position:50% align:center
I guess, but what
exactly are you doing?

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.861 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I mean, these chairs
aren't gonna stack themselves.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
I have cleaning duty.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
Sorry I'm late.

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
I had to go to the bathroom.

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Wait, so you're...
you're actually going to clean?

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Of course I am.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's the gig.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.999 position:50% align:center
Um, where's everyone else?

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, they went home.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center
I think they had to work.

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center
What? All of them?

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah.

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.218 position:50% align:center
Be honest, okay?

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center
Are they taking
advantage of you?

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.806 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
You guess so?

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
And you're still doing it?

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
You don't mind?

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Well, um...
I-I mean, I sort of do.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:13.900 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Of course you do!

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
You should!
Did you tell them?

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
Well, no...

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
But the two of them thanked
me for helping them out

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
and for being a good friend.

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Dude. That's not a friend.

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
Those jerks are using you.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't say yes to
things you don't wanna do.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
I'm serious.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
You need to take
better care of yourself.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
Next time, don't do it.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
If you hide your feelings,
they'll eat you alive.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Ow!

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Did you hurt yourself?

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I cut my finger again.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
What? You've gotta be careful!

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
Let me see if we
have any bandages left.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
Don't move,
and keep pressure on it!

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:11.249 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay, thanks.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] It's been days
since I saw her last.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
Next time, don't do it.

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:21.217 position:50% align:center
If you hide your feelings,
they'll eat you alive.

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] But her words
never left my mind.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
They're on constant repeat.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
She saw right through me.

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it.

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
I've always been afraid
to say how I'm feeling.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
Always.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.693 position:50% align:center
Even back then.

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
Oh great.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Here ya go. Slap this on.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, Grandpa?

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
The machine's not working.

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.416 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Must've been her time.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
She was pretty
much an antique.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
Guess that means
you get a new one.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
I just wish I'd gotten to a
good stopping point first.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
Oh! I know.

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
It's so easy to use.

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness there's
no Arts and Crafts Club.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center
I'll never have to worry
about anyone else

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
coming in here after school.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.701 position:50% align:center
And I can bring you with me.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
Hi, beautiful!

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna sew
your outfit today.

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
Just you wait.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa!

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA gasps]

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!
Does anything hurt?

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.276 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Crap.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.030 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
That's it. It's over.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center
No way? You know how to sew?
That is so awesome!

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:18.835 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.587 position:50% align:center
How do you know
how to use the machines?

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
We don't even have
home ec as an elective here!

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh. Well, uh...

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
My grandfather owns
a <i>hina</i> doll shop, so...

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:30.388 position:50% align:center
...I learned how to sew
when I was a kid.

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
I've always done it.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.184 position:50% align:center
That makes so much sense!
No wonder!

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
So is that a <i>hina</i> doll?

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:37.562 position:50% align:center
Lemme see it!

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh...

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Here you go.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
Wow. She's so beautiful.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:51.576 position:50% align:center
Look! Her eyes sparkle!

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What was that?

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:59.000 position:50% align:center
Someone is complimenting
something I love.

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
For the first time ever?

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure how to handle it.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.298 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] So you're saying
you actually made this doll?

00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, not at all.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.261 position:50% align:center
My grandpa's actually
the one who made her.

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
I... I'm not there yet.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:14.849 position:50% align:center
I still only know how to
make their clothes.

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:16.101 position:50% align:center
Hold the phone!

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
You make clothes?

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah? I do.

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
For real?

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm not. I mean,

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:26.361 position:50% align:center
it's not a big deal, making
the dolls themselves is--

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:37.080 position:50% align:center
Um... So, uh...

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
Could you maybe turn around?

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] What? No, no, no,
no, no, this can't be happening!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
Why is she undressing?

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's not.
Maybe that's something else.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
I hear clothes hitting
the floor, but why?

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hey, Gojo?

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes? What?

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
How can I help you?

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] You could
start by looking at me.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.103 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why?

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Just turn around. Please.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
I'm still not done
with it yet, okay?

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
And I know I've got
a lot to learn, but, uh,

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
what do you think?

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
Any advice?

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Huh? On what?

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
What exactly are you wearing?

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
It's that...

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean, it's going
to be that when I'm done.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
A little project, y'know?

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
I made it!

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
You're joking, right?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
No, I'm totally serious,
I worked hard on it.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Is this picture right?

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
'Cause that's not
what you've got on at all!

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
I don't know what you're
wearing, but it's not this!

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] This type of material
is supposed to have a lining,

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
where is it?

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
Lining? What's that mean?

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
You don't know
what a lining is?

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
Who taught you how to sew?

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.169 position:50% align:center
And what's this?

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
Look at your seams.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you
backstitch them?

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
They're falling apart!

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
Wait, what happened
to these stitches here?

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
Did you sew them
with no bobbin?

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
Oh my god!

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
This is horrible!

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on!

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
Why would you change the
tension on the dial right there?

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:22.977 position:50% align:center
Are you--

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
Please! Forgive me, I went way
too far, I am so sorry!

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
Kill me now. I insist!

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
Ew! What?

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna kill you!

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:35.824 position:50% align:center
Get up!

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Look, I can pay you!

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
How much money do you want?

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
Just give me a number, okay?

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
No! Stop that! I'm not mad!

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
Not even a little bit!

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
Seriously, dude, calm down.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
You're making it weird.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
So, um, here's the thing.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
This dress is the first step
towards my goal!

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
Goal?

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
Yup! To cosplay!

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
Basically,
I wanna create replicas

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
of the character outfits
in manga, games, and anime!

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
That's cosplay!

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
It allows you
to express your love

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
for your favorite characters!

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
Isn't that awesome?

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:22.620 position:50% align:center
Think of it like.

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:25.790 position:50% align:center
The ultimate form of love!

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
You listening to
me down there?

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes! I'm sorry!

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:30.628 position:50% align:center
I'm totally listening!

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay, so...

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
I don't have a
sewing machine at home,

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:38.470 position:50% align:center
that's why I was working on
this outfit here after school.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
But as you can see,

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
it's not exactly in the
best shape, and, well,

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
I'm not very good at sewing
and don't know anyone who is.

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
Gojo! I beg you!

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
Please help me make
the perfect cosplay!

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
If you don't want to,

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
just tell me.

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna force you, okay?

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:13.838 position:50% align:center
It's just that Shizuku-tan
means so much to me.

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
And I wanna show
that to everyone,

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
but I can't do it by myself.

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
I wanna be like her.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
I love her!

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
So please, help me, Gojo!

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
No way? You know how to sew?

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:30.313 position:50% align:center
That is so awesome!

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
Wow. She's so beautiful.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
Why be rude about it?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
Making fun of things
people like is not hot!

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center
Next time, don't do it.

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
If you hide your feelings,
they'll eat you alive.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
All right.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center
I'll help you.

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
I might not be perfect

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
since I've just made
clothes for dolls.

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center
But I'll try.
I promise I will.

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
Seriously? You will?

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yes.

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
You said yes! I'm so excited!

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
Thank you!
I'm gonna be Shizuku-tan!

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
I can't wait!

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.131 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna live her life
and be just like her! Yay, yay!

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:40.175 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Right here in this classroom.

00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:43.762 position:50% align:center
There's someone who lives in
the exact opposite world as me.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.933 position:50% align:center
I never thought I'd make
a promise like this

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
with someone like her.

00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:56.191 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I'm seriously
crying real tears right now.

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:57.359 position:50% align:center
Thanks, you rock.

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.361 position:50% align:center
And seriously,
if you ever need anything.

00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.112 position:50% align:center
I'm totally here for you!

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
Hey, thanks.

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.491 position:50% align:center
You really do love
this Shizuku, huh?

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:06.159 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Of course!
I mean, who wouldn't?

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:07.994 position:50% align:center
She's just too
precious for words!

00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:09.454 position:50% align:center
Shizuku Kuroe-tan.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.414 position:50% align:center
from <i>Saint Slippery's</i>
<i>Academy for Girls:</i>

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:14.000 position:50% align:center
<i>Young Ladies of</i>
<i>the Humiliation Club</i> !

00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:15.585 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, what?
