[gasps softly]

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
What do you think?

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.320 position:50% align:center
Did it work?

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
Do I... Do I look
like Shizuku-tan?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.285 position:50% align:center
Yes! You really do!

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
You're the perfect Shizuku-tan!

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.455 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
You're right!

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
I am, I can I feel it!

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:41.833 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Gojo.

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center
I'm totally
Shizuku-tan right now!

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center
You are! You are!

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.048 position:50% align:center
You're totally Shizuku-tan!

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.091 position:50% align:center
Oh, but how does it fit you?

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
Does it feel too tight anywhere?

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.428 position:50% align:center
No, it's perfect!

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess maybe
a little here.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
Like, I can't
extend my arm much.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.851 position:50% align:center
But who needs straight arms?

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.312 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.
Making clothes for humans means

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.397 position:50% align:center
I have to consider
comfort and mobility.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.525 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] But you nailed
the important part!

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.945 position:50% align:center
I didn't know these boob bag
things could look so realistic!

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.989 position:50% align:center
I mean, check out
the bounce factor!

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center
Dang! These babies are OP AF!

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.745 position:50% align:center
And this skirt is,
like, the perfect length.

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:20.789 position:50% align:center
I mean, you just get her!

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
Shizuku-tan is all
about the low-key,

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50% align:center
yet screaming garter reveal.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.710 position:50% align:center
And you crushed that!

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.462 position:50% align:center
Like, show me to your temple!

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.547 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Thank you,
that's really nice.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
I'm so flattered I don't
know what else to say.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.511 position:50% align:center
But, I do still have
a long way to go.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.596 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I can't believe
this is my life right now.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.015 position:50% align:center
Like I'm finally
Shizuku-tan, for real.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.100 position:50% align:center
Am I dreaming?

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.726 position:50% align:center
Pinch me! No wait, don't!

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.228 position:50% align:center
Like, what?

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:46.064 position:50% align:center
I never thought this would
actually happen for me!

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:48.858 position:50% align:center
I can't even. I can't!

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.861 position:50% align:center
I'm so excited
I'm gonna explode!

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.655 position:50% align:center
Okay, Kitagawa, calm down!

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:54.823 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I need photos!

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.451 position:50% align:center
Wanna take pics for me? Please?

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:02.163 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Um, okay, let's see.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.832 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that looks good.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.167 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Omigod, did you get it?

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:10.255 position:50% align:center
Is it fierce?
I wanna see, too! Sweet!

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:13.008 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's a good picture,
for sure.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.343 position:50% align:center
But you're just
kinda posing like you.

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:16.886 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
And what's wrong with that?

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.222 position:50% align:center
I'm hilarious, get used to it!

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.017 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Okay, but since
you're cosplaying and all,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.769 position:50% align:center
maybe you should pose more
like your character would.

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:27.188 position:50% align:center
And this background's
not quite right.

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:28.606 position:50% align:center
We should go and
take these somewhere

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.401 position:50% align:center
that looks more
like Shizuku-tan's world.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.028 position:50% align:center
Ah. I feel that.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
How 'bout over here?

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.865 position:50% align:center
This is neutral enough
to be anywhere.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.998 position:50% align:center
'Kay, you're Shizuku-tan now,
let's see it.

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.624 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yessir!

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50% align:center
Aw, crap! I cheesed!

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
Nope! Sorry! Can't stop!

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.846 position:50% align:center
Won't stop! Must smile.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
How can I not?

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.807 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy I could just die!

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
Don't hate me!

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:05.894 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll do it right
and be super serious.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:07.604 position:50% align:center
Please take it one more time.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, okay.

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:13.026 position:50% align:center
[breathes in/out]

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.111 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I got this.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
So serious.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.327 position:50% align:center
Is it all right? Did we get it?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.704 position:50% align:center
Sure did!
That one was incredible!

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.166 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Yes! Let's keep
going while you're on a roll!

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.626 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Looking good!

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
You've got her
poses down perfectly!

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! Yeah,
that looks awesome!

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:37.300 position:50% align:center
You are Shizuku-tan!

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.344 position:50% align:center
Okay, now look right
at the camera.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
That face.
It's just like that scene

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
where she's with the
main guy, it's amazing!

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
Do you think that's enough?

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
We got a lot!

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
Cool! Thanks! Can I see them?

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
Wow! Gojo, these look fab!

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.274 position:50% align:center
I'm so psyched now!

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna create an account
and upload these right away.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
You already want to post them?

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Duh! Except, I haven't
thought of a cosplay name yet.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
Hmm. Ma... Mar...

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
I guess we can go with Marine.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
I can't get over
how cute these pics are!

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
Like, I can't, Gojo!

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hey, you know what?

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hmm? What's up?

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center
I think we should
go to the event tomorrow!

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
I'm ready now, so why not?

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
Come on! It'll be fun!

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
I dunno, man.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center
Wow! Oh. Em. Gee!

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
Cosplay events are so cool!

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
so many in one place!

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center
Is that Mami-tan?

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
She's totes adorbs!

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.769 position:50% align:center
Omigah that's Soji!

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
And Ryoma!

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.940 position:50% align:center
That's Lancelot and Kenshin!
And there's Leo!

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
And I could've sworn I saw
Cirque and Soleil over there!

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.528 position:50% align:center
Eee! I'm so hype about it all!

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
Right. It's great.

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] This is a dream come
true, it's finally happening.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.409 position:50% align:center
My cosplay debut!

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
I've never been happier
in my entire life!

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.538 position:50% align:center
I really don't know
how to thank you!

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Holy sweat-beads. Are you okay?

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
I'm okay, I just didn't realize
how many girls would be here

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
so I feel a little out of place

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
and kinda like
I should hide somewhere?

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,
I swear I'll calm down.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
That's a lot.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Yeah. Also, I feel
like everyone's looking at us.

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
Oh! I know what's up!

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
They must be as obsessed
with this outfit as I am!

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center
And, come on, can you blame 'em?

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Actually, I think it's
because I'm so out of place.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one not dressed up.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50% align:center
Huh? There's
nothing wrong with that.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
You look fine in your
normal clothes. Who cares?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
--[WAKANA] 'Kay.
--And if they are staring...

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.333 position:50% align:center
...it's probably because this
is the best boob bag here!

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
No one else's even comes
close and they're jealous.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay, I get it!

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.214 position:50% align:center
But do you have
to do that out here?

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.633 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] We don't have to hang
here if it's making you nervous.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.344 position:50% align:center
I saw some photographers
and other dudes in the plaza.

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
We can go there!

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.555 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Cool. I'm sorry.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
Wow! It's like
a super chill oasis!

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
Nice!

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Definitely not as bad up here.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Oh, check out
that Vanessa over there!

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.530 position:50% align:center
She's so cute!

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50% align:center
Her rack is ginormous, too!

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna line up to get
a pic with her for sure!

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.370 position:50% align:center
[PHOTOGRAPHER A]
Excuse me.

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
You mind if
I take some pictures?

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Huh?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you talking to me?

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
[PHOTOGRAPHER A]
Uh, yeah, you're Shizuku Kuroe

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
from <i>Slippery Girls 2</i> , right?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
Yes! Shizuku-tan rules!

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
[PHOTOGRAPHER A]
Yeah! Oh, but it's cool

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:32.637 position:50% align:center
if you don't do photos.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] What? No!
I'm totally fine with it!

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
In fact, that sounds awesome!

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.977 position:50% align:center
Perfect! I really appreciate it!

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.153 position:50% align:center
Can you do a pose in character?

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.612 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.790 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, whoa. That's super cute.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
[PHOTOGRAPHER A]
It is. Thank you so much.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?
I appreciate it!

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:05.670 position:50% align:center
Hold on. I have an idea!

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
Let's take a
photo together, cool?

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
Savor the memory!

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.344 position:50% align:center
Okay, here we go!

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.012 position:50% align:center
Hey, you can come closer
if you want.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna bite you.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.140 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, dude!

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.979 position:50% align:center
You totes made my day!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
[PHOTOGRAPHER B]
Hi, you look great.

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
Could I get some photos, too?

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.569 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Yeah! Of course,
you can, thanks!

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:32.072 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
She's got a line. Amazing.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
Could you give
me a pose, please?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay, good.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
I'm glad she's posing
like Shizuku now.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
People cosplay in drag, too?

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
I guess there were
a lot of girls dressed

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
as guy characters downstairs.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.392 position:50% align:center
They're cosplaying
their favorite character

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
no matter who it is.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:05.522 position:50% align:center
That's what makes it
so much fun for them.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
This is really nice.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
She looks happy.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
I'm glad she's
having a good time.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
And that I could keep
my promise to her.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
I beg you!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
Please help me make
the perfect cosplay!

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh, that's right.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
I did what she asked me to do.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
So I won't get to hang out
with Kitagawa like this anymore.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
Looks like today's the last day.

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm glad I met her.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
Not having friends and
always doing everything alone

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:46.021 position:50% align:center
made talking to someone
like her really special.

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
Going shopping with a friend.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
Actually having plans
after school.

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.318 position:50% align:center
Meeting up on our days off.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
Spending my free time
with someone else.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
Well, those were firsts for me.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Thinking about it.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
It almost doesn't seem real.

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
It was so much fun.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.308 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Um. Hey, are you okay?

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
You're still here.

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:09.813 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah!

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
[MARIN pants]
Thank goodness.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center
I thought you decided
to dip without me

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
and totally freaked out.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.657 position:50% align:center
So, real talk.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
I think...

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
...my clothes
are gonna come off!

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.291 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, what?

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
They're coming off?

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
Which part's
not working for you?

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.173 position:50% align:center
Well, here's the thing.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
Last night, I was looking

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.552 position:50% align:center
at the pics you took
of me in the outfit.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
Aren't Shizuku-tan's boobs
way bigger than that?

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.851 position:50% align:center
So, this morning,
I added some special bras

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:51.563 position:50% align:center
to give me a little
extra lift, ya know?

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.064 position:50% align:center
And I feel like
I'm about to burst.

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah, you probably are!

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
That outfit was measured
and sewn to fit you perfectly!

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
There isn't room for
special bras or whatever!

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
You don't have to match

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.824 position:50% align:center
the exact chest size
of a game character!

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Okay, but it's
also sweaty stank-town

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center
under this wig.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
The whole outfit
is just a furnace.

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna die. Like, for real.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Huh? Oh no.

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
This must be because
I picked the thicker fabric!

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:20.508 position:50% align:center
This is all my fault!

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
Let's go somewhere
you can cool off!

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:30.268 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
So good.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
Gojo, you, sir, are a lifesaver!

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.230 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:35.106 position:50% align:center
Do you think you can make it

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
to the changing room?

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:39.986 position:50% align:center
No way! I can't move.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.031 position:50% align:center
I wish I'd thought more
about how hot it would be.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
I really am sorry.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:54.042 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much!

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
You should also
cool off your neck some,

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:59.381 position:50% align:center
and your underarms and
anywhere with a major artery.

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
Here's a towel.

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
Use it to wipe your sweat.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
Will do.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
Yuck.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center
Look how much
sweat's up in there.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
I don't think I even
sweat this much in PE.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:22.654 position:50% align:center
The black fabric
definitely makes it worse.

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Those special bras are hardcore.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
Okay, let me see what else
we can do to help here.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
Yeah, thanks.

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
Heatstroke is no joke,

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
and I don't wanna be
lame and pass out.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
Ah. Okay, I found something.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
That's it?

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
You just gonna stand there
and watch me die?

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
Whoa 'kay, my dude.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
I didn't say rip it
off me, sit down.

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center
Just unzip it a little.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center
Can we at least get you
to the dressing room?

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.105 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Right. I'm an idiot.

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.441 position:50% align:center
She said she can't move.

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
She does seem to be
having a rough time.

00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Here goes.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
This is no time to be panicking.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
Please excuse me.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:17.500 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:19.294 position:50% align:center
Holy crap!

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:22.464 position:50% align:center
Now I'm freezing because
my back is dripping wet!

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Even my undies
are drenched in sweat!

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
I seriously should've
brought an extra pair.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.345 position:50% align:center
Next time.

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gojo?
Could you wipe my back?

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.057 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, sure.

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Stop panicking, dude!

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:41.524 position:50% align:center
'Kay. So, I'm gonna wipe now.

00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
Ah! Whoa!

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.155 position:50% align:center
Could you go a little lower?

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
I'm like a fountain, I swear.

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:53.995 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
L-Lower? You mean like here?

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.664 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yeah, there. Right there!

00:15:56.748 --> 00:16:00.669 position:50% align:center
Yes! Oh, that feels so good.

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:05.715 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Yeah! There! More!

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
[moans]

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
Hey. Kitagawa, can you try to
keep your voice down, please?

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.807 position:50% align:center
Someone's gonna hear you
and come back here.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
No, they won't.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm not
being that loud.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.854 position:50% align:center
And if I am, I'm not
trying to, so whatever!

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, yeah.

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure that
I've got a swamp under here.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
Gojo, could you hand me a towel?

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Put that down!
Someone might see!

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Don't you worry about that.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.575 position:50% align:center
I've got shorts on!

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:35.870 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You do? Of course you do.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
Those look neat.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.250 position:50% align:center
Did you write them out yourself?

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I did!

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
I figured if
I wanna be Shizuku-tan,

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.713 position:50% align:center
I should probably go all out!

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Oh. Yeah, that's cool.

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
Okay, this should help
to reinforce it.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
You're the best.

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Be careful, though,

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
it's not as strong as
a sewing machine stitch.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Mm-hmm.

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
I think we should
head home for now.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Good idea.

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
You seem pretty exhausted.

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.981 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I'm so sorry, Gojo.

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
Could we go back
to the plaza again?

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center
It'll only take a second.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.160 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, there!

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:16.411 position:50% align:center
[PHOTOGRAPHER C]
Hmm?

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.164 position:50% align:center
Shizuku, you're back!

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
Sorry for running off
like that earlier.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
I got dizzy from all this heat.

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
What? That's terrible!

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:26.254 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center
I'm actually feeling much
better now and heading home.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:31.176 position:50% align:center
But I felt awful for
bailing on you earlier

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:32.761 position:50% align:center
so I wanted to finish the shoot!

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
[PHOTOGRAPHER C]
Aww, you didn't have to do that!

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
But if you don't mind,
I'd love a shot in the shade.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
Maybe over here?

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.893 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Of course!

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Here we go.

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.483 position:50% align:center
Last photo of the day.

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
[PHOTOGRAPHER C] Could I get you
to look at the camera, please?

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, crap!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
I don't know
what I was thinking!

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
I'm deleting them now!

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
Oh, I don't blame you.

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:16.680 position:50% align:center
You're right, I wasn't looking
at the camera at all, sorry.

00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
--[PHOTOGRAPHER C] Huh?
--[WAKANA] Wha...?

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:19.265 position:50% align:center
Okay, one more!

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
This time I'll get it right!

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
[PHOTOGRAPHER C, WAKANA]
That's what she's worried about?

00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'm glad we found a seat.

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're lucky it
isn't crowded.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Gojo. Great job today.

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
Oh man, I guess that
means summer's here already.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
Looks like.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to jump into the
shower as soon as I get home.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:47.627 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Kitagawa?

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center
Thank you for everything.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
I know it was rough at times,

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
but this was a great experience.

00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
And I... I really
had fun with you.

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
I did, too.

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
So much fun with you!

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Gojo!

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
You rule.

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50% align:center
So what are we gonna do
for the next one?

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:22.954 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Next one?

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
My next cosplay.

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh.

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
So... you... you wanna be
more than just Shizuku-tan?

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
Is that a serious question?

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
OMG, I have like 50
all-time fave characters!

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] What's the
point of favorites then?

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
This is such a hard decision.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
I mean, I still wanna cosplay
the heck outta Shizuku-tan.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
But like there are
so many cosplays I wanna do,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
and I only have
one body to work with.

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
What's that face about?

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
Aw, look at that shy smile!

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
Y'know I think you might be
happier than you let on.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.111 position:50% align:center
Uh! No, I, uh...

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking
about something.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, yeah? What? Out with it.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
Well, ya know. It's, um...

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
I know I'm not great yet!

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
But I'm looking forward
to working with you again!

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm. For sure.

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
We need a dress form.

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go buy one.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
It was kinda rough
just winging it.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:25.517 position:50% align:center
That sounds like a great idea!

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'll buy it for you.

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
I wonder if
we can get one online.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
Sweet! Found one!

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
Here, check this guy out.

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
Looks like someone needs a nap!

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
Sleepy much?

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:43.827 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, sorry.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.037 position:50% align:center
Guess I'm pretty wiped.

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:48.790 position:50% align:center
I had so much fun, Gojo.

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
Thanks for an amazing day!

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
Actually, it seemed like
everyone was having fun,

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:54.713 position:50% align:center
it was so insane!

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center
All those people
together in one spot,

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
doing what they loved.

00:20:58.425 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
The vibe was so hype!

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.594 position:50% align:center
I just ate it up!

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:03.513 position:50% align:center
That's my favorite thing.

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
Whether it's a hobby,
or a job or whatever,

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
I love being around people
having fun doing what they love.

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
I can almost see them sparkle!

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I can't wait
to go to more events!

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
Holy crap,
I didn't even take any pics

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:18.778 position:50% align:center
with the other cosplayers!

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:20.864 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go full
paparazzi next time!

00:21:20.947 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
Like that Leo!

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
That was one cosplay I would've
loved to have a shot with!

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:27.120 position:50% align:center
Leo from <i>Seven BFs</i> is so money!

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
How are they all so
beautiful without a filter?

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:30.999 position:50% align:center
It's not fair!

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You're right.

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
Kitagawa, you looked
so beautiful today.

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:41.343 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.889 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No other word since then.

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
Could define the things
most precious to me.

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
So I don't say
"beautiful" or "pretty,"

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:53.688 position:50% align:center
unless it comes from the heart.

00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:49.054 position:50% align:center
[JUJU]
Next time.
