[MARIN]
O. M. G!

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.809 position:50% align:center
You're a genius;
I'm freaking out!

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:20.854 position:50% align:center
Seriously, Gojo, I'm blown away!

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
I'm glad that it
fits you so well.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Mm-hmm. It fits perfectly!

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
All that's left is the wig.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay, but wait.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
What's wrong?

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
Um, nothing really.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.907 position:50% align:center
The outfit's so great.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:37.579 position:50% align:center
But, when I cosplay, I start
to feel like the character.

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:44.127 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
So, Gojo. I mean, M-Mast...

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.796 position:50% align:center
Master.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
Will you please...

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
Please look.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.719 position:50% align:center
Pwease.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center
Look at what
I'm hiding under here.

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.316 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Pwease look.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.443 position:50% align:center
I want you to see.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.820 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.707 position:50% align:center
What the hell was that?

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.793 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:25.835 position:50% align:center
Eh!

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.837 position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:40.558 position:50% align:center
So, do you think you could
look the other way?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
[RANDOM STUDENT B]
Morning.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:17.447 position:50% align:center
[RANDOM STUDENT A]
Morning!

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.659 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] What a messed-up
way to start the day.

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to talk to her now?

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
Now that my subconscious
violated us.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Look, it's Kitagawa!

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
Ugh! Marin is such a cutie.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50% align:center
[KENSEI]
Yo, Kitagawa!

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50% align:center
Hi!

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] I bet she's,
like, a model or something.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
For sure.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
She's not even real,
I call witchcraft.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.177 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing
she's pretty popular.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
Well, duh!
Look at her!

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.513 position:50% align:center
Hey, I get it.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
This whole thing is so surreal.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
I can't believe someone like her
was in my house this weekend.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Whatever, it's fine.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:51.648 position:50% align:center
I just need to stay calm.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh! Hey, Gojo! Hello!

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
Hi, good morning, how are you?

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.322 position:50% align:center
Amazing, thanks to you!

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
I'm super excited
to become Shizuku-tan,

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.284 position:50% align:center
you totes made my day!

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
Um, I'm so sorry!

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Huh? About what, weirdo?

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
Can you tell?

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
I decided to curl my hair
at the bottom today.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, yeah.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:17.590 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you did. I see it.

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:18.800 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
You see it?

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
I would hope so!

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
Right. I'm sorry.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
[NOWA]
Whatcha guys talkin' about?

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
I wanna hang out with you two.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Kitagawa's friend.
What's her name?

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
[NOWA]
Yo! I'm Nowa!

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
Oh! Good morning to you, Nowa!

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
Good mornin', newb.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
Heya!

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Morning.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I do not know how to do this.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
It's cool to see
you actually talk!

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
Hi there.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I do! Thanks!
Pleasure to meet you!

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
Sucker?

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.786 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Uh, sure! Thank you!

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
Marin, is this a joke?

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hmm?

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
This guy's obviously
uncomfortable.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should just,
like, leave him alone.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
Oh, he's fine! See?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure!

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.720 position:50% align:center
[NOWA]
Let's go.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
We still have to get snacks
before first period starts.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh crap! You're so right.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
Later. See ya round.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
Uh, right.

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
Hey, do you have change?
I've only got bigger bills.

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] She's not
acting any differently.

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
She's treating me the
exact same way at school.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.572 position:50% align:center
Am I hallucinating?

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
Is she going out
with that loser?

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Shut up! Yeah, right!

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
Can you imagine?

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
I don't want to!

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:28.912 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Yo, Gojo!

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
Okay so, I have the best idea!

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.003 position:50% align:center
After school today
you and I should--

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:39.381 position:50% align:center
I-I'd love to but I can't.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
There's something else
I have to do.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hmm?

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.053 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Gojo, c'mere! About today.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
Bathroom break?

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:52.185 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Gojo? Where are you?

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50% align:center
Are you in here? Gojo?

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
Gojo, come on!

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
There you are!

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
Finally! That was a close one!

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.755 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hi, Kitagawa.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I've been looking
everywhere for you,

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.092 position:50% align:center
I wanna take you shopping!

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
I know some
cute places that have

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
what we need for the outfit.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna have to pass.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
Huh? What?

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
Omigod, you're running?

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] The station is
in the opposite direction.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
I should be safe here for a bit.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:54.289 position:50% align:center
It was nice of her
to invite me, though.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Kitagawa.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna apologize,

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center
then don't run away
in the first place!

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
What? You found me? But how?

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center
Seriously, you're in
the middle of the sidewalk!

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
I used my eyes!

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center
You've been avoiding me
all day, haven't you?

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
You got a problem, then say so!

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
Don't be a coward
and hide from me.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
You're right. Sorry.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
It's just that when
people see us together,

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
they're gonna think that we, uh,

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
that we know
each other, ya know?

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.404 position:50% align:center
So maybe we shouldn't hang out.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50% align:center
At least while
others are around.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Huh? What are you even saying?

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center
Why shouldn't people
know we're friends?

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
Well, um, I also heard some
people in the hallway saying

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.171 position:50% align:center
that we might be,
you know, going out.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Seriously?

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center
Hmmm...

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
Well, then why don't we?

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
Wha...? What do
you mean? Really?

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
[MARIN laughs]

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.973 position:50% align:center
C'mon! Let's go out!

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.234 position:50% align:center
Hurry up! You're too slow!

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
Huh? No, I'm not!

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.362 position:50% align:center
I just don't know
where we're going!

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I told you!
We're going shopping!

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] How cool that they
have an entire cosplay section.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.164 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I know, right?

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.417 position:50% align:center
So many people are
into cosplay these days!

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
Especially on Halloween.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
That makes sense.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
By the way, I wanted to ask:

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
Could you take a look at this?

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Holy shit.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I drew a
multi-view design map

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.637 position:50% align:center
of Shizuku-tan's costume.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
We need quite a few things.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
Fabric, lace, ribbons,
artificial roses,

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
shoes, a wig, fasteners,
color contacts,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
garters and
stockings. And also...

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay, stop the car!

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
Are you saying
you drew all of this?

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
Like, all of it?

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:47.318 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah.

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
That is insane!

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Okay, so the skirt
here is pretty poofy, right?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Uh-huh.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:54.993 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I bet we can
get the volume we need

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
by adding a
petticoat underneath.

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
We'll have to buy one
that's ready-made, but...

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay! I'm down.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Also, this shoe style
is pretty unique.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing we'll
need to get them

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50% align:center
from a specialty shop somewhere.

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
The style is called
Gothic Lolita, I think.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I'll look for them!

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
By the way,
what about the collar?

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
Um. Oh yeah, that.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
I've honestly never
made one before.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I might be able
to find one at a V-kei shop.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
I'll keep an eye out.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.687 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Thank you,
I appreciate that.

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:27.567 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Look! How about that fabric?

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Hmm...

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
Will it work?

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.281 position:50% align:center
I dunno, uh... Let me see.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
I kinda feel like this
one would work better.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Huh? But how?
I don't see a difference.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Slippery Girls
Academy is a school

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
for upper-class girls, right?

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
So I would think that
Shizuku-tan's uniform

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.587 position:50% align:center
would reflect her status.

00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
I figure we should go with
fabric that's a bit thicker

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:53.259 position:50% align:center
and heavier, since the glossier
materials tend to be cheaper.

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
You are so right!

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Ugh, but it's
literally double the price

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50% align:center
of the other one.

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap, I wasn't
planning on shopping today,

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
so I'm not carrying cash on me!

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.312 position:50% align:center
We can't get anything right now!

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
[Don't you worry your
pretty little head about that.

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center

I can't do that!

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
It doesn't feel right!

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.450 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh, don't be dramatic!

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:20.203 position:50% align:center
I've been saving up
for cosplay for a while.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Yeah, but...

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
Take it! Please or I did
all that work for nothing!

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.171 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Okay, okay.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
[MARIN chuckles]

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
Yay! Let's get to it then!

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
I think we managed
to get everything!

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
Thanks for carrying all that.

Sure.

I love it here.

around gives me a rush.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center

Yeah, I get that.

[WAKANA]
It really is amazing.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:39.908 position:50% align:center
So many different styles,
in every color imaginable.

They're all so beautiful.

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Gojo.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.041 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
I found it. Medium black.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
--Black?
--Yep.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
This one's styled just
like hers, it's perfect.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
The style's great.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
But I think we
should do this color.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
Huh? That one? Why?

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
It looks kinda purple.

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Sure.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
But I think Shizuku-tan's
character color

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.560 position:50% align:center
is purple, isn't it?

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
I mean her hair is black,

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:10.814 position:50% align:center
but it looks like it
has some depth to it.

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
Plus, a purple tint
feels more "her." 

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
Oh. Good call.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.319 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
For such a big fan,

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:19.155 position:50% align:center
she doesn't pay
much attention to details.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
I think we should go
with this black violet.

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.743 position:50% align:center
Or wait, maybe
the deep violet instead.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
Also, the length's wrong.

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.666 position:50% align:center
We need to get one
that's longer.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
But why?

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.669 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Shizuku-tan has
an asymmetrical bob,

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.295 position:50% align:center
so just a medium
length won't work.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
If we buy it longer,
we can trim it for accuracy.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, I'll get it
cut at my salon!

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
Wait, by a real stylist?

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
That's perfect.

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
Bobs are super hard to cut.

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're here.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:48.935 position:50% align:center

all this alone today.

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] But every time
I do that, it's a mess.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center

the most inaccurate pieces.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
Sounds good!

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:19.044 position:50% align:center
I'll get the pattern
drawn up for you, too.

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:21.421 position:50% align:center
For real? Hell yeah!

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:24.841 position:50% align:center
Where's the first place I should
wear it once it's complete?

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.010 position:50% align:center
Are there designated areas?

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.345 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
There are all kinds of events

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.972 position:50% align:center
where cosplay groups
get their photos taken!

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
Like they'll rent out amusement
parks for super creative shoots.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
Those who aren't as
extra might go to a studio,

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
or even just cosplay at home.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.775 position:50% align:center
I totes wanna do some blingy
photo booth shots, too!

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
Basically, you're only
limited by your own creativity.

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
Fascinating.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.406 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Oh and of course,

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
you can always post your
favorites to your sosh meeds.

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.869 position:50% align:center
What? You put those
photos on the internet?

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Uh, duh. Why not? Look!

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.332 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
That's amazing!

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] I can't tell if
she got that done at a studio.

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I love the details.

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.296 position:50% align:center
Do you think she
crafted her own props?

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
She prolly bought them.

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
Oh, look at this one!

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:07.592 position:50% align:center
Her name is Juju!

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:09.469 position:50% align:center
Isn't she offensively cute?

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
I'm basically obsessed with her!

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center
She cosplays a lot of
younger anime characters,

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
like magical girls n' stuff.

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:17.060 position:50% align:center
She's gorgeous,
and the quality of her costumes

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
and photos are sick!

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
That's why she's got
a gazillion followers!

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
Apparently,
she doesn't go to events,

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
so she's like
this eternal mystery,

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.945 position:50% align:center
but I'm pretty sure
she's a total pro.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] Wow.
She looks really young, though.

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
How old do you think she is?

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Hmm. She might
be in middle school?

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
Or the end of grade school.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
Huh?

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.414 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Omigosh look!

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
She's cosplaying
pre-transformation Shion Nikaido

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
from <i>Flower Princess Blaze</i> !

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
Her outfit is perfect!

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
She's so frikkin cute I could
literally throw up and die!

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
There's a theme. Black hair.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.050 position:50% align:center
It's a thing for you.

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
And what about you, kettle?

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right, good point there.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.016 position:50% align:center
Guess we're the same.

00:16:58.059 --> 00:16:59.185 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
You gotta see this!

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
They're so pretty!

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
Wow, this one's effing gorgeous!

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
I swear, girls who
cosplay guys are my jam!

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center
Damn! Look how hot this one is!

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.782 position:50% align:center
Why are you
mute all of a sudden?

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
Are you immune
to beauty or something?

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.537 position:50% align:center
What? No, I swear,
nothing like that.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Then what is it?

00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
Well, um, it just made me
think of something else

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.210 position:50% align:center
from my childhood.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I don't have any siblings.

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
So the first time
I ever saw a doll

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
was on the shelf at
my Grandpa's store.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center
Whoa...

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I couldn't take
my eyes off of her.

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
I thought to myself.

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
How can something so beautiful
exist in this world?

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] It was like she
reached in and stole my heart.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center
There, in that moment,

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
I first understood what
the word "beautiful" meant.

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
Nothing else could describe her.

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
And no other word
since then could be used

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
to define things that
are the most precious to me.

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
So I don't say
"beautiful" or "pretty,"

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
unless it comes from the heart.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
Okay. But, like,
<i>hina</i> dolls are all painted

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.912 position:50% align:center
to look super gorgeous, right?

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
Gojo, you're a total face guy.

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA] I hope I didn't
say something wrong.

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
I have a hard time
giving compliments.

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not
like I'm denying

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
that those people
look good, but...

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
Dude, if that's
your code or whatever,

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.387 position:50% align:center
it's totally fine to own it.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's okay not
to compromise on stuff.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
I've got some things
I'm hardcore about, too.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
Like boob bags, for instance?

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:11.192 position:50% align:center
Yup! Huh?

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
Oh, baby!

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
I gotta get that in my mouth!

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
It looks so good!

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center
You sure you don't want
me to get you one, Gojo?

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'll totes cover you.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
I'm sure. Thanks though.

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:24.831 position:50% align:center
'Kay! Be right back!

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
How can she eat anything

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
after we just
had all that ramen?

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:35.216 position:50% align:center
Damn, I went on
a spending binge today.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.052 position:50% align:center
I'll have to add
more hours at work.

00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
Wait! I forgot to
pay you back for the ramen.

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
What? I told you that was on me.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
I stole your whole day.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.017 position:50% align:center
If you're sure...

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
I promise, it's fine.

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
It's just that.

00:19:57.572 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
You made me really happy.

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
It's not very often
that someone actually plays

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
a game I recommend, you know?

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:07.290 position:50% align:center
Most people will say
"yeah that seems fun"

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
and then awkwardly
change the subject.

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
To be completely honest,

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center
I didn't think you'd be the type

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
to get into a game
like <i>Slippery Girls</i> .

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:16.841 position:50% align:center
My bad.

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're the one
who drew her outfit

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
perfectly right down
to the very last detail.

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
It's hard to admit, but you're
more of an expert on it than me.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
And, um, I have a point.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you. 'Kay?

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Gojo.

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
Besides, since
I can't really sew,

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
the only way I can help is
by emptying my wallet, right?

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No, that's not true.

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
Anyway, this meat roll is
giving me life right now.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:56.965 position:50% align:center
Here, have a bite.

00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
It'll blow your mind.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[MARIN] Open! Here!

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
No, that's an indirect kiss!

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
Oh no, I really
couldn't eat another bite!

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
You've treated me
to more than enough today!

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
I'm super stuffed!

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:09.144 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Okay.

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
Please don't be upset.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.772 position:50% align:center
I'm not, but you're missing out!

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hmm?

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:20.613 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
You probably think
I'm a total pig, don't you?

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:24.242 position:50% align:center
Ehhhh...

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
No, not at all.

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:29.122 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Liar! Look!

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna get fat
for eating like this, okay?

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
Quit staring at me
in that tone of voice!

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
I'm fine!

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:35.462 position:50% align:center
Of course you're fine!

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
I wasn't judging you, I swear!

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:38.506 position:50% align:center
My body needs carbs, okay?

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
So, it's not my fault!

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:40.800 position:50% align:center
It's science!

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
No, yeah! I hear you!

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
[MARIN] Whatever. I'm not eating
anything until the event.

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:47.891 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll still be able
to fit into my cosplay!

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
[WAKANA]
You have to eat.

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
But when does
this event take place?

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:52.520 position:50% align:center
[MARIN]
Hm? Hmm...

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:54.481 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:55.565 position:50% align:center
Oh, here it is.

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:57.984 position:50% align:center
Looks like it's
in exactly two weeks.

00:21:58.068 --> 00:21:59.152 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap!

00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
Sorry! I gotta go
or I'll miss my train!

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.907 position:50% align:center
Thanks for everything today!

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.867 position:50% align:center
See you later, Gojo!

00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:11.331 position:50% align:center
