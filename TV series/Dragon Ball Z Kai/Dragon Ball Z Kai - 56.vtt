You re in such a hurry to
meet your doom. So be it!

Frieza, no! The planet
can t handle that!

It was a nice warm up before

the real Super Saiyan arrives.

00:14:19.953 --> 00:14:22.023

That... was Frieza...!

He got rid of him...
like like he was nothing!

Yeah, right...
and in no time flat...!

[BULMA] How can you tell
what s going on up there?

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.882
I must need glasses
or something

00:15:57.982 --> 00:15:59.151
Anyhow, sounds like Goku

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:02.023
managed to make
it back just in time, huh?

00:16:02.123 --> 00:16:03.191
I guess all that training

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:06.933
out in space
really paid off, too.

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.104
Yep...! I told ya
he d save us... Right?

00:16:09.204 --> 00:16:11.809
Whoever that is up there,
it s not Goku.

Huh?

00:16:13.112 --> 00:16:15.449
But he definitely
is a Super Saiyan

You re talented, boy...
Excellent work.

00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:58.002
[KING COLD] You Super Saiyans
far exceed my expectations

00:16:58.102 --> 00:16:59.839
You destroyed my son Frieza and

00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:02.343
appear none the worse for wear.

00:17:02.444 --> 00:17:03.547
[KING COLD]
If you re interested,

00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:05.985
I seem to find myself
short an heir...

00:17:06.085 --> 00:17:07.254
With your peerless strength,

00:17:07.354 --> 00:17:09.859
you d make a
worthy addition to my clan.

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.963

You d be a prince,

00:17:12.063 --> 00:17:14.334
and magnificent worlds
the universe over

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:16.973
would be at your disposal.

00:17:17.073 --> 00:17:19.277
Sounds pretty lame.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.054
You turn up your
nose at my offer...?

00:17:24.154 --> 00:17:25.524
That s a shame...

00:17:25.624 --> 00:17:28.897
By the way, stranger,
I m curious about your sword.

00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:31.503
It must be quite a
piece of workmanship.

00:17:31.603 --> 00:17:33.038
[KING COLD] Truly, for how
else could you have

00:17:33.138 --> 00:17:36.345
defeated my son with such ease?

00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:39.217
Might I... take a closer look?

00:17:41.154 --> 00:17:42.591
[KING COLD]
Come, now.

00:17:42.692 --> 00:17:46.164
You re not afraid to be without
it for a moment, are you?

00:18:10.413 --> 00:18:11.916
[KING COLD]
Just as I thought.

00:18:12.017 --> 00:18:15.023
This has been
forged by a master.

00:18:15.924 --> 00:18:18.796
I m thinking, perhaps
the only reason you defeated

00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:23.005
Frieza was because you
had this sword in hand.

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:25.275
That sound about right?

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:27.714
I don t know, you think so?

00:18:27.814 --> 00:18:29.217
Yes

00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:33.660
It all makes sense now

00:18:34.228 --> 00:18:35.663
[KING COLD]
Clearly

00:18:35.764 --> 00:18:38.770
Without this sword in your
possession... you re nothing.

00:18:56.238 --> 00:18:57.340
Well, you re wrong--

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.479

figured that one out.

I ll give you one
of my finest planets!

00:19:31.308 --> 00:19:34.615
No, wait! I ll give you an
entire solar system!

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.654

wicked ways! I give you my word!

going to touch down.

about three hours from now.

all from Frieza, right...?

to take us to Goku...

decent enough kid to me.

they met each other...?
