Don t be a coward!

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.812
Blast! This terrain is littered
with places to hide

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:56.620
Which means I m going to have
to flush him out into the open!

[GERO LAUGHS]

00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:36.252
He s become so

lost his eye for movement.

opportunity to strike.

[GERO THINKS] I still must
admit, I never calculated

00:04:51.717 --> 00:04:54.421
for this level of
power from Vegeta.

00:04:54.454 --> 00:04:57.862
What next...? Considering his
reputation for vigilance,

00:04:57.895 --> 00:05:02.438
the most logical move would
be to return to the laboratory.

00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:05.377
It is a step I would have
preferred to avoid,

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.349

forced my hand.

strength only to Vegeta.

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:54.014

be more than sufficient.

doesn t stand a chance.

It d be risky.

Besides, the machine s
not very precise.

I d land in the right place.

It s how we give our

You see, even if you
had stolen all of my energy,

but as long as they re on our
side, I guess I can t complain.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.756
Hurry up and send this piece of
junk to the scrap yard...!

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:45.062
Unless you d rather I
interfere and do it for you.

00:17:45.095 --> 00:17:47.634
No, he s all mine...
I m not in the habit of

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:50.674
giving bad guys second
chances like Goku is.

00:17:50.707 --> 00:17:53.145
I ll finish what I started!

00:17:55.718 --> 00:17:56.953
[KRILLIN]
Who s that?

00:17:56.986 --> 00:17:59.190
Hey...! He came back!

00:18:01.996 --> 00:18:03.733
Trunks is here?

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:07.174
[VEGETA THINKS]
What...? Trunks...?

00:18:07.207 --> 00:18:10.881
Did he just say Trunks?

00:18:10.914 --> 00:18:15.056
That s my son s name...
How can that be?

00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:17.895
Unless unless

00:18:17.928 --> 00:18:20.600
He s from the future!

00:18:25.511 --> 00:18:27.313
[TRUNKS THINKS]
He s different, too!

00:18:27.346 --> 00:18:30.120
[GERO THINKS] Now there s
another one! Who is he?

00:18:30.153 --> 00:18:31.622
Where did he come from?

00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:35.462
I don t have any information
on him in the database!

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.603
[GERO THINKS]
In any case

00:18:38.637 --> 00:18:41.609
I ve clearly made some
terrible miscalculations

00:18:41.643 --> 00:18:45.216
It seems I now have only
one option remaining...

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:47.921
I must return to the laboratory!

00:18:49.992 --> 00:18:53.298
Is... this the Android
you ve been fighting with...?

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:56.038
I don t get it. He s not one
of the Androids from my time!

00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.240
Wait, what?

00:18:57.273 --> 00:18:58.408
[VEGETA] If this isn t one
of the Androids

00:18:58.442 --> 00:19:01.314
you warned us about,
then what is it?!

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:04.254
I wish I knew
the answer to that.

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:07.427
So... Who ve we been battling?

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.834
Wait... What did he say...?
Who is this guy?

00:19:10.868 --> 00:19:13.238
What s... going on?

00:19:25.162 --> 00:19:26.464
Hey... You see that...?

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.803
I wonder who made that big
crater over there.

00:19:28.837 --> 00:19:31.575
Look... I think I see people
just beyond those rocks...!

00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:34.782
It must be them...
Only a little more to go!

00:19:34.816 --> 00:19:37.353
What? Are you nuts...?
Stay away from there!

00:19:37.386 --> 00:19:39.423
[BULMA]
Would you please just calm down?

00:19:39.457 --> 00:19:42.196
I m sure the
battle s over by now.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.600
If you take us any closer

00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:46.238
I m chucking this kid out
the window, you got that?

00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:50.313
Ah...Go right ahead
but Vegeta won t like it

00:19:50.346 --> 00:19:53.553
I did tell you, didn t I...?
He s the father.

00:19:54.454 --> 00:19:56.860
He s... Vegeta s... son?

00:19:56.893 --> 00:19:58.195
This little brat guy--

00:19:58.228 --> 00:20:00.934
I mean, this handsome baby
is you and Vegeta s kid?

00:20:00.968 --> 00:20:03.372
Awesome Then let s hurry!

00:20:03.405 --> 00:20:05.276
[BULMA]
I thought you d say that.

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:08.115
No Nonsense!

00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:10.253
There s no denying this
thing is an Android...!

00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:12.924
[VEGETA] You think that s
just a coincidence?!

00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:14.762
Why does it matter if they don t

00:20:14.795 --> 00:20:16.431
look like the Androids
of the future...?

00:20:16.464 --> 00:20:18.870
Oh sure, we may have
changed history a little

00:20:18.903 --> 00:20:20.473
but what s the big deal?

00:20:20.507 --> 00:20:21.976
[KRILLIN] The whole
point of this battle

00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:25.349
was to change the future, maybe
this is one of the changes!

00:20:25.382 --> 00:20:27.587
[TIEN]
I hope you re right.

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.564
[GERO THINKS]
Now what to do.

00:20:32.597 --> 00:20:34.367
I have to get to
the laboratory...

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.473
but if I fly, they ll almost
certainly catch up to me.

00:20:37.507 --> 00:20:41.582
I ll just have to go on foot and
keep hidden among the rocks.

00:20:44.287 --> 00:20:47.259
Hey, Gohan Am I crazy,
or is that Bulma?

00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:52.370
Yoo-hoo!

00:20:52.403 --> 00:20:54.407
Bulma, look...! There he is!

00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:57.313
The Android! I thought
they d have it beat by now!

00:20:57.346 --> 00:20:58.550
Doctor Gero?

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:01.655
It s too dangerous...!
Stay away from here!

00:21:01.689 --> 00:21:02.891
That s it!

00:21:02.924 --> 00:21:04.461
I was speaking the truth when

00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:06.398
I said you had no
chance of winning!

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:09.003
The moment I m gone,
Numbers 17 and 18

00:21:09.037 --> 00:21:10.673
will be here to avenge me!

00:21:10.707 --> 00:21:11.542
Number 17?

00:21:11.576 --> 00:21:13.278
Number 18?

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:17.687
[GERO LAUGHS]

00:21:21.194 --> 00:21:23.398
