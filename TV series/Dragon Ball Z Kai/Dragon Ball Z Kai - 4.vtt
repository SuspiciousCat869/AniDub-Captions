[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:06.847
Piccolo and Goku joined forces

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:09.118
to defeat the Saiyan
warrior Raditz.

00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:11.155
But their victory
was short-lived.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.797
Already, a new threat to the
Earth is fast-approaching...

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.133
And unless
some way to counter

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.403
the coming Saiyan
invasion can be found,

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:21.978
Goku's sacrifice
will have been in vain.

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:25.551
The preparations begin, now.

"Run in the Afterlife, Goku!

The One Million
Mile Snake Way!"

00:02:06.452 --> 00:02:07.922
[CHI-CHI]
I bet Goku and the others

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:09.292
are having the time
of their lives

00:02:09.325 --> 00:02:12.699
over at Master Roshi's
right about now.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:17.007
I do hope Gohan's getting
along with everybody.

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:20.213
What am I thinking?
I worry too much.

00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:23.120
He's such a
well-behaved little boy.

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:24.455
[sighs]

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.760
I wish I could
have gone with them.

00:02:28.864 --> 00:02:30.935
[OX-KING] Gohan!

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.270
[chuckles]

00:02:32.304 --> 00:02:34.241
[CHI-CHI]
Dad, welcome back!

00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:35.511
[OX-KING laughs]

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:39.218
Hello Chi-Chi! I brought
a few things for Gohan.

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:41.991
Hey! Gohan,
Grandpa's here!

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:44.896
[OX-KING] Come out and see
all the new toys you have!

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.032
[grunting]

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.603
[laughs]

00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:49.171
Oh, Dad!

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.018
[KRILLIN]
Goku...! Goku...!

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:57.756
Please, you can't be dead!

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:58.490
[ROSHI] Goku...

00:02:58.524 --> 00:03:00.027
[KRILLIN] Come on, wake up!

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.296
He's gone...

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.268
I can't believe our
Goku is actually gone!

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:07.608
Goku...! Goku...!

00:03:13.554 --> 00:03:14.155
[gasps]

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:15.491
[ROSHI] He disappeared!

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:19.867
Hmm... Figures...
This is Kami's doing.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.469
[KRILLIN and ROSHI gasp]

00:03:21.503 --> 00:03:24.341
I can't think of anyone
else capable of such a thing.

00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:25.711
[PICCOLO] He's probably
come up with some sort of

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:28.450
meddling plan,
just like always...

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:29.987
[KRILLIN]
I wonder what he's up to.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.958
[ROSHI] Well,
if Goku isn't safe with

00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.227
the Guardian of Earth,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.296
he's not safe anywhere.

00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:40.608
All the same, we need
to start gathering up

00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:42.344
the other other six
Dragon Balls so we can

00:03:42.378 --> 00:03:45.050
wish Goku back
to life right away.

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:46.252
Yeah...

00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:47.522
But we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:48.891
And of course,
Yamcha's out

00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:50.695
running around
who knows where!

00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:53.399
Well, you're the one
who chased 'im off.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.105
Say that reminds me, I've
been curious about something.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.445
How did Goku's brother manage
to track him down so quickly?

00:03:59.478 --> 00:04:01.116
[PICCOLO] With that
device he's wearing...

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:03.219
Attached to his face...

00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:05.290
Apparently,
it reads "power levels"

00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:07.060
and tracks their location.

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:08.630
[BULMA] Huh...?

00:04:11.303 --> 00:04:12.238
Come here, Krillin.

00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:13.807
[KRILLIN] Yeah...

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:15.911
[KRILLIN] Hold this.

00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:21.924
Okay...

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:23.594
Now see if you can get that
thing off his face for me.

00:04:23.627 --> 00:04:24.462
Huh...?!

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:25.832
Yeah, sure, whatever...

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.904
but if he so much as
twitches, I'm out of here.

00:04:33.313 --> 00:04:36.921
[beeping]

00:04:36.954 --> 00:04:38.489
Hmm...

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.299
[beeping]

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.736
[BULMA]
Huh... Well that's good.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:47.374
It looks like it's still
got power, at least.

00:04:49.278 --> 00:04:51.149
Wow, this is some
cutting edge stuff!

00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:52.417
It's a little
banged up, but I think

00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:54.622
I may be able to do
something with it.

00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:57.461
You really think so...?
That's awesome, Bulma!

00:04:57.494 --> 00:04:59.398
Well, I haven't
actually fixed it yet.

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.069
I'll need some time
to figure it out first.

00:05:01.102 --> 00:05:03.508
But if I can get it working,
we can use it to find Yamcha,

00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:05.410
and Tien,
and all the others.

00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:07.782
[ROSHI] In any case, I think
we should head back home.

00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:08.984
You can work there.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.220
Yeah, right...

00:05:10.253 --> 00:05:11.790
I guess there's not much
else we can do here.

00:05:11.824 --> 00:05:13.927
'Kay... we'll get you guys
back to Roshi's place,

00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:16.366
then I'm gonna go start
looking for the Dragon Balls.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.037
What are your plans
in the meantime, Piccolo?

00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:20.074
[ALL gasp]

00:05:20.107 --> 00:05:21.877

[PICCOLO panting]

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.119
Just like
a lizard's tail!

00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:46.426
You should start looking for
the Dragon Balls immediately.

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:47.695
Wherever Goku is now,

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.535
he'll still need you to
wish him back to life.

00:05:50.568 --> 00:05:53.172
But... you can leave
Goku's son with me.

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:55.343
I'll be taking
him from here.

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:56.914
What are you going
to do with him?

00:05:56.947 --> 00:05:59.719
How powerful that boy becomes
depends almost entirely

00:05:59.753 --> 00:06:03.293
on whether or not he receives
the proper training.

00:06:03.326 --> 00:06:04.428
[PICCOLO] One year from now,

00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:06.767
two more Saiyans
will arrive on Earth.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.775
When that day comes,
we'll need him to be ready.

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:12.745
There is little time
and much to learn.

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:14.850
So for the next
year, he's with me.

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:16.953
Whoa, you're really
serious aren't you?

00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:19.826
A year, don't you need a
parent's signature for that?

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.097
[KRILLIN]
Yeah, a form or something...

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.499
Let's see... Goku's gone,

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:24.803
but I guess we
could ask Chi-Chi.

00:06:24.836 --> 00:06:27.742
Look! I don't have
time for this nonsense!

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:29.679
I'm not asking
for your permission!

00:06:29.713 --> 00:06:33.486
I'm taking the boy with me,
by force if I have to!

00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:36.058
Heh...

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:39.197
[gasps]

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.571
[ALL gasp]

00:06:45.444 --> 00:06:47.549
Once the year is up and
his training is complete

00:06:47.582 --> 00:06:50.153
I'll bring him back,
but not a day before.

00:06:50.186 --> 00:06:52.525
[PICCOLO] When you wish Goku
back to life, tell him he can

00:06:52.558 --> 00:06:55.965
look forward to seeing his
son again when we return.

00:07:01.843 --> 00:07:02.879
[exhale heavily]

00:07:02.913 --> 00:07:04.949
Whoa... This is bad...
Really bad, isn't it?

00:07:04.983 --> 00:07:06.018
Gohan's gonna die.

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:08.757
Or worse, he's gonna
turn out like Piccolo!

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.402
[KAMI] And that
is why this young man

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:16.238
stands before you today.

00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:18.611
To make this one request.

00:07:18.644 --> 00:07:21.015
All he asks
is to be trained.

00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:22.150
On his behalf,
I beg you

00:07:22.183 --> 00:07:26.025
to allow him to call upon
King Kai for guidance.

00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:27.595
[KING YEMMA] Hmm...

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:29.933
Goku, huh? I'm
looking at his file,

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:31.837
and it's certainly
impressive...

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.339
So let me
get this straight....

00:07:33.373 --> 00:07:34.776
even though this
friend of yours

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.278
is a shoe-in to
get into Heaven,

00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:37.849
he still wants to
risk Snake Way

00:07:37.882 --> 00:07:40.988
just to meet with
King Kai for training?

00:07:41.022 --> 00:07:42.390
[KAMI]
Yes, sir.

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:44.328
Hey... So this is the
place everybody comes

00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:45.731
when they die,
isn't it?

00:07:45.764 --> 00:07:46.867
[KAMI]
That's right.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.169
Aliens, too?

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:50.708
[KAMI]
Yes... Every living being,
human or not, comes here

00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:53.847
to be judged and learn where
they will spend their afterlife.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.718
Yo! Did a big
guy named Raditz

00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:57.989
show up here a little
bit before us?

00:07:58.023 --> 00:07:59.191
[KING YEMMA] Hmm...?

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:01.496
[KAMI] Goku! You do not
address King Yemma with a "yo"!

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.900
Yeah, I remember him.

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:06.105
Says here he was
your older brother.

00:08:06.138 --> 00:08:09.613
Now he's on his way
to Hell. Go figure...

00:08:09.646 --> 00:08:11.248
He give you any trouble?

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:12.852
[KING YEMMA]
He certainly did...

00:08:12.885 --> 00:08:14.054
Well, tried...

00:08:14.087 --> 00:08:17.260
But I knocked some sense
into him and he settled down.

00:08:17.294 --> 00:08:19.632
Wow! And Raditz was tough!

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.335
You must be really strong!

00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:23.206
[chuckles]

00:08:23.239 --> 00:08:24.809
Hey... Maybe I
oughta stick around

00:08:24.843 --> 00:08:26.279
and train with
the Big Guy!

00:08:26.312 --> 00:08:28.016
Shhh... Keep
your voice down!

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.955
You must show King Yemma
the proper respect!

00:08:30.989 --> 00:08:32.157
Oh...

00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:33.393
Just keep quiet...!

00:08:33.426 --> 00:08:36.131
Trust me, King Kai
is much stronger!

00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:37.267
[KING YEMMA] Hey...

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.206
What was that...
Kami of the Earth?

00:08:40.239 --> 00:08:41.409
What... ah...

00:08:41.442 --> 00:08:43.079
You shouldn't talk
that way about someone

00:08:43.113 --> 00:08:45.250
who can send you to Hell!

00:08:45.283 --> 00:08:46.854
Ahh...
You heard that?

00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:48.958
You must have the
devil's own ears, sir!

00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:51.964
The devil himself...!
Appropriate, huh?

00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:54.635
[laughs nervously]

00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:59.513
Huh... Kami, you think
you're funny, don't you?

00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:01.215
No...?

00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:05.257
Fine... If you want
it that badly...

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.993
take Snake Way to King Kai.

00:09:07.027 --> 00:09:10.433
Ahh... Thank you,
Your Greatness!

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:12.370
I'll summon
a guide for you.

00:09:12.403 --> 00:09:14.843
Just go right
outside and wait.

00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:16.278
Thanks!

00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:18.818
[KING YEMMA]
However...!

00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:20.688
If you fall
off of Snake Way,

00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:23.493
I don't want you to
come crying back to me.

00:09:23.527 --> 00:09:26.566
Uhh... Okay...

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:28.871
Goku. Have a
safe journey.

00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:31.175
This will be a most
challenging year for you.

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:33.012
Well... I'm not sure
what you mean by that,

00:09:33.045 --> 00:09:35.149
but if this King Kai is as
strong as you say he is,

00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:37.588
then I'm sure it'll
be worth the trip!

00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:42.397
See you soon! And say
hey to Mr. Popo for me!

00:09:42.431 --> 00:09:43.967
[chuckles]

00:09:45.404 --> 00:09:46.940
Bye!

00:09:49.244 --> 00:09:51.182
[KAMI] The Earth has drawn
the attention of some of

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.556
the most despicable beings
the universe has to offer.

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:55.958
If something isn't done soon,

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:58.597
we could find ourselves
in a lot of trouble.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:59.800
What can we do?

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.803
We could try to wish
our enemies away...

00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:03.974
But even the great Shenron
might be powerless

00:10:04.008 --> 00:10:05.778
against their
tremendous strength.

00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:08.584
Goku is the greatest warrior
the Earth has ever known,

00:10:08.618 --> 00:10:09.786
yet to these Saiyans

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:12.056
he's nothing more
than an inconvenience.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.729
I wonder if King Kai's
instruction will even help.

00:10:14.763 --> 00:10:19.004
Until Goku returns, it seems
Gohan is our best hope.

00:10:19.037 --> 00:10:21.643
He's young though...
and there's so little time.

00:10:21.677 --> 00:10:26.385
That's enough! Go home...!
I have work to do!

00:10:27.989 --> 00:10:28.858
[KAMI]
Forgive me, Your Greatness!

00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:30.193
Of course you're busy!

00:10:30.226 --> 00:10:32.831
I'll just be getting out
of your way now. Goodbye!

00:10:35.972 --> 00:10:37.541
Terribly sorry
for the wait...

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:39.077
But don't you worry,

00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:40.881
I'll get you to the head of the
Snake Way before you know it!

00:10:40.915 --> 00:10:42.451
You're in good
hands with me.

00:10:42.484 --> 00:10:44.021
Whoa...

00:10:44.054 --> 00:10:45.991
[GUIDE]
So Snake Way is very long
and extremely treacherous.

00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:48.296
What kind of shape
are you in? Good...?

00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:51.837
Me? No... I mean, I was
pretty healthy when I was alive.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.807
But I don't think
so now that I'm dead...

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.380
Hey... What's King Kai like?
You've met him before, right?

00:10:57.413 --> 00:10:59.118
Oh, sure...
Lots of times...

00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:01.288
He's surprisingly down to
Earth considering he rules

00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:05.430
over every other deity in
this region of the universe.

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:07.902
He must be strong!
I can't wait!

00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:30.179
[ROSHI] I don't suppose
we could get away with

00:11:30.212 --> 00:11:33.486
not telling
Chi-Chi about this.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.855
Krillin...!

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:37.160
Why don't you go over there
and break the bad news?

00:11:37.193 --> 00:11:37.896
She likes you.

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:41.669
Me...? Why do
I have to go?

00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:43.473
I just hope she's
familiar with the phrase

00:11:43.507 --> 00:11:44.976
"don't kill
the messenger."

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:46.145
[gulps]

00:11:46.179 --> 00:11:47.881
[chuckles nervously]

00:11:48.148 --> 00:11:51.121
[GOKU snoring]

00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:53.794
[GUIDE]
Here we are! Snake Way.

00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:57.000
Exit to your left.
Watch your step.

00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.369
Huh...?

00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:04.549
[GOKU] Whoa! So this
is Snake Way, huh?

00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:06.786
[GUIDE]
Yes indeed...

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.927
What am I supposed to do now?

00:12:11.996 --> 00:12:13.466
[GUIDE]
Just start walking!

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:15.937
You'll want to take Snake Way
all the way to the very end.

00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:18.510
That's where
you'll find King Kai.

00:12:18.543 --> 00:12:21.115
Sure is long, huh?

00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:23.218
Yes... In fact,
according to legend,

00:12:23.252 --> 00:12:25.924
Snake Way is about a million
miles from end to end.

00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.129
A million miles...?!

00:12:28.163 --> 00:12:30.366
Has anyone ever made
it the whole way?

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:33.005
Only one in the last
hundred million years...

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:34.542
It was the Great
King Yemma himself,

00:12:34.575 --> 00:12:36.547
if my memory
serves me... Yes...

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.184
The big guy from before...?

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:41.121
Well... I guess if
there's one person

00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:42.658
who's already made it
all the way to the end,

00:12:42.691 --> 00:12:44.762
then I might be
able to manage it, too.

00:12:44.795 --> 00:12:46.198
[GUIDE]
It's possible.

00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:48.737
But please be careful not to
fall off into the clouds.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.139
Hell lies beneath
those clouds,

00:12:50.172 --> 00:12:52.645
and once you go there,
you can never come back.

00:12:52.678 --> 00:12:54.682
Really. Wow.

00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:56.385
[GOKU] Oh, hey!
What do I eat?!

00:12:56.419 --> 00:12:58.857
Maybe I should'a packed
a lunch or something.

00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:00.293
[GUIDE] Oh, I'm
sure you'll be fine.

00:13:00.326 --> 00:13:02.297
Think of it this way:
You're already dead,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.205
so the chances of you dying of
starvation are slim at best.

00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:07.541
[GOKU] Oh yeah!

00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:09.210
Bye!

00:13:09.244 --> 00:13:10.881
[GOKU]
Wait, I almost forgot!

00:13:10.914 --> 00:13:12.651
I've got a favor to ask you.

00:13:12.685 --> 00:13:13.954
Yes?

00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:16.626
Well... Do you know
who Fortuneteller Baba is?

00:13:16.659 --> 00:13:17.862
[GUIDE] Yes, sir.

00:13:17.895 --> 00:13:19.498
She comes by to say
hello once in a while.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:20.734
Okay, great...!

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.237
Think you could tell her
something for me...?

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.174
Tell her I need her to
go see Master Roshi

00:13:24.207 --> 00:13:25.844
and give him an
important message.

00:13:25.877 --> 00:13:27.615
I want him to know that
whatever happens...

00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:29.552
he can't bring me
back for a year...

00:13:29.585 --> 00:13:31.021
Let's see if
I have all this...

00:13:31.055 --> 00:13:34.562
Don't... bring Goku
back to life...

00:13:34.595 --> 00:13:36.498
You said
Master Roshi, right?

00:13:37.969 --> 00:13:39.639
I guess
I should get started.

00:13:39.673 --> 00:13:41.576
[spitting]

00:13:41.609 --> 00:13:44.749
So the only real trick is to
not fall off the snake, right?

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:46.787
Right...
That would be bad.

00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:49.892
That'll be a breeze!
Woo hoo!

00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:01.850
I'm sorry, ma'am...

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:06.324
But... your husband,
Goku... is dead... Sorry.

00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:11.034
Not bad, but it might
be a little blunt...

00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:13.205
I'm sorry, but I
have terrible news.

00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:15.076
I... I hate to have
to tell you this,

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.248
but Goku has gone
to his eternal rest.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:22.625
Then again... he is
coming back to life...

00:14:22.658 --> 00:14:24.629
That's it! Say it
with a smile...!

00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:25.897
Goku is dead,

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:27.233
but he is coming back
to life pretty soon...

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:29.338
so you don't have
to worry about it... Okay?

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:32.711
[laughs nervously]

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:34.314
Hi, Krillin!

00:14:34.347 --> 00:14:35.149
Chi-Chi! Hi!

00:14:35.183 --> 00:14:36.519
Isn't it a
lovely afternoon?

00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:39.258
I knew I heard somebody
mumbling to themselves.

00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:40.226
What's wrong?

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.429
Wrong...? Why would
anything be wrong?

00:14:41.462 --> 00:14:42.196
Well, something is...

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.134
but it'll be fine soon...

00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:45.436
Hmm...?

00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:48.510
Hey, Krillin...!
How's things...? Good?

00:14:48.543 --> 00:14:50.412
Yes, sir. I'm okay...

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:52.316
Thank you. It's nice
of you to ask.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.223
I figured you'd still be
with Goku. Everyone alright?

00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:57.595
See... about that...
Thing is...

00:14:57.628 --> 00:15:00.601
Goku's kinda... d-d...

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:01.737
What?

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.441
Goku's... d... d... d...

00:15:04.474 --> 00:15:05.343
D...?

00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:06.512
Go on...

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:10.453
D... "Don't worry about me,"
he says... He's fine!

00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:11.623
[laughs nervously]

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:15.865
He's fine? Really...
He's gonna be late, right?

00:15:15.898 --> 00:15:17.300
He sure is! That's it!

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:20.273
But, actually... he...
won't be coming back.

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:22.044
Goku said he
isn't coming back?

00:15:22.077 --> 00:15:24.682
No...! Well, yes, he
will be back real soon.

00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:26.653
Well? Is Goku coming
back home or not?

00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:28.524
Start making sense!

00:15:28.557 --> 00:15:30.059
Wha...

00:15:30.093 --> 00:15:32.865
Now, now... Why don't
we all step inside?

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:33.800
Come on, I'm sure you're

00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:35.504
dying to get
off your feet.

00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:37.406
[sighs]

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:48.162
Alright... I've let you
sleep long enough, kid.

00:15:48.196 --> 00:15:51.268
Now wake up! It's time
to start your training.

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:54.708
[grunts]

00:16:00.988 --> 00:16:01.989
[yells]

00:16:02.023 --> 00:16:04.194
[coughing]

00:16:04.227 --> 00:16:05.463
[PICCOLO]
We have to talk.

00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:07.200
Get out of the water.

00:16:09.572 --> 00:16:10.574
[gasps]

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:13.580
You're not my daddy!
Where are you, Daddy?

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:20.728
[GOHAN]Daddy! Daddy,
come here! I'm scared, Daddy!

00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:23.667
Aaahhh! Daddy...!

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.805
Where are you?!

00:16:25.838 --> 00:16:27.774
Spoiled little brat...!

00:16:29.077 --> 00:16:30.781
We don't have time for this!

00:16:30.814 --> 00:16:36.024
[crying]

00:16:38.162 --> 00:16:40.768
Shut up...! If you don't
stop that crying,

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:42.704
I'll snap you in half!

00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:44.407
Now listen up...

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.582
I'm only going
to say this once.

00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:50.788
First... your "Daddy"
was killed today.

00:16:50.821 --> 00:16:52.256
Huh...?

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.261
[PICCOLO] You remember some
of what happened, don't you?

00:16:54.294 --> 00:16:57.200
In order to defeat
the man who took you,

00:16:57.233 --> 00:17:00.272
Your father
sacrificed himself.

00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:04.080
[RADITZ groans]

00:17:04.114 --> 00:17:08.388
[GOKU] Quick! Your attack!
Do it! Do it now!

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:17.440
[GOKU] Do it!

00:17:17.473 --> 00:17:19.010
[PICCOLO] Right!

00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:21.950
Makankosappo!

00:17:21.983 --> 00:17:23.386
[grunts]

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:24.722
[yells]

00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:29.765
[RADITZ screams]

00:17:36.145 --> 00:17:38.282
No... He can't be...

00:17:38.315 --> 00:17:39.952
Stop...!
Stop, right now...!

00:17:39.986 --> 00:17:43.225
I already warned you what
would happen if you cried again!

00:17:45.329 --> 00:17:46.700
Heh...

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:47.935
Now I'm sure your father

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:50.273
already told you about the
Dragon Balls at some point.

00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:52.477
His friends are currently
trying to gather all seven

00:17:52.512 --> 00:17:55.183
in the hopes of bringing
him back to life.

00:17:55.216 --> 00:17:58.022
[PICCOLO] However, that is
their mission; not ours...

00:17:58.055 --> 00:17:59.257
Your father
and I were able

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.662
to defeat the man
who kidnapped you.

00:18:01.696 --> 00:18:02.998
But before he died,

00:18:03.032 --> 00:18:06.205
he alerted two other Saiyans who
will reach Earth in one year.

00:18:06.238 --> 00:18:07.508
And we have
reason to believe

00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:09.478
they are even
stronger than he was.

00:18:09.512 --> 00:18:12.483
[PICCOLO] If that's true,
even Goku can't stop them.

00:18:12.518 --> 00:18:15.222
Not even if I
were to help him...

00:18:15.256 --> 00:18:16.491
But if you can be trained,

00:18:16.525 --> 00:18:19.097
your strength may give
us the edge we need.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.505
But... I don't...!
I couldn't...! I'm too little.

00:18:22.538 --> 00:18:24.174
I don't even
know how to fight!

00:18:24.207 --> 00:18:25.442
That's enough...

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:27.113
I can see that you're
blind to your potential.

00:18:27.146 --> 00:18:28.282
Though you may not believe it,

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.452
you are incredibly strong.

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:32.323
But you're still
in need of training.

00:18:32.356 --> 00:18:35.263
And so it's my job to help
you find that strength.

00:18:35.296 --> 00:18:38.603
But I can't. I'm not
as strong as you think!

00:18:38.637 --> 00:18:39.772
[chuckles]

00:18:39.805 --> 00:18:41.408
You want me to prove it?

00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:42.878
[yells]

00:18:42.912 --> 00:18:44.247
[GOHAN] Hey, hey...

00:18:44.281 --> 00:18:45.216
--[PICCOLO] Okay...
--[GOHAN] What are you doing?!

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:46.685
[GOHAN] Stop it!
Put me down!

00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:52.531
Lemme go! Lemme go! Lemme go!
Daddy! Somebody! Help me!

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:53.767
[GOHAN cries]

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.607
[GOHAN yells]

00:18:57.641 --> 00:18:59.912
[PICCOLO] Do it!
Release your power!

00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:01.850
Let's see what you've got!

00:19:01.883 --> 00:19:05.289
[yells]

00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:06.759
Huh...?

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:15.877
[explosion]

00:19:24.094 --> 00:19:26.297
What the...?!
How did he...?

00:19:33.913 --> 00:19:35.383
[PICCOLO]
Unbelievable...!

00:19:35.416 --> 00:19:38.388
He's more powerful than
I could've imagined!

00:19:44.535 --> 00:19:46.506
[PICCOLO] I'm not sure
how I feel about this.

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:48.241
To think I'm about
to train the child

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:50.747
who's likely to become
my greatest adversary.

00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:52.785
I must be losing my mind.

00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:54.354
[GOHAN] W-Wait...

00:19:54.387 --> 00:19:56.358
I didn't do that, did I?

00:19:56.391 --> 00:19:57.459
[PICCOLO] That's right.

00:19:57.493 --> 00:19:59.599
It's time you
realized your power.

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:02.705
It appears your strength is
closely linked to your emotions.

00:20:02.738 --> 00:20:05.644
You can't maintain it.
Which isn't very convenient...

00:20:05.677 --> 00:20:07.113
We'll never
defeat the Saiyans

00:20:07.147 --> 00:20:09.786
unless we correct it.
And of course, we will.

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:10.754
Huh...?

00:20:10.788 --> 00:20:12.257
[PICCOLO]
We're going to turn you into

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.029
the greatest warrior
this world has ever known.

00:20:15.063 --> 00:20:16.298
Got that?

00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:18.636
Yes, sir. It's just...

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.406
I don't wanna
learn how to fight.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.145
'Cause... I wanna study
hard and be a scholar.

00:20:23.178 --> 00:20:23.980
Heh...

00:20:24.013 --> 00:20:25.316
Maybe you will...

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:26.785
But you'll have
plenty of time for

00:20:26.819 --> 00:20:30.125
scholarly things once we're
done defeating the Saiyans.

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:31.629
We only have a
year to prepare you

00:20:31.662 --> 00:20:33.331
to defend
the planet with us.

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:36.105
You don't want everyone
on Earth to die, do you?

00:20:36.138 --> 00:20:38.175
No, but... I'm scared.

00:20:38.208 --> 00:20:39.512
Stop your whining!

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:42.316
Unless you want me
to kill you right now!

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.322
We don't have time for this!
Your training has begun!

00:20:45.355 --> 00:20:47.627
Shut up and
take off your tunic!

00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:52.436
Fine... I'll do it...
But just 'til Daddy's back,

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:56.444
then I want him to teach
me to fight instead of you.

00:20:56.478 --> 00:20:58.983
Ha! That's too bad.

00:20:59.017 --> 00:21:00.319
Your dad may be powerful,

00:21:00.352 --> 00:21:02.858
but I doubt he'd be
an effective teacher.

00:21:02.892 --> 00:21:06.197
He doesn't have any gift
for commanding respect.

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:07.467
Which is why his
son turned out to be

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.103
such a snot-nosed brat.

00:21:09.137 --> 00:21:10.673
[sneezes]

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:13.478
Huh...?

00:21:14.047 --> 00:21:16.050
[yells]

00:21:16.084 --> 00:21:17.821
[panting]

00:21:17.855 --> 00:21:20.793
Oh, man...! That really
took a lot out of me.

00:21:20.827 --> 00:21:22.598
Guess I'll just have
to go on foot...

00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:24.802
[NARRATOR] And so, as his
son prepares to face

00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:27.373
Piccolo's rigorous
training back on Earth,

00:21:27.407 --> 00:21:29.545
Goku has begun his
own perilous journey

00:21:29.578 --> 00:21:31.549
to reach the end of Snake Way!

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:34.821
The race is on...
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:21:35.423 --> 00:21:45.409
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:21:45.443 --> 00:21:55.429

[GOKU]
Hey, it's me, Goku!

00:22:39.351 --> 00:22:41.321
I wonder how my boy,
Gohan, is doing.

00:22:41.354 --> 00:22:43.593
[GOHAN]
Daddy! I miss you so much!

00:22:43.627 --> 00:22:45.429
Hey, is that a full moon?

00:22:45.462 --> 00:22:48.703
I've never seen
one before. It's pretty!

00:22:48.737 --> 00:22:51.041
[PICCOLO] No! It's just
as Goku's brother said!

00:22:51.074 --> 00:22:54.281
If the kid transforms the same
way the other Saiyans do...

00:22:54.314 --> 00:22:56.485
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:56.519 --> 00:22:59.925
"Wilderness Survival!
A Moonlit Night Awakens Gohan!"

00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:04.100
[GOHAN] Look at the moon!
It's so big and round!
