00:15:31.696 --> 00:15:35.169
Since when does the champion
of the world run from a fight?

00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:37.709
[CARONI] So... this means
we're staying...? Really?!

00:15:37.742 --> 00:15:38.911
[HERCULE]
That's right...!

00:15:38.944 --> 00:15:40.280
Just as soon as I've
gone to the hospital

00:15:40.313 --> 00:15:43.385
and had this nasty
stomach thing taken care of.

00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:44.321
[ALL]
Uhh...

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:48.028
[HERCULE] All right...!
Hospital, I go!

00:15:48.062 --> 00:15:48.830
[A16]
W-Wait...

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:50.099
[HERCULE]
Huh...?

00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:02.090
[A16]
Over here...

00:16:02.123 --> 00:16:03.358
[ANNOUNCER]
Huh...?

00:16:10.106 --> 00:16:11.107
[A16]
Please help me.

00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:13.078
[ALL]
Aaah!!

00:16:13.112 --> 00:16:16.786
[A16] Before you go, please
carry what is left of me

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.322
to the boy,
I must speak with him.

00:16:18.356 --> 00:16:20.059
[ANNOUNCER]
How're you talking...?!

00:16:20.092 --> 00:16:21.462
You're a head!

00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:26.038
[A16] Please... do it...
for the... sake of the planet.

00:16:26.071 --> 00:16:27.406
[HERCULE] Have you
lost your mind?!

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.681
Cell is standing right
next to that kid! Forget it!

00:16:30.714 --> 00:16:31.916
[ANNOUNCER]
Yes, agreed...!

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.452
No sane person
would just willingly

00:16:33.486 --> 00:16:35.557
throw themselves into
harm's way like that!

00:16:36.157 --> 00:16:37.527
[A16] You claim
to wear the title

00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:40.466
of the World's
Greatest Champion...

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.603
Please...

00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:43.774
It is still not too late
for you to play the part.

00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:45.176
[ANNOUNCER] Everyone
knows Hercule here

00:16:45.209 --> 00:16:47.146
is the greatest
human fighter alive...!

00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:48.282
But fighting
robots and monsters

00:16:48.315 --> 00:16:50.921
is not in the
Champ's job description!

00:16:50.955 --> 00:16:52.123
[HERCULE]
What did you say...?!

00:16:52.156 --> 00:16:53.527
The Champ's not
scared of nobody!

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.465
Man, metal, or monster,
I'll take 'em all on!

00:16:56.498 --> 00:16:59.037
After I get back
from the hospital.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.343
[A16] Be a...
champion...

00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:08.156
[PIIZA] Let's just
go already, Hercule!

00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:10.393
Those party-crashers
aren't your probem!

00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:11.461
Come on!

00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:13.466
[PIROZHKI] She's right!
What're we waiting for?!

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:15.570
[CARONI] Yes--and don't
forget your stomach!

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:20.346
[ANNOUNCER]
It's now or never...!

00:17:24.487 --> 00:17:27.360
[HERCULE] Fine...!
Let's do it, Head!

00:17:37.948 --> 00:17:41.021
[HERCULE] If I run now I'm a
world champion laughing stalk.

00:17:41.388 --> 00:17:43.392
[ANNOUNCER]
You are so brave...

00:17:43.426 --> 00:17:44.996
[HERCULE] I...
just have to get you

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:46.365
close to the kid,
you said, right?

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:48.335
[A16] Close...
Correct.

00:17:57.086 --> 00:17:58.556
[HERCULE] You made
it sound so easy?!

00:17:58.589 --> 00:18:01.161
[A16] Throw me to him,
once you are within range.

00:18:01.194 --> 00:18:04.233
[HERCULE] Oh,
I will! Trust me!

00:18:06.706 --> 00:18:09.243
[GOHAN]
No...! Stop!

00:18:12.718 --> 00:18:17.026
[GOHAN] Please, I'm
begging you to stop this...!

00:18:17.059 --> 00:18:18.663
[CELL]
Heh heh heh...

00:18:18.696 --> 00:18:21.902
<i>[CELL] One last push should
send him over the edge.</i>

00:18:21.936 --> 00:18:23.238
[CELL] Heed me,
my little ones!

00:18:23.272 --> 00:18:24.542
You've had your play-time.

00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:27.581
Now dispose of
these week fools!

00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:29.552
[GOHAN]
Aaaaahhh!!

00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:38.268
Grrrrr!!

00:18:38.302 --> 00:18:40.373
<i>[CELL] Just a
little more, now...</i>

00:18:40.406 --> 00:18:42.511
<i>You're almost there...</i>

00:18:43.311 --> 00:18:46.719
[CELL] Do it...!
Make them suffer!

00:18:46.753 --> 00:18:49.558
[HERCULE] All right...
here goes nothing...!

00:18:56.438 --> 00:18:59.779
[GOHAN] Huh...?
Android 16...?

00:18:59.812 --> 00:19:03.285
[HERCULE] That's no good!
I threw him too hard!

00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:08.295
[A16] Gohan...
listen to me...

00:19:09.263 --> 00:19:11.167
[A16] There
are some foes...

00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:13.873
who cannot be
reasoned with...

00:19:13.907 --> 00:19:19.184
You are allowed... to fight
on the side of justice.

00:19:19.217 --> 00:19:21.288
Seize upon your anger...

00:19:21.322 --> 00:19:23.292
Wield it like a weapon...

00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:25.864
I understand
your reluctance...

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:28.503
but holding it
in is pointless.

00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:35.551
[CELL] That's
sound advice.

00:19:35.584 --> 00:19:39.324
Better than I expected
from an appliance.

00:19:39.357 --> 00:19:42.497
But I'd rather tear
the rage out of him.

00:19:43.232 --> 00:19:47.775
[A16] Gohan... I...
loved the animals...

00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:49.945
and everything about nature.

00:19:50.948 --> 00:19:53.719
Protect them for me...

00:19:54.922 --> 00:19:56.559
[A16]
They need you.

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:02.604

00:20:18.903 --> 00:20:22.644

[PICCOLO]
Gohan...?!

00:21:23.432 --> 00:21:26.572
[NARRATOR] Finally, pushed to
his breaking point by Cell,

00:21:26.606 --> 00:21:30.079
Gohan lets his
anger boil over,

00:21:30.112 --> 00:21:32.551
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!
