[Narrator]
Last Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.745
As Goku continued
his intense training,

00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:08.550
Krillin, Gohan, and Bulma
reclaimed a Dragon Ball

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:12.425
from Vegeta, enraging the
ruthless Saiyan in the process.

00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:15.097
Meanwhile, Frieza's
special reinforcements

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:17.234
closed in on Planet Namek.

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:18.771
[Frieza] Vegeta
may be able to run...

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:21.242
but once the Ginyu Force brings
their cutting-edge scouters,

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:24.448
try though he might,
he can't hide...

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:36.573
â™ª Opening Song â™ª

00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:08.558
[Gohan sighs]

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:09.993
It feels like we've
been flying forever...

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.431
How much farther
do we have to go?

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:14.536
Well... I'd say we're
just about halfway there...

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:16.139
The Grand Elder's
not doing well.

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:17.809
I sure hope he can hold out.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.382
[Killin] Only
one thing to do...

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:22.518
We're going
to have to risk

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:23.821
picking up the
pace quite a bit...

00:02:23.888 --> 00:02:25.424
I think we're far enough
out now that Vegeta may

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.996
not notice the spike
in our power levels.

00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:29.365
I say we go for it...

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:31.236
He'll have his hands full
once my Dad gets here,

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:32.840
which should be really soon.

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.075
That settles it, then.

00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:35.645
Let's ratchet our
self up to full power!

00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:37.347
Yeah!

00:02:39.084 --> 00:02:40.320
At this rate
we ought to reach

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:42.692
the Grand Elder's place
in about an hour or so.

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:45.296
[laughs]

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.378
[Vegeta] There they are...!

00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:53.881
Must be at full power...

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:57.321
Kakarot's brat and the bald
pipsqueak; I can sense them.

00:02:57.388 --> 00:02:59.727
But, then... Why aren't
they heading towards me?

00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:01.597
With their radar,
they can easily pinpoint

00:03:01.664 --> 00:03:03.667
the Dragon Balls
in my possession.

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:05.571
I don't know what sort
of game they're playing...

00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:07.141
But this may be my only chance

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.045
at wringing the last
Dragon Ball out of them;

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:11.583
I can't let it slip
through my fingers.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.888
I think I'll take
this one with me...

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:15.290
Just in case their lady friend

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:17.629
is lurking about to take
the others while I'm away...

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:19.933
This way she
won't get all seven.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.402
Ha!

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.574
Nobody plays
Vegeta for a fool...!

00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:26.914
Nobody...! You're about
to learn that the hard way!

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.986
[cackles]
Muwahahahaha!

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:46.252
Nine thousand nine hundred
and ninety-nine... Ten thousand.

00:03:49.993 --> 00:03:52.430
[Goku sighs]

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:58.677
[hmms]

00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:01.015
Hey...! How about that?
I don't feel worn out...!

00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:03.954
You'd think there'd be a
little soreness or something...

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:06.492
Still. I think that should
just about do it for training...

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.198
Time to save up my
strength with a little R &amp; R.

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:10.502
[giggles]

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.706
I probably ought to
let my body re-adjust

00:04:12.772 --> 00:04:14.976
to normal gravity
while I'm at it, too.

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:22.892
[humming]

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:26.365
[surprise]
Whooa...

00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:41.997
[Machine shutting down sounds]

00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:43.667
[sighs]

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:54.689
[crunch]

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.680
[laughs] Hahahahaha!!
I don't believe this!

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:09.586
Normal gravity is a piece of
cake...! This is awesome...!

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:11.623
I mean it feels
like I've barely got

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.827
both feet on the
ground I'm so light!

00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:14.863
[giggling]

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:16.634
I'm as light as a
feather...! Woo-hoo...!

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.304
I'm as weightless as a jellyfish
swimming in the ocean!

00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:20.407
[giggling]

00:05:20.473 --> 00:05:22.477
And the best part is...

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:25.918
I'm not only light, I'm
as solid as a brick wall!

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:27.154
[Goku hmms]
Hmmmmm...

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.593
I bet my body could withstand
a nine-times Kaio-ken...

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.397
Heck, maybe even
a ten-times Kaio-ken!

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:35.704
[Sniffs]

00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:39.713
[Giggle]

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:40.347
[Click]

00:05:40.414 --> 00:05:42.484
[Goku] Ahhhh....

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:44.589
We don't want the bad guys
being able to smell me

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:46.560
before they can see me, right?

00:05:46.626 --> 00:05:47.361
[Giggle]

00:05:47.427 --> 00:05:48.964
Bombs away!

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:52.973
That was relaxing... Ah...

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.208
What I've got to do now

00:05:54.274 --> 00:05:56.547
is catch some shut-eye,
but before that...

00:05:56.614 --> 00:06:00.721
A little refreshment...
Let's see now...

00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:02.892
Ahhaaaa!!

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:04.897
Oh, wait... That's
not gonna work...

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:07.869
It's way too bitter...
Ah, there we go...

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:10.708
Bulma's Dad's own specially
formulated sports drink...

00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:13.647
This ought to really
hit the spot... Oh yeah!

00:06:13.714 --> 00:06:22.932
[Goku snoring]
Hgggnnnhhhh...

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:25.671
[Narrator] Sleeping like a
baby, Goku had yet to realize

00:06:25.738 --> 00:06:28.443
that his brutal training at
one-hundred-times gravity

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.315
had increased his strength
to an unprecedented level,

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:34.555
far exceeding the normal
Saiyan capabilities.

00:06:46.278 --> 00:06:47.381
Hang in there, Gohan...

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:49.151
The Grand Elder's
place is up ahead;

00:06:49.218 --> 00:06:50.220
we'll be there soon.

00:06:50.286 --> 00:06:51.890
Right!

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.228
[thinking]
As strong as Gohan'll be

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:55.831
once the Grand Elder
boosts his powers,

00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:59.071
this whole plan might still just
be wishful thinking on my part.

00:06:59.138 --> 00:07:02.578
I'm not sure anyone can
take on Vegeta alone.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.926
The guy's a monster.

00:07:09.993 --> 00:07:13.065
It's like there's no ceiling
on how powerful he can get.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.674
Even with Gohan
at full capacity,

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.209
the smartest
thing we could do

00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:21.215
after seeing the Grand Elder
is wait for Goku to get here.

00:07:34.977 --> 00:07:39.217
[thinking] That's right, vermin.
I'm right on top of you now!

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.236
Gohan, it's straight ahead!

00:07:48.303 --> 00:07:49.606
Huh?

00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:50.808
You see it...? That
strange-looking mountain...

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:52.712
That's what we're headed for!

00:07:57.054 --> 00:07:57.922
[laughs]
Hahaha...

00:07:57.989 --> 00:07:59.892
Looks like we're
in the home stretch!

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:02.832
No, wait!

00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:04.769
There's a huge power level
coming up right behind us!

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:12.150
[gasping]
It can't be!

00:08:12.217 --> 00:08:15.256
[gasping] Don't tell me...
That's Vegeta...!

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:23.073
Gohan... I'm going to try and
stall him as long as I can...

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:25.978
You go on ahead to
the Grand Elder's place.

00:08:26.045 --> 00:08:26.947
What are you...?

00:08:27.014 --> 00:08:28.984
Don't argue...!
Just go get stronger...!

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.061
[determinedly]
'Kay!

00:08:36.967 --> 00:08:40.239
[thinking] All right...
I'll just do whatever I can.

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:06.626
[thinking]
That speed...!

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:09.064
Hey.

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:12.505
I... I'm a little surprised you
risked trying to track us down.

00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:13.807
Then you're a fool...

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:16.411
I tend to thrives when
the stakes are high...

00:09:16.478 --> 00:09:18.149
Now, let's dispense
with the chat...

00:09:18.215 --> 00:09:19.886
I believe you have
something of mine that

00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:22.658
you'd be well advised to give
back if you value your life.

00:09:22.725 --> 00:09:25.063
Don't think I don't know.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.336
I have no idea what
you're talking about...

00:09:28.403 --> 00:09:29.639
Keep playing dumb...

00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:32.110
Let's see how far
you're willing to take it.

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.470
This is incredible.

00:09:45.537 --> 00:09:47.808
[laughs]
Muwahahaha!!

00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:54.120
What in the...?

00:09:57.862 --> 00:10:01.001
That mountain is where Kakarot's
son flew off to, isn't it...?

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:03.940
But there's more to it
than meets the eye...

00:10:04.007 --> 00:10:06.513
Is that where you've hidden
the ball you stole from me?

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.216
Uh... No, it's...

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:10.988
Ahhh! Damn it, wait!!!

00:10:12.123 --> 00:10:13.961
[coughing]

00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:15.698
[Grand Elder]
Such reserves of strength

00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:17.601
the child has locked within.

00:10:17.668 --> 00:10:20.173
You are an Earthling,
are you not?

00:10:20.239 --> 00:10:21.275
No disrespect, sir...

00:10:21.342 --> 00:10:23.914
But if you could hurry up,
that'd be great--

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.053
He has come, Grand Elder.

00:10:28.757 --> 00:10:30.126
[gasps]
Haaahh...

00:10:32.197 --> 00:10:34.769
What is this place
supposed to be?

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:39.010
Wait...! Don't go
in there! Vegeta!

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:47.561
Leave us.

00:10:47.628 --> 00:10:49.765
And what if I don't?

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:57.380
[gasping]

00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:12.711
[deep breath]

00:11:14.314 --> 00:11:16.418
[cries out]
Aaaaahhhh...

00:11:18.156 --> 00:11:21.896
[thinking] Yes! Gohan's power
level just seriously spiked!

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:25.637
I see... Kakarot himself
must be holed up in there...

00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:28.777
Then let today be the
day we settle our score!

00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:30.246
[angrily]
Come on out here!

00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:32.016
Fight me coward!

00:11:38.229 --> 00:11:39.832
What?!

00:11:57.901 --> 00:12:01.643
It... It's you...!
What the heck's going on...?

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.879
What were you up to in there?

00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:05.416
Why did your power
level suddenly shoot up?

00:12:05.483 --> 00:12:07.053
[laughs]
Heh heh heh...

00:12:15.738 --> 00:12:25.991
[laughing]
Ha... Ha... Hahahahahaha!!

00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:32.304
So... You think after
whatever trick you pulled

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.376
in there you're strong
enough to lock horns with me?

00:12:35.443 --> 00:12:37.113
[Vegeta] Really?

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.217
Trust me kid: you're
still light years away from

00:12:39.284 --> 00:12:42.223
being able to tangle with
someone who knows how to fight.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.770
Stepping up?

00:12:52.545 --> 00:12:56.653
[coughing]

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.922
Grand Elder, no!

00:12:57.989 --> 00:13:01.763
[Grand Elder sighs]
Hmmmmm... Dende...

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:03.066
Um, Yes?

00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:05.336
You.. You must go
outside and tell them...

00:13:05.403 --> 00:13:08.243
Tell them there's a great power
approaching Planet Namek...

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:10.747
the size of which
is truly staggering--

00:13:10.814 --> 00:13:11.950
[coughing]

00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:13.486
But what is it, sir?

00:13:13.554 --> 00:13:15.056
Hurry, child!

00:13:15.122 --> 00:13:16.526
Right!

00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:27.514
Wait...! Please...

00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:29.084
The Grand Elder says there's
something really, really

00:13:29.151 --> 00:13:31.255
powerful that's about
to land on the planet!

00:13:31.321 --> 00:13:32.224
Wha...?

00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:34.160
Grand Elder...?
Who in the hell is that?

00:13:34.227 --> 00:13:36.365
Hey...! He's right...!
I can totally sense it!

00:13:36.432 --> 00:13:38.704
Wow... He wasn't
kidding they are strong.

00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:40.206
Yeah.... And you know what...?

00:13:40.273 --> 00:13:42.512
We might be in luck, 'cause
who else can it be but Goku?

00:13:42.578 --> 00:13:44.180
What?!

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:48.757
Well... I don't know...

00:13:48.824 --> 00:13:51.028
I mean... It feels like
there's more than one.

00:13:51.094 --> 00:13:53.399
No, it... It can't...!

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:05.423
One... Two... Three...
Four, five...

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.728
It... It is them!

00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:10.635
Frieza summoned the Ginyu
Force to this ball of dirt...?!

00:14:10.701 --> 00:14:12.871
Damnit!

00:14:14.241 --> 00:14:16.445
Look... I don't have time
to play with you brats;

00:14:16.513 --> 00:14:17.848
hand over the Dragon Ball!

00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:20.521
No... I won't...!
You don't scare me!

00:14:20.587 --> 00:14:22.056
I'll make a deal with you...

00:14:22.123 --> 00:14:23.827
Give back the Dragon
Ball and I promise

00:14:23.894 --> 00:14:25.463
I won't lay a finger on
you or your friends...!

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.702
Things are about to turn
very ugly for all of us,

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:29.170
unless we act right now!

00:14:29.237 --> 00:14:32.311
[Krillin] As if we'd be dumb
enough to fall for that!

00:14:32.377 --> 00:14:34.014
You want us to take
your word for it...?

00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:36.451
Why should we trust
someone like you?

00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:40.126
All right, listen up...
I'll explain this once.

00:14:40.192 --> 00:14:41.461
Imagine someone as strong as

00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:43.499
I've become since
our first meeting..

00:14:43.566 --> 00:14:46.506
Wait, no... No...
Someone even stronger...

00:14:46.573 --> 00:14:49.546
Now imagine that there
are five of these monsters!

00:14:49.612 --> 00:14:51.014
[Vegeta]
Five with scouters

00:14:51.081 --> 00:14:52.684
that'll hone in on us from
halfway across the planet--

00:14:52.751 --> 00:14:53.954
and who aren't here
to make friends!

00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:56.124
You... You're just
making all this up!

00:14:56.191 --> 00:14:58.062
[Vegeta] Idiot! Can't
you sense their power?

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.366
This is the only
course open to us!

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:03.072
I'm telling you, our only hope
for beating the Ginyu Force

00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:05.109
is for me to become immortal!

00:15:05.176 --> 00:15:07.982
[Nail] He may actually
be telling the truth.

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:09.451
I can sense it...

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:12.089
Whoever they are, there are
five, and they're hostile.

00:15:20.507 --> 00:15:22.110
Damn it!

00:15:22.176 --> 00:15:25.115
Fine then... Why not
make Gohan immortal?

00:15:25.182 --> 00:15:27.253
Are you kidding? The boy
has no tactical experience!

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.895
We might as well appoint
a ladybug to defend us!

00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:33.867
If we do this... Then we...

00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:35.705
We'll waste the one
wish we came here for!

00:15:35.771 --> 00:15:37.007
You get more than one.

00:15:37.074 --> 00:15:39.444
The Dragon Balls
will grant you three.

00:15:43.486 --> 00:15:44.589
With two to spare...

00:15:44.656 --> 00:15:46.526
Surely you can all achieve
what you came here for.

00:15:46.593 --> 00:15:50.635
Wow, that... That kind
of changes everything.

00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:53.540
So... We get three...

00:15:53.606 --> 00:15:54.875
Grrrrr!!

00:15:54.942 --> 00:15:57.080
Oh, come on already!

00:15:57.147 --> 00:15:59.083
Great, so we get three
wishes instead of one...!

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.386
The longer you
stand there in awe,

00:16:00.453 --> 00:16:02.056
the less we time
we have to act!

00:16:02.123 --> 00:16:03.827
Wait, let's be
absolutely clear...

00:16:03.893 --> 00:16:05.196
The Dragon Balls here...

00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:07.635
They'll actually grant us
a total of three wishes?

00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:09.370
Indeed

00:16:11.576 --> 00:16:13.980
All right, then.

00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:15.918
C'mon... But you've
gotta keep your promise

00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:18.222
about never laying
a finger on us!

00:16:21.228 --> 00:16:23.131
[Gohan]
Hey, wait up!

00:16:25.537 --> 00:16:26.404
This is crazy!

00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:29.010
Don't dawdle!
Use your full power!

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.668
They've left, I take it?

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:41.869
[Nail]
Yes, Grand Elder.

00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:43.773
But even if their
strategy bears fruit

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.877
the odds are stacked
against them.

00:16:45.944 --> 00:16:47.548
You really think so?

00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:49.284
[Grand Elder]
Nail...

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.922
Your talents are better
used elsewhere...

00:16:51.989 --> 00:16:54.829
Go forth...
The earthlings need you.

00:16:54.895 --> 00:16:56.231
But, sir...

00:16:56.298 --> 00:16:58.202
[Grand Elder]
It's fine. You
needn't worry about me.

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:01.676
There's some life in this
decrepit body yet...

00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:10.292
[Nail]
As you wish, Grand Elder.

00:17:16.004 --> 00:17:20.012

And there they are,
precisely on schedule...

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:51.108
Theatrical as always...
Let the pageant begin.

00:17:51.174 --> 00:17:53.780
[laughing]
Nyahahahaha...

00:17:54.147 --> 00:17:57.253
How much futher?!
The Ginyu Force just landed!

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.792
[thinking] Keep your shirt on.
We're almost there.

00:18:05.136 --> 00:18:08.108
[breathes deeply]

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.554
[whining] Why do bad things
happen to good people?

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.655
Ahhhh!!

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:17.728
[angrily] This is
exactly what I mean! Hey!

00:18:17.794 --> 00:18:19.097
[Krillin]
Sorry, Bulma.

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:20.767
We had to stop by and pick
this up really quick.

00:18:21.736 --> 00:18:24.474
[Vegeta] Finally! Now
I take the lead. Come on!

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:30.754
Hold on a second! What are
you doing?! I said hold on!

00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:32.090
[Bulma]
Oh seriously!

00:18:32.156 --> 00:18:33.527
Somebody throw me a
bone for crying out loud!

00:18:33.594 --> 00:18:35.363
You can't just swoop
down and take off again

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.500
like I'm not good enough to know
what the plan is, you jerks!

00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:41.108
I won't be ignored! Arrgggg!!!

00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:43.278
Fine... Be that way...

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:49.525
What the...? Either I'm crazy
or that was Vegeta with 'em...

00:18:49.592 --> 00:18:52.597

My.. What an entrance.. heh..

00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:15.550
[Narrator] The Ginyu Force
has burst onto the scene

00:21:15.617 --> 00:21:17.287
ready to do Frieza's bidding.

00:21:17.353 --> 00:21:19.558
Are they really as
fearsome as Vegeta says,

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:22.531
or is this merely a ploy
to dupe Krillin and Gohan

00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:23.767
out of the seventh Dragon Ball

00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:26.438
and horde all three
wishes for himself?

00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:29.210
Whatever becomes of the
unlikely alliance between them,

00:21:29.277 --> 00:21:33.953

next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

[Goku] Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:39.652 --> 00:22:41.656
So this is Planet Namek, huh?

00:22:41.723 --> 00:22:42.958
[Krillin] I've never
felt the kind of power

00:22:43.025 --> 00:22:45.697
these Ginyu Force creeps
have--it's unbelievable!

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:47.667
Still, though; I think
the one called Guldo

00:22:47.734 --> 00:22:49.337
might fall pretty
hard if we team up.

00:22:49.404 --> 00:22:50.372
What do you think, Gohan?

00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:51.709
Want to show 'em
what we've got?

00:22:51.776 --> 00:22:52.811
[Gohan] Yeah!

00:22:52.878 --> 00:22:54.615
Especially now that my

[Goku] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:01.061 --> 00:23:04.400
[Krillin] Is it me, or are
these guys just plain weird?
