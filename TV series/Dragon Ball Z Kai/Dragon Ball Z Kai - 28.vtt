Last Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.745
As Goku continued
his intense training,

00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:08.550
Krillin, Gohan, and Bulma
reclaimed a Dragon Ball

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:12.425
from Vegeta, enraging the
ruthless Saiyan in the process.

00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:15.097
Meanwhile, Frieza's
special reinforcements

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:17.234
closed in on Planet Namek.

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:18.771
[Frieza] Vegeta
may be able to run...

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:21.242
but once the Ginyu Force brings
their cutting-edge scouters,

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:24.448
try though he might,
he can't hide...

[Gohan sighs]

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:09.993
It feels like we've
been flying forever...

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.431
How much farther
do we have to go?

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:14.536
Well... I'd say we're
just about halfway there...

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:16.139
The Grand Elder's
not doing well.

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:17.809
I sure hope he can hold out.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.382
[Killin] Only
one thing to do...

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:22.518
We're going
to have to risk

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:23.821
picking up the
pace quite a bit...

00:02:23.888 --> 00:02:25.424
I think we're far enough
out now that Vegeta may

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.996
not notice the spike
in our power levels.

00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:29.365
I say we go for it...

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:31.236
He'll have his hands full
once my Dad gets here,

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:32.840
which should be really soon.

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.075
That settles it, then.

00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:35.645
Let's ratchet our
self up to full power!

00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:37.347
Yeah!

00:02:39.084 --> 00:02:40.320
At this rate
we ought to reach

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:42.692
the Grand Elder's place
in about an hour or so.

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:45.296
[laughs]

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.378
[Vegeta] There they are...!

00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:53.881
Must be at full power...

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:57.321
Kakarot's brat and the bald
pipsqueak; I can sense them.

00:02:57.388 --> 00:02:59.727
But, then... Why aren't
they heading towards me?

00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:01.597
With their radar,
they can easily pinpoint

00:03:01.664 --> 00:03:03.667
the Dragon Balls
in my possession.

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:05.571
I don't know what sort
of game they're playing...

00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:07.141
But this may be my only chance

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.045
at wringing the last
Dragon Ball out of them;

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:11.583
I can't let it slip
through my fingers.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.888
I think I'll take
this one with me...

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:15.290
Just in case their lady friend

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:17.629
is lurking about to take
the others while I'm away...

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:19.933
This way she
won't get all seven.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.402
Ha!

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.574
Nobody plays
Vegeta for a fool...!

00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:26.914
Nobody...! You're about
to learn that the hard way!

Hey...! How about that?
I don't feel worn out...!

00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:03.954
You'd think there'd be a
little soreness or something...

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:06.492
Still. I think that should
just about do it for training...

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.198
Time to save up my
strength with a little R &amp; R.

[giggles]

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.706
I probably ought to
let my body re-adjust

00:04:12.772 --> 00:04:14.976
to normal gravity
while I'm at it, too.

I don't believe this!

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:09.586
Normal gravity is a piece of
cake...! This is awesome...!

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:11.623
I mean it feels
like I've barely got

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.827
both feet on the
ground I'm so light!

as solid as a brick wall!

a ten-times Kaio-ken!

We don't want the bad guys
being able to smell me

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:46.560
before they can see me, right?

That was relaxing... Ah...

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.208
What I've got to do now

00:05:54.274 --> 00:05:56.547
is catch some shut-eye,
but before that...

00:05:56.614 --> 00:06:00.721
A little refreshment...
Let's see now...

00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:02.892
Ahhaaaa!!

not gonna work...

[Narrator] Sleeping like a
baby, Goku had yet to realize

00:06:25.738 --> 00:06:28.443
that his brutal training at
one-hundred-times gravity

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.315
had increased his strength
to an unprecedented level,

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:34.555
far exceeding the normal
Saiyan capabilities.

00:06:46.278 --> 00:06:47.381
Hang in there, Gohan...

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:49.151
The Grand Elder's
place is up ahead;

00:06:49.218 --> 00:06:50.220
we'll be there soon.

00:06:50.286 --> 00:06:51.890
Right!

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.228

As strong as Gohan'll be

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:55.831
once the Grand Elder
boosts his powers,

00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:59.071
this whole plan might still just
be wishful thinking on my part.

00:06:59.138 --> 00:07:02.578
I'm not sure anyone can
take on Vegeta alone.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.926
The guy's a monster.

00:07:09.993 --> 00:07:13.065
It's like there's no ceiling
on how powerful he can get.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.674
Even with Gohan
at full capacity,

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.209
the smartest
thing we could do

00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:21.215
after seeing the Grand Elder
is wait for Goku to get here.

00:07:34.977 --> 00:07:39.217
[thinking] That's right, vermin.
I'm right on top of you now!

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.236
Gohan, it's straight ahead!

00:07:48.303 --> 00:07:49.606
Huh?

00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:50.808
You see it...? That
strange-looking mountain...

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:52.712
That's what we're headed for!

Looks like we're
in the home stretch!

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:02.832
No, wait!

00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:04.769
There's a huge power level
coming up right behind us!

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:12.150
[gasping]
It can't be!

00:08:12.217 --> 00:08:15.256
[gasping] Don't tell me...
That's Vegeta...!

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:23.073
Gohan... I'm going to try and
stall him as long as I can...

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:25.978
You go on ahead to
the Grand Elder's place.

00:08:26.045 --> 00:08:26.947
What are you...?

00:08:27.014 --> 00:08:28.984
Don't argue...!
Just go get stronger...!

Hey.

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:12.505
I... I'm a little surprised you
risked trying to track us down.

00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:13.807
Then you're a fool...

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:16.411
I tend to thrives when
the stakes are high...

00:09:16.478 --> 00:09:18.149
Now, let's dispense
with the chat...

00:09:18.215 --> 00:09:19.886
I believe you have
something of mine that

00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:22.658
you'd be well advised to give
back if you value your life.

00:09:22.725 --> 00:09:25.063
Don't think I don't know.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.336
I have no idea what
you're talking about...

00:09:28.403 --> 00:09:29.639
Keep playing dumb...

00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:32.110
Let's see how far
you're willing to take it.

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.470
This is incredible.

Muwahahaha!!

00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:54.120
What in the...?

00:09:57.862 --> 00:10:01.001
That mountain is where Kakarot's
son flew off to, isn't it...?

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:03.940
But there's more to it
than meets the eye...

00:10:04.007 --> 00:10:06.513
Is that where you've hidden
the ball you stole from me?

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.216
Uh... No, it's...

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:10.988
Ahhh! Damn it, wait!!!

But if you could hurry up,
that'd be great--

in there! Vegeta!

level just seriously spiked!

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:25.637
I see... Kakarot himself
must be holed up in there...

00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:28.777
Then let today be the
day we settle our score!

00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:30.246

Come on out here!

00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:32.016

It... It's you...!
What the heck's going on...?

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.879
What were you up to in there?

00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:05.416
Why did your power
level suddenly shoot up?

00:12:05.483 --> 00:12:07.053
[laughs]
Heh heh heh...

00:12:15.738 --> 00:12:25.991
[laughing]
Ha... Ha... Hahahahahaha!!

00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:32.304
So... You think after
whatever trick you pulled

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.376
in there you're strong
enough to lock horns with me?

00:12:35.443 --> 00:12:37.113
[Vegeta] Really?

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.217
Trust me kid: you're
still light years away from

00:12:39.284 --> 00:12:42.223
being able to tangle with
someone who knows how to fight.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.770
Stepping up?
