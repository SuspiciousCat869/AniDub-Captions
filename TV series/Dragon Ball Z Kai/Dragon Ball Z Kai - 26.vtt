Last Dragon Ball Z Kai...

It seemed that our heroes
had caught their first break!

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:08.283
As the forces of evil
fought amongst themselves,

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:11.524
Gohan ventured off to find the
Dragon Ball hidden by Vegeta

00:00:11.557 --> 00:00:13.994
at a nearby village,
while Krillin raced back

00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:16.365
to the cave with a Dragon
Ball of his own...

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.537
But with the five remaining
Dragon Balls, and now

00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.644
an injured Vegeta, still
firmly in Frieza's clutches,

00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:25.585
can our heroes' luck
hold out? Find out, now!

Back at Zarbon!"

[Appule] You've taken quite
a beating there, pal.

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.195
We could be in for
a long haul here.

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.199
Damn it all... As if
there's not enough

pressure around
here as it is...

Unless I can somehow nurse
you back to consciousness,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.812
Frieza'll have my
head on a pike.

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:20.748
I hope that does it...

and keep my fingers crossed.

Lord... He's been stabilized...
It won't be long now.

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:43.226
That is excellent

Guess the speed at which
I'm able to recuperate

was more than you
bargained for.

stand there!

Frieza's with him. Perfect.

immediately!

Drag the scoundrel back
here in a heap if you must,

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:37.367
just find him!
Or so help me

never been born!

think you'll get away!

I'll find you... You rat!

00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:11.823
No one could've scampered
off that quickly...

00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:14.061
He must be hiding
somewhere nearby...

00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:18.704
[Frieza] Ah, you mock me with
your incompetence, Zarbon!

[Zarbon] Lord Frieza...
I'm sure there's a perf--

00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:22.444
Know that I hold
you responsible

00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:23.981
for our friend's
untimely flight...

00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:27.420
In your position, I'd track
him down... And quickly!

00:05:28.757 --> 00:05:32.732
[chuckle] That's right, moron...
Leave no stone unturned.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:39.779
Heh... One, two, three,
four, five... Good.

00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:41.684
[Vegeta] I hate to come
off all ungrateful after

00:05:41.717 --> 00:05:44.155
putting you through all the
trouble of healing my injuries,

00:05:44.188 --> 00:05:48.396
but let's face it:
I've earned these.

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:51.102
Trouble is... it's not as
though I can just waltz

00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:52.772
out the front door
with all five

under my arm.

Hey, genius! Way to
look inside the ship

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.133
before running off
on a wild goose chase!

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:24.702
Oh hell!

00:06:25.804 --> 00:06:27.107

[chuckle]

00:06:51.122 --> 00:06:52.591
Now!

00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:02.444
Could you tell where his voice
was coming from, my lord,

00:07:02.478 --> 00:07:04.081
or is it possible--

00:07:07.922 --> 00:07:09.057
No! No he's...

00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:12.531
He's pilfering my Dragon
Balls right under our noses!

00:07:16.038 --> 00:07:18.009
Out you go!

00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:27.662
Well... Looks like my
work here is done.

[running steps]

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:33.072
No! No! No!

00:07:34.074 --> 00:07:37.213
Thieving ape!!!

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.025
Where... Where he's
gone this time?!

00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:47.902
[Zarbon frantic]

00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:55.584
[Zarbon] Frieza, my lord!

00:07:55.618 --> 00:07:58.657
Is... Is he perhaps
still on the ship?

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.295
[Frieza] This is your
mess! You find him!

00:08:01.328 --> 00:08:03.099
[Zarbon] Yes, sir!

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:07.508
[Vegeta chuckling]

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:09.211
If I know these
two imbeciles,

00:08:09.244 --> 00:08:11.182
they'll expect me
to flee by air.

00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:13.820
But I wasn't
born yesterday.

00:08:25.043 --> 00:08:28.316
[Frieza] Absolutely
unacceptable!!

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:30.621
You let Vegeta and
my precious bounty

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:32.892
slip through your fingers
in one fell swoop!

00:08:32.925 --> 00:08:34.996
It's unthinkable that he
could have absconded

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:37.635
with all five Dragon Balls
in the twinkling of an eye!

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.839
I will conduct my own search
of the ship's interior--

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:41.777
you, however, will comb
the surrounding areas

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.979
for all you're worth!

00:08:43.013 --> 00:08:44.181
Sir.

00:08:44.214 --> 00:08:46.185
If Vegeta is not standing
before me within the hour,

00:08:46.218 --> 00:08:47.622
the only thing to calm my wrath

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:51.295
will be your life. Understood?

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:55.470
Understood.

00:08:55.505 --> 00:09:05.758
[beeping]

00:09:07.762 --> 00:09:12.337
Huh? This way? It's not
inside the houses?

00:09:15.577 --> 00:09:17.013
Oh, I get it!

00:09:17.047 --> 00:09:19.284
Not even Vegeta woulda looked
at the bottom of the lake!

00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:21.723
It's perfect-- of course!

00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:46.806
Awesome!

00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:51.048
[exhale]

00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:54.722

[exhale]

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:20.406
Alright. Surely they didn't
land much farther than this.

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:29.358
[laughter] Perfect!
I throw a mean curveball

00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:31.295
if I do happen to
say so myself...

00:10:31.329 --> 00:10:35.136
The only thing Frieza's
pitching now is a fit.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.211
I've got you right where I want
you don't I, you bastard?

00:10:39.245 --> 00:10:41.382
[laughter]

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:43.920
All I need to do is drudge
up the one nestled safely

00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:47.962
underwater, and I'm one step
away from having all seven!

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:52.371
Somebody's headed this way...
Someone powerful...

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:57.080
Huh... It's not Zarbon,
the power level is far too low.

00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:01.355
Wha-- It can't be!

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:05.429
[laughter] This is awesome!

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:07.935
Gohan, once I've gotten you
to the Grand Elder's place,

00:11:07.969 --> 00:11:11.375
you're gonna be a force to be
reckoned with-- I guarantee it!

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:17.221
It's the wretched earthling!

00:11:17.254 --> 00:11:20.292
Wait, what is he doing
on Planet Namek?!

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:24.034
And what in the world is he
doing with a Dragon Ball...?

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.440
[laughter] Evidently
today's the day

00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:29.378

to smile on me!

[evil laughter]

00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:57.000
Seriously, this has
gotta be a new record!

00:11:58.036 --> 00:11:59.806
Well now, looks like
the Dragon Balls

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:01.543
are even more popular
than I thought!

00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:02.878
It's a shame he's
come all this way,

00:12:02.911 --> 00:12:05.216
to have that one swiped
right out from under him!

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:10.026
[laughter] Oh, this is
almost too good to be true!

00:12:11.062 --> 00:12:16.038
Vegeta! Where are you?!
If only I had a scouter!

00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:17.775
The way things
are going right now,

00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:21.115
I might as well hide
myself under a rock...

00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:23.018
Come on!

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.664
You're determined
to be the end of me

00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:31.468
one way or another,
aren't you?

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:36.478
Ah-ha! There!

00:12:37.313 --> 00:12:38.550
[Zarbon] No, wait.

00:12:38.584 --> 00:12:42.290
It's just the insect who rescued
that whiney Namekian brat.

00:12:42.324 --> 00:12:45.864
And am I... crazy or is that
a Dragon Ball he's carrying?

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:49.972
[Zarbon] Vegeta!

00:12:50.006 --> 00:12:54.982
I've locked on you now! And you
are going to rue the day!

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:17.227
Huh? Another power level
closing in on me...

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.133
That's gotta be
Zarbon, surely...

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.638
Ha, couldn't leave
well enough alone, huh?

00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:24.108
Still, I shouldn't complain...

00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:26.211
I get to kill two birds
with one stone...

00:13:26.245 --> 00:13:28.684
He's bound to be so frazzled
after our last encounter

00:13:28.717 --> 00:13:30.020
that his guard'll be down...

00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:32.524
This really is my lucky day!

00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:40.139
[sigh]

00:13:41.943 --> 00:13:43.980
[Krillin laughs]

00:13:46.218 --> 00:13:46.853
Sorry...

00:13:46.887 --> 00:13:48.990
[whimpers]

00:13:49.892 --> 00:13:51.630
What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:53.366
Are you trying to kill me?!

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.638
I thought we all agreed
you'd stay inside the cave...

00:13:55.671 --> 00:13:57.709
I mean, I know you need
the light to read by and all,

00:13:57.742 --> 00:13:59.211
but you're gonna get
spotted out here...

00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:03.185
Whatever! I've only been out
here like all of two seconds!

00:14:03.219 --> 00:14:05.625
Ooh... Is that what
I think it is?!

00:14:05.658 --> 00:14:07.662
You actually found one?!

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:09.566
[chuckle] Pretty neat, huh?

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:10.968
Wow...

00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:13.106
I guess the homegrown
variety are a lot

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:16.111
bigger than we're used to...

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:17.982
You shoulda seen
the Grand Elder.

00:14:18.015 --> 00:14:19.552
Turns out he's
really cool.

00:14:19.585 --> 00:14:22.891
Oh, but that's just the start!
Gohan's still inside, right?

00:14:22.925 --> 00:14:23.994
He and I have a
little trip to make

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:25.463
back to the Grand
Elder's place.

00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:27.835
You're not gonna believe
what that old guy can do!

00:14:27.869 --> 00:14:29.104
Um, yeah... About that...

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:31.308
he's kinda off on his
own at the moment...

00:14:31.341 --> 00:14:34.014
A Dragon Ball popped up on the
radar over near that village

00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:36.418
Vegeta was attacking,
and he went to go look for it.

00:14:36.451 --> 00:14:39.158
Ahh... Please tell
me you're joking.

00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:42.698
What the?! There's an
energy right on top of us...!

00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:43.901
And it is huge!

00:14:43.934 --> 00:14:45.971
Is it Gohan? That
didn't take very long.

00:14:46.004 --> 00:14:48.977
No... We're not
that lucky.

00:14:50.146 --> 00:14:52.985
[Both] Ah! It's Vegeta!!!

00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:02.572
He must've followed me!

00:15:02.605 --> 00:15:05.944
I was so pumped from getting
stronger, I didn't even notice!

00:15:05.977 --> 00:15:09.885
Huh. Fancy our paths
crossing here, Earthling...

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:11.823
I never would've
suspected your kind

00:15:11.856 --> 00:15:13.292
capable of
interstellar flight,

00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:15.096
given the state
of your civilization...

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.766
But judging from
the Dragon Ball

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.335
you're clutching
so tightly there,

00:15:18.369 --> 00:15:22.410
it appears you've come all this
way for the same reason I did.

00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:23.747
That's right...

00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:27.521
We can do this the easy way or
the hard way-- it's up to you...

00:15:27.555 --> 00:15:30.126
Now, the two of you can
choose to stay put here

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:32.130
while I attend to some
unfinished business

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:37.040
or you can try to run
and make this much uglier.

00:15:37.073 --> 00:15:39.444
And it seems
we have a guest...

00:15:43.654 --> 00:15:45.256
[chuckle]

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:51.068
Oh, he's cute...
With a face like that,

00:15:51.101 --> 00:15:52.371
he's must be one
of the good guys;

00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:54.976
come to whisk us bravely
out of harm's way?

00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:57.079
I wouldn't count on it.

00:15:57.614 --> 00:16:03.425
[wind blowing]

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:12.979
[wind blowing]

00:16:13.012 --> 00:16:14.882
Can this be any worse?!

00:16:14.915 --> 00:16:19.123
What are you talking
about? He's gorgeous!

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:21.061
Have you lost your mind?!

00:16:21.095 --> 00:16:23.265
Ever hear of not judging
a book by its cover?!

00:16:23.298 --> 00:16:26.338
Well, yeah, but... I mean
look at those eyes...

00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:28.877
Just trust me, I don't
have to look at his eyes.

00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:31.348
I'm sorry, what
were you saying?

00:16:31.382 --> 00:16:34.788
You have no taste in
boyfriends, Bulma. Seriously.

00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:44.141
Interesting... You
make me look the fool

00:16:44.174 --> 00:16:46.411
and now all you can do
is just stand there.

00:16:46.445 --> 00:16:47.113
[chuckle]

00:16:47.147 --> 00:16:49.418
Ah... I recognize baldy...

00:16:49.451 --> 00:16:52.324
A new friend you've made since
you've got here, perhaps...

00:16:52.357 --> 00:16:53.594
[terrified]

00:16:53.627 --> 00:16:54.729
[giddy]

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:56.900
All the pieces are beginning
to fall into place.

00:16:56.933 --> 00:17:00.373
Hey, big boy!
Over here...

00:17:00.407 --> 00:17:02.912
Just so you know,
I'm rootin' for ya!

00:17:02.945 --> 00:17:04.247
You've got a fan club.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.850
That's right--
have a laugh, then...

00:17:05.884 --> 00:17:08.523
You have absolutely no idea
how much I'm going to enjoy

00:17:08.556 --> 00:17:10.661
watching Lord Frieza
put that mouth of yours

00:17:10.694 --> 00:17:12.363
through the wringer...
One way or another,

00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:15.671
you will tell us where the
remaining Dragon Balls are.

00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:16.939
Oh... Is that a fact?

00:17:16.973 --> 00:17:20.479
[chuckle] That's enough...

00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:27.493
[Vegeta] Yahhh!!

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.250
I've had it with you!

00:17:49.104 --> 00:17:50.440
He's gotten limber...

00:17:50.473 --> 00:17:54.080
Ha! Don't hold back
for my sake, please.

00:18:05.771 --> 00:18:09.612
[petrified]

'kay you win--
he's a bad guy!

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:20.165
His energy just went
straight through the roof!

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:23.238
[Krillin] This is bad.
Really, really bad...!

00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:29.117
[growl]

00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:32.156
That's it. Take the bait...

00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:35.462
[growling laughter]

00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:41.876
[chuckle]

00:18:42.912 --> 00:18:44.380
Damn it!

00:18:57.507 --> 00:19:02.383
Haahhhhhhh!!!

00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:06.157
This is our chance... We gotta
run! Let's go Bulma...

00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:08.228
What?! He's gonna pound
us to dirt if we run!

00:19:08.261 --> 00:19:11.334
He's gonna pound us into
dirt if we don't... C'mon!

00:19:11.536 --> 00:19:12.236
Ahh!

00:19:12.269 --> 00:19:13.873
No you don't!

00:19:15.677 --> 00:19:16.946
Wahhh!

00:19:18.349 --> 00:19:21.722
Great, what now?! Does
nothing get past this jerk?

00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:26.264
There's a ton of energy...

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.603
And it's coming right
from where I left Bulma!

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:30.339
I'd better hurry!

00:19:36.084 --> 00:19:38.623
How dare you...
You bastard!

00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:41.461
[chuckling] Wow. You
don't look so good...

00:19:41.495 --> 00:19:44.467
Our little scuffle appears to
be taking quite a toll on you...

00:19:44.502 --> 00:19:45.937
Forgive me for saying so,

00:19:45.971 --> 00:19:48.208
but I don't think you'll last
much longer at this rate.

00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:50.914
Is that what you
think? [laughter]

00:19:50.947 --> 00:19:52.751
A comedian to the
very end, I see!

00:19:52.784 --> 00:19:55.089
Your power pales
in comparison to mine!

00:19:55.122 --> 00:19:56.793
How awkward. I thought
you of all people

00:19:56.826 --> 00:19:58.529
would be acquainted
with Saiyans enough

00:19:58.563 --> 00:20:01.502
to know the serious trouble
you're in right now...

00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:02.538
[growling]

00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:04.440
You were foolish to
treat me so carelessly

00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:07.982
knowing our fight had left me
at death's door... Weren't you?

00:20:08.617 --> 00:20:10.654
When a Saiyan recovers
from the kind of damage

00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:12.457
you dished out to
me, old friend,

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.529
he only becomes that
much more powerful.

00:20:14.562 --> 00:20:15.731
[shock]

00:20:15.764 --> 00:20:18.135
Of course. That's it...
That's how Goku was able to get

00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:21.241
so much stronger after
every battle he lost...

00:20:21.275 --> 00:20:24.782
So, then... Exactly how
powerful is Vegeta now?

00:20:24.815 --> 00:20:27.086
Posture all you want! Scum
like you could come back

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:28.890
from the abyss a
hundred times over

00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:32.698
and not be one-tenth as mighty
as I am in my present form!

I- I beg- beg you... mercy...

00:21:13.613 --> 00:21:16.417
After all the years of being
spat on and taunted by you,

00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:18.488
I'm expected to
show you mercy?

00:21:18.523 --> 00:21:22.196
Hear me out... if we...
joined... together...

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.537
we could prevail
over Frieza...
