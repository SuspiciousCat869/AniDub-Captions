Now that's what
I wanted to see, boss!

this guy had to come along

and deny all of the champ's

that Hercule's rematch will
no longer be taking place...

as an unnamed challenger
has defeated Cell

00:16:15.316 --> 00:16:19.057

described as a fluke!

than I thought it would be.

[GOKU] Don't know
why I'm surprised.

I shoulda' known you'd
be able to regenerate.

Piccolo's cells are quite
useful in that regard.

Curse that monster!

I thought you went
down a bit too easily...

00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:02.531
But regenerating half a body
still takes a lot of energy.

strength anymore.

for you, as well.

that I'm not going to fall
for your little trick again...

going to get dull rather quickly
