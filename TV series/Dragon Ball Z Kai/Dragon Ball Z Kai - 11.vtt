00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:03.407
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:06.948
Chiaotzu gave his life
to stop the Saiyans...

00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:12.525
[TIEN]
Tri-Beam... Ha...!

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:13.962
[TIEN]
You... bastard...

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:15.698
[NARRATOR] Then,
despite his best efforts,

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:18.203
Tien was the next to fall.

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:20.107
But before the
massacre could continue,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.746
Vegeta called a three-hour
halt to the action.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.152
The wait for
Goku begins--now!

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:36.540
♪ Opening Song ♪

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.192
I'm sick
of standing here--

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:28.162
why do we have to
wait for Kakarot?

00:02:28.196 --> 00:02:29.632
Because...

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:32.270
As a traitor to the Saiyan
race he gets special treatment.

00:02:32.304 --> 00:02:33.541
[VEGETA] You and
I are going to savor

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:36.379
doling out punishment
on that fugitive...

00:02:36.412 --> 00:02:39.954
By making him watch his
friends and loved ones die...

00:02:39.987 --> 00:02:42.257
Right in front of him.

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.096
[VEGETA] And that'll
be just to offer a taste

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.567
of what's to come...

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.743
Because he'll follow their
lead--only much slower.

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:57.355
[VEGETA] He'll
remember what it means

00:02:57.388 --> 00:02:59.826
to be a Saiyan as
he writhes in agony--

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.329
[chuckles]

00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:03.333
Surely three hours
isn't too long to wait

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:04.737
for that kind of entertainment.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.907
[NAPPA] Oh-ho, I get
what you're goin' for...!

00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:08.243
This'll be awesome!

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:09.680
[VEGETA] That's of course
assuming he's brave enough

00:03:09.713 --> 00:03:12.184
to show his face in
the next three hours...

00:03:12.217 --> 00:03:13.453
[NAPPA] If he does,
how 'bout this:

00:03:13.487 --> 00:03:15.324
you take Kakarot
and I'll sink my teeth

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:16.660
into those three!

00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:19.231
[VEGETA] Suit
yourself, but first...

00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:20.735
[VEGETA] Get the Namekian
to tell what he knows

00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:23.574
about the Dragon Balls...
Then kill him.

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:31.990
[NAPPA] This is gonna
be one hell of a party!

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:37.401
[KRILLIN]
Hey, uhh...

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:38.504
why don't we just
get outta here

00:03:38.538 --> 00:03:40.007
while we still
have the chance...?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.309
We can't beat them...

00:03:41.342 --> 00:03:43.146
I say live to
fight another day!

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.983
[PICCOLO] You imbecile...
Don't you get it?

00:03:45.017 --> 00:03:46.319
There won't be
another day for us--

00:03:46.352 --> 00:03:48.624
or anyone else--to
fight these monsters...

00:03:48.657 --> 00:03:51.696
These freaks intend to
eradicate all of humanity.

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.068
[KRILLIN] Agh...!
This is bad...!

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:56.673
Come on, Goku...
Get here...!

00:03:56.706 --> 00:03:58.242
You have to show
these two monsters

00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:00.815
how much stronger you've
gotten before it's too late!

00:04:00.848 --> 00:04:03.019
Hurry!

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:05.524
[GOKU] C'mon,
c'mon, c'mon!

00:04:06.894 --> 00:04:07.662
[KAMI] That's it...

00:04:07.696 --> 00:04:08.798
[GOKU] Just hang
in there, guys--

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.400
I'm on my way!

00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:17.381
[KRILLIN] Piccolo,
Goku is gonna be here

00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:20.086
before the three hours
are up, dont'cha think?

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.024
[PICCOLO] Who knows?

00:04:22.057 --> 00:04:24.361
[PICCOLO] Just in case,
I suggest we use this time

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:26.332
to figure out a way to
inflict a little damage

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.636
on them ourselves...

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.040
[GOHAN] Um,
I have an idea...

00:04:30.073 --> 00:04:31.576
We can use this
time to train...!

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.547
You and me can spar the
way we've been doing--

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.117
[PICCOLO] I've done
what I can to train you,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.254
and it was a
waste of time...!

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:39.358
Why are you even still here?

00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:41.696
[GOHAN]
But you said...

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.113
[KRILLIN] Piccolo!

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:51.617
[PICCOLO]
Rise above it, boy...

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.822
What you think you need,
you already have.

00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:57.562
[KRILLIN]
Gohan? It's okay...

00:04:57.595 --> 00:05:00.067
You can't just leave...!

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.336
Gohan!

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:04.442

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:06.613
[NAPPA] Hey, now!
What's the rush, kiddo?

00:05:06.647 --> 00:05:09.152
Don't wanna miss
all the fun, do ya?

00:05:09.185 --> 00:05:11.455
[laughs]

00:05:11.488 --> 00:05:12.725
[GOHAN] You're
no fun, you bully!

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.261
You're stupid
and ugly, and--

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:15.430
You smell!

00:05:15.463 --> 00:05:17.501
[NAPPA] Aaaahh!

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:20.508
[NAPPA] I smell?
Why... you...!

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:22.010
It's not my fault...!

00:05:22.044 --> 00:05:23.981
I've been cooped up in
a space pod for a year!

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:25.450
What d'ya expect?!

00:05:25.484 --> 00:05:27.822
[car engine running]

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:32.531
[REPORTER]
All right--

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:33.601
we're going to
try to get as close

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:35.504
to the action
as we can, folks.

00:05:37.207 --> 00:05:38.243
[REPORTER] There's
no obvious reason

00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:39.747
for the sudden
calm, but...

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.315
Well, it looks as though
they may be taking

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.020
some sort of a break
from the combat;

00:05:43.053 --> 00:05:44.923
to recoup I'd imagine...

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:48.764
[NAPPA] Whatdya say I have
some laughs with these guys...?

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:50.100
No point in
standin' around while

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:52.437
there's a perfectly good
chance to stretch my legs.

00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:54.609
[VEGETA] Very well...
But watch yourself...

00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:57.014
try not to get carried
away--I know how you are.

00:05:57.047 --> 00:05:58.216
[NAPPA] Ah, c'mon.

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:59.318
[VEGETA] Don't argue...

00:05:59.352 --> 00:06:02.458
We want to save
our strength, right?

00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:04.462
[NAPPA] Yeah, okay--
I get what you mean.

00:06:04.495 --> 00:06:05.631
Fair enough!

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:06.600
I'll just have to
make this a friendly

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:08.804
little "meet the press," then.

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:13.246
[REPORTER] One of
the aliens has leapt

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.818
into the air and
appears to be flying!

00:06:15.852 --> 00:06:18.858
Where he's headed we can only
speculate at this time...

00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:19.793
[gasps]

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:21.462
[REPORTER] He's
changed direction now.

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:23.667
Again, I hesitate
to guess...

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.172
But I think he's flying
directly toward us!

00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:27.241
[ALL]
Ahh!!

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:29.178
[NAPPA]
Gyaaa! Ha ha ha!

00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:32.017
[REPORTER]
Get us out of here!

00:06:36.794 --> 00:06:37.996
[ONLOOKER A]
He's coming this way!

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:42.505
[ONLOOKER B] Quick!
Swing the camera around!

00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:45.911
[NAPPA]
I hate the media!!!

00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:57.702
[KING KAI]
It's taking forever!

00:06:57.736 --> 00:06:59.873
What is his name...
"Slow-ku...?"

00:06:59.906 --> 00:07:02.077
[monkey sounds]

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.848
[KING KAI] Yes, yes,
I know I'm a comic genius,

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:06.286
but this is no time
for a laugh track...

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.490
The fate of the Earth
hangs by a thread!

00:07:08.524 --> 00:07:10.995
[KING KAI]
Come on, Goku!

00:07:17.642 --> 00:07:18.677
[GOKU]
I see it!

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.480
[GOKU] Yes,
I'm almost there...!

00:07:23.687 --> 00:07:24.689
[MR. POPO]
You sense him, sir?

00:07:24.723 --> 00:07:26.458
[KAMI] Yes...
If he hurries...

00:07:26.492 --> 00:07:28.764
He might just
make it in time.

00:07:35.911 --> 00:07:38.015
[VEGETA] One more
hour to go...

00:07:38.884 --> 00:07:41.355
If Kakarot decides not
to show his face here,

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:43.560
I'll be very disappointed.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.933
[PICCOLO] There's no
other option for us.

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:49.605
At this point,
it's all or nothing.

00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:54.749
[KAMI] Ah...!
That's it!

00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:56.519
Goku's made it to the end!

00:07:56.553 --> 00:07:58.624
[MR. POPO] Hurry, sir--
there's no time to lose!

00:07:58.657 --> 00:08:01.061
[GOKU] Feet don't
fail me now!

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:07.007
[KING KAI] Hey, how 'bout
that--it's Goku after all!

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.411
[GOKU] Whoa...So that's
the Saiyans, huh?

00:08:09.444 --> 00:08:11.550
I can already sense
their power from here!

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.722
[NARRATOR] And so...
three hours had passed,

00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:19.197
and there's still no sign
of Goku on the battlefield.

00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:23.072
[VEGETA]
Time is up.

00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:24.509
[KRILLIN]
No!

00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:27.314
[VEGETA] Looks like
your "mighty champion"

00:08:27.347 --> 00:08:29.752
isn't coming to the rescue.

00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:34.194
[NAPPA] He afraid,
or somethin'?

00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:37.301
[VEGETA] That would be the
long and short of it, I'd say.

00:08:37.334 --> 00:08:38.570
[GOHAN]
He's not afraid!

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:40.072
My dad'll be here any
minute now--you'll see!

00:08:40.106 --> 00:08:42.979
[KRILLIN] Damn it--what the
heck is taking him so long?!

00:08:43.012 --> 00:08:46.051
[PICCOLO] Come on...
don't do this to us, Goku.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.989
[thud]

00:08:48.022 --> 00:08:51.028
[NAPPA] Well all that waitin'
sure got my bloodlust up...

00:08:51.062 --> 00:08:54.736
Too bad you three are all
I've got to take it out on.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.476
[PICCOLO] We've got
one shot against him,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.081
and that's assuming
things go smoothly.

00:09:02.384 --> 00:09:03.520
[PICCOLO] We're playing
for keeps here,

00:09:03.554 --> 00:09:07.093
so listen and listen
good... Krillin...

00:09:07.127 --> 00:09:08.362
You're the decoy...

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:11.135
Do whatever it takes to draw
his attention away from me.

00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:13.239
[PICCOLO] When the
opportunity presents itself,

00:09:13.272 --> 00:09:14.475
I'll make a go for

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:17.280
the Saiyan brute's only
weak-spot: his tail.

00:09:17.314 --> 00:09:18.349
[KRILLIN]
Right.

00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:19.285
[PICCOLO] If I can
grab hold of it,

00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:20.721
he won't be able to move...

00:09:20.754 --> 00:09:23.293
Then... Gohan, that's
when you charge him

00:09:23.326 --> 00:09:25.062
with everything you've got.

00:09:25.096 --> 00:09:26.198
[GOHAN]
Right...

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:27.936
And... And I promise
I won't run away this time!

00:09:27.969 --> 00:09:29.171
[PICCOLO]
I should hope not...

00:09:29.204 --> 00:09:30.942
Remember, right now
the fate of the world

00:09:30.975 --> 00:09:33.045
rests in our
hands, understood?

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:34.816
[PICCOLO] You've got to
believe in yourself...

00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:36.318
Brush aside those
childish doubts

00:09:36.352 --> 00:09:39.992
and you'll tap into a power
even greater than mine!

00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:52.651
[GOHAN]
I can do this!

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:01.201
[KAMI]
You've made it!

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:01.903
[GOKU]
Kami!

00:10:01.936 --> 00:10:03.507
[KAMI] Quickly,
grab on!

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.343
[GOKU]
You got it!

00:10:05.377 --> 00:10:06.947
[KING YEMMA] Huh...
Well I never...

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.282
That... That is to
say I never would've

00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:11.756
put money on the kid bein'
able to make it back...

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:14.896
[GOKU] Alright, time
to meet those Saiyans...

00:10:14.929 --> 00:10:17.367
This is what I've
been training for!

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.771
[KAMI] Hurry now!
Make us proud!

00:10:18.804 --> 00:10:20.774
[MR. POPO]
Best of luck, Goku!

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:28.189
[GOKU] Gohan! You all
better still be in one piece!

00:10:28.222 --> 00:10:29.491
[KORIN]
Here he comes!

00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:32.364
I can only imagine how worn
out the poor guy must feel...

00:10:32.397 --> 00:10:33.567
[GOKU]
Hey, Korin!

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.836
[KORIN]
Hi!

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.138
[GOKU] Can you
help me out?!

00:10:36.172 --> 00:10:37.274
[KORIN]
Of course!

00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:40.881
How 'bout my last two
senzu beans...? Heads up!

00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:43.353
[GOKU] You're the
best...! Thanks!

00:10:43.386 --> 00:10:44.421
[KORIN]
No problem...

00:10:44.454 --> 00:10:46.291
give 'em a good
thrashin' for me!

00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:48.128
[GOKU] Alright;
one for me...

00:10:54.008 --> 00:10:57.213
[GOKU] Yeah... That's
the stuff... Nimbus!!

00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:02.190
[GOKU] Hey!
Long time no see!

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:04.930
[GOKU] We've got to get
down to the battlefield...!

00:11:04.963 --> 00:11:08.870
That way! Keep it together,
guys ! I'm coming!

00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:36.793
[KRILLIN] Right...
Here goes!

00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:40.466
[KRILLIN]
Aaaaahhhh!!

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:41.837
[NAPPA] Ha...!
Well now...

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.441
It looks like somebody's
got some nerve!

00:11:46.813 --> 00:11:48.950
[PICCOLO] Please
take the bait...

00:11:49.986 --> 00:11:53.292
[KRILLIN]
Yaaahhhh!!

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.196
[PICCOLO]
Now!

00:11:57.902 --> 00:11:59.572
[NAPPA]
You son of a...!

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:01.241
[PICCOLO]
Gohan!!!

00:12:01.275 --> 00:12:03.814
[GOHAN]
Hyaaahhh!!

00:12:03.847 --> 00:12:05.416
[NAPPA]
Heh heh heh...

00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:07.186
Nice attempt!

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:17.908
[PICCOLO] That's...
impossible...!

00:12:22.852 --> 00:12:25.222
[GOHAN]
Piccolo, no!

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.801
[NAPPA] Whoa there,
don't die on me yet.

00:12:31.503 --> 00:12:34.041
Stick with us just a little
bit longer, alright...?

00:12:34.074 --> 00:12:37.013
We've got some questions
about those Dragon Balls.

00:12:38.917 --> 00:12:41.355
[KRILLIN] This...
This isn't happening...

00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:42.858
[VEGETA]
Hahahaha!

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:45.163
Don't tell me that was
your big strategy...!

00:12:45.197 --> 00:12:46.498
You think we'd be
the warriors we are

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:50.841
if such an obvious weakness
were left untrained?

00:12:50.874 --> 00:12:53.412
[NAPPA] He was
your best, huh...?

00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:55.016
What a shame...

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.723
Sure didn't take much to
make him buckle, did it?

00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:00.326
[GOHAN] You have
to get up...!

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.330
C'mon! Shake it off!

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:04.902
[NAPPA] Yeah... Kid...
hate to break it to ya,

00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:07.908
but I'm sure your buddy
there's beyond pep-talks...

00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:10.915
You might wanna forget
about him for a moment,

00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:14.020
because I've got
plans for you, next...

00:13:16.057 --> 00:13:17.461
[NAPPA] Don't sell
yourself short;

00:13:17.494 --> 00:13:19.264
you're Kakarot's son...

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.603
That, my friend, means
you've got Saiyan blood

00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:23.874
coursin' through
those veins.

00:13:23.908 --> 00:13:25.242
[NAPPA]
So, see...

00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:28.015
I'm countin' on you to
give me a run for my money.

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:45.550
[NAPPA] Get up... No one
told ya you could die...

00:13:45.584 --> 00:13:48.222
I'm just gettin'
warmed up here!

00:13:58.443 --> 00:14:00.046
[NAPPA]
Hahahaha!

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:02.851
See...? That
wasn't so hard!

00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:23.258
[VEGETA] Ah... someone's got
a few tricks up his sleeve...

00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:24.227
[KRILLIN] Oh,
you like that?

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.331
Well, you're
gonna love this!

00:14:28.436 --> 00:14:35.917
Hyuuuu-aaaaaahhhh!!!

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.614
[KRILLIN]
Kien-zan... ha!

00:15:11.188 --> 00:15:13.660
[NAPPA] That
supposed to scare me?

00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:17.133
[VEGETA]
Nappa...! Dodge it!

00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:19.037
[NAPPA]
Ah!

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:26.151
[crash]

00:15:31.094 --> 00:15:32.531
[VEGETA]
That imbecile...

00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:33.767
He would've lost his head!

00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:34.902
Has he gone blind?!

00:15:34.936 --> 00:15:37.273
[KRILLIN]
Ugh... Damn!

00:15:44.922 --> 00:15:47.427
[NAPPA] How...
How dare you...?!

00:15:47.461 --> 00:15:49.565
No one cuts this face--
not unless they wanna

00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:53.372
spend the last few minutes
of their life in total agony!

00:15:58.415 --> 00:16:01.756
[NAPPA] Counter this,
you little eyesore!

00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:13.312
[NAPPA] Time to
say goodnight!

00:16:23.867 --> 00:16:30.012
[PICCOLO panting]

00:16:30.045 --> 00:16:32.818
[NAPPA] You
scorched my back...!

00:16:32.851 --> 00:16:34.556
How dare you?!

00:16:34.589 --> 00:16:37.494
[VEGETA]
Hahahahaha!!

00:16:37.528 --> 00:16:38.763
What's wrong, Nappa...?

00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:40.333
Bite off more
than you can chew?

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:43.172
[PICCOLO]
Saiyan trash...

00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:46.244
It would not be smart
to underestimate me.

00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:49.184
[NAPPA] Don't
you tell me who

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.054
I can and can't
underestimate...!

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:52.390
I was gonna be nice,
since we needed

00:16:52.424 --> 00:16:54.394
to pry the whole Dragon
Ball secret outta ya--

00:16:54.427 --> 00:16:56.298
but you can forget
about that now...!

00:16:56.332 --> 00:16:58.402
Cocky, green
antennae-having bastard!

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:02.143
[PICCOLO] Cocky? Me?
Heh. You have no idea...

00:17:03.245 --> 00:17:05.550
[PICCOLO] What's that power...?
It's tremendous...!

00:17:05.584 --> 00:17:07.922
And yet it's emanating
from such a great distance,

00:17:07.955 --> 00:17:10.259
how could it possibly
be so strong...?

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.269
[GOHAN] I can feel it,
too...! That's my dad!

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:18.944
I just know it is!
He's finally here!

00:17:18.977 --> 00:17:21.716
[KRILLIN] Yup...
There's no doubt about it...

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:24.421
Goku's coming...

00:17:24.454 --> 00:17:26.860
[PICCOLO]
And most importantly...

00:17:26.893 --> 00:17:29.798
Goku... will be ready.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.439
[KING KAI] Hurry
it up, big guy!

00:17:33.472 --> 00:17:37.013
You're almost there!
Just a bit further now!

00:17:37.247 --> 00:17:39.017
[PICCOLO] Well it's
about damn time...!

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.921
Another minute and
we'd all be finished...

00:17:40.954 --> 00:17:44.094
No one ever said punctuality
was Goku's strong suit...

00:17:44.127 --> 00:17:46.533
but still, I oughtta kill
him for making us wait!

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:48.837
[GOHAN] He... He's real
close...! C'mon Dad!

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.975
We're over here,
Dad! Hurry up...!

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:53.245
I knew he would come!

00:17:54.414 --> 00:17:56.385
[KRILLIN]
Just in time...

00:17:56.418 --> 00:17:57.721
[VEGETA] Is it
actually possible

00:17:57.754 --> 00:18:01.328
for you waifs to somehow
detect Kakarot's presence?

00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:05.737
[VEGETA] Or are you
bluffing me...? We'll see.

00:18:10.412 --> 00:18:12.250
[GOKU] Okay...
There they are...

00:18:12.284 --> 00:18:15.624
Two big powers... two
that are even bigger...

00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:16.993
and one small...

00:18:17.026 --> 00:18:18.664
[GOKU] But there should
be more than five...

00:18:18.697 --> 00:18:21.802
If this means what
I think it means then...

00:18:23.272 --> 00:18:26.545
[GOKU] Faster,
Nimbus! Faster!

00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:31.690
[NAPPA]
Vegeta...

00:18:31.723 --> 00:18:33.158
[NAPPA] They just
tryin' to buy some time

00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:35.730
or are we finally gonna
see some real action?

00:18:35.764 --> 00:18:37.701
C'mon, let's have some
good news for a change--

00:18:37.735 --> 00:18:40.139
I've been chompin' at
the bit all day here.

00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:41.341
[VEGETA] I don't
know if it's Kakarot,

00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:43.112
but something
is on the way...

00:18:43.145 --> 00:18:44.982
Whatever it is we
should see for ourselves

00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:48.055
in approximately
four minutes...

00:18:48.088 --> 00:18:49.191
And if it's him,

00:18:49.224 --> 00:18:51.629
his power level
exceeds five-thousand.

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:57.306
[NAPPA] Five-thousand...?!
That's... Impossible!!!

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.543
[VEGETA]
Enough...!

00:18:58.576 --> 00:19:00.848
Play time is over--
eliminate them! Now...!

00:19:00.881 --> 00:19:03.118
We can't risk having
all four team up on us...

00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:04.555
They might prove
to be an issue...

00:19:04.589 --> 00:19:07.594
I want their corpses to
be the first thing he sees!

00:19:07.628 --> 00:19:08.195
[PICCOLO]
What?!

00:19:08.228 --> 00:19:09.397
[GOHAN]
Ehh?

00:19:10.834 --> 00:19:13.005
[NAPPA] But, what about
the Dragon Balls...?

00:19:13.038 --> 00:19:14.274
I thought--

00:19:14.308 --> 00:19:16.546
[VEGETA] The Namekian is
of no use to us anymore.

00:19:17.147 --> 00:19:18.382
Let's just say
I have a hunch

00:19:18.416 --> 00:19:20.186
that if we put our
green friend's home world

00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:22.156
next on the list of
planets to conquer...

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.127
We'll get answers...

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.697
Funny; until today
I'd always assumed

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.634
the Dragon Balls were
just a fairy tale--

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:29.705
but if Kakarot's been
brought back to life...

00:19:29.738 --> 00:19:31.943
We know there's more
to them than rumor...

00:19:31.976 --> 00:19:33.245
don't we, now?

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:36.384
[NAPPA] Yes we do...
So... Green Guy.

00:19:36.418 --> 00:19:38.455
You wanna be first?

00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:41.328
[GOHAN] No,
Piccolo...! Let me...!

00:19:41.361 --> 00:19:42.731
You just get out of
there--and I'll find a way

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:45.236
to keep this guy busy
while we wait for Dad!

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.371
[PICCOLO]
What?!

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:47.808
[GOHAN] If you die,
Kami dies, too,

00:19:47.841 --> 00:19:50.379
and the Dragon Balls will
be completely useless...!

00:19:50.412 --> 00:19:52.585
We cannot let
that happen!

00:19:53.319 --> 00:19:54.756
[PICCOLO] Now what kind
of nonsense is that...?

00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:57.059
You expect me to let
you go head-to-head

00:19:57.093 --> 00:19:59.230
with this oaf
on your own...?

00:19:59.263 --> 00:20:01.134
If that's what
the brat wants...

00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:02.804
Let's go!

00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:05.777
[PICCOLO]
Damn it!

00:20:10.988 --> 00:20:12.490
[GOHAN]
Yaaaaggh!

00:20:41.983 --> 00:20:46.659
Now you're through...

00:20:57.848 --> 00:20:59.317
[PICCOLO]
No!

00:21:01.589 --> 00:21:06.765
[NAPPA]
Die!!! Yaaaaa!

00:21:20.259 --> 00:21:21.729
[GOHAN]
Aaaaaaa!!

00:21:21.762 --> 00:21:23.666
[NARRATOR] Piccolo has put
his own life on the line

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.471
to shield Gohan from
Nappa's lethal blast.

00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:30.145
But if Piccolo falls, the Dragon
Balls will cease to exist!

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:31.616
Will the Namekian survive?

00:21:31.649 --> 00:21:35.156

00:22:38.181 --> 00:22:39.852
[GOKU] Hey!
It's me, Goku...!

00:22:39.885 --> 00:22:42.691
Do I even wanna know
what's goin' on down there?

00:22:42.724 --> 00:22:44.595
[PICCOLO] Don't read
too much into things--

00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:46.733
I simply refuse
to let them win!

00:22:46.766 --> 00:22:47.968
[GOHAN]
Please don't die!

00:22:48.001 --> 00:22:50.907
Why didn't you just
run away like I said?!

00:22:52.076 --> 00:22:54.147
[GOKU] Those monsters
will pay for this...!

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.086
Next time, on
Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.500
[GOHAN] Wow! My Dad's even
stronger than I thought!
