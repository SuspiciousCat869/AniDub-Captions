Last Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:31.362
Frieza revealed his
second transformation,

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.170
raising his already immense
power to shocking new heights.

00:00:35.237 --> 00:00:38.209
Suddenly Piccolo found
himself on the defensive,

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:41.249
and it quickly became obvious
that the Namekian's hopes

00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:43.621
for victory had been misplaced.

00:00:43.687 --> 00:00:44.823
Stop it!

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.994
Gohan! Damn...

Do you honestly think
you can help them?!

00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:51.202
You have to attack me
with all the power you have!

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.404

[Piccolo pants]

00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:12.357
Sure, kid...

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:16.399
Peculiar. That little
runt's power level

00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:18.537
has taken a rather
sizeable jump.

00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:20.975
Somehow, recovering from
that thrashing I gave him

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:23.981
seems to actually have
made him stronger...

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:29.224
Wait! Of course!
He must be a Saiyan child!

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:30.861
But how? Who is he?

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:34.068
I made sure that the Saiyan
race was all but extinct...

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:36.139
Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz
were the only three

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:39.980
that I allowed to remain.
So then... who's "daddy"?

00:05:40.047 --> 00:05:41.416
[Frieza] Hmm...

00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:44.121
He doesn't much take
after Vegeta or Nappa...

00:05:44.188 --> 00:05:45.725
So I guess that leaves Raditz!

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:47.862
I suppose there is a vague
resemblance there...

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:51.235
He may have deflected that
attack, Gohan... but...

00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:53.473
it's obvious you've
gotten stronger...

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.943
I'm proud of you, kid.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.447
But I don't know if there's
anything else I can do...

00:05:57.515 --> 00:06:00.220
I mean, I put everything
I had into that blast,

00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:02.490
and it didn't even faze him!

00:06:03.628 --> 00:06:06.534
[Vegeta] Tch! You!

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.002
Do I have to spell it out?!

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.875
Every time a Saiyan recovers
from a near fatal injury,

00:06:10.942 --> 00:06:12.311
his power increases!

00:06:12.378 --> 00:06:14.550
We can use this to
our advantage!

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:16.251
Now, before Frieza has time

00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:18.090
to perform his last
transformation!

00:06:18.156 --> 00:06:20.426
I need you to blast me!

00:06:20.493 --> 00:06:22.632
Don't think about it,
just do it!

00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:25.036
It won't work if the
injury is self-inflicted.

00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:28.175
--Get it?! It has to be you!
--[Krillin] B-B-But I can't...

00:06:28.242 --> 00:06:29.546
You're so much
stronger than me...

00:06:29.613 --> 00:06:31.315
I doubt I'd even scratch you!

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:32.886
Don't worry about that...

00:06:32.953 --> 00:06:34.789
I'll lower my defenses
to the minimum,

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:36.392
so even one of
your puny attacks

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.029
should do plenty of damage...

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:40.801
And then with the Namekian
brat's healing powers,

00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:42.438
I'll be restored
to full strength

00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:44.041
in a matter of seconds.

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:46.312
As much as I'd like
smashing your face in...

00:06:46.378 --> 00:06:47.982
It wouldn't be right.

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:48.884
[Vegeta groans]
Tch...

00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:50.487
B'sides... we just
have to hold out

00:06:50.554 --> 00:06:52.391
a few more minutes before
Goku's recovered...

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:54.563
And what can he do?!
He's a low-class scum,

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:56.666
he's reached his peak!

00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:58.871
This just won't do.
I think it's time

00:06:58.938 --> 00:07:01.409
to wipe these Saiyans
out once and for all...

00:07:01.475 --> 00:07:03.580
Not that I ever put
much stock in those

00:07:03.647 --> 00:07:06.620
ridiculous "Super Saiyan"
legends they bandy about...

00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:09.091
but... I have always
believed it is better

00:07:09.158 --> 00:07:10.794
to err on the side of caution.

00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:14.301
And their little power
ups are worrying me...

00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:16.540
[Frieza laughs]
Eh, heh, heh...

00:07:16.607 --> 00:07:19.178
Very well... It would be a
relatively simple matter

00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:22.350
for me to obliterate you
all in my current form...

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:23.754
but rather than do that...

00:07:23.821 --> 00:07:26.693
It will be far more satisfying
to leave you with

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.568
one final vision more
terrifying than death...

00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:33.406
I don't much like
the sound of that.

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:35.845
Consider this my
parting gift to you!

00:07:35.912 --> 00:07:39.484
A nightmare beyond even
the horrors of Hell!

00:07:39.552 --> 00:07:43.594

ultimate form!

heal the others...

You brat...

00:10:42.217 --> 00:10:43.620
[Krillin] Anytime a
Saiyan like Vegeta

00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:44.856
nearly gets killed,

00:10:44.922 --> 00:10:46.860
when he recovers,
his power goes way up!

00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:48.362
You know about that, right?

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:50.200
[Gohan] Sure. Yeah.

00:10:50.267 --> 00:10:51.770
[Krillin] Well, that's
why Vegeta asked me

00:10:51.837 --> 00:10:53.907
to blast him half to hell...
He thought it would

00:10:53.974 --> 00:10:56.211
give him enough
power to beat Frieza.

00:10:57.214 --> 00:10:59.785
[Gohan] So do you
think it'll work?

00:11:01.857 --> 00:11:02.725
[Krillin] Dende!

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:04.461

It's you...

They say... that you have...
the power to heal...

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.187
Is... Is that true?

00:11:17.253 --> 00:11:18.924
[Dende] Yes!

keep coming back!

00:11:44.474 --> 00:11:45.644
[Piccolo] That's amazing.

00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:47.681
Do all Namekians
have this ability?

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:49.317
No... Only some can heal,

00:11:49.384 --> 00:11:52.892
just like only some are
warriors like you and Nail.

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:54.161
Never mind, Dende.

00:11:54.228 --> 00:11:56.299
Listen, Vegeta's in
bad shape over there,

00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:57.434
and he needs your help.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.071
I know he's not the
greatest guy in the world,

00:11:59.138 --> 00:12:02.244
but we can't win without him...

00:12:02.311 --> 00:12:05.182
That man, he's...
just like Frieza!

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:08.790
How many of my brothers
did he kill in cold blood?!

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.034
[Piccolo] Do it for me.

00:12:15.804 --> 00:12:18.476
I can handle Vegeta
when the time comes.

00:12:18.544 --> 00:12:23.352
But Frieza... there's no
way I can beat him alone.

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:31.769
[Frieza roars]
Rrrrraaaaahh!!

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:35.978
Great... Is that
what I think it is?

00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:39.017
Frieza's completed
his transformation.

00:12:40.386 --> 00:12:41.824
[Krillin] Damn it...
why didn't we just

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.661
mask our power levels
and hide somewhere

00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:44.996
when we had the chance?

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:46.633
It wouldn't do any good...

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.169
Frieza won't waste
time searching;

00:12:48.236 --> 00:12:50.808
he'll just blow up
the whole planet!

00:12:50.874 --> 00:12:53.079
What's stopping him?
Without the Dragon Balls,

00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:55.550
he has no use for this world!

00:13:16.192 --> 00:13:18.763
That power!
It's enormous!

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.468
I can't even get my
head around it...

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:23.239
Any ideas? Guys?

00:13:23.306 --> 00:13:24.943
'Cause we're about
to get creamed...

00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:26.680
Please... Dende... Hurry...

00:13:26.746 --> 00:13:29.885
It's... It's up to you
to heal Vegeta...

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.853
Thanks, Dende...

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.558
He's coming into view.
Get ready.

00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:26.264
You little wretch!

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:30.708
Consider yourself lucky

00:14:30.775 --> 00:14:33.345
that I didn't incinerate you.

00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:41.562
So, this is
Frieza's full power.

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:45.570
At last, we finally see what
we're really up against.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.115
Ha! Not that it matters
in the slightest.

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:53.554
I have become a Super Saiyan!

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.191
I am second to no one!

00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:16.933
[Piccolo gasps]

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.439
[Krillin shudders]

00:15:37.741 --> 00:15:39.712
Uh... Huh...

00:15:46.057 --> 00:15:47.629
Wait... am I
missin' somethin'?

00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:49.164
That's the big change?

00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:51.536
I was thinkin' he was gonna
come out all scary-looking...

00:15:51.603 --> 00:15:52.972
He's kinda' scrawny now...

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:54.375
[Piccolo]
Idiot. You know full well

00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:56.311
that an opponent's power
has nothing to do

00:15:56.378 --> 00:15:58.015
with their outward
appearance...

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:00.487
Frieza's previous forms were
tame compared to this...

00:16:00.554 --> 00:16:02.056
Yeah, but...

00:16:03.894 --> 00:16:05.997
Ahh! It's hopeless!

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:07.300
After all of my training,

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:08.803
and everything you
went through to collect

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.675
the Dragon Balls
and wish me back...

00:16:10.741 --> 00:16:12.343
it was all for nothing!

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.680
[Gohan shudders]

00:16:13.747 --> 00:16:15.382
I'm sorry, Gohan...

00:16:15.449 --> 00:16:18.990
I won't be able to save you
this time. Not from him.

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:20.459
But Piccolo...

00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:24.000
[Goku]
Gah... I don't
believe this...

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:27.508
Frieza's power just
skyrocketed again.

00:16:27.575 --> 00:16:30.145
Damn, this is bad...

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:36.792
[all shudder]

00:16:41.603 --> 00:16:43.473
[Piccolo gasps]

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.709
"Bang."

00:16:44.775 --> 00:16:45.911
[Krillin shudders]
Ahhh...

00:16:45.978 --> 00:16:47.915
[Piccolo grunts]
Mmph... hnhhh...

00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:50.186
[Gohan shudders]
Aaahhhh...

00:16:50.253 --> 00:16:52.456
[Vegeta gasps]
Ah--aahhh...

00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:55.564
[Dende screams]
Ahhh!

00:16:57.467 --> 00:16:59.605
[all gasp]

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:08.055
[all shudder]

00:17:08.122 --> 00:17:10.627
What...? Why him?

00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:20.547
No... Dende!

00:17:20.614 --> 00:17:22.350
[Piccolo]
I didn't even see him fire!

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:25.724
It was an instant!
No time to react!

00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:30.165
What in the hell has he become?!

00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:34.808
That should speed things up...

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:37.213
One less pest to
deal with... right?

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.451
[Frieza chuckles]

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:42.023
[Gohan shudders]

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.762
No... Dende...

00:17:44.829 --> 00:17:46.565
[Frieza chuckles]

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:49.104
[Goku]
Someone just went down...

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.945
Who? Who was it?
Damn it! I'm sick of this!

00:17:53.012 --> 00:17:55.650
I need to know what's
going on out there!

00:17:56.787 --> 00:17:59.123
[Frieza chuckles]

00:18:06.004 --> 00:18:10.012
Dende... Why him?
He wasn't even fighting!

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:11.415
[Piccolo]
But we were!

00:18:11.482 --> 00:18:13.352
Damn it... Frieza
must've realized

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:15.289
he'd have a tough time
finishing all of us off

00:18:15.356 --> 00:18:18.863
while we had Dende
here to heal us.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.270
That made him
the prime target...

00:18:22.337 --> 00:18:24.808
[Gohan]
He's gonna pay!

00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:28.315
What? He's gone!

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:38.704
[all shudder]

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.607
[Vegeta]
Those fools!

00:18:41.374 --> 00:18:42.912
Where... Where'd he go?

00:18:42.978 --> 00:18:44.848
[Frieza]
Right behind you.

00:18:46.586 --> 00:18:50.828
[all shudder]

00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:52.931
[Frieza chuckles]

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:54.902
He's so fast...

00:18:57.373 --> 00:18:59.277
[Frieza]
I promised you, didn't I?

00:18:59.344 --> 00:19:00.915
That I'd show you a nightmare

00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:03.619
beyond the horrors of Hell?

00:19:05.256 --> 00:19:08.262
Of course, I had hoped
to include all of you...

00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:09.532
But from the looks of things,

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:12.203
it seems the little one
won't be joining us.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.074
Such a shame, don't you think?

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.311
[Gohan shudders and growls]

00:19:16.378 --> 00:19:17.614
When you see him
in the next world,

00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:20.053
I suppose you'll have to
tell him what he missed.

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:24.461
[Gohan yells]
Haaaaaaa!!

00:19:24.528 --> 00:19:27.334

Yaaaaaah!!

Take this!

00:20:14.528 --> 00:20:15.830
Hmm.

00:20:21.207 --> 00:20:23.546
Hey! Where you goin'?!

Haaaaaa!!

Did you hit him?!

00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:48.563
[Krillin]
He disappeared again.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.000
Great... but where is he now?

Frieza has unleashed another
burst of deadly power,

and Gohan stands
directly in its path!

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.077
Does any hope remain,
now that Frieza

00:21:29.143 --> 00:21:30.881
has revealed his true form?
