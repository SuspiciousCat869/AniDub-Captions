you two saved the world.

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:23.038
[GOHAN] Don't
say that to me...

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:26.378
I should have finished the
fight when I had the chance...

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:28.851
I let my power take
control of me...

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:31.890
I did this...
It's all my fault.

00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:36.700
[KRILLIN] Look... You can't
be so hard on yourself...

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.703
Whether it controlled you
or the other way around,

00:08:38.804 --> 00:08:43.346
your power saved
us... That's a fact.

00:08:43.446 --> 00:08:44.649
[KRILLIN] Don't tell
me you didn't see

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:46.586
the look on your dad's
face before he left?

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:49.358
C'mon. If that wasn't
the smile of a proud papa,

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:51.028
I don't know what is.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.203
[KRILLIN] Now...
Chin up... Right?

00:08:56.973 --> 00:08:57.942
Let's go.

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:11.703

00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:45.838

Sorry, Bubbles.

00:09:45.938 --> 00:09:47.340
And sorry to
you too Gregory...

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.648
I didn't mean to drag you
guys into this mess as well.

[KING KAI] Goku...
What you did...

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:54.188
it was just
absolutely ludicrous...

00:09:54.288 --> 00:09:55.825
I mean I'm King Kai...

00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:57.995
I have a whole galaxy
to watch over...!

00:09:58.096 --> 00:10:00.634
It's kind of a
big deal, you know?!

00:10:01.937 --> 00:10:04.208
[KING KAI]
I'm livid... Furious...!

00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:07.648
You took advantage of me for
the sake of a single planet...!

00:10:07.748 --> 00:10:10.253
Exploited me like a
neighbor's lawn mower!

[GOKU]
Oh, come on.

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:12.792
I told you I was
sorry, didn't I...?

00:10:12.892 --> 00:10:14.562
What else do you
want me to do...?

00:10:14.662 --> 00:10:15.832
Hey, in my position I bet

00:10:15.932 --> 00:10:17.768
you would've done
the exact same thing.

00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:21.777
[KING KAI] Oh yeah...?!
Glad you know me so well...!

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:24.248
Now do us all a favor...
and shut your trap!

00:10:24.348 --> 00:10:25.416
[GOKU]
Take it easy.

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:28.222
[GOKU] Kind of strange,
don't you think...?

00:10:28.322 --> 00:10:31.095
I'm not seeing Cell
anywhere... Huh...

00:10:31.195 --> 00:10:33.265
Guess he just got sent
straight down below, huh?

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:36.906
[KING KAI] Wait, wait, wait,
wait... no, no, no, no!

00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:40.848
[KING KAI] He's isn't
here...! He's gone...!

00:10:40.948 --> 00:10:42.016
It all makes sense...

00:10:42.117 --> 00:10:44.020
Because... no matter
who you are...

00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:47.595
we all go to Yama's
place first...

00:10:47.695 --> 00:10:49.866
[GOKU] What is that
supposed to mean?

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:53.472
[KING KAI] Well...
It can only mean one thing.

00:10:53.573 --> 00:10:54.408
He's back!

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:56.144
[GOKU] He's what?!

00:11:11.944 --> 00:11:13.814
[VEGETA] Hold it...
I hope for your sake

00:11:13.914 --> 00:11:16.418
you're not planning
to restore that thing.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.957
If it's still active...
destroy it.

00:11:19.057 --> 00:11:20.928
[KRILLIN] But...
I mean... Come on.

00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:22.363
She's really
not all that bad

00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:24.067
once you've gotten to
know her a little bit.

00:11:24.168 --> 00:11:26.873
[VEGETA] Hmph!
You're a fool! Tsk!

[PICCOLO]
What the...?!

00:11:52.558 --> 00:11:55.230
[VEGETA] No...
It... can't be...!

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.365
[TRUNKS]
That power...!

00:11:56.733 --> 00:11:59.104
[PICCOLO]
But... But how?!

00:11:59.204 --> 00:12:02.377
[crashes]

00:12:05.952 --> 00:12:08.322
[TRUNKS]
Aaahh!!

00:12:08.422 --> 00:12:09.892
[VEGETA]
Huh?

00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:22.283
[CELL] Now whose scream
was that? Ah yes: Trunks.

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:56.787
[YAMCHA] How can
this be happening?

00:12:56.887 --> 00:12:59.258
[GOKU] No! How can
he still be okay?!

00:12:59.358 --> 00:13:00.426
You've got to be wrong!

00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:03.366
I watched him completely
vanish with my own eyes!

00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:05.905
[KING KAI] I don't yet
know how it's possible...

00:13:06.005 --> 00:13:09.177
But I'm afraid there's not
much room for doubt here.

00:13:11.215 --> 00:13:13.052
[GOKU]
That's not fair...!

00:13:13.152 --> 00:13:14.120
So what you're basically
telling me is that

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.891
I did all that
for nothing?!

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:17.594
[KING KAI]
I wish it weren't so.

00:13:27.114 --> 00:13:29.552
[CELL]
Heh heh heh heh...

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:31.924
[CELL]
Surprised to see me?

00:13:32.024 --> 00:13:34.996
Allow me...
to explain.

00:13:35.096 --> 00:13:36.499
[CELL] This is all
what you might refer

I suppose you might call
it a kind of nucleus...

00:13:47.287 --> 00:13:50.093
Left untouched,
it's extremely useful...

00:13:50.193 --> 00:13:53.867
As long as it's intact
I can renew indefinitely.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.022
[CELL] Now
fortunately for me,

00:14:05.122 --> 00:14:10.266
that nasty little explosion
didn't damage it one bit.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.119
[CELL]
And here's the part

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.321
that's really
going to get you...

00:14:21.422 --> 00:14:23.760
I wasn't even
planning on this...

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.933
It was pure luck,
nothing more.

00:14:32.778 --> 00:14:34.081
[CELL] Luckier still
was the fact that,

00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:35.416
even without Eighteen,

00:14:35.517 --> 00:14:39.792
I managed to regenerate
into my perfect form...

00:14:39.892 --> 00:14:43.332
[CELL] Or should I say,
a more perfect form.

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:46.438
Like Gohan, my power
increased exponentially...

00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:49.979
It seems this body has taken
a cue from Saiyan biology

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:52.918
and extrapolated from
near-crushing defeat

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:57.060
giving me infinite
stores of strength.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.831
[CELL]
As an added bonus,

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:00.199
I even managed
to pick up

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:03.640
Goku's Instant
Transmission technique.

00:15:09.217 --> 00:15:11.121
[CELL] Now... I was
able to return to you

00:15:11.221 --> 00:15:13.993
in the best shape
of my life so far.

00:15:14.093 --> 00:15:16.164
[CELL] Triumph may have
been what Goku intended,

00:15:16.264 --> 00:15:20.072
but who knew he meant for
me to have it all to myself?

00:15:28.222 --> 00:15:32.330
[GOHAN]
Hyaaargh!

00:15:35.403 --> 00:15:37.174
[CELL] Something
amuse you?

00:15:37.407 --> 00:15:39.545
[GOHAN] I'm glad
you're back.

00:15:40.947 --> 00:15:41.716
[CELL]
That so...

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:42.952
[GOHAN]
Oh yeah...

00:15:43.052 --> 00:15:44.154
It was because of
my mistake that Dad

00:15:44.254 --> 00:15:45.524
had to sacrifice himself.

00:15:45.624 --> 00:15:48.195
It's my fualt you to
put us in that position...

00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:51.268
[GOHAN] I'd have given
anything for a chance

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:54.842
to do it over again...
Now I get one.

00:15:54.943 --> 00:15:56.077
[CELL]
Hmph!

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.984
[CELL] Then let's see
if you've got the power

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:00.787
to back up your words...

00:16:00.888 --> 00:16:03.492
Luck won't be on
your side this time.

[PICCOLO]
No, Gohan!

00:19:57.894 --> 00:19:59.798
[KRILLIN] Vegeta, what
were you thinking...?!

00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:01.569
It's not like we can't
just wish Trunks back

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:03.673
to life with
the Dragon Balls!

00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:09.317
[CELL] Heh...

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:12.456
I see that fighting spirit
hasn't diminished at all.

00:20:14.294 --> 00:20:18.002
[CELL] But... I am
done playing games...

00:20:18.102 --> 00:20:19.538
