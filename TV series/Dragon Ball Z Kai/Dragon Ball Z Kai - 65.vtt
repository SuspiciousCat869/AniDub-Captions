His strange glow has faded

00:15:47.126 --> 00:15:50.534
[17] and look, his hair has
gone back to its black color

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:52.203
What an odd phenomenon.

00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:55.744
[18]
The other one was the same way.

00:15:55.778 --> 00:15:57.648
[17]
That's true.

00:16:00.153 --> 00:16:02.290
I can t help but
wonder who he is...

There s nothing in our data...

00:16:04.194 --> 00:16:07.033
Well... I suppose
it doesn t matter.

That should heal them
completely, right?

00:16:51.087 --> 00:16:52.724
Tell them something for us...

00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:54.193
If they ever feel up to it

00:16:54.227 --> 00:16:56.298
we ll be glad to
take them on again.

we ll find him on our own.

Besides If we go out
and cause enough trouble...

come looking for us.

[17]
What are you looking at, 16?

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:46.766
There were birds here

so all the birds flew away.

Birds, huh?

00:17:51.408 --> 00:17:53.613
[18] Listen, this road doesn t
seem like it gets much traffic.

00:17:53.647 --> 00:17:54.616
If we want to get noticed,

00:17:54.649 --> 00:17:57.788
we need to find a
place with more people.

00:18:05.637 --> 00:18:07.508
[17] You re right about
the lack of traffic.

00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:09.511
An area with more
humans would definitely

00:18:09.545 --> 00:18:11.515
be better suited
to our needs.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:13.520
I m all for
relocating if you are.

00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:16.191
[18] When we do, I want to
find a change of clothes.

There s no reason to
keep fighting in rags.

it unanimous, Number 16?

Yes.

we can do for you?

00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:33.359
Yeah... There s just one
thing I need to know...

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:34.762
What is it that you re after?

00:18:34.795 --> 00:18:37.601
[KRILLIN Is it Goku?
Or something bigger than that?

Are you trying to take
over the world? What?!

00:18:40.206 --> 00:18:43.045
[17]
For now, it s beating Goku...

00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:45.416
and once we ve done
that, we ll have to see

Why are you after him?

[KRILLIN]
What did Goku ever do to you?

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:53.265
Gero s the one that hated him

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.370
and he s gone so
why do you care...?!

00:18:55.403 --> 00:18:57.206
Why can t you just
leave everyone alone?!

Dr. Gero has
nothing to do with it.

You see, Krillin
We re playing a game.

00:19:02.718 --> 00:19:05.056
Did you... say a game...?

00:19:05.089 --> 00:19:06.827

why you re doing this...?

you to tell me where Goku is

00:19:21.656 --> 00:19:24.895
forget this game and
walk away...? Would you?

00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:34.214
Negative...
