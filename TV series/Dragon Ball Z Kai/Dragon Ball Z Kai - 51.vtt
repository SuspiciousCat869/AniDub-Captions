00:00:28.658 --> 00:00:30.995
King Kai...! You okay?

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.501
What did you just see?

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:37.174
What incredible power...!
But wait...

00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:38.410
Something s wrong.

00:00:38.443 --> 00:00:40.615
Shenron should have
granted our wish by now.

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:43.486
[KAMI] Hurry, Shenron...
time s running out.

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.859
Please, return to us
all those who

00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:48.063
fell to Frieza and his
evil soldiers...

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:49.800
Once the Grand Elder returned...

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:53.507
then the dragon of Namek
should reappear, as well.

00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:55.277
If we re to save
Goku and the others

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.684
before Namek is destroyed,
this is our only hope!

[FRIEZA]
Ha...! Take that!

00:03:31.022 --> 00:03:36.099
Did you think... you could
actually win? You... defeat me?

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.971
[FRIEZA LAUGHS]

00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:43.614
Dad s energy has faded...
It s just suddenly... gone.

00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:49.926
What...? But... he s okay,
right? He s not... you know.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.204
[GOHAN] Get going. Take Piccolo
back to Earth without me.

00:03:55.237 --> 00:03:56.339
I m staying here.

00:03:56.373 --> 00:03:58.744
Whoa, whoa... What?!

00:03:59.713 --> 00:04:01.249
Gohan!

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.621
Don t do this!

00:04:03.654 --> 00:04:05.390
I m my father s son, Bulma...

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:07.529
Dad fought Frieza
cause he had to...

00:04:07.562 --> 00:04:11.603
Because it was him or us... I
have to finish what he started.

00:04:11.637 --> 00:04:14.542
No...! You don t...!
You can t win!

00:04:14.576 --> 00:04:17.314
I can try...
Piccolo would understand.

00:04:17.348 --> 00:04:20.454
It s what he and Dad
would ve wanted.

00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:24.762
Bye, Bulma... Be safe.

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:26.901
[GOHAN THINKS] There s only
one thing I can do...

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.904
I just hope it works!

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:46.306
What s going on...?
This doesn t make any sense!

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:49.111
It s impossible...
We shouldn t still be here.

00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:52.652
What s happening...? Why
is the ground shaking like this?

00:04:52.686 --> 00:04:57.093
Whatever it is, it s bad...
The sky is pitch black!

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:05.043
Where in the world am I...?
And how did I end up here?

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.981
It is done... All those
on Planet Namek who were

00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:28.991
defeated by Freiza and his men
have been restored to health.

00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:30.393
That s great news.

00:05:30.427 --> 00:05:33.867
Until we meet again.

00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:40.614
...! He did it! They re back...!

00:05:40.648 --> 00:05:42.819
Shenron has
brought everyone back!

00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:43.520
Awesome!

00:05:43.554 --> 00:05:45.056
You re sure it s everyone?

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.829
The Grand Elder returned, didn t
he...? And the Namekian dragon?

00:05:47.862 --> 00:05:50.768
[KING KAI] Of course! At least,
I think so. If the others are

00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:52.605
back, the Grand
Elder should be.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.441
And if the Grand
Elder is back...

00:05:54.474 --> 00:05:57.214
Yes... the sky on Namek
has gone completely dark,

00:05:57.247 --> 00:06:00.453
which must mean...
Hold on, let me check.

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:03.894
What is this...? The sky

00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:07.802
This must be a sign...
The planet is weakening.

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:09.506
I ve got to get off of
this miserable rock

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.610
while I still have time...

00:06:11.643 --> 00:06:14.281
I ve already sustained a
considerable amount of damage.

00:06:14.314 --> 00:06:18.089
I can t get caught in an
explosion that size.

00:06:20.761 --> 00:06:23.200
No...! What now?

00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:28.276
What has happened to
me...? What s this...?

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:32.183
Why have I been revived
from my slumber?

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.228
Wonderful...!
It s just like we planned!

00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:55.999
So there s still time...
but not much...!

00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:58.302
Hurry up and tell them
what to wish for!

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:01.643
He s right... Our wish will only
last as long as the Grand Elder!

00:07:01.676 --> 00:07:04.314
Don t you think I know that?!

00:07:04.347 --> 00:07:06.586
Grand Elder of the
Planet Namek...

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:10.126
This is King Kai of the
Northern Galaxy speaking.

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:12.197
Go on, King Kai.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.005
[KING KAI] I need you to listen
closely; it s very important.

00:07:21.883 --> 00:07:26.860
Where re you going...?
Don t tell me you re giving up.

00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:31.803
[LAUGHS]

00:07:36.513 --> 00:07:39.986
It seems foolishness
runs in your family.

[FRIEZA] You don t stand a
chance against me, kid.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:46.466
Sad, really...
You can t help it...

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.902
Even when you re outmatched,

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:51.275
Saiyans don t know
when to quit.

00:07:52.077 --> 00:07:57.722
Well...? Little Saiyan...
You have one chance.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.549
Where do you
think you re going?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.860
[FRIEZA] Slow down!

00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:27.381
Pathetic... Well, this shouldn t
take long... Should it boy?

00:08:27.414 --> 00:08:28.517
[GOHAN THINKING]
I ve just got to keep him

00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:30.888
distracted for a few
more minutes...

00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:32.759
The only way to beat him
is to make sure he s

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:35.998
still on the planet
when it explodes...

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:47.154
Hold on... I just had
an excellent idea.

00:08:47.956 --> 00:08:52.532
I ll destroy Earth next... in
honor of you and your father.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.803
Go on... You may thank me...

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:58.209
I have been more than
merciful... It s only polite.

00:08:58.242 --> 00:09:01.248
[FRIEZA LAUGHS]

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:11.569
Good... You still have
some fight left in you.

00:09:15.243 --> 00:09:19.018
[GOHAN THINKING]
Just a little longer. Come on!

00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:24.962
That brat...
What is he trying to pull? No!

00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:34.114
I ve finally figured
out your little scheme.

00:09:34.147 --> 00:09:40.059
You ve been stalling for
time.I see that I m right.

00:09:40.092 --> 00:09:44.134
You want to let an exploding
planet do your dirty work.

00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:45.904
For shame.

00:09:45.938 --> 00:09:48.409
You... you killed my dad.

00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:50.614
And Krillin, too...
and the others...

00:09:50.647 --> 00:09:53.352
Because of you... they re gone!

00:09:57.093 --> 00:10:01.301
I m going to make you pay
for what you did to them!

00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:11.188
Masenko... Ha!

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:25.951
About time you showed
some backbone...

00:10:25.984 --> 00:10:29.057
Rather impressive for a
toddler, I must say.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.028
[FRIEZA]
But enough fun and games.

00:10:31.061 --> 00:10:33.834
It s time I let you in
on a little secret.

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:36.773
I m not fighting at full
power... Not yet...

00:10:36.807 --> 00:10:40.012
Not like I did...
with your lame... father.

00:10:45.423 --> 00:10:48.429
[GOHAN THINKS]
Dad... Piccolo

00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:52.370
It s over.

00:11:00.453 --> 00:11:02.156
What?!

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.230
You re okay!

00:11:22.263 --> 00:11:24.167
Get out of here!

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.173
I told you, get to
the ship and go!

00:11:27.206 --> 00:11:28.375
But... But Dad!

00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:29.377
Go!

00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:31.281
Yes, Sir!

00:11:34.623 --> 00:11:36.491
Bye, Dad.

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:41.068
[FRIEZA] You really are a pesky
one, aren t you...?

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:44.575
You could have stayed out of
sight and accepted your fate...

00:11:44.609 --> 00:11:47.113
A deck hand going
down with the ship.

00:11:47.147 --> 00:11:49.251
Foolishness must be
a virtue on Earth;

00:11:49.284 --> 00:11:52.056
you all seem to
value it so highly...

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.928
It s almost unbelievable
that you would choose

00:11:53.961 --> 00:11:56.833
to face someone who wields
the power I possess.

00:11:56.867 --> 00:11:59.906
What s unbelievable is how
you can still be so arrogant.

00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:04.982
What?!Fine, have it your way

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:07.688
I ll just blast you
into oblivion...

00:12:07.722 --> 00:12:10.928
like I did that
other Earthling.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.303
What other Earthling
are you talking about...?

00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:17.841
You mean Krillin, don t you?

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:25.958
You ll... pay for that!

00:12:57.588 --> 00:13:00.427
[KING KAI] As you can tell,
Grand Elder, Namek could explode

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.167
any moment now, taking
everyone on the planet with it.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.303
But there should still be one

00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:08.409
wish left on the
Namekian Dragon Balls.

00:13:08.443 --> 00:13:11.717
[GRAND ELDER] Yes, King Kai.
I believe you're right.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.152
[KING KAI]
Then we have to move quickly!

00:13:13.186 --> 00:13:14.922
We won t get a
second shot at this.

00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:17.060
You have to tell your dragon
to transport everyone

00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:19.064
except for Frieza
to Planet Earth.

00:13:19.097 --> 00:13:21.435
I understand your lordship.

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:24.374
And I realize that time
is of the essence.

00:13:24.408 --> 00:13:27.481
[GRAND ELDER] Unfortunately, one
must convey their wish directly

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.417
for it to take effect.

00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:32.324
But I might be able to
contact someone close by

00:13:32.357 --> 00:13:33.727
and ask them to make
the request in perso--

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.098
[GOKU]
No, don t do it!

00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:38.904
You have to change the wish!

00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:41.409
Goku? Have you
been listening in?

00:13:41.442 --> 00:13:42.845
What s this?

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.456
[GOKU] Don t make the
wish everyone on Namek

00:13:48.489 --> 00:13:49.759
except for Frieza ...

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:54.234
Make it everyone on Planet
Namek except for Frieza and me!'

00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:57.073
Look, Goku... I know how
you feel, but you ve got

00:13:57.107 --> 00:14:00.312
to leave Namek and
get back home soon!

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:13.673
[GOKU] If you even think about
taking me out of this battle--

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:15.544
[GOKU]
I ll never forgive you!

00:14:15.578 --> 00:14:17.214
[KING KAI]
But... Goku!

00:14:17.247 --> 00:14:19.451
[GOKU]
Please, King Kai.

00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:23.860
I m not sure, Goku

00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:26.164
[GOKU] Just do it, and fast!
This whole place is

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.368
going to blow any second!

00:14:32.243 --> 00:14:35.450
Fine, Goku... I can see
your mind s made up.

00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:40.025
If you want it that
badly, I won t stop you.

00:14:42.732 --> 00:14:46.471
The last thing I remember
is Frieza and a flash of light!

00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:50.781
Dende is the closest...
Dende, can you hear me?

00:14:50.814 --> 00:14:52.116
This is the Grand Elder.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.421
You re okay!
How? What happened t--

00:14:54.455 --> 00:14:56.258
[GRAND ELDER]
There s no time for questions!

00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:58.764
I need you to do something
very important!

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:01.368
Porunga should be
somewhere close to you,

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:04.374
waiting for the third
wish... Can you see him?

00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:07.214
Yes, Sir. He s right
in front of me.

00:15:07.247 --> 00:15:09.519
There must still be one
wish left to make.

00:15:09.552 --> 00:15:14.127
Go to him at once... It s up to
you to make the final wish.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.632
Yes, Sir... of course,
but what is it?

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:19.003
[GRAND ELDER] Tell him that we
wish for everyone on Namek

00:15:19.037 --> 00:15:22.343
to be relocated to the
planet Earth, except for

00:15:22.377 --> 00:15:26.586
Frieza and Goku. Now hurry,
Dende! Time is short!

00:15:29.725 --> 00:15:34.267
Okay... If Gohan was right...
we re ready to launch

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:36.238
Why did he have to run off and

00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:38.877
pick a fight with Frieza
in the first place?

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.346
If he d gone to
find Goku instead,

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:43.252
we d all be on our
way home by now!

00:15:44.522 --> 00:15:46.659
[VEGETA THINKING]]
I shouldn t be here...

00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:49.364
Not after what
Frieza did to me!

00:15:54.842 --> 00:15:57.046
[GOHAN THINKING]
Hurry, Dad.

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:03.727
[KING KAI] Be sure you get back
to Earth safely, Goku.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.762
[GOKU] You ve got
your own worlds

00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:06.132
to take care of, King Kai.

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:08.335
I ll handle this one.

00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:14.213
So that s Namek s
eternal dragon, huh?

00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:18.455
Alright, then... Now I can fight
you without holding back.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.873
[FRIEZA THINKING] The dragon!
It s returned somehow!

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:28.142
Then that means...

00:16:28.176 --> 00:16:31.750
the Dragon Balls didn t
turn to stone after all!

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.254
This is my chance.

00:16:36.993 --> 00:16:38.696
Wait!

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.394
Stay out of my way!

00:16:54.427 --> 00:16:56.431
Where are they?

00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:03.813
[GRAND ELDER]
It s up to you now, Dende.

00:17:03.846 --> 00:17:06.619
[KING KAI]
Please get there soon!

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:15.236
Porunga!

00:17:22.785 --> 00:17:26.926
I am here, young one...
Have you another wish to make?

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:29.163
Yes...! Yes, I do!

00:17:34.007 --> 00:17:37.581
Then... speak your wish now.

00:17:37.615 --> 00:17:41.756
Right... Here goes
Porunga our last wish is--

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:45.396
[FRIEZA] Grant immortality
to the mighty Frieza!

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.298
No, don t!

00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:47.668
Oh, no! It s Frieza!

00:17:47.702 --> 00:17:53.913
I wish that I... Frieza-- be
granted... eternal life!

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:56.017
Poporunga, Frieza pot Goku

00:17:56.051 --> 00:18:01.261
pupirito... lonlonpa
papipupo paro!

00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:07.808
I have heard your wish
and will fulfill it gladly.

00:18:07.842 --> 00:18:11.615
All living beings save the
ones known as Goku and Frieza

00:18:11.649 --> 00:18:14.420
shall be transported
to Planet Earth.

00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:18.563
Why, you little brat!

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.744
Frieza!

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:31.121
Vegeta.

00:18:39.304 --> 00:18:44.715
Well, Kakarot... I see you ve
become a Super Saiyan at last.

00:18:45.517 --> 00:18:49.726
Vegeta...? How are you here?
I defeated you!

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:51.762
Sorry! It didn t take!

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:09.865
I shall take my leave. Farwell.

00:19:23.225 --> 00:19:25.429
Wait...! Not yet!

00:19:41.127 --> 00:19:44.167
Sorry, Frieza. It looks like
your luck s finally run out...

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.873
It s a shame you don t
speak Namekian, isn t it.

00:19:46.906 --> 00:19:48.844
You had me a little worried
for a minute there.

00:19:48.877 --> 00:19:52.283
I already took care of that kid.
Where did he come from?

00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:54.420
My friends used the Dragon
Balls on Earth to bring back

00:19:54.454 --> 00:19:57.093
everybody that you and your
goons had taken from us.

00:19:57.126 --> 00:19:58.429
What?!

00:19:58.462 --> 00:20:02.470
So we got our last wish
on the Dragon Balls here.

00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:05.944
And the wish the little Namekian
runt just made-- what it was!

00:20:05.977 --> 00:20:07.447
You haven t figured it out yet?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.585
He used the last wish to have
everyone on Planet Namek

00:20:09.618 --> 00:20:12.824
moved to Earth
except for you and me.

00:20:25.482 --> 00:20:28.623
The planet is beginning to
collapse... In two minutes

00:20:28.657 --> 00:20:31.629
Namek will be a cloud
of dust and a memory.

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:34.602
There is only thing that
remains to be seen...

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:37.039
Whether I can end this in
the next two minutes...

00:20:37.073 --> 00:20:38.676
or if you can
continue to fight up

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.647
until the moment the
planet explodes...

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.452
then float forever...
in outer space.

00:20:43.485 --> 00:20:46.257
All I know... is that I ve
been waiting for this moment

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:48.830
for a long time... and I
will finally get to see

00:20:48.863 --> 00:20:51.536
which one of us is the greatest
warrior in the universe!

00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:54.809
Well... It appears I was wrong
about you... You didn t run

00:20:54.842 --> 00:20:59.417
off with your tail between your
legs at the first opportunity.

00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:12.678
Hand-to-hand combat,
eh...? Oh, alright...

00:21:12.711 --> 00:21:15.917
My, this really is
important to you, isn t it?

00:21:18.689 --> 00:21:20.894
<i>[NARRATOR] On a desolate,
crumbling planet,</i>

00:21:20.927 --> 00:21:23.666
