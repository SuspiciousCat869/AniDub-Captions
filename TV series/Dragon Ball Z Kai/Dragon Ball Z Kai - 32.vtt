[Narrator] Last Dragon Ball Z
Kai: Having finally arrived

00:00:04.408 --> 00:00:07.516
on Planet Namek, Goku
demonstrated his new strength

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.287
by easily overpowering
the Ginyu Force.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.757
But will Goku
have what it takes

00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:16.332
to face Captain Ginyu himself?
The battle continues now!

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:26.720
♪ Opening Song ♪

00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:55.531
These two are still alive,
but they probably need to see

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:57.334
a doctor...
If you want to help 'em,

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.405
come pick 'em up
and get off this planet.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.276
Don't be absurd, Kakarot!

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:03.881
Finish them off now while
you still have the chance!

00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:05.751
No, I've already
made my point.

00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:06.687
This fight is over.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.292
They're not a threat
to anyone like this.

00:02:09.325 --> 00:02:12.164
This can't be real...
We're unstoppable...

00:02:12.197 --> 00:02:14.368
The one and only Ginyu Force!

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.281
We are hands down the toughest,
meanest group of warriors

00:02:20.314 --> 00:02:22.886
ever assembled...
a freakin' force of nature!

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.422
Nobody stops us!

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:27.663
So how did this no power-level
weakling do this?!

00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:32.138
Damn it! He's beating
us to a bloody pulp.

00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:35.110
And there's not a
thing I can do about it,

00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:36.279
not on my own!

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:38.150
[Gohan]
He's getting away!

00:02:38.183 --> 00:02:39.686
Huh? Are you kiddin' me?

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.391
He's just gonna run off
and leave his friends behind?

00:02:43.794 --> 00:02:45.163
[Krillin] Hey...

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:47.502
Who are you and what
have you done with Goku?

00:02:48.904 --> 00:02:51.009
[flying sounds]

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:52.411
Vegeta!

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.452
[Vegeta laughing]

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:02.799
[explosion]

00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:13.253
What's wrong with you?!
I told you we didn't have

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:15.324
to worry about
those guys anymore.

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:18.831
They were done... they couldn't
even defend themselves.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.469
They got exactly
what they deserved.

00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:24.442
And you...
you make me sick.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.181
What were you thinking, letting
the last one get away?!

00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:28.550
With your new strength,

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:30.688
you could have finished
him without batting an eye!

00:03:32.626 --> 00:03:35.196
Ha! But it seems
you're still as soft as ever.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.935
You're no Super Saiyan,
that much is certain.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:39.739
What the... a Super Saiyan?

00:03:39.773 --> 00:03:41.543
What good is all that power
if you don't have the

00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:44.516
killer instinct to finish the
job?! You'll never beat Frieza

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.088
like that, not even if
you were immortal.

00:03:47.121 --> 00:03:48.490
You don't have a clue...

00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:50.862
That tyrant is going to
chew you up and spit you out!

00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:53.768
Look, I don't really like to
brag, but I think I've gotten

00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:55.971
just about as strong
as a person can get...

00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:58.443
And even with that, you're
still saying this Frieza guy's

00:03:58.476 --> 00:03:59.980
going to beat me so easily?

00:04:00.013 --> 00:04:04.188
Effortlessly... fool. Don't
overestimate your own ability.

00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:05.991
Frieza won't go down lightly...

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:09.800
...his power is far
greater than you can imagine!

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.035
Oh, come on!

00:04:11.068 --> 00:04:13.340
You've gotta be exaggerating
just a little bit, right?

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:16.079
You saw for yourself
how awesome Goku is now.

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:17.481
Uh-huh.

00:04:17.515 --> 00:04:19.619
Those Ginyus were crazy
strong and Goku beat 'em easy.

00:04:19.652 --> 00:04:22.859
How much tougher could
Frieza be? I mean, really?

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:26.733
I don't see either of
you raring to take him on.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.304
At any rate, he's obtained
all seven Dragon Balls,

00:04:29.338 --> 00:04:30.440
which means he's
more than likely

00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:32.311
gained immortality by now.

00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:33.446
Any thoughts of defeating him

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.316
are sheer
fantasy at this point.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.955
The best we can hope for
is not to run into him.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.462
I've got a feeling that Frieza

00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:44.201
hasn't had his
wish granted yet.

00:04:44.235 --> 00:04:45.872
What do you mean? Why not?

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:49.011
Well... it hasn't gotten dark.
If the Dragon Balls here

00:04:49.045 --> 00:04:52.218
are anything like the ones back
on Earth... the sky turns black

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:53.687
when Shenron appears.

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:56.526
We would've noticed
something as obvious as that.

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:01.670
So... Shenron hasn't appeared.

00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:04.007
Shenron?! What the
hell is a Shenron?!

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:06.814
You mean to tell me this thing
comes out of the Dragon Balls

00:05:06.847 --> 00:05:07.749
when they're collected?

00:05:07.782 --> 00:05:09.485
Of course!
It makes perfect sense!

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.024
Frieza has no idea
what the password is!

00:05:12.057 --> 00:05:14.228
He probably thought he'd have
his wish granted the second

00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.799
he brought all seven together!

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:19.639
There's a password?
Why didn't I know this?!

00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:21.075
You know what
that means, right?

00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:23.714
There's still a chance for
us to get our wish granted!

00:05:23.747 --> 00:05:24.983
Awesome!

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:26.787
How about that?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.489
So, if we hurry
up and get moving

00:05:28.524 --> 00:05:32.064
then we can bring everyone
back... just like we promised!

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.065
Yay!

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.201
Um, but first we
gotta find a way

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.640
to get the Dragon
Balls back, right?

00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:38.844
[Vegeta Thinking]
Shenron?

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:41.149
[Ginyu] Are you kidding me?!

00:05:41.182 --> 00:05:45.356
Guldo, Recoome and Burter
have all been taken out?!

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.360
Yes... but sir,
the craziest part

00:05:47.394 --> 00:05:48.631
is the guy
that did it.

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:51.369
Don't be stupid!
We are the Ginyu Force!

00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:52.838
We're unbeatable!

00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:55.177
An elite fighting unit made
up of the best of the best!

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.316
Our might is second to
none but Lord Frieza himself!

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.719
That's what I
thought too, sir;

00:05:59.753 --> 00:06:01.122
but you should
have seen it...

00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:02.391
...he was
inconceivable!

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:04.295
[Ginyu Growls]

00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:06.499
So those three
disappearing power levels

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.470
weren't a scouter
malfunction after all.

00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:10.473
What the hell are
we dealing with here?

00:06:10.508 --> 00:06:12.845
Sir! We have to
tell Lord Frieza.

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.221
Are you insane?! And lose our
heads along with our dignity?!

00:06:17.254 --> 00:06:19.592
We're lucky that
Lord Frieza isn't here.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.997
[chuckles]

00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:25.638
Just leave this to me,
I'll handle it.

00:06:25.672 --> 00:06:29.245
They don't call me
Captain Ginyu for nothing.

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:30.915
Yes... whatever
you say, sir.

00:06:30.948 --> 00:06:33.920
You men, bury those Dragon
Balls! If anything happens

00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:36.893
to them now, Lord Frieza
will have all of our heads!

00:06:36.926 --> 00:06:38.196
Sir, yes sir!

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:41.402
[incoherent chatting]

00:06:41.436 --> 00:06:45.544
[digging]

00:06:46.446 --> 00:06:48.015
[stomping]

00:06:48.784 --> 00:06:51.489
No one will find
them now, Captain.

00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:54.629
Good... Let's move out.
I plan on taking my sweet time

00:06:54.663 --> 00:06:56.600
showin' this
Tough Guy who's boss.

00:06:56.634 --> 00:07:01.109
[military drum roll]

00:07:01.142 --> 00:07:03.045
Ginyu Force.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.555
Go!

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:10.093
[awkward clapping]

00:07:10.928 --> 00:07:12.163
Uhh...

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:14.902
This doesn't look so cool
with just the two of us, huh?

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:17.274
All those hours
rehearsing this pose

00:07:17.307 --> 00:07:19.177
in front of the mirror wasted.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:25.056
No one makes the great
Captain Ginyu look like a fool!

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:29.566
[Bulma] I've had it
up to here with Dad.

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:31.302
Where does the old
crank get off telling me

00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:33.006
Goku should already be here?

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:34.575
[crackling]

00:07:34.609 --> 00:07:36.446
Surely if Goku
was already on Namek

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:39.217
his first priority
would be to rescue me.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.556
Ugh!

00:07:44.228 --> 00:07:45.931
[sigh]

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.938
I mean that's obvious, isn't it?

00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:50.974
[Krillin] If only we
had some surefire way

00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:52.912
of getting the
Dragon Balls back...

00:07:52.946 --> 00:07:55.350
You know these guys. What's the
best way of getting around them

00:07:55.384 --> 00:07:56.720
without them finding out?

00:07:56.754 --> 00:07:58.456
There's got to be something
the four of us can do.

00:07:58.489 --> 00:08:00.093
Feeling squeamish
about facing-off

00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:01.462
with Frieza
all of a sudden?

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:03.634
I'm still gonna do my best
to bring him down...

00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:05.270
...but before that we've got to
make good on our promise

00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:08.175
to bring back the friends
of ours you killed on Earth.

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:09.912
And to what
purpose would you

00:08:09.946 --> 00:08:11.482
bring your little
entourage back

00:08:11.516 --> 00:08:12.619
when it's only
a matter of time

00:08:12.652 --> 00:08:15.724
before Frieza wipes
them all out again?

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:16.960
C'mon use your heads.

00:08:16.994 --> 00:08:19.098
Why waste a good wish?
Let me become--

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:20.333
Lay off that already!

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.338
If you're granted eternal
life the rest of us would be

00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:24.709
no better off than
if Frieza had his way!

00:08:27.181 --> 00:08:30.386
There's two big powers
headed right toward us!

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.157
The Captain himself...

00:08:35.096 --> 00:08:36.031
[Vegeta] Great...

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:38.336
Jeice, the one you
let go has returned.

00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:41.008
And he's brought
his fearless leader...

00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:43.781
I don't care how
strong you've become...

00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:46.152
you're going to have your
hands full with this one.

00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:47.087
Yeah he's right...

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.926
this guy's way stronger
than the others.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.130
Hold on... Where did
Frieza run off to?

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:54.334
I can't sense him; you'd think
he'd be onboard the spaceship

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.840
hovering over the goods
Ginyu just laid at his feet.

00:08:56.873 --> 00:08:58.309
[Goku] Well,
he's not there now,

00:08:58.343 --> 00:08:59.946
I can tell you that.

00:09:04.088 --> 00:09:05.558
I'm feeling a huge
amount of energy

00:09:05.591 --> 00:09:07.528
coming from
that direction.

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:10.868
That's him... Who else
could it be but Frieza?

00:09:10.901 --> 00:09:13.106
Yeah... But isn't that where...

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:14.241
The Grand Elder!

00:09:14.274 --> 00:09:16.478
He must be trying to find
the Grand Elder's place!

00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:17.815
The old Namekian?

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:19.484
That's it! Frieza couldn't
get his wish granted,

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:22.458
so now he's using a scouter to
track down the last Namekians

00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:23.861
and get some answers!

00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:25.531
So, what? You think the Grand
Elder will just give him

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:27.400
this password
or whatever it is?

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:28.771
Is he the one who
created the Dragon Balls

00:09:28.804 --> 00:09:30.775
on this planet
in the first place?

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:34.448
As a matter of fact,
that's exactly who he is.

00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:35.718
This isn't good.

00:09:35.752 --> 00:09:37.756
No it's not! Once Frieza
thinks he's figured out

00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:39.258
how to get his wish granted,

00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:41.864
he'll just kill the Grand Elder
like he did all the others!

00:09:41.897 --> 00:09:43.099
There's nothing to stop him!

00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:45.069
Frieza doesn't know
if the Grand Elder dies

00:09:45.103 --> 00:09:47.307
the Dragon Balls
won't work anymore!

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.077
They'll be
rendered useless?!

00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:52.051
[distant flying sounds]

00:09:52.084 --> 00:09:52.718
Look!

00:09:52.751 --> 00:09:55.223
[flying sounds]

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:07.380
You thought you could make us

00:10:07.413 --> 00:10:09.051
look like a
pack of losers, huh?

00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:11.188
Well Captain Ginyu here
has something he'd like

00:10:11.222 --> 00:10:13.225
to say to you about that!

00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:17.334
[Krillin] What
do you say, Goku?

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.138
You can take
this guy, can'tcha?

00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:21.242
I guess there's only
one way to find out.

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:23.212
You were right about
one thing, though...

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:26.887
...this one's a lot stronger
than the others were.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.257
Is that him...
the troublemaker?

00:10:30.193 --> 00:10:32.397
The scouter puts him
at about five-thousand.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.734
Yeah, that's him.

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:35.672
Kind of weird that his
power level is so low, right?

00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:37.407
You're such an idiot.

00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:40.747
The reason he made you
look like "a pack of losers"

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:43.152
is that you
relied on your scouters.

00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:45.023
He's obviously
capable of bumping up

00:10:45.056 --> 00:10:46.859
his power level during combat.

00:10:46.893 --> 00:10:50.299
A shrewd warrior could tell
that about him at a glance.

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:53.038
By my estimation, I'd say
this fellow's true power level

00:10:53.072 --> 00:10:55.778
is somewhere in the
neighborhood of sixty-thousand.

00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:56.946
Sixty-thousand!

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.918
But that's impossible;
he's just a Saiyan!

00:10:58.951 --> 00:10:59.953
I've never
known one of them

00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:01.422
to get even half
that strong, sir!

00:11:01.456 --> 00:11:02.825
It's not unheard of.

00:11:02.858 --> 00:11:04.729
He's probably a naturally
gifted fighter who had his

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:07.769
abilities amplified by
some mutation, like us.

00:11:07.802 --> 00:11:09.606
In any case, this
suddenly promises

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:11.744
to be a very interesting fight.

00:11:11.777 --> 00:11:13.713
Heh. Who'd have thought
today'd be the day

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:16.653
when Captain Ginyu got
to showcase his true power?

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:18.657
This is gonna be fun.

00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:20.995
Alright, I'll keep this
guy busy for a while.

00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:22.598
You two to go get
the radar from Bulma.

00:11:22.631 --> 00:11:24.267
Find the Dragon Balls
as soon as you can.

00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:26.338
They probably took them
back to Frieza's spaceship.

00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:28.677
We might be able to
get them if he's gone.

00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:30.614
[Goku] Okay. Then if I'm
able to win this round,

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:31.683
I'll be right behind you.

00:11:31.717 --> 00:11:32.852
[Krillin] What
do you mean "if"?

00:11:32.886 --> 00:11:35.123
Don't talk like that,
of course you will!

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:35.758
Sure...

00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:37.026
Alright, let's do this.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.329
We don't have much
time before Frieza reaches

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:40.032
the Grand Elder's place,
we've got to hurry!

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.468
He might even be
there right now!

00:11:41.503 --> 00:11:43.607
Whatever you do, be safe.

00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:44.976
Vegeta, how about you
take the one on the left

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:46.679
and I take the
one on the right?

00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:47.815
You've recovered
from near death

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:49.585
a couple of times
now, haven't you?

00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:51.121
You should be up for this.

00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:53.727
I figure your new strength'll
make this an easy win for you.

00:11:53.761 --> 00:11:55.130
Oh, I'm sure it will.

00:11:55.163 --> 00:11:57.702
Right. Go for it, guys.
Just be careful.

00:11:57.735 --> 00:11:58.837
You got it, Dad!

00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:01.074
Best of luck, Goku!

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.079
Those two are getting away!

00:12:03.112 --> 00:12:05.851
They're nobody.
Let 'em go.

00:12:05.884 --> 00:12:08.356
Okay. Let's do
what we've got to do.

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:10.126
What choice
do we have?

00:12:13.701 --> 00:12:14.669
[snickering]

00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:15.738
[blasting off]

00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:17.742
Have fun, Kakarot!

00:12:17.776 --> 00:12:19.378
[Maniacal laughter]

00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:20.881
Vegeta, no!

00:12:33.507 --> 00:12:35.010
You're wide open!

00:12:35.043 --> 00:12:36.378
[kapow]

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:47.133
[frenzied fighting]

00:12:50.173 --> 00:12:52.443
Hiyah!

00:12:52.477 --> 00:12:54.447
Aah!

00:12:58.122 --> 00:12:59.391
[wham]

00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:00.827
Ahhh!

00:13:04.803 --> 00:13:06.906
[Chuckles]

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.983
Oof!

00:13:17.695 --> 00:13:20.500
[groaning]

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:22.236
[Laughs]

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:24.509
[screaming]

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:26.780
[explosion]

00:13:26.813 --> 00:13:28.082
[blasting off]

00:13:28.116 --> 00:13:30.287
[yelling]

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.888
[bam]

00:13:30.922 --> 00:13:35.062
[frenzied fighting]

00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:41.977
Ow... Vegeta...
you double-crosser...

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.014
Bravo. You're good at this.

00:13:44.048 --> 00:13:46.184
Even better than I
gave you credit for.

00:13:46.218 --> 00:13:47.588
[Chuckles]

00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:49.057
If Vegeta hadn't bailed on you,

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.763
you might've
actually had a shot.

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:54.134
[Goku thinking] Damn it!
There's isn't much time.

00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:57.040
I need to settle this
quickly or I might as well

00:13:57.074 --> 00:13:59.879
throw everyone's hope
right out the window.

00:14:00.547 --> 00:14:02.317
[flying sounds]

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.887
[Laughs]

00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:06.192
Isn't this a welcome
turn of events?

00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:07.728
If I've read their
powers correctly,

00:14:07.762 --> 00:14:10.099
Ginyu and Kakarot
are evenly matched.

00:14:10.132 --> 00:14:11.503
With any luck, they'll
take each other out

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:14.174
and leave me free to
do whatever I please.

00:14:14.207 --> 00:14:16.579
At the very least
they're preoccupied...

00:14:16.612 --> 00:14:18.783
Once I've beaten the
password from the two runts,

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.521
I'll make sure they're
no longer in a position

00:14:20.554 --> 00:14:22.858
to be a nuisance to me.

00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:24.260
With the aid of
their special radar,

00:14:24.294 --> 00:14:26.767
I can find the Dragon Balls,
be granted immortality,

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.837
and set my sights on Frieza!

00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:31.074
[Maniacal laughter]

00:14:31.676 --> 00:14:35.518
[yelling]

00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:36.553
[explosion]

00:14:36.587 --> 00:14:40.894
[frenzied fighting]

00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:43.867
[Ginyu] I have
to hand it to you,

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.940
for a Saiyan your
speed is exceptional.

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:48.710
But! You'll still
freeze with fear

00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:54.287
at the sight of my
Ultra Fighting Pose!!!

00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:55.056
Like this?

00:14:55.089 --> 00:14:56.224
[Ginyu Grumbles]
You stupid!

00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:58.229
Your legs are totally
in the wrong place!

00:14:58.262 --> 00:15:00.834
Ooops... uh...
How's this?

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:02.638
So, um... what now?

00:15:02.672 --> 00:15:05.945
Is there some reason why
we're doing this silly pose?

00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:09.619
"Silly pose"?! A rank
amateur like you dares to mock

00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:13.292
the Ginyu Force's flawless
sense of showmanship?!!

00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:16.498
Sorry about that. I'm not
really big on showing off,

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:19.138
and I really hate to
mess up your big entrance...

00:15:19.171 --> 00:15:21.041
...but I don't have
a lot of time here.

00:15:21.075 --> 00:15:23.546
Ah... You're pretty
sure of yourself, huh?

00:15:24.214 --> 00:15:25.116
[Laughs]

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:26.620
Arrogant little ape.

00:15:26.653 --> 00:15:28.891
Nobody talks
to me like that!

00:15:28.924 --> 00:15:30.827
You've got
some nerve.

00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:32.196
If I'd known you
were this cocky,

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.000
I would have made it more
of a point to knock you down

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:35.904
a few pegs
right from the start.

00:15:35.938 --> 00:15:38.843
But for whatever reason,
I decided to play nice.

00:15:38.877 --> 00:15:40.547
You see... we have
something in common.

00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:42.985
Like you, I can keep the
full extent of my powers

00:15:43.018 --> 00:15:46.358
safely under wraps until
the moment is just right.

00:15:47.293 --> 00:15:48.630
[Jeice Thinking]
That's the Captain for you.

00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:52.170
Calm, cool and in total
control of the situation.

00:15:52.203 --> 00:15:54.474
Of course, that pretty
much goes without saying.

00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:57.047
Even if this freak's power level
really is sixty-thousand,

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.254
on a bad day Captain
Ginyu's is way above that.

00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:03.359
[charging]

00:16:03.392 --> 00:16:03.827
Woah!

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.764
[blast]

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.468

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:23.733
Wonderful.

00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:26.572
First the stupid spaceship gets
demolished so we're stuck here;

00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:29.211
and now the communicator
decides to break down.

00:16:29.244 --> 00:16:32.450
Next the sky will start
raining fire or something.

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:35.423
It's fixed! Yay!
Finally something feels

00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:37.728
like cooperating
with me a little here.

00:16:37.762 --> 00:16:40.634
[distant explosion]

00:16:40.668 --> 00:16:42.370
Ahh!

00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:44.407

00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:50.220
Ow... What does this
planet have against me?

Huh... all the Dragon Balls
are gathered in one place...

00:16:56.231 --> 00:16:57.668
...and I'm cooped up in here.

00:16:57.702 --> 00:17:00.540
Those sneaky little buggers,
trying to summon the dragon

00:17:00.574 --> 00:17:02.712
and have your wish
granted without me?

00:17:02.745 --> 00:17:04.213
We'll see about that.

Wait. If Vegeta's got 'em all,

what exactly am I
getting myself into?

00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:25.456
Ahh!

00:17:25.489 --> 00:17:28.596
Oh, give me a break! What
did I ever do to you Namek?!

00:17:30.366 --> 00:17:33.272
Hey... I've got it. Even if it
is Vegeta who's got them all,

00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:34.842
I only have to say
"take me home"

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:36.779
and Shenron will
whisk me out of here!

00:17:36.812 --> 00:17:39.150
Of course! Simplicity itself.

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:40.286
Sorry guys,
this is what you get

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.123
for leaving me by myself.

What are you waiting for?

There's no other option.

you I pulverize, understood?!

You think I can't tell when
someone's holding back?

00:19:41.896 --> 00:19:44.502
Let me guess, you intend
on saving up all that power

00:19:44.535 --> 00:19:47.039
for your big showdown
with Lord Frieza.

00:19:47.072 --> 00:19:48.643
I understand.
It's not every day

we get to put
ourselves to the test,

on the here and now.

Sounds good to me, heh.

Just remember: when
this is all over and done,

you asked for it.

[Ginyu] That's the spirit. Show
us what you're really made of

you once and for all.

think "what I'm really made of"
