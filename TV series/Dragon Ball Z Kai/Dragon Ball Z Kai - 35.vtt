Last Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:05.746
While Captain Ginyu
fought to keep control

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:07.147
of Goku's stolen body...

00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:10.287
[Vegeta] I scarcely know my
own strength anymore...

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.024
I'm becoming a Super Saiyan.

00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:13.862
[Narrator]
Vegeta used the opportunity

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:15.999
to put his increased
powers to the test,

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:18.671
easily overwhelming
the ruthless Jeice.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:22.011
But amidst all of this chaos,
what will become of Goku?

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:25.116
The battle continues... now!

Vegeta! No!

You didn't have to
take it that far!

[laughing]

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.229
Funny, when right now
you're a shining example

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:12.633
of where mercy gets you...

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.804
The only thing your
bleeding heart is good for

00:02:14.837 --> 00:02:16.139
is holding you back...

00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:19.045
It's why you'll never
be a Super Saiyan like me!

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:22.184
[Ginyu (Goku's body)] What...?!
Now he's the Super Saiyan?!

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.627
And those two still haven't
finished off Ginyu, eh...?

00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:30.702
Well... when you want
something done right...

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:32.805

Change... now!!!

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.433
This is it...! My chance
to get the old me back!

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.505
[Goku] If I can time
this just right...

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.648
[Vegeta] What the hell?!
Get out of the way!

00:03:42.813 --> 00:03:44.481
[Ginyu] Meddling pest...!

way of my transmutation!

Eheheheh!

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:57.474
Well... I did it... Looks
like I'm... I'm me again...

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.546
What...? He just
blocked my attack...

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.584
But why...?
What just happened?!

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:03.486
Did... did you
see that light?

00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.925
Yeah... That was some
blast... But I don't get it,

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.664
why would Goku jump
in front of it like that?

00:04:19.887 --> 00:04:22.057
Hey, do you sense
that energy, Krillin...?!

00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.326
That's Dad; I know it...!

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.066
I think he just switched
back into his own body!

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.901
What?!

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.737
Really...? You're sure?

00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:34.315
[Vegeta] So then, Ginyu's back
in his original body now?

00:04:34.348 --> 00:04:37.955
[Ginyu thinks]
Damn it...

00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.796
I have to change bodies
again; and quickly...

[Ginyu laughing]

That's the way...!
This time you're mine!

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:54.522
Wait... It's a trap...
Don't fall for it Vegeta;

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:57.929
he's just trying to trick you
into swapping bodies with him...

00:04:57.962 --> 00:05:00.366
If that happens, we're through!

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.474
Change now!!!

00:05:13.293 --> 00:05:15.998

Ginyu's doing the same
thing he did with me,

00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:29.292
letting himself get banged up

00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:31.229
so his body'll be
useless once he swaps...

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:33.533
Vegeta won't stand a chance...

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:39.746
Yes... Very good...
but I think that's enough.

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.454
[Vegeta] Bastard!
I'll tell you what's enough!

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.994
No, Vegeta! Stay back!

worked, huh...?

00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:53.459
Hey... Goku...
Are you all right?

00:06:53.492 --> 00:06:55.931
Come on, Dad.
Can you stand up?

00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:01.075
Heh... It's great...
having my body back...

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:03.179
But you guys worked
it over pretty good...

00:07:03.212 --> 00:07:04.415
Didn't you?

00:07:04.448 --> 00:07:07.053
Ha! Never mind that...
What about Ginyu...?

00:07:07.087 --> 00:07:09.893
Where is he? Whose body
did he switch with now?

00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:13.033
I doubt we have to
worry about him anymore...

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:14.335
Take a look;

00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:16.005
you see that little alien frog
looking thing over there...?

00:07:16.038 --> 00:07:17.441
That'd be him.

[croaking sounds]

00:07:23.821 --> 00:07:28.296

...Almost...

00:07:32.772 --> 00:07:34.509
Come on... Leave him alone...

00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:36.445
He can't hurt anyone anymore...

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:38.750
Being stuck like that
is punishment enough.

00:07:38.784 --> 00:07:41.489
Very well... I guess
I'll spare you...

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:43.359
But only because I
find the thought of you

00:07:43.392 --> 00:07:45.197
flopping around
like that amusing.

00:07:55.717 --> 00:07:59.191
at least one last senzu bean
stashed away somewhere...

Well, well... There's
really nothing standing

00:08:07.207 --> 00:08:10.113
between you and utter
annihilation anymore, is there?

00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:11.014
Wait...what?

00:08:11.048 --> 00:08:13.521
Hey... don't get
any ideas... you...

00:08:13.554 --> 00:08:16.225
you spineless,
double-crossing jerk!

00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:19.966
Heh... Don't...worry guys...

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.205
He won't try to do
anything to us just yet...

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.845
[Vegeta]
How very astute of you...

00:08:25.878 --> 00:08:26.947
Indeed I won't;

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.118
not until the Dragon
Balls have been unlocked.

00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:30.320
And beyond that,

00:08:30.353 --> 00:08:34.261
Kakarot's strength may still
prove useful against Frieza.

00:08:34.295 --> 00:08:35.263
Follow me.

00:08:35.296 --> 00:08:36.767
[Kirllin]
Where, exactly?

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.008
Aboard Frieza's spaceship...
Kakarot's worthless like this.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.922
[Krillin] We're not taking a
step 'til you explain.

00:08:47.956 --> 00:08:49.759
[Vegeta]
I want him back in top form.

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:52.197
Yeah right, how about a
straight answer for once?!

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:56.138
Fools... I'm going
to treat his wounds...

00:08:56.172 --> 00:09:00.280
But feel free to waste
away out here if you prefer.

00:09:00.313 --> 00:09:02.017
I don't like this.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.223
[painful grunting]

00:09:05.256 --> 00:09:07.227
There's no time...

00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:09.331
Come on... Let's go.

00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:16.947
Move quickly... Certainly
I don't have to explain

00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:19.217
what will happen if
Frieza comes back.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.596
[Vegeta] This is what state-of-
the-art medicine looks like.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.898
Oh wow...

00:09:55.456 --> 00:10:00.634
[machine powering up;
running water]

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:02.973
[Krillin] So... How
does this work exactly?

00:10:03.006 --> 00:10:04.809
The specifics would
be over your head...

00:10:04.843 --> 00:10:08.750
But putting it simply, this is
known as a Healing Chamber...

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:10.954
The liquid flooding the
tank is a chemical compound

00:10:10.988 --> 00:10:13.928
specially formulated to
speed the recovery process.

00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:15.864
Whoa... That's kind of neat.

00:10:15.898 --> 00:10:17.935
[Vegeta thinking] Just don't
imagine you'll be receiving

00:10:17.969 --> 00:10:20.641
the same treatment when
this business is over with.

00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:21.910
After Frieza's out of the way,

00:10:21.943 --> 00:10:23.947
I'll be disposing
of you as well.

00:10:23.981 --> 00:10:27.320
Should be simple enough,
once I'm a Super Saiyan.

00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:29.759
[Vegeta]
The chamber in this room

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:31.095
is a slightly outdated model,

00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:33.099
but given Kakarot's
resilient nature,

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:35.470
I'm sure that won't make
the slightest difference.

00:10:35.505 --> 00:10:36.607
[Gohan]
This thing's outdated?

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.842
Yes, unfortunately...

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:40.748
But the newer model
and I had a little tiff.

00:10:40.782 --> 00:10:43.753
You sure he's not gonna,
like, drown in there...?

00:10:44.555 --> 00:10:46.926
[Goku thinking]
Ah, this feels good...

00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:49.231
Right... Let's do
something about

00:10:49.264 --> 00:10:50.835
those stupid outfits
while we're at it...

00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:52.403
They've got just the thing here

00:10:52.437 --> 00:10:55.143
to help you spruce up
your first line of defense.

00:10:55.177 --> 00:10:58.517
Wait, you mean armor...?
Like what you've got on?

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.054
Um... Won't that
make us look mean?

00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.795
Oh man, I've got
to hand it to them...

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:07.467
Their civilization must be
light years ahead of Earth's.

00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:09.872
Yeah; light centuries.

00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:13.647
Strip down and put
those undershirts on.

00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:15.852
Frieza will be
back before long...

00:11:15.885 --> 00:11:17.822
Come on! What did I say!

00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:20.060
You know, I don't mean to be
the negative one here, Gohan;

00:11:20.093 --> 00:11:22.598
but if Vegeta is willing to
accept our help in this fight...

00:11:22.631 --> 00:11:26.472
This Frieza must be the scariest
guy in the entire universe.

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:28.309
No kidding.

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:30.280
Now to suit you up in
proper battle armor.

00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:32.317
Fortunately, Frieza
keeps some henchmen

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.387
that're about your size.

00:11:37.494 --> 00:11:40.701
Probably a dumb question,
but how do we put them on?

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:43.173
Our arms can't get
through once our head's in.

00:11:43.206 --> 00:11:44.709
Just force them on...

00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:46.679
The material they're made
of isn't just strong;

00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:48.115
it's extremely flexible...

00:11:48.148 --> 00:11:49.685
Remember when you
saw me transform

00:11:49.719 --> 00:11:51.121
into a Great Ape
back on Earth,

00:11:51.154 --> 00:11:52.892
my armor expanded
along with me.

00:11:52.925 --> 00:11:56.966
These suits will easily
adjust to your shape as well.

00:11:58.236 --> 00:11:59.471
[roaring]

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.976
Wow... Heh... He's right!

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.847
So, I'm guessing
the gloves and shoes

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.418
are made out of
the same material?

00:12:06.451 --> 00:12:07.755
Of course.

00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:10.527
[Krillin] Cool! This
stuff's so light it's crazy!

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.099
[laughing]

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:15.436
Seriously, it's like I'm barely
wearing anything at all...!

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.940
This is totally unfair...

00:12:16.973 --> 00:12:20.615
How come the bad guys always
get to wear the coolest clothes?

00:12:20.648 --> 00:12:23.085
Ha...! Who's bad now!

00:12:24.454 --> 00:12:26.526
Wait... Why didn't you set us
up with suits like yours...?

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.797
I mean these shoulder
things are kind of stupid...

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.866
They'll just get in the way.

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:31.168
[Vegeta] Oh shut up.

00:12:31.202 --> 00:12:33.005
The armor I'm wearing
is an older style.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:35.678
It was all I could
find in my base size.

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:37.013
Huh... Well...

00:12:37.046 --> 00:12:38.584
These things don't get in
the way all that much.

00:12:38.617 --> 00:12:39.652
I think they're cool...

00:12:39.685 --> 00:12:42.157
Moving's a piece
of cake actually.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.027
Speaking of moving
around and all...

00:12:44.061 --> 00:12:46.131
How long 'til Goku's
back on his feet?

00:12:46.164 --> 00:12:47.969
Who knows...? I'm not a doctor,

00:12:48.002 --> 00:12:51.008
but if I had to guess I'd say
about an hour, give or take.

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.847
Right... I'll go back
to the Grand Elder's

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.519
and ask about
the Dragon Balls.

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:57.922
Now I know it's dangerous

00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.526
and that Frieza's probably
already found the place...

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:00.861
But unless we can figure out

00:13:00.894 --> 00:13:02.330
what the password is
to summon the dragon...

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:04.836
we might as well pack
it up and go home now.

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:06.573
Right... Let's do it!

00:13:06.607 --> 00:13:12.183
No... I'm going out there alone
this time... Wait for me here.

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:23.072
[heavy panting]

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.523
Poor thing, look at
the state you're in...

00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:33.058
Here I am only
using one arm

00:13:33.092 --> 00:13:36.232
and we've already gotten
to the bottom of you...

00:13:36.265 --> 00:13:38.670
Why not stop this
feeble attempt at resistance

00:13:38.704 --> 00:13:41.475
and tell me what
I need to know?

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.847
[screams]
AAAAHHHHH!!!

00:13:50.527 --> 00:13:53.299
Nothing in your bag of
tricks is going to work...

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.170
Take my word for it.

00:13:55.971 --> 00:13:57.775
[Frieza] Surely it's time
to accept your situation

00:13:57.808 --> 00:14:00.046
for what it is and relent...
Or must we follow

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.585
the present course to
its natural conclusion?

00:14:02.618 --> 00:14:03.853
The choice is
yours, naturally;

00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:05.857
though I simply cannot
understand the appeal

00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:08.095
you find in
persisting to defy me...

00:14:08.128 --> 00:14:11.001
Do you fight for the sake
of your fallen comrades...?

00:14:11.034 --> 00:14:12.671
Or will your guilt
be satisfied by

00:14:12.705 --> 00:14:15.009
laying down
your own life as well?

00:14:15.844 --> 00:14:17.013
[wham]

00:14:17.046 --> 00:14:20.086
[painful moaning]

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:22.356
[Frieza] This is my
final warning to you...

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.031
Tell me how I can make the
Dragon Balls grant my wish...

00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:30.473
...or prepare to
embrace oblivion.

00:14:31.809 --> 00:14:36.318
[Nail chuckles]

00:14:37.888 --> 00:14:39.357
Even if I told you...

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.030
the information
would be useless.

00:14:42.063 --> 00:14:44.067
D... Dende will have... He...

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:49.679
He'll have made it to our
Earthling allies by now...

00:14:49.712 --> 00:14:52.183
While... while you...
toy with me...

00:14:52.217 --> 00:14:55.390
They will have
gotten their wish...

00:14:55.423 --> 00:14:57.995
What?!

00:14:58.028 --> 00:15:00.233
[Frieza thinking]
That dust mite!

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:01.903
[growling]

00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:04.307
How could I fall for
such an obvious ruse?!

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.445
[blasting off]

00:15:06.478 --> 00:15:08.248
[Nail laughing]

00:15:12.257 --> 00:15:13.927
[Grand Elder]
Why did I not tell our visitors

00:15:13.961 --> 00:15:16.900
how to summon the dragon
while they were here...?

00:15:16.933 --> 00:15:19.171
Age has sapped
my mind of clarity

00:15:19.204 --> 00:15:22.645
and forced Nail to endure
the beating of his life...

00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:29.224
[coughing]

00:15:29.257 --> 00:15:33.198
Please... may Dende
reach our friends soon...

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:34.635
The... the time left to me

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:37.641
on this plane of existence
grows ever shorter...

00:15:43.051 --> 00:15:45.289
If I don't hurry and teach
the Earthlings the words

00:15:45.322 --> 00:15:47.595
they need to have their
wish granted, all is lost!

00:15:47.628 --> 00:15:49.665
[blasting off]

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:53.238
[Vegeta]
Hey brat, listen up...

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.782
Keep an eye on the
Dragon Balls for me...

00:15:57.815 --> 00:15:59.250
I'll be inside...

00:15:59.284 --> 00:16:01.589
I think my efforts lately
have earned me a little nap...

00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:04.228
Come in and wake me when
your friend comes back.

00:16:04.261 --> 00:16:05.430
[Gohan thinking] Seriously?

00:16:05.463 --> 00:16:06.899
[Vegeta] With this
twenty-four seven sun,

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:08.837
who knows how long it's
been since I've slept?

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.707
[Gohan thinking] Frieza could
drop in on us at any moment

00:16:10.741 --> 00:16:13.647
and he decides this is a
good time to catch some z's?

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.748
[waves crashing]

00:16:14.782 --> 00:16:16.184
Why am I not picking
up any readings

00:16:16.218 --> 00:16:17.755
from the Ginyu Force...?!

00:16:17.788 --> 00:16:20.359
Those fools...!
This is absurd...!

00:16:20.392 --> 00:16:21.963
How could they all be beaten?!

00:16:21.996 --> 00:16:23.332
I don't believe it...

00:16:23.366 --> 00:16:25.604
So Vegeta and those two
miserable Earthlings somehow

00:16:25.637 --> 00:16:28.442
managed to defeat my most
elite team of fighters...?!

00:16:28.476 --> 00:16:32.350
If so, they may already
have the Dragon Balls!

00:16:32.383 --> 00:16:35.222
Vermin...! You'd dare
to steal my wish?!

00:16:35.256 --> 00:16:36.892
I am the mighty Frieza...!

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:40.533
I will allow no one to stand
between me and immortality!

00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:46.580
[screeching to a halt]

00:16:46.613 --> 00:16:47.715
Huh...

00:16:47.748 --> 00:16:48.916
There's something headed

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.756
straight for
Goku and the others...

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.129
Wait a minute...
I know that energy!

00:17:00.641 --> 00:17:02.578
It's Dende!

00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:04.347
[Krillin] Hey!

00:17:06.184 --> 00:17:07.220
[Krillin laughing]

00:17:07.254 --> 00:17:08.690
Sorry about that... Heh...

00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:11.262
Don't let the outfit
fool you; it's just me!

00:17:11.295 --> 00:17:12.463
So you're all right...!

00:17:12.496 --> 00:17:14.735
[together]
It's good to see you!

00:17:16.506 --> 00:17:18.242
If it's the same as
the last time he went,

00:17:18.275 --> 00:17:19.545
it's probably
gonna take Krillin

00:17:19.578 --> 00:17:21.181
at least a couple of
hours to get all the way

00:17:21.214 --> 00:17:24.121
to the Grand Elder's
place and back again.

00:17:24.154 --> 00:17:25.489
What am I supposed to do

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:28.395
if Frieza shows up sometime
between now and then?

00:17:31.268 --> 00:17:33.239
I can't believe I
found you... Lucky!

00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:35.276
We've finally got all the
Dragon Balls together

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.915
in one place but we don't know
how to get Shenron to come out

00:17:37.949 --> 00:17:39.318
and grant our wish;

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.254
so I was on my way to the
Grand Elder's to find out.

00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:42.591
Finding me wasn't luck...

00:17:42.624 --> 00:17:44.763
The Grand Elder must've
known you'd have trouble;

00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:45.998
he actually sent me here

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.568
so I could teach
you the password.

00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:49.304
Oh yeah...? So...

00:17:49.338 --> 00:17:50.941
Just what are we
supposed to say?

00:17:50.975 --> 00:17:52.578
You simply ask the
dragon to come out,

00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:55.149
only you need to say it
in the Namekian language.

00:17:55.182 --> 00:17:57.320
[Krillin] Namekian, huh...?
Well that figures...

00:17:57.353 --> 00:17:58.422
Kind of wish the Grand Elder

00:17:58.456 --> 00:17:59.892
would have said
something, though...

00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:01.361
You know,

00:18:01.395 --> 00:18:02.731
back when I was out as his
place the first time around...

00:18:02.765 --> 00:18:04.736
[Dende] His ways are a
bit of a mystery sometimes.

00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:05.971
Maybe he didn't think

00:18:06.004 --> 00:18:07.140
you'd be able to get
all of them together...

00:18:07.173 --> 00:18:08.408
[Krillin] Yeah... maybe.

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:09.945
[Dende] What's important
now is that we hurry.

00:18:09.979 --> 00:18:12.183
The Grand Elder's
barely hanging on...

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:15.356
And if that's not bad enough,
Frieza's on his way too.

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:17.594
There's no time to waste then.

00:18:23.372 --> 00:18:26.880
Someone's close;
I can tell... Krillin...?

00:18:26.913 --> 00:18:29.283
But there's definitely
two of them...

00:18:37.334 --> 00:18:40.740
Whoever it is...
They're hiding their energy...

00:18:40.774 --> 00:18:43.379
That means Krillin, and...

00:18:43.412 --> 00:18:46.051
Dende...! All right!!!

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:48.089
[Krillin] Hey! It's Gohan!

00:18:48.122 --> 00:18:49.490
[Dende] So it is!

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.600
How in the world
did you manage

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.704
to get him all the
way back here so fast?

00:18:55.737 --> 00:18:56.706
[Krillin] Believe it or not,

00:18:56.739 --> 00:18:58.308
Dende was actually
on his way to help us.

00:18:58.342 --> 00:19:00.346
I ran into him not
even halfway there.

00:19:00.379 --> 00:19:03.119
So that means you know how to
make the Dragon Balls work?

00:19:03.152 --> 00:19:04.487
Uh-huh!

00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:06.025
By the way, where's Vegeta...?

00:19:06.058 --> 00:19:07.427
As we got closer, we masked

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.433
our power levels so he
wouldn't realize we were here.

00:19:10.466 --> 00:19:12.504
I don't think he noticed
you guys come up...

00:19:12.537 --> 00:19:14.942
Get this... He's in the
spaceship taking a nap...

00:19:14.975 --> 00:19:17.413
He said for me to wake him
up when you guys came back.

00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:20.419
Good...! Then we're in luck,
guys... This is the plan...

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:22.824
Let's sneak the Dragon Balls
away and summon Shenron

00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:25.263
before Vegeta gets wise
to what's going on...

00:19:25.296 --> 00:19:27.500
It'll be too late by
the time he notices...

00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:29.705
We've got a real window
of opportunity here--

00:19:29.738 --> 00:19:31.007
whatta you say?

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.909
[Dende] Yeah!

All right. It's up
to you now, Dende.

00:20:06.244 --> 00:20:07.514
Got it...

Hurry Dende...!

00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:32.898
You've gotta summon the
dragon before it's too late!

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:34.300
Right!

Did you say it right...?

00:20:46.424 --> 00:20:48.429
I mean are you certain
that's how it goes?!

[dragon balls humming]

00:20:49.932 --> 00:20:52.003
That's... a good sign...

Porunga has been summoned!

00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:27.541
Will Krillin and Gohan finally

I can't believe it!

that's the relation.

not to mention Vegeta!

[Krillin] So we really
do get three, right?

00:23:01.428 --> 00:23:03.966
Man, the dragon
here is way generous!
