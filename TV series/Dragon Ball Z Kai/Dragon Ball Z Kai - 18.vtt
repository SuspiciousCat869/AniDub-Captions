00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:46.219
I didn't... I have no clue
how I came to be there.

00:08:46.252 --> 00:08:49.759
Apparently I hit my head, for I
have no memory of my parents,

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:51.630
or anything else
up to that point.

00:08:51.663 --> 00:08:53.332
But you had
parents, didn't you?

00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:54.735
I don't know...

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:56.540
All I had was
a letter that read,

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:59.077
"Wait here and we will
come for you soon."

00:08:59.111 --> 00:09:02.317
That's sad, but... what does
it have to do with this?

00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:03.687
When Kami was a boy,

00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.161
he waited many years for
his parents, who never came.

00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:10.601
[KAMI] It was in Yunzabit
that I spent my childhood.

00:09:10.635 --> 00:09:12.037
Throughout my youth,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.776
I remained certain that my
parents would return for me.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.083
But my certainty faded
with each passing day,

00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:19.786
then month, then year.

00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:22.390
I wonder how long I waited.

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:23.928
Twenty years, perhaps...?

00:09:23.961 --> 00:09:26.900
It could easily have
been thirty or more.

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:31.342
Eventually I gave up hope and
left my home, and Yunzabit.

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:34.348
I go back to look in on
the place every now and then,

00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:36.285
but nothing has ever changed.

00:09:36.318 --> 00:09:38.055
Okay... Now would you remind me

00:09:38.088 --> 00:09:39.692
why I needed to
know all of that?

00:09:39.725 --> 00:09:41.261
This is the time
for listening.

00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:43.266
Understanding
comes later.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.003
Heh... Back then...

00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:47.775
I thought I had the most
normal home in the world.

00:09:47.808 --> 00:09:50.013
It was years later when
I fully comprehended

00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:52.819
how strange a spherical
house really was.

00:09:52.852 --> 00:09:55.423
Not to mention its
four tiny legs...

00:09:55.456 --> 00:09:57.928
or that the door
had no knob or lock...

00:09:57.962 --> 00:09:59.865
In fact, the only
way I could open it

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:02.137
was with a specific
vocal command.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.640
And it was... Piccolo.

00:10:03.673 --> 00:10:04.976
[BULMA gasps]

00:10:08.116 --> 00:10:10.319
Wow it opened right up!

00:10:13.293 --> 00:10:15.163
Now we have to
stand on this.

00:10:15.196 --> 00:10:16.331
Huh...?

00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:22.578
So... Kami's use
to live in there?

00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:24.950
The same command
closes the door.

00:10:24.983 --> 00:10:26.151
Piccolo.

00:10:26.184 --> 00:10:27.287
[BULMA gasps]

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.659
[BULMA whimpers]

00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:36.707
[MR. POPO] Kami called
this his house but to my eye

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.111
it seems that it
could be a spaceship.

00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:42.283
Of Course! Kami is
from Namek after all!

00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:45.190
And King Kai said that Planet
Namek was almost wiped out

00:10:45.223 --> 00:10:47.762
by some sort of severe change
in the climate there, right?

00:10:47.796 --> 00:10:49.297
I heard King Kai as well,

00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:51.903
and if it's true that Kami was
not of this world I thought...

00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:53.574
surely something must
have bought him here....

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:55.110
So I came back to have a look.

00:10:55.143 --> 00:10:57.481
Well, if this is a spaceship,
and it looks like it is,

00:10:57.515 --> 00:11:00.419
it fits perfectly with what
Kami told you about his past.

00:11:00.453 --> 00:11:02.023
Yes... with Planet
Namek in crisis,

00:11:02.056 --> 00:11:04.796
Kami's parents decided to
put their son on a spaceship

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:06.833
and send him to Earth
so he would be safe.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:09.237
They must have thought that they
could come back for him later,

00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.406
like the letter promised,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.845
but then for whatever reason
they weren't able to.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:14.749
Besides... Look at it!

00:11:14.782 --> 00:11:17.722
Does this look even
remotely like a house to you?

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:18.523
[BULMA gasps]

00:11:18.557 --> 00:11:20.293
This is a spaceship!

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:22.264
It has to be!

00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:25.436
Now we just have to see if
we can get her in the air.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.640
The door opens,
so that means

00:11:26.673 --> 00:11:28.911
it's pulling power
from somewhere.

00:11:28.944 --> 00:11:31.081
I wonder if this
is the main switch...

00:11:31.114 --> 00:11:34.454
No... That's not it... Maybe...

00:11:36.224 --> 00:11:37.862
[BULMA grunts]

00:11:37.895 --> 00:11:41.202
Gee, I don't know...
It's not working at all.

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:44.007
Maybe it needs a pass
code or something.

00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:45.611
I don't get it.
How can a spaceship

00:11:45.644 --> 00:11:47.715
not have any
buttons or controls?

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.952
It doesn't make any sense!

00:11:49.986 --> 00:11:53.092
Unless this is some
kind of a sensor.

00:11:53.126 --> 00:11:54.295
For voice?

00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:56.767
Of course! It recognizes words,
like the entrance does!

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.937
Then we say "Piccolo"
to make it fly?

00:11:58.971 --> 00:12:00.574
That's probably just
the word you use

00:12:00.608 --> 00:12:01.676
to open or close the door.

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:03.379
I doubt it'll
do anything else.

00:12:03.413 --> 00:12:05.884
We're going to have to
try a more direct approach.

00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:08.356
Fly! Fly... you hear me?!

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:09.659
This'll never work...

00:12:09.692 --> 00:12:13.499
I'm sure it only responds to
Namekian, and I don't know any.

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:16.305
I remember Piccolo said
something in a strange language

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:17.340
when he fought Goku,

00:12:17.373 --> 00:12:20.280
but I had no idea it
was an alien language.

00:12:20.313 --> 00:12:22.785
I wish I'd paid closer
attention to what he said.

00:12:22.818 --> 00:12:24.922
If the language you heard
Piccolo speak is Namekian,

00:12:24.956 --> 00:12:26.593
then I happen
to speak it too.

00:12:26.626 --> 00:12:27.862
You do?!

00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:29.197
I know that Piccolo's
name means "other world"

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.901
in the language
he and Kami spoke,

00:12:30.934 --> 00:12:34.108
and it just so happens that
"Piccolo" also means entrance.

00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:37.247
Why didn't you say
so in the first place?

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.253
So the name "King Piccolo" in
Namekian would translate to

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:42.859
something along the lines of
"King of Another World"...

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:44.962
Well, what are you
waiting for? Tell it to fly!

00:12:44.995 --> 00:12:46.533
[MR. POPO]
Tell it to fly where?

00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:48.269
Anywhere is fine...

00:12:48.302 --> 00:12:51.275
Why don't we start with
someplace around Jupiter?

00:12:51.308 --> 00:12:53.245
Topul kuppa koloppungo.

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.782
[beeping]

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.026
[BULMA and MR. POPO yell]

00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:02.965
[BULMA and MR. POPO yell]

00:13:08.175 --> 00:13:09.210
[BULMA gasps]

00:13:15.558 --> 00:13:16.827
[BULMA] It's Jupiter!

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.028
This isn't just a spaceship,

00:13:18.062 --> 00:13:19.933
it's an amazing spaceship!

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.103
You really did it, Mr. Popo!

00:13:22.137 --> 00:13:25.511
It's exactly what we need!

00:13:25.544 --> 00:13:27.013
I'm so glad.

00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:30.520
If this works that means that
Kami will come back as well!

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.236
[BULMA] It is a spaceship...
And it's perfect!

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:57.473
It's fast... and it
won't need much work...

00:13:57.508 --> 00:13:59.277
just a few minor
modifications...

00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:01.883
We could easily be on
Namek within the month!

00:14:01.917 --> 00:14:03.386
Hmm... Let's see...

00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:05.791
If we work fast, we can
launch in five days!

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:07.728
We're flying Kami's
spaceship to Namek?

00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:08.664
That's great!

00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:09.932
It seems like there might be

00:14:09.966 --> 00:14:11.669
a light at the end of
this tunnel after all!

00:14:11.702 --> 00:14:13.372
It's all thanks
to you, Mr. Popo.

00:14:13.405 --> 00:14:15.544
I'm so happy you're
going to be joining us.

00:14:15.577 --> 00:14:18.282
Oh, I can't go
to Planet Namek.

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:19.853
I'm sorry,
but I just can't...

00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:21.355
If I went with you then

00:14:21.388 --> 00:14:23.325
I'd be away from the Lookout
for at least two months or more.

00:14:23.359 --> 00:14:23.927
Too long.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.196
You're kidding me!

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.733
You're the only one of
us who speaks Namekian!

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:29.972
You have to come with us!
And besides, you're huge...!

00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:32.077
What if we get attacked
and we need your help?

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.817
You can learn.
I'll teach you Namekian.

00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:38.255
[KRILLIN] If anybody can
do it, you can, Bulma!

00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:39.559
This is great!
Think about it...

00:14:39.592 --> 00:14:42.263
If the ship breaks down,
you'll be there to fix it!

00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:46.138
Okay... I guess the trip
won't be too dangerous.

00:14:46.172 --> 00:14:48.275
But I am not going all
by myself, understand?

00:14:48.308 --> 00:14:50.112
One of you is coming with me!

00:14:50.146 --> 00:14:51.315
Don't look at me...

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:53.653
No way I'm going to
that screwy planet!

00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:56.125
Goku is hurt,
so he can't come...

00:14:56.158 --> 00:14:58.228
Hey, Krillin...
You'll come with me, right?

00:14:58.262 --> 00:15:00.333
Oh...! Uh...
I guess I can.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:02.939
Sure... I mean, if
you really want me to.

00:15:02.972 --> 00:15:05.410
Sounds nice...
I wish I could join you.

00:15:05.443 --> 00:15:07.514
I'd really want to see
what kind of Shenron

00:15:07.548 --> 00:15:08.884
would be on planet Namek.

00:15:08.917 --> 00:15:09.885
Maybe he's blue...

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:11.054
I'll check it
out for you...

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:12.457
But for right now,
you need to rest up

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.729
and figure out a way
to beat the Saiyans.

00:15:14.763 --> 00:15:15.898
[GOKU] Yeah, you're right.

00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:17.400
It's up to the
two of you, then.

00:15:17.433 --> 00:15:19.572
I... I...

00:15:21.475 --> 00:15:24.280
I... I want to
go to Namek with you!

00:15:24.314 --> 00:15:25.350
[ALL gasp]

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:26.418
Hmm...

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.661
Now, that's adorable. But...

00:15:30.694 --> 00:15:32.932
This isn't the right time
to be making silly jokes.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.437
I'm not making a joke,
I really want to go!

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.108
Please... let me...
I don't want to stay here!

00:15:38.142 --> 00:15:40.146
No...! You're not
going you hear me?!

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.917
You'd be away for
another two months!

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.887
I'm sorry, Mom... but...

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.791
I want to go more
than anything...

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:47.160
I want to be there
to see Piccolo

00:15:47.193 --> 00:15:48.596
when they bring
him back to life!

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.667
How could you even say
something like that?!

00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:51.803
[CHI-CHI]
Just look at you!

00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:53.774
You're not even
properly healed yet!

00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:56.378
[GOHAN] I'm fine.
I will be, anyway.

00:15:56.411 --> 00:15:58.851
[CHI-CHI] Gohan...! Baby,
what are you doing?!

00:15:58.884 --> 00:16:01.421
Stop! Gohan, listen
to me! I'm your mother!

00:16:01.455 --> 00:16:03.092
[GOHAN] Please, Mom...
All I want is for you

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:04.529
to say I can go.

00:16:04.562 --> 00:16:06.298
I will not!
I forbid it!

00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:08.069
Do you even know
what you're asking?

00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:11.208
You're not going anywhere!
Not for two months!

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:13.245
Have you thought about
all the school you'd miss?

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:15.449
And those piano lessons
won't take themselves!

00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:17.487
You can't fall
behind for Piccolo!

00:16:17.521 --> 00:16:18.757
Shut up!

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.563
[KRILLIN and ROSHI gasp]

00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:23.399
Ahh...!

00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:24.836
My baby boy...!

00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:27.741
He... he's turning
into a delinquent!

00:16:27.775 --> 00:16:29.444
I'm... sorry, Mom...

00:16:29.478 --> 00:16:32.585
but... if you want to talk
about how bad I'm turning out,

00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:34.254
we can do that later.

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:37.093
Right now we have to
focus on our friends.

00:16:37.126 --> 00:16:39.298
They fought hard
trying to protect us.

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:42.270
And they died to
save us... and the Earth!

00:16:42.303 --> 00:16:45.409
But it wasn't for nothing...
It can't have been for nothing!

00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:49.117
I just... I have
to do something!

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.492
I'm sorry, Mom...
I really am... But I have to.

00:16:53.527 --> 00:16:56.331
[OX-KING] You have to admit
he has a point, Chi-Chi.

00:16:56.365 --> 00:16:58.870
Seems to me he has
his mind made up...

00:16:58.903 --> 00:17:01.142
Give him your
blessing, let him go.

00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:02.511
[GOKU]
That's my Gohan...

00:17:02.544 --> 00:17:05.349
He's getting
stronger every day.

00:17:05.383 --> 00:17:06.987
Don't you worry
about a thing.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.389
We'll take good care of him.

00:17:08.422 --> 00:17:10.192
And with all of us there
to look after each other,

00:17:10.225 --> 00:17:12.631
what's the worst
that could happen?

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:16.104
You said five days... can
you learn Namekian by then?

00:17:16.137 --> 00:17:17.373
Good point...

00:17:17.407 --> 00:17:19.512
I will take some time to
program a translator...

00:17:19.545 --> 00:17:22.116
so lets call it ten
to be safe... 'Kay...!

00:17:22.149 --> 00:17:23.920
We'll meet in ten
days at Roshi's!

00:17:23.953 --> 00:17:25.558
[GOHAN laughs]

00:17:25.591 --> 00:17:27.059
Great!

00:17:28.362 --> 00:17:30.534
[NARRATOR] So with
preparations under way

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:33.338
ten days passed in
a blink of an eye.

00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:36.580
And now... the day of
the launch has arrived!

00:17:36.613 --> 00:17:38.248
[KRILLIN] Whew...
Are you sure this thing

00:17:38.282 --> 00:17:41.589
can get us all the
way to Planet Namek?

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:43.827
[BULMA] That's a pretty
snazzy outfit, Krillin.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.698
Did you rob
the kids department?

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.402
You realize it's freezing
in space, don't you?

00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:50.005
I thought you'd take
your packing choices

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:52.277
a little more
serious like me.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.414
I even cut my hair for this!

00:17:54.447 --> 00:17:56.619
[KRILLIN laughs]

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:05.402
[GROUP gasps]

00:18:08.075 --> 00:18:09.477
[GROUP yells]

00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:10.312
[KRILLIN laughs]

00:18:10.346 --> 00:18:12.250
Gohan, I barely
recognized you!

00:18:12.284 --> 00:18:14.454
What's wrong with
your hair? You lose a bet?

00:18:14.487 --> 00:18:17.962
No... Dad laughed the
first time he saw me, too.

00:18:17.995 --> 00:18:19.430
Say what you will,

00:18:19.464 --> 00:18:21.402
but I think he looks like a
perfect little gentleman...

00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:23.574
He's going to make
quite the impression!

00:18:23.607 --> 00:18:24.542
We're counting on you.

00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:26.178
If there's Dragon
Balls on Namek,

00:18:26.211 --> 00:18:27.615
I know you'll find them.

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:28.783
Right!

00:18:31.723 --> 00:18:33.225
Piccolo.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.420
Bye, Grandpa...
Goodbye, Mom...

00:18:47.454 --> 00:18:49.424
Bye, Master Roshi
and Mister Turtle...

00:18:49.457 --> 00:18:51.930
We'll be back
soon... I promise.

00:18:51.963 --> 00:18:53.265
Piccolo.

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:55.436
[OX-KING] Eat as much as
you can, whenever you can!

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.510
And don't forget to
write to me every day!

00:18:58.544 --> 00:19:00.079
Bye!

kind of exciting, isn't it?

00:19:12.704 --> 00:19:13.807
Hey... Bulma.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.476
Where do you want us to
put our bags and stuff?

00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:18.950
I don't care, just somewhere
out of the way... And hurry up!

00:19:18.984 --> 00:19:21.522
Hmm... She sure
is grouchy today.

00:19:21.555 --> 00:19:25.597
We launch in five seconds...
Our destination... Namek.

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:26.766

[KRILLIN] Stop...!
We're still not ready yet!

00:19:38.488 --> 00:19:41.194
Couldn't you at least waited
until we got our seatbelts on?

about the ship being fast.

of sight already!

around now if you want.

Things should
run more smoothly

now that we've
left the atmosphere.

I'm changing my clothes.

00:20:09.952 --> 00:20:13.092
Seriously...?
Like into pajamas?

Hey, speaking of...

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.670
I think I forgot to bring
anything to sleep in.

00:20:18.703 --> 00:20:19.705
What about you?

00:20:19.738 --> 00:20:22.778
Pajamas were the first
thing that I packed.

00:20:22.811 --> 00:20:24.582
Not that it's any
of my business...

00:20:24.615 --> 00:20:25.850
but I was starting
to wonder how long

00:20:25.884 --> 00:20:28.455
you were going to stay
in that nerd costume.

[GOHAN]
It was just for launch.

I made something to
change into later,

00:20:31.629 --> 00:20:34.669
but I didn't want Mom
to see it before we left.

00:20:34.702 --> 00:20:37.173
Hmm...

00:20:37.206 --> 00:20:38.643

These aren't my
pajamas, you idiots.

I was just tired of being
the only person on the ship

who cared enough to
dress appropriately

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:07.200
