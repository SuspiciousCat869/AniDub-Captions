Which means your
only choice is to submit.

Come... Join with me, Eighteen.

00:17:58.523 --> 00:18:01.729
Let us discover
perfection together.

00:18:06.438 --> 00:18:07.774
Huh?

00:18:10.747 --> 00:18:12.383
I d stay back if I were you...

00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:15.524
Take one step closer
and I ll self-destruct.

00:18:15.557 --> 00:18:18.730
I m guessing you wouldn t
like that very much.

[CELL USES 17'S VOICE]
Please don t do anything
foolish, Eighteen...

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:32.625
Listen... It ll be okay.

00:18:32.658 --> 00:18:35.698
I didn t like the idea
of joining Cell either...

00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:37.635
But I was so wrong...!

00:18:37.668 --> 00:18:39.037
It s great!

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.208
You should let him
absorb you right away.

00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:42.711
Trust me-- you won t believe

00:18:42.745 --> 00:18:46.251
how incredible it feels
to have this kind of power!

00:18:46.285 --> 00:18:48.624
Is that really you,
Seventeen...?

00:18:48.657 --> 00:18:51.161
[ANDROID 16] No...
It is a trick, Eighteen!

00:18:51.194 --> 00:18:52.698
Do not listen...!

00:18:52.732 --> 00:18:55.603
Cell is only using Seventeen s
voice in order to confuse you!

00:18:55.637 --> 00:18:58.710
[CELL] Silence toaster!
Keep quiet.

00:18:58.743 --> 00:19:02.684
I think Eighteen is capable
of recognizing her own brother.

Aren t you, Eighteen...
Hear him out.

00:19:05.824 --> 00:19:06.893
It s good in here now,

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:08.195
but with you
it would be perfect!

00:19:08.229 --> 00:19:09.632
We would be
the ultimate android,

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:12.805
and we could fulfill
all of our father s wishes!

00:19:12.838 --> 00:19:14.207
We can defeat Goku

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.814
and then turn this entire
world into our playground!

00:19:17.848 --> 00:19:19.051
No...! I ve heard enough!

00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:20.920
That is not Seventeen!

00:19:22.724 --> 00:19:25.430
We hated Doctor Gero for
stealing our lives from us

00:19:25.463 --> 00:19:27.500
and turning us into
his pet androids...

00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:31.509
The last thing Seventeen cared
about was fulfilling his wishes!

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:33.513
If you refuse to
come to me willingly,

00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:35.750
I will simply
take you by force!

00:19:36.553 --> 00:19:38.657
And don t bother
self-destructing...

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.461
It ll take you a second or two
to power up the blast...

00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:43.600
which will be more
time than I need.

00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:45.704
[CELL] With my new speed,
I could close the distance
