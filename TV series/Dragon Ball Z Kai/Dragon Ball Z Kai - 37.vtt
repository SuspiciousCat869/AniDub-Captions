WEBVTT

00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:07.381
I swear you'll pay
for this, you worms!

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.619
I'll kill you,
slowly and surely!

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.293
Not a single one of you is
getting away! Say your prayers!

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:16.065
You've finally shown
your true colors, huh?

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:17.869
Go ahead and try it!

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.811
If you think I'll be defeated
that easily, you're gravely
mistaken!

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:24.550
Of all the things you
might have said...

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.325
It seems you've forgotten
how terrifying I can be.

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:33.466
Let me remind you.

00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:42.351
It can't be!

00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:45.825
T-T-To think he'd
be this dreadful...!

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:19.579
"A Nightmarish Transformation!
Freeza at Battle Power
1,000,000."

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:28.229
That huge Ki just
got even larger.

00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:35.644
Has that Freeza guy
finally gone into action?

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.921
I sense a faint Ki. I
hope that isn't Gohan!

00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:58.858
A Namekian, who
looks just like me...

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.328
He's close to death.

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:06.205
A-Are you the Namekian the
earthlings were talking about?

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.552
Y-You are... Then their
wish was granted. Good.

00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:15.925
Ho, you seem to know
all about everything, huh?

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:21.737
Then you must also know that
I am hurrying to help those
kids.

00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:22.872
Yeah...

00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:25.845
Sorry, but I'll have to
leave you here to die.

00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:27.782
You surprise me.

00:03:28.717 --> 00:03:30.955
I don't know what kind
of training you've done,

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:35.230
but you've gained an
unbelievable level of power.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.568
Which makes it all
the more a shame.

00:03:37.668 --> 00:03:42.211
If only you had come back here
as your original, single self...

00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.380
What?!

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.685
...you could have beaten Freeza.

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:48.825
Hmph, are you saying that
if I had merged with Kami,

00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:50.460
and we had become one again,

00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:54.636
our power would be greater
than even that Freeza bastard?

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:59.879
Th-That's right. I was
overwhelmingly beaten by Freeza,

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:05.758
but I think I... know
Freeza's power pretty well.

00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:13.574
Hmph, it doesn't make
any difference now.

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:17.983
Besides, I never intend
to rejoin with him!

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:19.352
Then...

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:23.193
...j-join with me.

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:26.834
I am the last...

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:29.839
...warrior-type
Namekian on this world.

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.610
What? You?

00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:36.887
Y-Yes. Your own power would
increase several times over.

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:41.763
I'm flattered by your offer,
but I want to be who I am.

00:04:41.863 --> 00:04:44.402
I don't want to join your
individuality with mine.

00:04:44.503 --> 00:04:48.042
Heh... You're a proud one...

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.749
Hurry! There's no time!

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.728
I am going to die soon. Quickly,
place your hand on my body!

00:05:13.828 --> 00:05:18.503
D-Don't worry.
Your personality will be your
own.

00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:24.248
I will be yours. I will be
nothing more than a catalyst.

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:26.485
You wouldn't lie to me, right?

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.800
If you think I would, then go on
ahead and get killed by Freeza.

00:05:43.052 --> 00:05:48.630
All right. Very well,
I'll try it your way.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.204
But if I don't like it
the least little bit,

00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:54.576
I'll drive you out right away.

00:05:54.676 --> 00:05:56.345
That's a fine thing to say,

00:05:56.445 --> 00:06:00.688
when I'm offering you a
wonderful present with the best
of intentions.

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.763
I'm in a hurry. If you're
going to do this, then do it.

00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:09.506
Y-You make sure you
kill Freeza. Got it?

00:06:09.606 --> 00:06:12.211
Hmph, I don't need
to hear it from you.

00:06:12.311 --> 00:06:17.020
That's what I want, if I can
manage it. For my own sake, as
well.

00:07:21.148 --> 00:07:25.190
N-No way... How can this be...?

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.895
What power!

00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:30.868
What unbelievable,
amazing power!

00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:34.909
I-Is this what it is
to merge with someone?!

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:41.221
I can beat him! Whoever my
opponent may be, I can't lose!

00:07:41.322 --> 00:07:45.496
I have just obtained
ultimate power!

00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:40.642
Gohan, at this rate, Vegeta will
be finished off in no time!

00:08:40.742 --> 00:08:44.015
We have to get in
there, and go for broke!

00:08:44.115 --> 00:08:45.818
Right!

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:01.683
Kuririn-san!

00:09:25.063 --> 00:09:29.204
What a Ki... There's
no way we can win...

00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:38.757
Of course not. Do you think that
three mere ants can beat a
dinosaur?

00:09:45.337 --> 00:09:46.806
Yes, we can.

00:09:46.906 --> 00:09:51.114
If we three fight together,
we can manage to beat you.

00:09:52.117 --> 00:09:55.089
What did you say?
You can beat me?

00:09:55.189 --> 00:09:56.893
That's right.

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.968
Of all the things you
might have said...

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:03.874
Freeza, not even you appear
to have realized this,

00:10:03.974 --> 00:10:08.249
but their battle powers
are rising quickly.

00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:10.153
The little one, in particular,

00:10:10.253 --> 00:10:14.394
has a hidden power that
not even he is aware of.

00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:16.666
And I am in the
process of becoming

00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:20.172
the Super Saiyan that
you are so afraid of!

00:10:20.273 --> 00:10:22.512
I'm surprised that you would
tell such a whopper as that.

00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:25.383
A Super Saiyan?

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:32.898
You are really pushing
my buttons, you bastard!

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:53.172
What?!

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:33.085
What?!

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:53.092
I see. So it wasn't
complete hogwash.

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:56.800
It's true... If the three
of us fight together,

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.404
we might be able to
get through this.

00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:05.784
Sure, he's incredibly tough,
but our power has increased,
too!

00:12:05.884 --> 00:12:12.364
I see. After coming here, Vegeta
has gained strength beyond his
limits.

00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:18.342
But then, why is Freeza so
unusually calm and composed?

00:12:21.015 --> 00:12:23.520
Transform yourself, Freeza.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.490
T-Transform?!

00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.193
If we're going to do this,

00:12:27.293 --> 00:12:29.131
why don't you transform right
now, and show us your true
self?!

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:32.906
Ho, I am impressed that
you knew about that.

00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:34.842
How did you find out?

00:12:34.942 --> 00:12:37.582
That bastard Zarbon let it slip.

00:12:37.682 --> 00:12:39.418
W-What are you talking about?!

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:42.357
There are a very small number of
weirdos out there in the
universe

00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:45.764
that are able to alter their
forms when it becomes necessary.

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:47.234
Whether for the
sake of camouflage,

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:49.438
or to prevent them from
consuming energy unnecessarily

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:51.943
in their usual states.

00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:55.183
My case is a little different.

00:12:55.283 --> 00:13:00.695
It is because I have too much
power, and cannot control it
myself.

00:13:00.795 --> 00:13:02.030
W-What?

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.535
Don't let him scare
you! He's just bluffing!

00:13:04.635 --> 00:13:05.972
He won't change that much.

00:13:06.072 --> 00:13:08.576
Are you sure about that?

00:13:17.762 --> 00:13:22.805
Very well. If you want to die
that badly, I'll show you.

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:28.683
Watch closely, now. This is not
something you will see every
day.

00:13:28.784 --> 00:13:32.625
After all, I had absolutely
no need to transform myself

00:13:32.725 --> 00:13:36.332
when I attacked Planet Vegeta,
where the Saiyans lived.

00:13:36.432 --> 00:13:40.975
Vegeta-san, your father,
the king of Planet Vegeta,

00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:43.145
was not all that big a deal.

00:13:43.246 --> 00:13:45.383
Don't let that fact
swell your head!

00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:49.358
I had surpassed the king's power
when I was just a little kid!

00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:54.001
The Saiyans' planet was
destroyed by him, was it?

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:57.608
Now, prepare to be stunned!

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:46.405
Ha! What kind of transformation
is that?! It's laughable!

00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:48.977
Imagine, your transformation
consisting of stripping out of
that,

00:14:49.077 --> 00:14:51.381
and making yourself lighter!

00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:56.959
Vegeta-san, you disappoint me.

00:14:57.059 --> 00:14:59.498
And after all the favor
I have shown you, too.

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:02.103
If only you had remained
submissive to me,

00:15:02.203 --> 00:15:05.477
you would not have had
to experience this terror.

00:15:05.578 --> 00:15:07.380
What?!

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.162
You mean you're now
just getting to it?!

00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:33.432
What?!

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.120
Th-This can't be right...!

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.857
W-We're gonna die!

00:16:18.957 --> 00:16:21.596
I-It's a nightmare!

00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:29.578
Watch yourselves.

00:16:29.678 --> 00:16:34.521
Now that I'm like this, I won't
be as gentle as I was before.

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:46.011
W-What a Ki!

00:16:48.115 --> 00:16:49.585
W-What is this?!

00:16:49.685 --> 00:16:52.624
The strength of Freeza's Ki
just increased many times over!

00:16:52.724 --> 00:16:54.495
I-It couldn't be...!

00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:56.566
Gohan!

00:17:02.277 --> 00:17:05.449
Vegeta, where's all that energy
you had a moment ago?

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.157
You were pretty free with
your words, weren't you?

00:17:10.927 --> 00:17:12.463
Well, not that I can blame you.

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:17.139
Not now that I've shown you
my overwhelming power.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:31.970
W-What a monster!

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.975
Like I said, watch yourselves.

00:17:35.075 --> 00:17:37.047
After all, I have more
power than I can handle.

00:17:37.147 --> 00:17:39.752
I just might overdo things.

00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:45.095
Incidentally, you can be sure my
battle power is at least a
million.

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:49.471
W-What?!

00:17:49.572 --> 00:17:51.007
O-Oh, no...

00:17:51.107 --> 00:17:54.615
N-Not even you could
be that strong...

00:17:56.351 --> 00:18:01.328
Hmph, if you think I'm lying,
then allow me to demonstrate.

00:18:11.683 --> 00:18:13.485
Dende!

00:18:43.278 --> 00:18:48.790
What is this?! What has
that bastard Freeza done?!

00:18:49.558 --> 00:18:53.298
What is with this planet?!

00:19:01.282 --> 00:19:04.722
W-Where's Kuririn-san?!

00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:07.193
Where's Kuririn-san?!

00:19:07.293 --> 00:19:09.230
Over here!

00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:12.337
You're bleeding!

00:19:12.437 --> 00:19:16.645
It's no big deal. One of those
rock fragments just hit me.

00:19:18.683 --> 00:19:23.693
Your swiftness in fleeing is
quite impressive. I applaud you.

00:19:23.793 --> 00:19:26.999
But then, that one was just
my way of offering my regards.

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.540
Even a Saiyan is
capable of that.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.676
D-Damn it!

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:34.682
The look on your face
is pathetic, Vegeta.

00:19:34.782 --> 00:19:40.493
Apparently, you never imagined
that I would become this strong.

00:19:40.594 --> 00:19:46.371
Well now, who shall
I show hell to first?

00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:40.980
I've decided!

00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:52.203
Kuririn-san!!

00:20:52.303 --> 00:20:54.608
H-He's fast!

00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:22.096
All too easily, Freeza
runs Kuririn through!

00:21:22.196 --> 00:21:26.271
Is this the strength of Freeza?!

00:21:26.371 --> 00:21:29.811
Kuririn-san!!

00:22:38.048 --> 00:22:39.651
Heya! I'm Goku!

00:22:39.751 --> 00:22:41.154
Kuririn has been done in?!

00:22:41.254 --> 00:22:45.329
Damn it, I can't wait until
I've completely recovered!

00:22:45.429 --> 00:22:47.701
Kuririn-san, please don't die!

00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:50.507
Kid, you don't appear to be just
an ordinary pipsqueak, huh?

00:22:50.607 --> 00:22:54.715
But the more you struggle,
the more angry you make me!

00:22:54.815 --> 00:22:56.586
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:22:56.686 --> 00:23:00.359
"Freeza Bares His Fangs!
A Transcendental Power Attacks
Gohan."

00:23:00.459 --> 00:23:02.764
Now, to finish you!
