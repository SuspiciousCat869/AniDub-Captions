[KING KAI] We don't
have very much time,

00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:53.974
so I'll try to keep it simple.

00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:55.477
First, we use the
Dragon Balls on Earth

00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:58.249
to bring back everyone
who fell to Frieza or his men.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:00.554
If there's truly no limit
to the number of people

00:11:00.588 --> 00:11:02.290
we can bring back
with a single wish,

00:11:02.324 --> 00:11:04.962
we'll save almost the
entire Namekian race.

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:07.702
And from what it sounds like,
maybe even the Grand Elder

00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:10.006
for a short time.
Now unless I'm mistaken,

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:12.077
the Namekian Dragon
Balls were only used for

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.847
two of their
three wishes, right?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.285
And they stopped working
when the Grand Elder died.

00:11:16.318 --> 00:11:17.487
But if we can bring him back,

00:11:17.522 --> 00:11:19.124
and I realize that's
a pretty big "if",

00:11:19.157 --> 00:11:21.161
then the Namekian Dragon
Balls should theoretically

00:11:21.194 --> 00:11:24.401
reactivate, allowing us
to access the third wish!

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.038
