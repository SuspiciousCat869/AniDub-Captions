00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:10.654
you've dismantled
everything earlier than him.

00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:13.360
[GERO] I intended to give
him a complete overhaul.

00:10:13.393 --> 00:10:14.529
Look... if you do this,

00:10:14.563 --> 00:10:16.966
if you reactivate
Android Sixteen now,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.804
you have doomed
us, one and all!

00:10:18.838 --> 00:10:20.340
We're all doomed, are we?

00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:22.343
I think I'll be
the judge of that.

00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:28.924
My sensors are
reporting that

00:10:28.957 --> 00:10:31.361
I'm stronger than
he is, you coward.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.266
Yes, but you're.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.134
Fine, then...

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:35.971
Go for it,
Eighteen--fire him up.

00:10:36.004 --> 00:10:38.143
That is enough!.
Shut your trap...!

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:40.848
The two of you are
just as bad as Sixteen!

00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:42.819
[GERO] Try to activate
him, you failures!

00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:44.923
I'm shutting you down
for good this time!

00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:46.926
[17] I broke your
little switch, remember?

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.097
Fine--I'll make
a new one, then!

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.475
Eighteen, are your
ears malfunctioning...?!

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:56.278
I forbid you to press that!

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.801
You... little brat!

00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:10.172
How dare you!

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.412
You are mine!

00:11:13.445 --> 00:11:16.753
You're my creation!
Obey me!

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:26.172
You ingrate!

00:11:26.272 --> 00:11:28.142
Look at what you've done!

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:39.031
What kind of
monster... does...

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:41.869
that to his maker, anyway...?!

00:11:43.674 --> 00:11:44.609
I see...

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:45.978
So whoever gets in their way,

00:11:46.012 --> 00:11:49.084
they destroy...
Just like a Saiyan.

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.100
You mean me?

00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:02.010
Aw man...! What'd I do?!

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:13.901
[17]
Let's get on with it Eighteen.

00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:15.871
You're not activating
another android--

00:12:15.904 --> 00:12:18.510
not so long as I'm
alive to stop you!

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:24.321
Hit the deck...!

00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:27.093
[explosion]

00:12:29.097 --> 00:12:30.868
Next time you wanna
blow everything up,

00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:32.571
how 'bout a warning first?!

00:12:32.605 --> 00:12:33.974
You little fool...!

00:12:34.007 --> 00:12:35.945
Why did you even
waste your breath?

00:12:35.978 --> 00:12:37.982
It's more than you did!

00:12:38.016 --> 00:12:40.219
Oh, really? Observe.

00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:45.898
Your attack did nothing.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.201
You might as well
have tickled them--

00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:49.004
at least that they
would have felt that.

00:12:49.037 --> 00:12:51.475
You young people
really are worthless,

00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:52.845
aren't you.

00:12:54.047 --> 00:12:55.851
We had better get him
out of that pod quickly...

00:12:55.885 --> 00:12:58.890
All of the support
systems were disconnected.

00:13:12.685 --> 00:13:14.020
That whole, "keep
it closed!" thing...?

00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:17.828
Yeah... so that plan's gone
right out the window...!

00:13:40.473 --> 00:13:41.944
That's Number Sixteen...?!

00:13:41.977 --> 00:13:42.945
I don't even think I come up

00:13:42.978 --> 00:13:45.049
to the kneecaps on that guy...!

00:13:45.082 --> 00:13:48.422
<i>[TRUNKS] In my future,
that android doesn't exist!</i>

00:13:48.455 --> 00:13:49.859
<i>Who is he?!</i>

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:06.325
Y'know, it occurs to me...

00:14:06.358 --> 00:14:09.264
I've never seen one of
your models active before.

00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:12.303
[17] Glad to be out and
about after all those years?

00:14:13.773 --> 00:14:15.076
Truth be known,

00:14:15.109 --> 00:14:17.549
Dr. Gero ordered us to
leave you inside of there.

00:14:17.582 --> 00:14:18.817
He kept yelling about

00:14:18.851 --> 00:14:21.254
how we were all doomed
if you woke up again.

00:14:21.622 --> 00:14:22.792
So, would you
care to fill us in

00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:25.096
on what the old man
was so upset about?

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.735
What's the matter--cat
got your tongue?

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:30.574
Or are you ...
the strong, silent type?

00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:35.517
Whatever... Let's go.

00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:36.519
Where to?

00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:37.788
Wherever Goku is...

00:14:37.822 --> 00:14:39.424
Where else
would we wanna go?

00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:41.929
Dr. Gero invented
you to destroy Goku,

00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:44.367
the same as us two--well,
isn't that right?

00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:46.138
Correct.

00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:47.106
I see...

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.144
Mention killing Goku
and you chime in.

00:14:49.177 --> 00:14:51.015
He only responds to the topics

00:14:51.048 --> 00:14:52.383
Gero programmed into him...

00:14:52.417 --> 00:14:54.689
He's not a failure.
He's just focused.

00:14:54.722 --> 00:14:55.958
Well as much as
I hate the thought

00:14:55.991 --> 00:14:57.226
of following Gero's orders,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.397
the idea of us
standing around here

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:02.336
all day doing nothing
is driving me up a wall.

00:15:02.704 --> 00:15:04.340
C'mon--let's go.

00:15:13.092 --> 00:15:15.598
[KRILLIN]
Th-They're flying away...

00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:16.733
Lucky us...!

00:15:16.766 --> 00:15:19.037
So, what are they
planning to do...?

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.473
I'm sure it can't
be anything good!

00:15:20.507 --> 00:15:22.277
They're heading
away from North City,

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.114
so that's not their target...

00:15:24.148 --> 00:15:25.016
I don't understand.

00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:26.284
It's Goku...!

00:15:26.318 --> 00:15:28.456
They're headed straight
towards Goku's place...!

00:15:28.489 --> 00:15:31.028
Because... He took
down the Red Ribbon Army

00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:32.263
back in the day,

00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:34.034
and Dr. Gero's wanted
revenge ever since!

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.169
True... but...

00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:36.405
why would they
kill Gero one minute,

00:15:36.438 --> 00:15:38.510
then turn and carry out
his orders the next?

00:15:38.543 --> 00:15:41.348
Who cares what they
want to accomplish?

00:15:41.381 --> 00:15:43.620
They're not going to
be here long enough...!

00:15:43.653 --> 00:15:45.423
They ignored me...

00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:47.027
Not the slightest
acknowledgment

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.964
that I was here...

00:15:48.998 --> 00:15:51.001
That was a mistake!

00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:55.476
No--don't follow them!

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.378
Please, wait...!

00:15:56.412 --> 00:15:58.016
Just a little
longer--that's all!

00:15:58.049 --> 00:16:00.854
So Kakarot can drag
himself out of bed?

00:16:00.887 --> 00:16:03.760
Kakarot? Are you
talking about Goku...?

00:16:03.793 --> 00:16:04.963
Listen to me!

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:06.232
Unless all three of
us go Super Saiyan,

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:09.003
there is no way we
can hope to defeat them!

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:12.845
You really don't
get it, do you?

00:16:12.878 --> 00:16:14.549
I'll crush the
androids happily enough,

00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:17.989
but the one I truly
want to annihilate...

00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:19.625
Is Kakarot!

00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:20.761
I'll dispatch
these machines

00:16:20.794 --> 00:16:22.765
before he can
sully my victory.

00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:24.769
I shall be the end
of Kakarot, too...

00:16:24.802 --> 00:16:26.138
once he's well...

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:27.775
Now get out of my way!

00:16:27.808 --> 00:16:28.676
What's wrong with you?!

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.879
You insist on rushing off

00:16:29.912 --> 00:16:31.816
to fight a battle
that'll be your death!

00:16:31.849 --> 00:16:34.087
Please, I am
begging you to wait!

00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:40.266
[KRILLIN]
What the...!

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.940
Trunks! Are you okay?

00:16:44.274 --> 00:16:45.778
Go... after... him...!

00:16:45.811 --> 00:16:46.779
Until Goku's recovered

00:16:46.813 --> 00:16:47.915
from his heart condition,

00:16:47.948 --> 00:16:50.152
Vegeta can't be
allowed to fight them!

00:16:50.186 --> 00:16:51.890
Stop him, Krillin--please!

00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:52.958
Gohan and Bulma

00:16:52.991 --> 00:16:53.960
are still out
there somewhere--

00:16:53.994 --> 00:16:56.600
they were headed
to Goku's place!

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:57.400
Oh man!

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:58.737
The androids are
gonna catch 'em!

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.741
You're right.

00:17:00.774 --> 00:17:02.778
My mother's
life is in danger!

00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:04.715
After them, then--come on!

00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:12.363
"Good call...!

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:13.900
Make a diaper out
of my best scarf...!

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:15.604
Wonder what'll happen...?

00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:16.606
Oh he whizzed on it?!

00:17:16.639 --> 00:17:17.875
Who knew?!"

00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:19.011
[sniffs]

00:17:19.044 --> 00:17:22.083
Yeah, that's baby pee.
Huuuuurrgghhh!!

00:17:22.116 --> 00:17:23.453
Hey, Yajirobe...

00:17:23.486 --> 00:17:26.726
Got anything else
I can use as a diaper?

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:27.995
You ain't fooling me again!

00:17:28.028 --> 00:17:29.197
Stop being such a grump

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.603
or he's gonna come
down with a cold!

00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:32.538
Yeah...?

00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:33.940
Well... grown-up
Trunks wasn't sniffling,

00:17:33.973 --> 00:17:35.778
so get over it!

00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:38.181
Huh... I guess it's okay...

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:39.685
You hear that...?

00:17:39.718 --> 00:17:42.958
Even if you do get a
cold, you'll be fine!

00:17:42.991 --> 00:17:45.096
And someday, you're
gonna be able to fly,

00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:46.565
just like your daddy!

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:49.337
Hey, Bulma...
[Bulma] Upsie-daisy,
my darling Trunks!

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.009
So, uh, is it okay if
we head out again soon?

00:17:52.043 --> 00:17:53.278
Yeah, of course...!

00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:55.884
You've gotta be pretty
worried about Goku, huh.

00:17:55.918 --> 00:17:57.721
Off we go!

00:17:57.755 --> 00:18:01.629
<i>[thinking] I wonder if Dad's
feeling better yet. I hope so...</i>

00:18:02.296 --> 00:18:04.769
[YAMCHA] Looks like he's
through the worst of it...

00:18:04.802 --> 00:18:07.073
So he's gonna be okay?!

00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:09.178
Far as I can tell, he's
on the road to recovery--

00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:10.446
but according to Trunks,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.350
whatever he came down
with is contagious...

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:14.789
We should hit up this
medicine too, Chichi.

00:18:14.822 --> 00:18:15.891
And Gohan...

00:18:15.924 --> 00:18:17.527
Why isn't he back yet?

00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:19.431
Uhh,
I don't know...!

00:18:19.464 --> 00:18:21.268
I just kinda
assumed he was here!

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:23.873
He's probably off
playing somewhere!

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:32.290
<i>[thinking] I've had enough
of that sniveling coward!</i>

00:18:32.324 --> 00:18:33.694
<i>Who needs Kakarot?</i>

00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:36.498
<i>Have I not become a
Super Saiyan as well?!</i>

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:37.968
<i>All other things being equal,</i>

00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:40.206
<i>he's no competition
for me, Vegeta,</i>

00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:41.776
<i>the prince of all Saiyans!</i>

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.081
<i>I'll show Trunks just
how powerful I am!</i>

00:18:44.114 --> 00:18:46.251
<i>I'll show them all!</i>

00:19:02.818 --> 00:19:05.691
[18] Seventeen, why'd we land
in the middle of nowhere?

00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:07.995
[17] Well, we're not
in any hurry, right...?

00:19:08.028 --> 00:19:10.032
Might as well enjoy the trip.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.870
That code for
"we're gonna walk?"

00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:13.439
That sounds like a drag.

00:19:13.472 --> 00:19:15.076
I say we wait
here until someone

00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:16.979
drives by in
something we like...

00:19:17.012 --> 00:19:19.250
and then we
take it for a spin.

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.021
Boys love things
like road-trips,

00:19:21.054 --> 00:19:21.856
don't they...?

00:19:21.889 --> 00:19:23.192
Listen to you...

00:19:23.225 --> 00:19:25.029
Still got a bit of human
rattling around in there.

00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:27.167
Sixteen knows what
I'm talking about...

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.971
I bet he was
totally a car guy

00:19:29.004 --> 00:19:31.108
before Gero changed him.

00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:34.380
Negative... I...
never was a human.

00:19:34.414 --> 00:19:36.552
You weren't made
from a human being?

00:19:36.586 --> 00:19:38.022
You're a totally
different sort

00:19:38.055 --> 00:19:39.892
of android than the two of us.

00:19:41.195 --> 00:19:42.430
<i>[thinking]
That's weird...</i>

00:19:42.464 --> 00:19:44.201
<i>If Dr. Gero was
already good enough</i>

00:19:44.234 --> 00:19:46.506
<i>to build Sixteen
from the ground up...</i>

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:48.241
<i>why'd he bother
using real humans</i>

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:50.847
<i>as a starting point
for Eighteen and me?</i>

00:19:51.883 --> 00:19:53.887
[VEGETA]
Well, well!

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.022
Not the sort of place

00:19:55.055 --> 00:19:56.860
I had expected to
find you three...

00:19:56.893 --> 00:19:58.295
but it'll have to do.

00:19:58.329 --> 00:19:59.532
[17]
Look he's back...

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:01.334
but what on Earth did
you do to your hair?

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.640
You'll find out
what soon enough.

00:20:03.674 --> 00:20:06.011
Your leaving all of a
sudden got me curious

00:20:06.044 --> 00:20:06.946
I will admit.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.082
Where is your destination?

00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:09.852
[18] Goku's house,
wherever it is...

00:20:09.885 --> 00:20:10.754
To kill him.

00:20:10.788 --> 00:20:11.655
Just as I thought...

00:20:11.689 --> 00:20:14.327
But you're never
going to get there.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.897
Because I, Vegeta,

00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:17.934
shall crush you
here and now.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.874
Funny, was it?

00:20:20.907 --> 00:20:21.876
Go right ahead...

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.180
Laugh it up while you can.

00:20:24.213 --> 00:20:26.786
Hey guys, Vegeta seems
to be pretty cocky,

00:20:26.819 --> 00:20:27.486
doesn't he?

00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:28.956
It must be a Saiyan thing.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.227
They always talk
such a big talk,

00:20:31.261 --> 00:20:33.666
and then they end
up losing so fast--

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:34.434
it's a shame.

00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:35.504
You shut your mouth...

00:20:35.537 --> 00:20:37.440
you disrespectful toy!

00:20:37.473 --> 00:20:39.010
I'll rip all three
of you to pieces!

00:20:39.043 --> 00:20:40.246
Who's first?!

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:42.049
You, boy?! Or you!

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:43.352
Or the big bastard?!

00:20:43.385 --> 00:20:44.487
Or maybe I'll just demolish

00:20:44.522 --> 00:20:46.893
all three of you
in a single go!

00:20:46.927 --> 00:20:48.697
Or maybe you'll die.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:49.832
What did you say?!

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:52.203
[18] Go on... I want to
see how strong you are...

00:20:52.236 --> 00:20:53.906
Sixteen you're up.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.511
Negative.

00:20:55.544 --> 00:20:58.917
The big one's not as
stupid as he looks.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.088
He sees how deadly I am.

00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:02.525
Why's he taking a pass?

00:21:02.558 --> 00:21:04.761
I really don't get him.

00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:08.904
'Kay, Mr. Hot Shot...

00:21:08.937 --> 00:21:12.611
Let's play... Just you and me.

[VEGETA] Gladly! But

notions of chivalry!

00:21:17.353 --> 00:21:19.057
But you're not a
female, are you--

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.159
no, not anymore...

00:21:20.192 --> 00:21:22.229
You're merely a thing!
