Last Dragon Ball Z Kai!

In a crushing display of
his newly increased powers,

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:08.985
Vegeta dealt rival Cui
out of the game for good.

00:00:09.018 --> 00:00:10.889
Meanwhile, sensing
the dark forces

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:12.291
that had converged on Namek,

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:14.128
Krillin and Gohan decided to

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.532
venture out of
their hiding place

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:18.938
to investigate what Frieza
and his men were up to...

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:19.907
Back on Earth,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.577
Goku made a complete recovery,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.685

enter the fray... now!

Aww...

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.633
Hi, Bulma's mom!

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:16.173
You've healed so fast;
can it really be you?

00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:18.477
Oh, it's me alright...

00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:19.747
Do you know
if the spaceship

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.717
I asked Bulma's dad
to fix is done yet?

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.588
Well... I'm not sure.

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:26.894
Last I saw, he was
still tinkering around.

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:29.566
He's still working...?!

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.635
That's not good.

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:32.806
[BULMA'S MOM] Oh, come
along. Let's go see him.

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:34.576
He's in the inner yard.

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:37.749
Oh my, who would've
ever thought

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:38.851
our darling little Goku

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.922
would grow up to be so
dashingly handsome...?

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:43.894
You simply must take me
out sometime soon, yes?

00:02:43.928 --> 00:02:45.163
Uh, sure, yeah...

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:47.067
Just let me...
defeat the Saiyans...

Well, aren't you
the busy beaver...

00:02:50.174 --> 00:02:51.409
Y'know, I stumbled across

00:02:51.443 --> 00:02:53.981
the most adorable cake
shop the other day...

00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:55.484
And the thought
occurred to me...

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:58.022
If you hadn't saved
the world it'd be gone...

00:02:58.055 --> 00:02:59.358
So thank you.

00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:02.031
Heh. Heh.
Oh, don't mention it.

[BULMA'S MOM] Sweetums!

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.068
Goku's here to see

00:03:04.102 --> 00:03:06.139
how you're doing on
the space-thingy.

00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:09.279
Woah! You've gotta
be kidding me...

00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:11.683
That's my spaceship?!

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:15.256
It's the size of a house!

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:21.737
Hey there... Didn't take
you long to heal up.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.041
No... Korin gave me
a Senzu bean...

00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:25.244
But what
about the ship...?

00:03:25.277 --> 00:03:27.047
Are you really not
finished with it yet?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.452
Mmm... Just a few odds
and ends left...

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:30.921
Come on in
and have a look.

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:33.861
Let me run and get you somethin'
to wet your whistles, 'kay?

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:35.564
That'd be great,
thank you.

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:40.106
Oh wow...! Amazing...!

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.081
How does one little space pod
turn into something like this?

00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:45.552
Built to your specifications,

00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:47.320
with a few tweaks of my own.

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:50.761
Ah! There's room for
all kinds of training in here.

00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:51.964
Quite a challenge...

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:54.736
Hell, just locating this
thing was an adventure...

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.776
Not to mention she was in
shambles for the most part...

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.047
But, luckily there was
enough of 'er still intact

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.617
for me to reverse engineer...

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.520
Practically built
the thing from scratch.

00:04:03.554 --> 00:04:06.359
Wait, it was in shambles?
My little pod...?

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:07.562
That's weird...

00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:08.964
I wonder if I did
somethin' to mess it up

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:10.067
when I was a kid...

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.670
Well, shambles or not,

00:04:11.703 --> 00:04:14.977
Saiyan technology is
pretty damn spectacular.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.485
So, uh... Where's the...
uh... Artificial Gravity Device?

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.257
Here... Just like
ya asked for.

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:24.428
[GOKU]
Whoa. Looks complicated.

00:04:24.462 --> 00:04:27.234
[BRIEFS] Not at all.
See, there's the "on" switch.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.537
And that's the controller...

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.273
Now, this puppy can
put out a hundred G's,

00:04:30.307 --> 00:04:31.242
as you requested...

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:33.581
So be very careful...

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:36.119
That kind of force is nothing
to thumb your nose at.

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:37.487
Even for someone like you...

00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:39.660
After all... If you weighed
just a hundred pounds,

00:04:39.693 --> 00:04:42.297
a hundred G's would put
you at ten-thousand pounds...

00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:44.603
Five tons...
A man'd have to be crazy--

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:46.373
Trust me... That's the idea.

00:04:46.406 --> 00:04:48.176
I'm gonna have to push
myself really hard

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.980
between here and Namek...

00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:52.619
So is this thing ready for
space travel yet or what?

00:04:52.652 --> 00:04:54.957
Oh, she'll fly...
Like a shooting star...

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.992
You can bet your life on it.

00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:57.695
Wha...? So...

00:04:57.728 --> 00:04:59.098

that ladder there...

[GOKU]
Wait. I don't get it.

00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:05.243
What exactly is
left to be done?

00:05:05.277 --> 00:05:06.680
I haven't yet found
an optimal spot

00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:08.551
to mount the stereo speakers...

00:05:08.584 --> 00:05:11.155
No point goin' hi-fi
if ya don't do it right.

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:12.625
So... Speakers...

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.263
A set of speakers is all that's
keepin' me on the ground?!

00:05:15.296 --> 00:05:16.634
That's all, he says... Ha...!

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:18.303
I'll have you
know it's quite tricky.

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.340
There's natural
acoustics to consider,

00:05:20.373 --> 00:05:22.979
reverberation,
tons of issues...

00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:25.284
But... Who cares about where
you put the speakers!

00:05:25.317 --> 00:05:27.120
I'm in the biggest
hurry of my life here!

00:05:27.154 --> 00:05:28.389
I have to get goin'!

00:05:28.423 --> 00:05:29.860
[BRIEFS] So sound
quality is of no concern?

00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:31.028
[GOKU] I got a message
from your daughter,

00:05:31.062 --> 00:05:32.163
for cryin' out loud!

00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:34.135
I need to leave,
like, yesterday!

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.905
Hmm...

00:05:35.938 --> 00:05:37.307
Please, please, please!

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:39.378
You gotta show me how
to fly this thing! Now!

00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:40.782
Fine, fine...

00:05:40.815 --> 00:05:43.053
But you're absolutely sure
about the stereo speakers?

00:05:43.086 --> 00:05:44.421
Uh-huh!

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:46.359
The flight data you need
has been pre-programmed...

00:05:46.392 --> 00:05:48.363
At the touch of
a button... bleep-bloop...

00:05:48.397 --> 00:05:49.566
Ya just sit back...

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.335
And let the ship make
the six-day flight

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:52.605
to Namek on its own.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.012
Six days...?! I can get
to Namek in six days?!

00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:57.615

Time to start trainin'...

It's great that I'll get to

00:08:45.584 --> 00:08:47.020
Gohan, do you see
what I'm seeing?!

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:48.423
The big one and
the guy with the hair,

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:50.026
look at what they've
got in their hands!

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:51.062
[GOHAN gasps]

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:53.233
I didn't know Dragon
Balls could be so big!

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.569
Huh...?

00:08:57.708 --> 00:08:59.713
Something wrong,
Dodoria?

00:08:59.746 --> 00:09:01.717
I thought I picked up
a tiny power level

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.854
coming from that cliff
just a second ago;

00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:05.958
but whatever it was,
it's gone now...

00:09:05.992 --> 00:09:08.797
It was probably an
insect or something.

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:15.110
[GOHAN and KRILLIN shudder]

00:09:15.143 --> 00:09:16.045
Wasn't good...

00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:18.950
We were this close
to being spotted.

[SUBORDINATE GATOR FACE]
Frieza, sir.

00:09:23.426 --> 00:09:24.962
Only five appear to be home...

00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:28.604
According to them, the
rest are "tilling the land."

00:09:28.637 --> 00:09:32.745
Get out here now...
otherwise I start shooting.

00:09:38.256 --> 00:09:39.224
Huh...?

00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:43.767
Hey, that guy looks
just like Piccolo!

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.305
It's... a real-live Namekian!

00:09:50.747 --> 00:09:53.452
[FRIEZA laughs]

00:09:53.485 --> 00:09:55.023
[KRILLIN]
What are they gonna do?

00:09:55.056 --> 00:09:57.093
Why did they force
'em all outside?

00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:00.133
[GOHAN] Krillin, think any of
those bad guys are Saiyan?

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:01.101
No they're not...

00:10:01.135 --> 00:10:02.505
They all have the
same battle gear on,

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:04.308
but those goons
aren't Saiyan.

00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:05.611
Besides, according to Vegeta,

00:10:05.644 --> 00:10:06.946
he's the last Saiyan
in existence

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.950
in the whole universe,
remember...?

00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:10.822
Well, not counting you
and your dad, of course.

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:12.558
Then... who are they?

00:10:12.592 --> 00:10:13.761
Now that I think about it,

00:10:13.794 --> 00:10:16.432
Goku's big brother
mentioned some crew...

We search for planets
with habitable environments

that using our
superior combat skills

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:25.249
eliminate all native
forms of life...

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:27.421
I'm not sure, but I think
these are the same guys

00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:29.592
he was talking about.

00:10:30.326 --> 00:10:34.101
Only thing... I don't see
Vegeta anywhere yet, do you?

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.269
[KRILLIN] Do ya
think he's looking for

00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:37.274
the Dragon Balls
someplace else?

[FRIEZA] Greetings,
my name is Frieza.

00:10:44.922 --> 00:10:46.960
As you can no doubt
surmise for yourselves,

00:10:46.993 --> 00:10:50.199
I'm quite the collector
of Dragon Balls.

00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:53.974
So now... I've told you
a little something about me...

00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:55.410
I expect you to
repay the courtesy

00:10:55.443 --> 00:10:58.048
by telling us the whereabouts
of your neighbors.

00:10:58.082 --> 00:11:01.255
Our sources say there
should be ten of you.

00:11:01.289 --> 00:11:03.527
[NAMEKIANS shudder]

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.300
You intend stay
silent on the matter...?

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.304
Very well then.

00:11:35.658 --> 00:11:38.162
[buzzing]

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:43.674
Come now, we haven't
got all day, have we?

[DODORIA laughs]

00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:55.998
Nuwainita...
hanitaemao moteleki koeto...

00:11:56.031 --> 00:11:58.269
Huh... A valiant
effort, my friend;

00:11:58.303 --> 00:12:01.041
but you will kindly answer our
questions in the same language

00:12:01.074 --> 00:12:03.980
with which they are addressed
to you, not this gibberish.

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:06.352
As I said, the others
are tilling the land...

00:12:06.385 --> 00:12:09.358
Only the old and
very young stay behind...

00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:10.794
I speak the truth.

00:12:10.827 --> 00:12:14.034
[FRIEZA] There, you see?
That wasn't so difficult.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.940
Continue to cooperate and
you've nothing to fear...

00:12:16.973 --> 00:12:20.046
Now, let's move on to more
pressing concerns, shall we?

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.952
I believe you have a Dragon
Ball in your possession?

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:25.524
[GOHAN and KRILLIN gasp]

00:12:25.558 --> 00:12:28.129
[FRIEZA] You are to present
it to me immediately.

00:12:28.162 --> 00:12:31.201
Wha... I've... no idea
what you're speaking of...

00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:32.972
[FRIEZA laughs]

00:12:33.005 --> 00:12:34.474

00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:35.310
Lord?

00:12:35.343 --> 00:12:36.211
[FRIEZA] I'm confused.

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:38.049
That other Namekian
we spoke to...

00:12:38.082 --> 00:12:40.621
He related something quite
intriguing, did he not?

00:12:40.654 --> 00:12:41.923
Yes... He did...

00:12:41.956 --> 00:12:43.459
Somethin' about not
being able to hand over

00:12:43.492 --> 00:12:46.298
his Dragon Ball except to
someone worthy... Heh...

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.971
Indeed... He was most
adamant about that point.

00:12:49.004 --> 00:12:50.172
Try as we might, though,

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:53.980
we could not get
him to say more.

00:12:54.013 --> 00:12:57.454
At least... not before we
decided to kill one of them.

00:12:57.487 --> 00:12:58.657
[ELDER gasps]

00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.926
Once that became part
of the discussion,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.830
he opened up quite a bit.

00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:03.165
About how the Grand
Elder of this world

00:13:03.198 --> 00:13:04.735
created seven Dragon Balls...

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:08.109
How each one was entrusted to
the care of a specific guardian,

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:09.378
who is required to determine,

00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:11.382
by conducting trials
of wit and strength,

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:14.053
whether a given seeker's
wish is honorable...

00:13:14.087 --> 00:13:16.258
And that only after being
determined sufficiently worthy

00:13:16.291 --> 00:13:19.766
can someone obtain the Dragon
Balls, etcetera, etcetera...

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:20.735
Well, and as you might imagine,

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:22.237
I had quite a difficult time

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.976
convincing the poor fellow
to see me as worthy...

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.245
I was told flat out

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:28.249
that I'd never obtain
a single Dragon Ball.

00:13:28.282 --> 00:13:30.822
And since I've never been
one to take bad news well,

00:13:30.855 --> 00:13:32.591
I'm afraid I killed him.

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:34.662
That did delay
our efforts to find

00:13:34.696 --> 00:13:37.467
the first Dragon
Ball somewhat...

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.704
But after locating it,

00:13:38.737 --> 00:13:40.106
the next three were
simply a matter of using

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:42.210
the right balance of
persuasion and tact.

00:13:42.244 --> 00:13:43.647
Since then,
your people have been

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.951
extraordinarily accommodating.

00:13:45.985 --> 00:13:48.022
Heh... Oh, I see...

00:13:48.056 --> 00:13:49.993
That's how it works, huh?

00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:53.432
Accommodating, you say?

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:54.636
You're a liar...!

00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:55.771
I don't believe a word!

00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:57.006
There's no way
the others

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.309
would've handed over
their Dragon Balls

00:13:58.343 --> 00:14:00.346
without protest to
someone as vile as you!

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.050
Ah you see,
that's where you're wrong;

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:03.921
once we showed them
this little ice-breaker

00:14:03.954 --> 00:14:05.558
they were glad to help.

00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:07.193

bit more cooperative now, yes?

little wish, really...

eternal life, too. Right...?

That was rude...

And here we were so
close to an agreement...

come all this way to die...

Because die you shall...

[NAMEKIAN E] I didn't
want to believe it.

00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:05.416
But I can see that
the rumor of someone

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.852
razing our villages
to the ground

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:09.024

How strong are
the three of you,

I can't help but wonder...

[ELDER] Of course...
I understand now.

00:17:48.737 --> 00:17:51.375
We've always taken care to
scatter our dwellings at random

across this planet to
foil potential aggressors;

00:17:54.749 --> 00:17:56.184

No...

They're suppressing their full
power. Can't you even tell?

00:18:10.346 --> 00:18:13.185
Man, for an elite fighting force
these guys sure are clueless.

00:18:13.219 --> 00:18:15.223
Wait a sec, the Saiyans
were caught off guard

Oh, I see...

The same way they size
up an opponent's power!

They've been using those devices
to track down Namekians

and bully them into
doing what they want.

out their game though;
