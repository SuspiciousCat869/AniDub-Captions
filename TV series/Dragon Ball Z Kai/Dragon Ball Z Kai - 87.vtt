00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:06.379
Just twenty minutes till
the Cell Games commence;

00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:08.984
when the fate of the world
becomes anyone's guess...

00:00:09.018 --> 00:00:11.156
Understandably there are
no spectators in sight,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.460
as few wish to be
caught in the crossfire.

00:00:13.493 --> 00:00:15.965
I trust our viewers can
see that Cell is standing

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.638
virtually motionless in
the center of the ring.

00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:21.476
Illustrious champion
for humankind Hercule,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.781
who has vowed to
thwart this evil menace,

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.918
is still nowhere in sight.

00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:27.656
Huh?

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.327
Wait! I can see a car!

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.472
There can be no mistake,
ladies and gentlemen!

00:00:36.507 --> 00:00:38.878
Hercule has arrived
on the scene!

00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:40.214
Yeeeah!

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:41.483
[Announcer] True to form,
he's facing the camera

00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:44.021
and raising his fist
skyward, as if to say:

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:47.294
"Worry not! Earth's
defender is here!"

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:52.404
[Hercule] Hmm.

00:00:56.813 --> 00:00:58.250
[Hercule grunts,
gives a raspberry]

00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:01.189
Wow! Unbelievable...!

00:01:01.222 --> 00:01:03.528
He's just given his
opponent a thumbs down!

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:05.732
If there are limits
to the man's daring,

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.669
we've yet to see them!

00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:10.207
Wait! Does Cell appear
to be crestfallen...?!

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.344
If you ask me, I think
the sight of the world's

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:14.983
strongest man has given
him food for thought!

00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:17.522
Seriously...?
This is hilarious.

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:20.194
Aah! Just fifteen minutes
shy of the tournament now,

00:01:20.227 --> 00:01:22.464
ladies and gentlemen!
Tensions run high...

00:01:22.498 --> 00:01:25.771
Cell versus Hercule, in the
match of the millennium!

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:30.146

with his trademark swagger...

[Announcer]
Incredible!

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.791
Hercule has officially
set foot in the ring!

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.363
Twelve minutes to go before
the games begin in earnest,

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:21.436
but our hero's raring
to get things underway!

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.843
Just what you'd expect
from humanity's champion!

00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:28.651
Ah! He's motioning to us...

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:31.156
Perhaps a signal to
move in closer...?

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.491

We... Uh... Um...

Yes! As all brave men...
we'll answer the call!

00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:44.448
Journalism will not falter!

00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:47.454
A hero of this caliber
deserves to be seen up close!

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:49.760
And with Hercule
taking charge of things,

00:03:49.793 --> 00:03:52.865
I doubt any danger will
befall the likes of us...

00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:56.540
I humbly urge our
viewers to take note

00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:58.677
of what is certain to
become an iconic image:

00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:01.717
an intrepid reporter rushing
toward an intrepid warrior,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.386
to the very ring
where the latter stands

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.761
boldly poised
to save the world!

So, um... Do you wish for us

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:10.835
to step into the ring
as well, Hercule, or...?

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.576
Don't worry, little man...
I'll protect you.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.547

Okay then...

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.684

that brave mind? I assume
you're feeling confident!

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.397
What I'm feeling right now
is pity for this creep Cell.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.403
I don't think he's counting
on having to go toe to toe

00:04:28.436 --> 00:04:32.378
with the toughest customer
this planet has to offer.

00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:34.381

I see through your tricks
like I'm looking through glass!

And you got the whole
world out there believing

not all of us, though.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:01.034
Argh! Enough of
this messing around!

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:03.138
This ain't no jungle
gym out here!

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:05.978
Y'all got no idea what kind
of pile you're stepping into!

00:10:06.011 --> 00:10:08.449
Oh, and I guess you're here
to tell us all about it...

00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:10.019
[Hercule gasps]

00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:26.285
Not only is the
man addressing you

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:28.790
in a class all by
himself as fighters go...

00:10:28.824 --> 00:10:30.460
His skills are legendary!

00:10:30.493 --> 00:10:32.097
He's the world's only hope!

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:32.898
[Goku] Huh?

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:34.602
Goku... What do you think?

00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:37.542
Should we let Mr.
Eager step up first?

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:40.379
Uh... Don't know about that.

00:10:40.413 --> 00:10:42.116
It's time.

00:10:54.441 --> 00:10:58.984
[wind whistling]

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:02.190
I don't care who's up...
Let's begin.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:06.332
I'm calling first dibs...
That's how it's gonna be.

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:08.604
There's no point trying to
talk him out of it, Goku.

00:11:08.637 --> 00:11:10.407
Neither one of 'em
will listen to reason.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.776
I gotta say something...

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.014
Hey, if you want to go
first, I won't stop you;

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:15.584
but you ought to know
you'll be crushed.

00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:17.387
--Hm?
--Hm?

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:20.795
[Announcer and Hercule smirk]

00:11:20.828 --> 00:11:22.263
Are you seeing this...?

00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:26.439
Go in tight on that
doofus over there.

00:11:26.472 --> 00:11:29.178
[Announcer] One can almost
hear the chorus of groans

00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:32.584
bound to be spanning the globe
at this nay-sayer's jab:

00:11:32.618 --> 00:11:36.960
a sad, misinformed soul with
no idea whom he's addressing.

00:11:36.993 --> 00:11:38.764
"If you want to pit
yourself against Cell,"

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:40.266
says the cocky upstart,

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.803
"be prepared to get
trampled underfoot

00:11:41.836 --> 00:11:44.108
like an insect mound."
The nerve!

00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:46.813
[Crowd boos]

00:11:46.846 --> 00:11:48.584
[Announcer] People like
this are the reason

00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:51.055
amateurs cannot be
taken seriously...

00:11:51.088 --> 00:11:53.761
Despite having the
situation made plain,

00:11:53.794 --> 00:11:55.898
they still mock Hercule!

00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:57.735
Wow... Some people
just don't know

00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:59.872
how not to make
fools of themselves.

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:01.743
That... That man...

00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:05.851
No, impossible... Or is it?

00:12:05.884 --> 00:12:07.955
His hair's different,
but apart from that,

00:12:07.989 --> 00:12:10.159
he's the spitting image
of the boy who saved us

00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:13.066
from Piccolo all
those years ago.

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:15.838
Hmm...

00:12:15.872 --> 00:12:17.842
Hold on a minute.
His eyes don't look

00:12:17.876 --> 00:12:21.281
right to me somehow...
Maybe it's not him...

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:25.724
The man we saw earlier
concerns me, though.

00:12:25.757 --> 00:12:27.494
There, look...

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:29.833
No... surely it's not...

00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:33.372
I mean, what would
Piccolo be doing there?

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:35.811
Hey, if he's itchin' to
make a spectacle of himself,

00:12:35.844 --> 00:12:37.948
then let him...
Worse comes to worse,

00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:40.754
we can always wish him
back with the Dragon Balls.

00:12:40.787 --> 00:12:44.796
Mm... Yeah, you're right,
Krillin. What's the use?

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:46.198
[Announcer] Aha!
Looks like the hecklers

00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:48.737
have done some growing up...
Perhaps there's hope

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.172
for the younger
generations yet...

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:52.712
It takes a man to know
when to step aside...

00:12:52.745 --> 00:12:54.682
And these fellows have stepped.

00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:57.321
A passing nuisance to
our hero, to be sure,

00:12:57.354 --> 00:12:58.857
but as the games begin,

00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:01.195
Hercule appears to have
regained his composure.

00:13:01.228 --> 00:13:03.600
[Pupils]
One moment please, master!

00:13:03.634 --> 00:13:05.537
Ah! What's this...?

00:13:06.873 --> 00:13:08.743
Oh, great... Now what?

00:13:08.777 --> 00:13:10.212
Hm!

00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:15.957
[Caroni and Priozhki grunt]

00:13:17.294 --> 00:13:18.564
Ah!

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:21.636
An unexpected turn as a trio
of strangers lands in the ring!

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.107
Who could this
enigmatic troop be?

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.156

Pirozhki the Mighty!

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.448
These are, uh...
acquaintances of Hercule,

00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:45.918
I believe... I hope...

00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:47.722
[Piiza] Allow me to explain...

[Announcer] Hm?

These gentleman here
are Hercule's pupils,

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:54.067
and after him, undoubtedly
the toughest, grittiest,

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.906
most fleet-footed pair
in all of creation...

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.447
Understudy one... and of
course, understudy two.

Oho...! That is good!

00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:06.727
And I am his gorgeous
manager, Miss Piiza.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.961
Mwah!

00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:10.466
Master... Let us
handle this freak...

00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:12.972
No need to sully your
hands on a wannabe.

00:14:13.006 --> 00:14:16.311
Yeah... Good point.

Oh, man...
This is just wrong.

on which the fortunes
of mankind rest,

have officially begun!

Fall unconscious, you lose.

Well, I don't know
exactly what...

Uh... I think he just jumped
a little bit too high...

[Pirozhki swallows]

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:47.761
What humbling
muscular fortitude!

00:15:47.794 --> 00:15:49.799
Pirozhki's good...
He won't slip up

00:15:49.832 --> 00:15:52.003
and knock himself
out like Caroni.

00:15:54.107 --> 00:15:58.917

makes a mad dash...!

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:09.839
[Pirozhki groans]

00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:13.981
[Pirozhki struggles]

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:15.182
I give up...

00:16:15.216 --> 00:16:17.387
[Pirozhki cries out]

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.723
[Announcer gasps]

00:16:18.757 --> 00:16:20.226
[Pirozhki shudders]

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:24.502
Again, I don't think I can
describe what I just saw!

00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:26.105
Sleight of hand.

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:28.209
The two-bit coward's
rigged the whole arena

00:16:28.242 --> 00:16:31.549
with cheap parlor tricks...
Just like a chump.

00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:35.490
But I'm gonna
expose this wise-guy

00:16:35.524 --> 00:16:37.193
for the charlatan he is!

00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:41.101
[Announcer] Here we go,
folks! Seething with rage

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:42.972
on behalf of his
hoodwinked understudies,

00:16:43.005 --> 00:16:45.544
Hercule again enters the ring!

00:16:45.578 --> 00:16:47.548
He sheds his cape...

00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:49.150
[Hercule] Hmph!

00:16:49.184 --> 00:16:50.988
[Announcer] He removes
the world championship

00:16:51.022 --> 00:16:52.490
belt from his waist!

00:16:52.524 --> 00:16:53.727
[Crowd cheers]

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.263
[Announcer] The moment we've
been waiting for has come!

00:16:55.296 --> 00:16:58.536
Hercule is ready
for a smack-down!

00:16:58.569 --> 00:17:01.208
Yes, I've said it many times,
but it bears repeating...

00:17:01.241 --> 00:17:03.178
The future of the world
rests on the outcome

00:17:03.212 --> 00:17:04.649
of the battle
we're about to see,

00:17:04.682 --> 00:17:07.019
but take heart, viewers,
in the knowledge that Hercule

00:17:07.053 --> 00:17:10.661
has been looking forward
to this day with gusto!

00:17:10.694 --> 00:17:13.098
What's this? Our hero's
removed something

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:14.568
from his breast pocket...

00:17:14.602 --> 00:17:18.643
It appears to be some sort of
capsule. Yes, a capsule...

00:17:21.148 --> 00:17:24.020
As if by magic, an
enormous bag has emerged

00:17:24.054 --> 00:17:27.561
from the casing...
Now, what's inside?

00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:34.575
Roofing tiles! That's right:
tiles for roofing!

00:17:34.608 --> 00:17:37.615
Fascinating; he's now
carefully stacking the tiles.

00:17:37.648 --> 00:17:39.819
Ugh...

00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:42.591
You, uh... don't think he's...?

00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:45.029
[Announcer]
There are... fifteen!

00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:47.200
An unbelievable fifteen!

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.705
Mere mortals would
be reckless to attempt

00:17:49.738 --> 00:17:51.776
what I think he's about to do!

00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:55.416
[Hercule chuckles]

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:56.317
[Hercule chants]

00:17:56.351 --> 00:17:57.788
[Announcer]
He gathers his focus...

00:17:57.821 --> 00:18:01.162
rallying all his strength
to the task at hand...

00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:04.000
A pregnant silence
falls over the ring...

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:05.771
[Crowd chatters]

00:18:05.804 --> 00:18:11.047
[Hercule grunts, yells]

00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:13.185
[Announcer]
Only one tile remains!!

00:18:13.219 --> 00:18:16.324
Such a feat completely
bedevils this reporter's

00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:18.730
considerable powers
of description!

00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:22.237
Fourteen roofing tiles
pulverized beyond recognition!

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.806
[Hercule exhales]

00:18:25.275 --> 00:18:28.783
[Hercule] Ooh... that
smarts... hold it together...

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:29.919
[Hercule roars]

00:18:29.952 --> 00:18:31.020
[Crowd cheers]

00:18:31.054 --> 00:18:33.126
[Man in crowd]
Hercule is the man!!

[groans of disbelief]

00:18:34.695 --> 00:18:36.131
[Hercule roars]

00:18:36.165 --> 00:18:38.971
[Cell] <i>You cannot be serious.</i>

00:18:39.004 --> 00:18:41.141
Hey! Take a good, hard look

00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:43.478
at what's left of
these tiles, pal!

00:18:43.513 --> 00:18:44.848
Hm!

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:48.222
Cause brother...
In one minute...

00:18:48.255 --> 00:18:50.226
This is gonna be you.

00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:52.463
[Crowd]
Hercule! Hercule! Hercule!

00:19:11.335 --> 00:19:13.138
[Announcer]
Despite his previous boasts,

00:19:13.172 --> 00:19:15.844
it appears Cell is now
stunned into silence,

00:19:15.878 --> 00:19:20.086
no doubt awash with terror at
Hercule's staggering display!

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:22.892
But as our champion
observed earlier...

00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:26.899
All hope for diplomacy has
long flown out the window!

00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:29.839
Let's dance!

00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:31.275
Ah! Here we go!

00:19:31.308 --> 00:19:34.180
Hercule has assumed
his signature stance!

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:37.153
The world is about to
witness its foremost fighter

00:19:37.186 --> 00:19:39.725
do what he does best:
take out the trash!

00:19:39.758 --> 00:19:42.029
The villainous poseur
will be hit hard

00:19:42.063 --> 00:19:44.234
by the iron-clad
hand of justice!

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:45.837
[Crowd]
Hercule! Hercule! Hercule!

00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:48.476
[Announcer] One almost
hopes Cell has enough sense

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.580
to forfeit the match
for his own sake...

00:19:50.613 --> 00:19:53.787
[Hercule yells]

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.224
[Announcer] Aaand there it is,
ladies and gentlemen!

00:19:56.258 --> 00:19:58.830
Hercule leads off with
his infamous Dynamite Kick!

00:19:58.863 --> 00:20:01.703
He's come roaring out
of the gate at full steam!

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:05.176
The fight is over
before it's begun!

00:20:05.209 --> 00:20:07.180
[Hercule yells]

00:20:07.213 --> 00:20:10.219
[Announcer] Inconceivable!
His fury unappeased,

00:20:10.252 --> 00:20:13.527
Hercule lets loose a
merciless volley of blows!

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.929
[Hercule grunts repeatedly]

00:20:14.962 --> 00:20:17.133
[Announcer] Cell is
paralyzed by the onslaught!

00:20:17.167 --> 00:20:19.505
Utterly locked up;
Hercule's inhuman strength

00:20:19.538 --> 00:20:23.445
an avalanche against which
evil can find no shelter!

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:27.286
[Hercule laughs
triumphantly]

00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:28.288
[Cell] Enough.

00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:31.629
[Hercule howls]

00:20:34.836 --> 00:20:35.771
Huh?

00:20:35.804 --> 00:20:36.806
[Krillin chuckles]

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:39.377
That's how she crumbles...
I mean c'mon,

00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:42.083
were any of us not rooting
for Cell just now?

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:44.187
[Hercule shudders]

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.861
Tch. He's in one piece...
Apparently, Cell has

00:20:47.894 --> 00:20:50.600
a bit of a soft spot
for fools and show-offs.

00:20:50.634 --> 00:20:54.408
[scattered reactions
of disbelief]

00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:57.948
Our hero has landed
outside the ring...

00:20:57.981 --> 00:21:03.492
As per... the game's rules...
our Hercule has lost.

00:21:05.429 --> 00:21:08.669
Well... That's quite enough
lenience for one day...

00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:13.245
Time for this to kick off...
Who wishes to be first?

00:21:13.278 --> 00:21:15.984
Any of you are welcome.

00:21:16.018 --> 00:21:17.888
[Goku] Thanks for waiting.

00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:24.535
Now, let's go.

00:21:24.568 --> 00:21:25.904
