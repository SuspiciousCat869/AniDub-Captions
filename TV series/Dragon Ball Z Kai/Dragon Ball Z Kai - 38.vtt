00:12:40.588 --> 00:12:42.992
What?! Who did that?!
You Vegeta?!

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:47.133
You?!
But you... you're dead!

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:50.206
I ran you through! There's no
way you could've survived!

00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:52.512
[charging up]

00:12:52.545 --> 00:12:55.050
No... Impossible!

00:12:55.083 --> 00:12:56.418
Kienzan!

00:12:58.423 --> 00:12:59.558
Ha!

00:13:04.068 --> 00:13:05.904
[Goku thinking]
That energy... It's Krillin--

00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:08.677
it's gotta be!
He's back! But how?

00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:10.446
What's going on out there?

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.818
AHHHH-ah!

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:17.360
[fearful gasping]

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:20.467
[angry grunting]

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.037
[raspberry]

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.205
What?!

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:25.143
Come on, whatcha gonna do now
you big ugly freak?

00:13:25.176 --> 00:13:26.613
[raspberry]

00:13:26.646 --> 00:13:28.349
Here, I'll give you a target!

00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:35.396
Why, you...!
How dare you mock me?!

00:13:37.568 --> 00:13:39.471
[Krillin thinking] I may not
be strong enough to fight him,

00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:40.741
but if I'm lucky,

00:13:40.775 --> 00:13:42.945
I can at least keep
him distracted...

00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:48.155
Oh, boy...

00:13:51.462 --> 00:13:53.132
There we go!

00:14:03.554 --> 00:14:06.359
[scared gasping, mumbling]

00:14:06.392 --> 00:14:09.899
Coward... Go ahead
and run if you like...

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:13.540
All you're doing is
delaying the inevitable.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.286
[scared screaming]

00:14:20.319 --> 00:14:21.823
[chuckling]

00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:23.927
[scared screaming]

00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:28.102
[scared screaming]

00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:35.049
Heh. No more games.

00:14:37.353 --> 00:14:39.826
[small explosions]

00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:42.463
[Frieza] Now, come out of there!

00:14:42.497 --> 00:14:45.002
[coughing]

00:14:45.638 --> 00:14:48.910
[maniacal laughing]

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:54.254
Far enough!

00:14:54.287 --> 00:14:56.358
I'm upset you survived
my last attack...

00:14:56.392 --> 00:14:58.395
But the fact that you
clipped my tail,

00:14:58.429 --> 00:15:01.836
that makes me furious!

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.707
So this time I'm going
to rip you apart

00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:05.945
until there's nothing left!

00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:08.249
Ah... Not good!...

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.652
One chance...!

00:15:09.686 --> 00:15:11.087
Ha!

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.529
[water exploding]

00:15:14.562 --> 00:15:17.969
[water bubbling]

00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:20.172
[chuckling]

00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:22.911
Try as you might, these
pathetic attempts at escape

00:15:22.945 --> 00:15:25.651
won't be enough
to save you...

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:28.055
[water bubbling]

00:15:28.088 --> 00:15:32.230
[Krillin struggling, choking]

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:37.340
I will personally
tear you limb from limb!

00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:42.049
Come! Show yourself!

00:15:42.952 --> 00:15:46.358
[water exploding, splashing]

00:15:46.391 --> 00:15:50.901
[heavy breathing]

00:15:50.934 --> 00:15:51.602
Now...!

00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:54.307
Taiyo-ken!

00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:59.985
[screaming]

00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:10.306
Thank goodness.
He's not dead...

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.412
Don't worry, I'll
heal you right away!

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:29.077
Vegeta! Now!
Frieza's stunned! Attack!

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:42.237
Ah... so that's
what's been going on...

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.610
What're you waiting for?!
There's not much time!

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.552
[Gohan laughing]

00:16:49.585 --> 00:16:51.055
[Dende laughing]

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:54.461
Hey, that's great!
He healed Gohan, too!

00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:56.198
It never crossed
your mind to tell me

00:16:56.231 --> 00:16:58.035
the Namekian kid
had healing powers?

00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:00.507
Why would you
keep that a secret?!

00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:01.643
What are you crazy?!

00:17:01.676 --> 00:17:04.047
You think we knew anything
about it before now?

00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:05.450
if we had

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.454
we would've gotten him to
heal Goku a long time ago!

00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:10.126
Wow, neat trick, Dende...
I owe ya' one.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.698
No, I'm glad to help.

00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:14.234
Huh?

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:18.008
OKay! Now I'm mad!

00:17:18.041 --> 00:17:18.977
What in the...?!

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:24.956
[charging up]

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:26.559
[waves roaring]

00:17:26.592 --> 00:17:29.231
[rock collapsing]

00:17:29.264 --> 00:17:30.300
He may whine
like an Earthling,

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:31.769
but he heals like a Saiyan--

00:17:31.803 --> 00:17:34.408
his power level's gone up
quite significantly, I'd say.

00:17:34.441 --> 00:17:37.981
[screaming]

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.985
Alright... Perhaps this
is just what we needed

00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:42.057
to turn the tide
of this battle.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.962
Damn it!
How do they keep coming back?!

00:17:44.995 --> 00:17:46.599
How many times do I have
to kill these pests

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:48.035
before they die!

00:17:48.069 --> 00:17:49.237
Now! Blow him away!

00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:51.576
[shots firing,
all three screaming]

00:17:51.609 --> 00:17:55.115
[explosions]

00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:04.167
You really don't
know when to quit.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.837
Damn it...!

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:09.879
No way am I giving up!
I don't care what he says!

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:11.081
Maybe it's hopeless...

00:18:11.114 --> 00:18:13.920
but even if it is,
we still have to try!

00:18:13.953 --> 00:18:16.391
Gohan! Don't!

00:18:31.522 --> 00:18:34.260
It's Piccolo!

00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:38.703
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:18:38.737 --> 00:18:40.006
You're really here!

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:43.713
I was starting to worry that
you didn't make it! [laughing]

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:49.257
So that's Frieza.

00:18:49.858 --> 00:18:55.303
I see... He's even more
hideous than I imagined...

00:18:55.336 --> 00:18:58.075
Aren't you one to talk.
How are you even here?

00:18:58.109 --> 00:19:00.279
I thought we
killed you on Earth.

00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:02.584
Wait, don't tell me...
That's what these imbeciles

00:19:02.618 --> 00:19:04.722
did with the
Dragon Balls, isn't it?

00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:05.857
Why would they
waste a wish

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.295
to bring back a worthless
piece of trash like you?

00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:09.732
Well, if you're
feeling brave...

00:19:09.765 --> 00:19:11.970
stick around and you'll
see for yourself...

00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:13.907
But, it's only fair
to warn you...

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.109
after I've defeated Frieza

00:19:15.143 --> 00:19:16.612
I'll be coming for you next.

00:19:16.646 --> 00:19:20.486
After you've defeated
Freiza, you say? (laughing)

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.323
That's funny. I didn't
think you Namekians

00:19:22.357 --> 00:19:24.661
were capable
of telling jokes.

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:31.509
So, yet another Namekian
who escaped my attention...

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:34.114
Yes, and there's something
different about this one,

00:19:34.147 --> 00:19:36.753
he's far more imposing
than the others...

00:19:36.786 --> 00:19:39.224
Of course, his fate
will still be the same...

00:19:39.257 --> 00:19:40.560
In another moment,

00:19:40.593 --> 00:19:43.699
he'll be joining the rest
of his kind in oblivion.

00:19:45.937 --> 00:19:47.908
[Goku thinking]
Who's that?

00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:49.712
Someone new
just showed up,

00:19:49.746 --> 00:19:53.151
but I don't recognize
the energy... Unless...

00:19:53.185 --> 00:19:56.559
Piccolo? No.
No way, it couldn't be.

00:19:56.592 --> 00:19:58.195
Even if he was here somehow,

00:19:58.228 --> 00:20:00.634
that power level is
way too huge to be him...

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:04.341
But then, Gohan's energy
is back to full strength, too...

00:20:04.374 --> 00:20:07.379
None of this makes any sense!

00:20:13.693 --> 00:20:14.895
Now then...

00:20:14.928 --> 00:20:17.366
Time to give this monster a
taste of his own medicine.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.270
I'll fight alone...

00:20:19.304 --> 00:20:21.842
The rest of you,
stay out of my way.

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:24.949
So that's him, he's the
one they wished back!

00:20:24.982 --> 00:20:27.419
He looks almost
exactly like Nail!

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.533
Take shelter, Dende,

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:36.506
before you get
caught in the crossfire.

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:38.375
Go. Now!

00:20:38.743 --> 00:20:42.450
Who is he?
And how does he know my name?

00:20:47.862 --> 00:20:50.332
[Gohan] Piccolo...!

00:20:52.337 --> 00:20:53.507
Oh, man...

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.042
Are we gonna let
him go through with this?

00:20:55.076 --> 00:20:58.481
It's crazy, right?!

00:20:58.516 --> 00:21:01.154
[Goku thinking] Hm. Things
have gotten quiet out there...

00:21:01.187 --> 00:21:02.591
Almost too quiet.

00:21:02.624 --> 00:21:04.126
I don't know what's happening,

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.496
but whoever
this new fighter is--

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.603
I sure hope he's on our side.

00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:18.288
[Narrator] At last,
Piccolo has arrived

00:21:18.321 --> 00:21:20.761
to join Gohan and the
others in their struggle.

00:21:20.794 --> 00:21:23.232
But will his new powers
truly enable him

00:21:23.265 --> 00:21:24.868
to topple the mighty Frieza?

00:21:24.902 --> 00:21:27.574
One way or another, the
battle may be decided

00:21:27.607 --> 00:21:30.948
long before Goku emerges
from the healing chamber--

00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:33.451
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:35.356 --> 00:21:45.543
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:38.349 --> 00:22:39.685
[Goku] Hey, it's me, Goku!

00:22:39.719 --> 00:22:42.625
Wow, so that is Piccolo.
He's been wished back,

00:22:42.658 --> 00:22:43.960
and now he's here on Namek!

00:22:43.993 --> 00:22:45.997
[Piccolo] Sorry to keep
you waiting, Gohan.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.133
[Gohan] Piccolo!

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:48.970
[Piccolo] I'm about to
clean up this cosmic trash

00:22:49.003 --> 00:22:50.205
once and for all!

00:22:50.238 --> 00:22:52.544
It'll give me a good chance
to show off my new power!

00:22:52.577 --> 00:22:55.550
Next time, on
Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:59.157 --> 00:23:00.593
[Gohan]
You're kidding!

00:23:00.627 --> 00:23:03.933
So does a second transformation
mean he's twice as strong?
