you had a moment ago?

00:18:00.794 --> 00:18:02.496
[cough]

00:18:08.475 --> 00:18:11.214
Aarrrggghhh!

00:18:14.822 --> 00:18:18.530
Little worm. Is that tiny
reservoir of strength

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:20.199
all dried up now?

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.704
[FRIEZA] If so, I
really see no point in

00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:24.775
dragging this out further.

00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:30.486
[GOKU] Okay, maybe that
wasn't such a great idea.

00:18:30.553 --> 00:18:33.560
I really lost a lot more power
than I was counting on.

00:18:33.627 --> 00:18:35.764
Matter of fact that
Kaio-ken times twenty

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.169
seriously wiped me out.

00:18:38.235 --> 00:18:40.573
What modest powers the
Saiyan race does--

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.247
or rather, did possess--
was utterly wasted on them.

00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:46.786
My wholesale slaughter
of the lot was a mercy

00:18:46.853 --> 00:18:50.226
in the grand scheme of
things, wouldn't you agree?

00:18:50.292 --> 00:18:53.065
[GOKU] I... I'm done for...

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:56.005
[VEGETA] Kakarot!
How dare you give up?

00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.440
You're a Saiyan warrior!

00:18:57.508 --> 00:19:00.446
Take some pride
in your heritage!

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:03.686
I... I am not a Saiyan like you.

00:19:03.753 --> 00:19:07.294
[VEGETA] Please! Stop
trying to convince yourself!

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.598
You personify our race!

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:13.238
Just stop. None of that
matters now anyway...

00:19:13.305 --> 00:19:15.877
Even together we-- [gasp]

00:19:18.215 --> 00:19:20.720
Vegeta! Where--

00:19:22.357 --> 00:19:26.231
The blood in your veins...
That perfect instinct

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:29.906
for battle... There's no
denying what you are.

00:19:29.973 --> 00:19:32.177
Reach down deep...

00:19:32.244 --> 00:19:35.116
Feel the pain of
those of us who fell...

00:19:35.183 --> 00:19:37.420
Your brethren were
all decimated...

00:19:37.486 --> 00:19:39.691
Your homeworld lost...

00:19:39.758 --> 00:19:42.364
[VEGETA] Does it not enrage
you to stand before the man

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.537
responsible for
driving us to extinction?

00:19:46.338 --> 00:19:51.481
My father... Your
father... Both gone...

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:55.890
Dead... Killed by
him... Lord Frieza.

00:19:58.129 --> 00:20:00.567
You are the last
of our kind, Kakarot...

00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:05.176
[YOUNG VEGETA] Everything we
were survives now only in you...

00:20:05.243 --> 00:20:06.979
[VEGETA] And he
won't rest until every

00:20:07.046 --> 00:20:09.050
trace of that has vanished...

00:20:09.117 --> 00:20:11.188
Because he's
haunted day and night

00:20:11.254 --> 00:20:13.627
by a single overriding fear:

00:20:13.694 --> 00:20:15.496
[GREAT APE] That the
legendary Super Saiyan

00:20:15.564 --> 00:20:18.636
will rise up from the
ashes and obliterate him!

00:20:18.703 --> 00:20:22.844
I dreamt... I yearned to
be the one to avenge us...

00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:27.688
Yet he battered and broke
me just as he did the others.

00:20:27.755 --> 00:20:30.694
[VEGETA] You cannot know
the torment I died...

00:20:31.395 --> 00:20:33.767
[VEGETA] Unless you're
the one to finish this...

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:38.442
We'll be lost... lost forever
to the memory of time.

00:20:43.753 --> 00:20:45.289
[gasp]

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:48.563
Really... I can't
fathom what must be

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.602
going on in
that skull of yours.

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:56.444
And that... makes me
quite... annoyed.

00:21:02.791 --> 00:21:05.797
[FRIEZA] No
quiet exit for you.

00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:10.439
Oh, no... No.
It'll be quite loud.

00:21:10.507 --> 00:21:14.749
Vegeta... Home for me has
always meant "Earth,"

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:17.453
so I don't know if I
fit the Saiyan mold.

00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:21.328
But... I do understand
where you're coming from.

00:21:21.394 --> 00:21:24.400
Stop talking nonsense
and make this fun.

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:26.472
I have to win...

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:29.879
I owe it to too many
people not to lose.

00:21:29.946 --> 00:21:32.752
Don't toy with me!

00:21:32.818 --> 00:21:34.655
Ahhh!

00:21:35.255 --> 00:21:45.442
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:38.048 --> 00:22:40.620
[GOKU] Hey! It's me, Goku!
Looks like the only card

00:22:40.687 --> 00:22:43.024
I've got left to play now
is my ace-in-the-hole!

00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:45.964
[FRIEZA] What's with that
stance? What are trying to pull?

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:48.670
[GOKU] Come on, Planet Namek!
Come on universe!

00:22:48.737 --> 00:22:52.109
Any energy you've got to spare
would be really appreciated!

00:22:53.513 --> 00:22:56.384
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:59.858 --> 00:23:01.095
[GOHAN] Will that
still be enough to put

00:23:01.161 --> 00:23:02.864
Frieza in his place?!
