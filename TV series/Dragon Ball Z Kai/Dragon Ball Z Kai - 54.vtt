you been up to?

Frieza's no longer an issue.

Hey guys! Get ready
to jump for joy...!

00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:49.926
Yamcha just told me
that Goku did it...

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.496
He took down Frieza for good.

There's more to it...

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:17.314
Once Frieza was
finished, Goku he...

00:04:17.348 --> 00:04:19.318
tried to get away, but...

00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:22.792
Namek exploded
before he could...

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:26.099
He's gone.

Oh hey, get a load of this.

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.840
[BULMA] Apparently Goku
couldn't make his way off Namek

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:32.812

went, well, bang...

00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:35.017
[YAMCHA] Am I missing
something funny here?!

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.054
I said Goku
didn't make it...!

00:04:37.087 --> 00:04:38.189
And he's already been

00:04:38.222 --> 00:04:40.828
wished back once
with the Dragon Balls!

00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:41.831
[BULMA laughs]

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:44.902
Well... I know something
you don't know...

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:47.909
The Namekians just happened to
come back to Earth with us...

00:04:47.942 --> 00:04:48.844
And it just so happens

00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:50.213
their special
homemade Dragon Balls

00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:52.719
followed them across the galaxy.

00:04:52.752 --> 00:04:54.890
But guess what the
best part is...?

00:04:54.923 --> 00:04:57.963
The Namekian Dragon Balls
can work their magic,

00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:59.131
regardless of how many times

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:02.003
a person's been
wished back before!

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.016
In other words...

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:10.320
Chiaotzu, Krillin
and Goku all get

00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:13.260
the same first class ticket
home as you boys do!

00:05:13.293 --> 00:05:14.395
[YAMCHA]
No kidding?!

00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:15.665
Yamcha...! What's up?

00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:18.169
We're gettin'
brought back, Tien...

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:21.142
All of us... That
includes you, pal.

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:22.645
Are you serious?!

00:05:22.678 --> 00:05:24.048
[KING KAI]
Your friends on Earth

00:05:24.081 --> 00:05:26.452
aren't seeing the
bigger picture.

00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:28.857
Well, that is to say
the Namekian Dragon Balls

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:32.632
can revive Chiaotzu without
too much of a problem...

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:35.170
But Goku and Krillin
are another story.

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:36.506
It made perfect sense to me...

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.276
I don't see what
the problem is...

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:39.780
The Dragon Balls will
only return someone

00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:41.717
to the physical realm
in the same place

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.721
they were when they
crossed dimensions.

00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:45.324
I don't like where
this is going...

00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:47.094
Krillin and Goku
would have to be brought

00:05:47.127 --> 00:05:49.131
back to Planet Namek...

00:05:49.164 --> 00:05:53.039
But Planet Namek has been
turned into galactic rubble!

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.250
Try though we might to
wish our friends back...

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:00.588
The cold vacuum of
space would be waiting

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:02.558
to swallow them both up!

00:06:12.043 --> 00:06:15.250
Come on...You're King Kai
for cryin' out loud...!

00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:17.622
There must be
something you can do!

00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:19.491
I would if I could...!

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:25.336
That part of the cosmos
isn't in my jurisdiction!

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.009
Okay... Well, uh...

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:31.617
Looks like I spoke too soon...

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.818
Oh no!

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.166
But... I don't understand;

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.841
why can't Dad and Krillin be
brought home like you said?

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:46.112
[BULMA] Well, if Kami
restored someone's body

00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:47.748
like in Chiaotzu's case,

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:50.955
that's the exception,
otherwise...

00:06:50.988 --> 00:06:52.123
According to the rules,

00:06:52.157 --> 00:06:54.629
you have to pick up exactly
where you left off...

00:06:54.662 --> 00:06:56.633
Which in their
case is nowhere...

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.336
in the present tense anyway...

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:01.042
See... The only
thing left of Namek now

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:03.814
is a whole bunch of nothing...

00:07:03.848 --> 00:07:05.618
And King Kai can't
do anything about it

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:07.421
because that area
of space doesn't fall

00:07:07.454 --> 00:07:09.058
within his jurisdiction.

00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:13.099

It would mean
burning an extra wish,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.384
but you could ask the
dragon to transport them

here to Earth before
anything else...

00:07:24.956 --> 00:07:26.025
That should be possible.

00:07:26.058 --> 00:07:28.162
[BULMA] Of course!

Aw, trust me--there's more
than enough room for everyone;

00:08:16.993 --> 00:08:18.830

we could do in exchange

00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:22.170
for letting us use the Dragon
Balls to save our friends.

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:24.710

You're right to wanna

Then we accept your offer.

Ah! There they are...
'bout time...

00:09:38.122 --> 00:09:40.060
Hey...! We're down here!

00:09:40.093 --> 00:09:41.830
Took you long enough!

00:09:42.431 --> 00:09:44.100
[touchdown sound]
Boom!

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.116
Where's my son...?!

00:09:53.653 --> 00:09:55.056
Start talking!!

00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:57.795
Oh! My sweet baby!

00:09:57.829 --> 00:10:01.235
[GOHAN sheepish laughter]

00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:03.807
Did you miss me?

00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:06.780
<i>[NARRATOR] And so, the
Namekians were escorted
covertly</i>

00:10:06.814 --> 00:10:09.284
<i>to the Capsule Corporation...</i>

00:10:10.387 --> 00:10:11.756
Bet you weren't
expecting the place

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.463
to be quite so big,
huh? Or as cool...

00:10:15.497 --> 00:10:17.467
Wait... Is that...?

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.306
<i>[NARRATOR] While waiting for
the Dragon Balls to recharge,</i>

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.077
<i>compliments of Bulma's family,</i>

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.952
<i>the visitors enjoyed all the
amenities of life on Earth...</i>

00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:28.791
<i>So much so that
before anyone knew it,</i>

00:10:28.824 --> 00:10:31.261
<i>their vigil had come to an end.</i>

00:10:40.112 --> 00:10:42.685
Wow... So it only takes
the Namekian Dragon Balls

00:10:42.718 --> 00:10:45.624
a hundred and thirty
days to reactivate, huh...

00:10:45.657 --> 00:10:47.060
That's right...

00:10:47.093 --> 00:10:50.233
One hundred and thirty days
makes one full Namekian year.

00:10:50.266 --> 00:10:51.502
Cool...

00:10:51.536 --> 00:10:53.005
that's only one-third of the
time it takes here on Earth.

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:54.942
Well, what do you say
we summon forth Porunga

00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:56.880
and get this party
under way you guys?

00:10:56.914 --> 00:10:57.982
Hold on a second...

00:10:58.015 --> 00:10:59.919
I don't see Gohan anywhere...

00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:03.025
[CHICHI
Wait! Don't start without us!

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:04.796
[OOLONG] Hey... what's up kid?
[PUAR] Hey, Gohan!

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:08.202
[GOHAN] Sorry! Cram
school ran long today.

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:11.308
[BULMA] Cram school?
Aren't you a trooper?

00:11:11.342 --> 00:11:13.813
His loving mother
intends for her little man

00:11:13.847 --> 00:11:18.122
to make a name for himself in
the halls of academia one day.

00:11:18.156 --> 00:11:20.293
The two of you made
it just in time...

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:22.599
Well, Dende.
What do you say?

00:11:22.632 --> 00:11:24.334
Sure...

00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:30.046
Takkaruaputo Popporunga
pupirito paro!

00:11:45.343 --> 00:11:47.347
Go... Go... Go

00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:09.792
Whoa! Look at
the size of him!

00:12:09.825 --> 00:12:12.397
This... This
is incredible!

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.703
Wow...!

00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:16.038
[PORUNGA]
I am summoned...

00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:18.577
I shall grant
you three wishes...

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.313
within my power...

00:12:20.347 --> 00:12:23.720
Speak, and let your
desires be known.

00:12:23.754 --> 00:12:25.423
You go first,
my friends...

00:12:25.456 --> 00:12:26.893
We'll withhold
our own wish

00:12:26.926 --> 00:12:28.731
until yours have
been fulfilled...

00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:31.035
As we see it, one
more year is nothing.

00:12:31.068 --> 00:12:33.974
Thank you very much...
We owe you one.

00:12:34.007 --> 00:12:36.212
Okay. Let's do this, guys...

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:38.817
First, we'll ask that Goku
and Krillin be transported

00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:41.254
here to Earth where they
can safely be brought back.

00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:45.998
[DENDE] Napahito sonda
bakuli lepicatto sopaletto!

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.837
Very well... I shall try...

00:12:56.084 --> 00:12:58.891
The one called Krillin
has been transported

00:12:58.924 --> 00:13:01.796
to the Earth's domain.

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:04.167
However it is not
within my power

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.307
to move the one called Goku...

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.979
What are you talking
about...?! Why not?!

00:13:10.012 --> 00:13:12.818
The one known as Goku
cannot be summoned,

00:13:12.852 --> 00:13:16.391
because currently Goku
is not in Other World.

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:22.671
He's alive?

00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:24.074
[KING KAI]
He what...?!

00:13:24.107 --> 00:13:26.746
That's impossible... No way!

00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:29.151
[OOLONG]
Yay... Yay... I knew it...

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:33.159
Hooray!!! That
doesn't make sense...

00:13:33.192 --> 00:13:35.429
If he's alive, why
not come home...?

00:13:35.463 --> 00:13:37.233
I--

00:13:37.267 --> 00:13:39.270
[GOHAN] Maybe his
spaceship's damaged, or...

00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:40.139
something.

00:13:40.173 --> 00:13:41.509
Oh, don't worry, friend...

00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:43.012
You can ask him yourself;

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:45.283
just have him
summoned here directly.

00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:46.853
Yeah! Great idea!

00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:48.790
Oh... Yay!!!

00:13:48.824 --> 00:13:50.928
So, for our second wish...

00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:53.567
Let's bring our buddy
Krillin back home

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.336
where he belongs!

00:13:55.369 --> 00:13:56.339
Bring him back!

00:13:56.372 --> 00:14:01.448
Papitto latonguge
Krillin sonda baratow!

00:14:16.111 --> 00:14:16.847
Hey...

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.149
Welcome home, pal!

00:14:18.182 --> 00:14:22.558
[KRILLIN]
Wow... Kinda awkward...

00:14:25.196 --> 00:14:27.033
[PORUNGA]
Your wish has been granted...

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:28.369
Now speak your third wish

00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:31.241
so that I may
return to my slumber.

00:14:31.274 --> 00:14:32.945
Aw... Come on...

00:14:32.978 --> 00:14:35.416
There's no need to be
grumpy Mr. Dragon...

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.687
Hahahaha!!

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.091
Okay. Last but not least...

00:14:39.124 --> 00:14:40.761
Now summon Goku to stand

00:14:40.794 --> 00:14:42.665
at the side of his loved ones!

00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:44.836
[cheers]

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:10.019
[PORUNGA] I am unable...
The request has been denied.

00:15:12.257 --> 00:15:14.194
The one called Goku prefers

00:15:14.227 --> 00:15:20.407
to return in his own time
and refuses to be summoned.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.344
[ROSHI]
Of course!!!

00:15:22.377 --> 00:15:25.249
The man is terrified
of his own wife...!

00:15:25.283 --> 00:15:27.320
For all his strength
as a Super Saiyan,

00:15:27.353 --> 00:15:31.195
the one thing he
can't face is her...!

00:15:31.228 --> 00:15:34.234
Just an observ--eh, joke...
Harmless joke...

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:37.975
So, does that mean Dad's
never gonna come home?

00:15:38.008 --> 00:15:41.148
[PICCOLO] All good things
to those who wait, kid.

00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:44.154
He'll come home...
In his own good time.

00:15:44.188 --> 00:15:46.358
<i>[VEGETA] Yes that's it...
I'm certain of it...</i>

00:15:46.392 --> 00:15:47.828
<i>He's found some remote planet</i>

00:15:47.861 --> 00:15:50.099
<i>where he can train
in secrecy...</i>

00:15:50.132 --> 00:15:53.673
<i>Oh... I can't afford to
sit here spinning my wheels!</i>

00:16:00.554 --> 00:16:04.227
[rumbling]

00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:10.507
[blast off noises]

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.888
[PICCOLO] Ignore him.
Just go... Get on with it.

00:16:17.921 --> 00:16:19.191
There are people
on the other side

00:16:19.224 --> 00:16:21.529
with King Kai who've
been waiting for this day.

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:23.299
[BULMA]
Right. Yes...

00:16:23.332 --> 00:16:26.004
I wonder who we
should wish back now.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.944
They're trying to
decide which one of you

00:16:28.977 --> 00:16:30.580
gets called home next.

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:31.516
Okay so...

00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:33.018
I'm not done with
my training yet...

00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:34.622
I'd rather stay.

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:37.460
I... I don't want to
go if Tien's not going.

00:16:37.493 --> 00:16:40.333
Well, Yamcha...
I guess that settles it.

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:43.339
[monkey sounds]
Oohoohoo! Ohoohoo!

00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:45.978
Me first, huh...?
Well okay...

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:47.480
Good... It's decided.

00:16:47.515 --> 00:16:51.055
[KING KAI]
Come in, Bulma...! Hello...

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:52.323
Forgive the intrusion.

00:16:52.356 --> 00:16:55.129
You do know who this is, right?

00:16:55.162 --> 00:16:56.465
I have an idea.

00:16:56.498 --> 00:16:57.969
[KING KAI] Tien and
Chiaotzu would like to stay

00:16:58.002 --> 00:16:59.170
with me a bit longer.

00:16:59.204 --> 00:17:02.144
If you please, bring
Yamcha back first.

00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:04.213
Sounds like a plan to me...!

00:17:04.247 --> 00:17:06.184
Alright; third
time's the charm...

00:17:06.218 --> 00:17:07.453
Once more from the top...

00:17:07.486 --> 00:17:09.892
Have Yamcha set
a course for home!

[splash]

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.392
[PORUNGA] The one called Yamcha
yet again walks among you.

00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:27.595
Really?

00:17:27.628 --> 00:17:28.362
[PUAR]
Where is he?

00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:30.500
[BULMA]
Why don't I see him?

00:17:30.534 --> 00:17:32.671
[PORUNGA]
Your wishes have been granted.

00:17:32.705 --> 00:17:34.742
I bid you farewell.

00:17:34.776 --> 00:17:37.413
Wait! You can't leave yet!

00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:56.252
Oh great... He's gone...

00:17:56.285 --> 00:17:59.090
And there's no sign of Yamcha.

00:17:59.124 --> 00:18:00.627
[YAMCHA]
Hello...

00:18:05.637 --> 00:18:07.841
Oh Yamcha! I missed
you so much...!

00:18:07.874 --> 00:18:09.746
I'm so glad you're back...
Don't ever leave me again...

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:11.281
C'mon.

[BULMA]
Yamcha...

00:18:15.523 --> 00:18:17.193
Hey, if you're gonna
bring someone back...

00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:20.567
the next time... try
to pick a better spot.

We're on Earth.

[CHIAOTZU]
We made it! We're back!

00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:57.941

Yes, sir.

For all that you've done,
