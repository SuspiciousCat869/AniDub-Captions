something pretty interesting.

Essentially if Piccolo and
Kami hadn't split in two,

he would've been able to hold
his own against the Saiyans.

Which means... If Piccolo
wants to gain more power

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:18.196
he just has to convince
Kami to reunite with him.

to merge back together

00:08:23.673 --> 00:08:25.611
then they'll turn into

all kinds of crazy skills!

are Super Sayans...

would make a Super Namekian!

like the sound of that.

Maybe there's hope
for us after all.

00:08:40.073 --> 00:08:42.377
Except, if they merge
and Kami disappears,

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.349
doesn't that means the Dragon
Balls disappear, as well?!

00:08:45.383 --> 00:08:47.622
Yeah.
Chances are it does...

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:49.324
But look at it from
this perspective...

00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:50.961
If they stayed
on their own,

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:52.497
soon as the androids
got a hold of them

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.702
we'd lose the
Dragon Balls anyway.

00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:57.808
I mean if Piccolo's
even considering this

00:08:57.842 --> 00:09:00.280
that should tell you how
bad the situation is.

He can't stand Kami.

00:09:01.616 --> 00:09:03.052
So there's no way
he'd agree to merge with him,

00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:05.691

absolute last possible chance
