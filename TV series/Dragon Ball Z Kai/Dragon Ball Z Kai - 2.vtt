<i>[Goku] Somebody powerful's
headed this way. Is it Piccolo?</i>

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:08.817
<i>I haven't seen him
since we fought</i>

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:12.324
<i>at the World Martial Arts
Tournament five years ago.</i>

00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:17.434
<i>[yelling]</i>

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:20.340
<i>Somehow I managed to beat him.</i>

00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:25.819
<i>Maybe he's spent the last
five years training</i>

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.489
<i>and now he's hunting me
down to take his revenge!</i>

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:34.168
<i>No! It's not Piccolo!
But who is it?</i>

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:37.642
<i>[Narrator] Yes, who is this
fearsome stranger?</i>

00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:42.351
<i>And what does he want with
Goku? Find out, now!</i>

00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:46.647
<i>The Enemy is Goku's Brother?!</i>

00:01:46.747 --> 00:01:50.153
<i>The Secret of the Mighty
Saiyan Warriors!</i>

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.702
He- He has a tail! Just like
Gohan. Just like I did!

00:01:57.802 --> 00:02:01.810
That's right.. Very good, you've
finally realized who I am.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.750
I have?.. What are you--?.. I...

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.054
I don't know what
you're talking about!

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:07.889
Come here!

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.526
Kakarot...

00:02:09.627 --> 00:02:11.062
Have you been on
this planet so long

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:12.464
that you've forgotten
even that?

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.903
My memory is fine. And you
can quit calling me this

00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:16.707
'Kaka'-whatever it
is you're saying..

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:17.943
My name is Goku!

00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:20.782
What has happened to you...?

00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:22.885
Daddy!

00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:28.396
Gohan! Stay back!

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:31.603
Hey! Tell me.. Did you
ever suffer any serious

00:02:31.703 --> 00:02:33.907
blows to the head
when you were young?

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.911
What?

00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:37.447
<i>[Raditz] Are you stupid, too?</i>

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.588
<i>I'm asking, did you ever hit
your head when you were a kid?!</i>

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:42.659
Now answer me!

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:43.761
Yes!

00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:46.567
But..it..was when I
was really little,

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.403
I don't remember
anything about it.

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:50.608
I see.. that explains it.

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:53.312
Explains what?!..
What do you mean?!

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:54.616
<i>[Roshi] Goku!</i>

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:59.091
There's something.. your
grandfather told me once

00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:01.495
that I think you should know...

00:03:01.597 --> 00:03:04.736
<i>[Roshi] A long time ago, your
grandpa Gohan was walking</i>

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:07.508
<i>through the woods when he came
upon a strange object that</i>

00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:09.311
<i>appeared to have
fallen from the sky.</i>

00:03:09.412 --> 00:03:12.519
<i>When he went to examine it
more closely, he found a baby</i>

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.825
<i>boy with a tail, sealed
inside a little round pod.</i>

00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:19.498
<i>Gohan decided to take the child
home and raise him as his own.</i>

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.438
<i>But the boy had an
angry, violent nature,</i>

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.446
<i>and before long the old
man was at his wits' end.</i>

00:03:26.547 --> 00:03:28.985
<i>Then one day, there was
a terrible accident.</i>

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:32.424
<i>The child fell into a deep
ravine and hit his head.</i>

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:34.428
<i>The injury was nearly fatal.</i>

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.969
<i>But somehow, miraculously,
the boy survived.</i>

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.975
<i>What's more, after that,
he was no longer violent.</i>

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:44.816
<i>From that day on, he became
a happy, loving boy.</i>

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:46.152
The boy was me, wasn't it?

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:47.454
Yes...

00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:48.758
But if that's true, then
what does it mean?..

00:03:48.858 --> 00:03:50.528
Are you saying that
Goku and this guy have

00:03:50.628 --> 00:03:54.402
some kind of connection? How
is that even... possible!

00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:58.977
Yeah.. It's time you did some
explaining.. First--who are you?

00:04:00.582 --> 00:04:03.654
Let's start at the
top... The truth is..

00:04:03.754 --> 00:04:06.960
you're not of this
world, Kakarot.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.767
You were born on a distant
planet called Vegeta..

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:11.135
home of the Saiyan race,

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:14.576
the most powerful warriors in
the universe. You are one of us!

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:16.179
Huh?!

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.615
Huh?!

00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:20.153
And as for your other
question, my name's Raditz.

00:04:20.253 --> 00:04:22.457
I'm your brother!

00:04:23.627 --> 00:04:25.832
No way.. Goku.. has a brother?!

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:29.471
It's..gotta be some..
kinda joke...!

00:04:29.572 --> 00:04:31.476
If it is, it's not funny.

00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:34.883
It's crazy!.. If Goku's really
an alien like he says,

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.620
what's he doing on Earth?

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.032
It's not hard to understand..
Kakarot was sent to this world

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:45.538
with a simple mission not
long after he was born;

00:04:45.638 --> 00:04:48.578
to destroy every human
being on the planet.

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:49.746
What?!

00:04:49.846 --> 00:04:52.451
We Saiyans may be a
proud warrior race...

00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:54.789
but we're also businessmen.

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.562
<i>[Raditz] We scour the universe
in search of planets</i>

00:04:57.662 --> 00:05:00.467
<i>with habitable environments,
and then use our skills</i>

00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:02.672
<i>to eliminate the
native life forms.</i>

00:05:02.772 --> 00:05:04.943
<i>Once cleared, the
planets are then sold</i>

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:08.049
<i>to any alien race that's
willing to pay the price.</i>

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:11.524
<i>For those planets whose
inhabitants have high power</i>

00:05:11.624 --> 00:05:15.396
<i>levels, adult Saiyans are sent
in to subdue the territory.</i>

00:05:15.496 --> 00:05:17.434
<i>But to planets like this one,</i>

00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:20.107
<i>whose life forms are
pathetic and weak,</i>

00:05:20.207 --> 00:05:22.410
<i>we send our infants.</i>

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:28.423
<i>This is how you came to be
here,
Kakarot. Even by yourself,</i>

00:05:28.524 --> 00:05:30.293
<i>a year or two was more
than enough time</i>

00:05:30.393 --> 00:05:32.632
<i>to liquidate these
human pests...</i>

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:35.905
You could have done it easily,
if you hadn't lost your memory.

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:41.550
Especially considering the
massive size of the moon here.

00:05:42.585 --> 00:05:44.422
Hey.. what're you
talking about?

00:05:44.523 --> 00:05:46.660
What does the moon have
to do with anything?

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.998
Don't play dumb!..
You must know!

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:51.736
You've lived on this planet your
entire life! The full moon

00:05:51.836 --> 00:05:54.308
is key to unlocking a
Saiyan's true potential!

00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:56.613
[roar]

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:00.588
Maybe I am dumb, because you
still aren't making any sense!

00:06:00.688 --> 00:06:03.594
Huh?.. What the -?!

00:06:03.694 --> 00:06:06.499
Kakarot...! Your tail...!

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.971
Uh... excuse me?

00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:11.609
What happened to your tail?

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.415
That?.. It got cut off a long
time ago. What's it matter?

00:06:14.516 --> 00:06:17.287
You fool! How could you
let that happen?..

00:06:17.387 --> 00:06:20.661
Do you even know
what you've done?

00:06:20.761 --> 00:06:22.431
That explains how you've
been able to fit in

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:25.103
so well with these
miserable humans.

00:06:27.308 --> 00:06:29.646
That's enough! Even
if it is true,

00:06:29.746 --> 00:06:31.850
and I'm some kinda alien
from another planet..

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.088
or even if you really
are my older brother..

00:06:34.188 --> 00:06:37.662
It doesn't matter, anyone
who'd do the horrible things

00:06:37.762 --> 00:06:40.000
you say is no brother of mine!

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.639
My name is Goku..
and this is my home...

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:44.643
And you're not welcome here!

00:06:44.743 --> 00:06:46.145
<i>[Bulma] Tell 'em, Goku!</i>

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:48.618
That's right, you heard the
man!.. Whatever his past..

00:06:48.718 --> 00:06:50.053
Goku is one of us now.

00:06:50.153 --> 00:06:52.725
In fact, he's a better human
being than any of us!

00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:54.663
He saved the entire
world before!

00:06:54.763 --> 00:06:57.969
Would an alien warrior do
that?.. I don't think so!

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.451
I'm afraid it will take
more than shouting

00:07:05.552 --> 00:07:07.956
to convince me to leave.

00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:10.160
Powerful though we are, we
Saiyans have never been

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.868
strong in number...What's more,
our proud race was almost wiped

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:17.742
out entirely when a giant meteor
struck our home Planet Vegeta.

00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:21.015
[explosion]

00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:26.994
There weren't any survivors.
Everyone was vaporized.

00:07:27.094 --> 00:07:30.501
That includes our mother
and father, Kakarot.

00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:35.043
Counting you, there
are only four left

00:07:35.143 --> 00:07:37.515
in the universe who are
of Saiyan descent.

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:40.588
I was away on assignment with
another of our warriors

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:43.661
when the meteor hit.. We lived.

00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:45.865
<i>A third Saiyan also
survived. He'd been sent</i>

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:49.137
<i>to conquer a distant planet,
just like you were.</i>

00:07:49.237 --> 00:07:51.643
Recently, we happened
upon an inhabited world

00:07:51.743 --> 00:07:54.649
that we think could
fetch us a nice price.

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:56.152
But there's just
one tiny problem..

00:07:56.252 --> 00:07:59.659
Even with all three of us,
it won't be an easy fight.

00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:03.266
And that's where you
come into the picture,

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:05.036
my long lost little brother.

00:08:05.136 --> 00:08:08.209
<i>Your power level is lower than
I
would have liked.. but even so,</i>

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:12.250
<i>the four of us together should
be able to manage just fine.</i>

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.954
Stay away from me!.. Back off!

00:08:14.054 --> 00:08:17.696
Kakarot..Can't you see?!
Open your eyes!

00:08:17.796 --> 00:08:19.533
You were born for this!

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:21.537
I'm scared!

00:08:21.637 --> 00:08:23.339
That's ridiculous!
You can forget it!

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.846
I'd die before I joined a gang
of ruthless pirates like you.

00:08:28.517 --> 00:08:30.721
Really?

00:08:31.723 --> 00:08:33.026
[scared crying]

00:08:33.126 --> 00:08:35.396
You know, there's something
I've been wondering.

00:08:35.497 --> 00:08:39.204
Is that your son?.. The brat
behind the blue-haired woman?

00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:40.240
No! it isn't!

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.146
You can't fool me.

00:08:43.246 --> 00:08:44.749
That boy has Saiyan blood..

00:08:44.849 --> 00:08:46.787
It's no use trying
to hide it from me.

00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:48.323
I can see his tail from here.

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:50.728
What if he does?.. Huh?!

00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:52.230
I wanted to reason with you,

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.769
but I can see you don't know
what's best for your son..

00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:58.042
So.. I'm afraid I'm going to
have to take him with me.

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:06.158
Hold it!

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:13.874
Don't you take one step closer
to my son--I'm warning you!

00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:21.321
[kick]

00:09:28.203 --> 00:09:29.572
Daddy!

00:09:29.672 --> 00:09:31.777
Daddy! Get up!

00:09:31.877 --> 00:09:32.979
[Raditz] Not so fast!

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:34.682
Gohan!

00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:37.622
So like I said.. I'll
be taking your son...

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:39.926
And if you want to see
him alive again..

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.631
you'll do what your big
brother tells you.

00:09:47.642 --> 00:09:50.013
We're family.. So I'll
give you 24 hours

00:09:50.113 --> 00:09:53.019
to think about my offer...
The choice is yours..

00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:57.026
<i>But for your son's sake, I
hope you decide to join us.</i>

00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:01.034
Still.. You should show me a
gesture of your allegiance.

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:04.843
Let's see... Oh, I think
I know just the thing..

00:10:04.943 --> 00:10:07.013
You're going to
annihilate one hundred

00:10:07.114 --> 00:10:09.151
human beings by this
time tomorrow.

00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:11.856
It should be an easy job once
you set your mind to it.

00:10:11.957 --> 00:10:13.561
Just stack them here
on the beach...

00:10:13.661 --> 00:10:14.862
What?!

00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:22.645
I can't wait to see which fate

00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:26.018
you've chosen for
your son, Kakarot.

00:10:26.118 --> 00:10:29.893
Now try not to worry.. I won't
hurt my nephew unless I have to.

00:10:29.993 --> 00:10:33.199

Just in case you
missed anything,

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:48.797
I'll say it one more time.

00:10:48.897 --> 00:10:51.201
If you want your boy back,
you'll eliminate one hundred

00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:55.142
humans and bring them here,
before I return in 24 hours.

[grunting in pain]

00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:02.156

boy back and you can join

00:11:02.256 --> 00:11:05.998
our team... but of course if
I find out you're even a

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.570
single human short,
your son's mine...

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.211
[Krillin] You coward! He's just
a kid! Leave him out of this!

00:11:12.311 --> 00:11:13.647
Yeah!.. That's right!

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:15.316
And besides.. It won't work!

00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:18.990
It doesn't matter what you do
Goku would never hurt anyone!

00:11:20.193 --> 00:11:23.733
Oh.. I see...Then if you're
willing to let this one go,

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:25.202
I can take him right
now and Kakarot

00:11:25.303 --> 00:11:28.142
doesn't have to get
his hands dirty.

00:11:29.077 --> 00:11:32.183
Suit yourself. Your days
are numbered anyway..

00:11:32.284 --> 00:11:35.490
Every creature on this planet
will soon be exterminated ...

00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:38.897
Once we've completed our current
mission.. with or without

00:11:38.997 --> 00:11:43.339
Kakarot's help... we'll be
back to conquer Earth.

00:11:43.439 --> 00:11:44.909
You.. you will?

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:49.118
Ha ha ha ha. Of course, it'll
only be the three of us against

00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:51.923
billions and billions
of humans...Even so,

00:11:52.023 --> 00:11:55.229
I'm sure we can finish the
job in under a month.

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:04.381
Did you catch all of
that, Kakarot?..

00:12:04.482 --> 00:12:07.120
Struggle all you want.. You
know the only way out of this

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.291
is to join me and the
rest of the Saiyans.

00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:12.765
Give me back my boy!

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:15.904
Hmhmhm hm. When I come back
here tomorrow for your

00:12:16.004 --> 00:12:22.383
decision...The word I
want to hear is.. Yes.

00:12:22.483 --> 00:12:25.891
For your son's sake, you
shouldn't try to fight back.

00:12:28.296 --> 00:12:31.570
<i>Your power level is nothing
compared to a real Saiyan's...</i>

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.477

for your older brother!

could've done something,

this! You're hurt!

this time you find out you

00:13:30.086 --> 00:13:33.393
have a brother.. too bad he
turned out to be such a creep.

00:13:33.493 --> 00:13:34.863
So what do we do now?...

00:13:34.963 --> 00:13:38.402
How do we even compete against
that kinda strength...?

His tail.

00:13:41.108 --> 00:13:43.445
That's it. That's
his weak spot...

00:13:43.546 --> 00:13:47.287
If I can grab it somehow...
it'll drain his power...

00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:50.561
At least that's how..
it worked for me.

But.. can you?.. I mean,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.270

close enough to grab his tail?
