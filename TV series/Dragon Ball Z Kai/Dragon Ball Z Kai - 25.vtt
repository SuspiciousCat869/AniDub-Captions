Last Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:05.511
Frieza's top lieutenant Zarbon

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:07.481
underwent a shocking
transformation,

00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:10.856
and proceeded to unleash
the full extent of his power

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.861
on an unprepared Vegeta.

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:15.363
As the two titans clashed,

00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:18.103
Krillin and Dende raced to
collect the final Dragon Ball,

00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:20.440
before it was too late...

00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:24.683
You'll pay... when...
the Dragon Balls are mine!

There it is. That really tall
rock formation in front of us!

00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:10.928
No kidding?

00:02:17.274 --> 00:02:19.879
Well, let's hope the long
trip was worth it...

00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:26.827
The Grand Elder's
lived in that house

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.831
longer than any of us know...

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:30.366
Kinda conspicuous...

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.538
Seriously, I mean with it
right out in the open like this

00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:34.275
the bad guys'll
barely have to look.

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.114
Doesn't seem all that
smart if you ask me...

00:02:37.148 --> 00:02:38.517
Huh?

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.819
I hate to ask this, but what
if they've already been here?

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:57.387
Oh...

00:02:58.322 --> 00:02:59.959
I don't know...

That's Nail!

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.796
Thank goodness! That means
everything's alright!

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.568
[Krillin] He's the spitting
image of Piccolo!

00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:24.174
[Nail] I am relieved you and the
visitor got here safely, Dende.

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:25.812
The Grand Elder
has become aware

00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:29.653
of the dark clouds
gathering over our homeworld.

00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:31.791
So he has seen all
of the horrible things

00:03:31.824 --> 00:03:32.993
that have been going on.

00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:35.330
Good. The less explaining
we have to do, the better.

00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:38.971
The Grand Elder wishes to see
you. Please, come inside.

00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:42.979
But... Wh-Why would he stay
if he knew what was happening?

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:46.754
This place is so obvious;
both of you should try to hide!

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:49.225
Alas, the Grand Elder
knows all too well

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:50.695
how futile that would be...

00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:54.435
I'm afraid at his age hiding
simply isn't an option...

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.005
And there's nothing
left for me to do

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:58.043
but stay by his side
and protect him

00:03:58.076 --> 00:03:59.178
for as long as I can.

00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:01.984
So then, all the
rumors are true...

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:03.788
He isn't long
for this world...

00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:06.425
Enter. Please.

00:04:07.428 --> 00:04:09.498
[Krillin] This guy could
hold his own in a fight.

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:11.135
He seems a lot
stronger than the rest

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:13.740
of the Namekians I've seen...

00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:17.882
Above.

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.806
Elder... Dende and
the visitor have come.

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:32.077
[Krillin] No way!

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:37.387
Welcome... You come to us
from a planet called Earth, yes?

00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:40.260
First of all, allow me
to express my gratitude

00:04:40.293 --> 00:04:43.668
for seeing a child of mine
to safety... Thank you.

00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:46.405
Uh... Hey, uh...
No need to thank me...

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.577
It was nothing, really...

00:04:56.927 --> 00:04:58.062
Hyaa!

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.055
Well, okay... Guess I'm
officially maxed out now.

00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:15.631
Still, though...

00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:17.802
I've mastered fifty-times
the gravity of Earth.

00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:20.473
And fast! Real fast!

00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:25.216
Looks like my little
face-off with Vegeta

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.991
did a lot more than put me
in the hospital after all, huh?

00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:46.459
By the cruel hand
of these invaders,

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:48.463
many of my children
have died...

00:05:48.496 --> 00:05:51.035
Their sacrifices
weigh on my heart like--

00:05:51.068 --> 00:05:52.337
[cough]

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.076
--like an ocean.

00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:56.713
The villains seek
the Dragon Balls

00:05:56.746 --> 00:05:59.753
for their own insidious
ends, am I correct?

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:01.088
[Krillin] Yes.

00:06:01.122 --> 00:06:04.495
To think such beacons of hope
could be so foully twisted...

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.901
That the pinnacle
of our peoples' wisdom

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:09.004
could incur such loss...

00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:11.408
Forgive me for cutting
to the chase here, but...

00:06:11.442 --> 00:06:13.113
with all due respect,
Grand Elder,

00:06:13.146 --> 00:06:14.582
if it's okay with you...

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:17.354
I need to borrow the Dragon
Ball that's above your head.

00:06:17.387 --> 00:06:19.959
I promise I won't let it
fall into their clutches.

00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:21.395
Never in a million years!

00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:23.266
You are on a quest to collect

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.169
the Dragon Balls
for yourself then?

00:06:25.203 --> 00:06:26.506
Yes, sir.

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.243
I wanna use them to bring
back some old friends

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:29.478
who died protecting me.

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.650
I'd like to ask
the same thing, sir...

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.052
Please, Grand Elder...

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:35.390
If his friends were brought
back, then just maybe

00:06:35.424 --> 00:06:36.960
together they might
be able to stand

00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:38.831
against these evil
men and defeat them!

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:41.436
And how is it you
know of our legacy?

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:43.874
We had them back home, too.

00:06:43.908 --> 00:06:44.943
You mean on Earth?!

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:47.648
Long ago, when this
planet was in crisis,

00:06:47.682 --> 00:06:49.653
one of your people
journeyed across the stars

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:52.424
and came to our world...

00:07:06.786 --> 00:07:07.955
[Krillin] For whatever reason,

00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:10.427
he created the
Dragon Balls for us.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.632
Ah, yes... I remember now...

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:15.404
A gifted child... A genius...

00:07:15.437 --> 00:07:17.975
The scion of Katattsu--
brightest flame

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:19.679
among the tribes of old...

00:07:19.712 --> 00:07:21.950
Imagine a maker of Dragon Balls

00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:25.290
reaching as far out into
the cosmos as that...

00:07:25.323 --> 00:07:27.294
He was killed...
along with my friends,

00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:29.098
by one of the monsters
who's here now...

00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:32.470
A Saiyan named Vegeta who
wanted to destroy the Earth.

00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:35.712
The Saiyans are indeed
a formidable race...

00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:38.083
I feel for our lost prodigy.

00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:39.118
Permit me to ask--

00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:42.424
was this monster by
chance a Super-Saiyan?

00:07:42.457 --> 00:07:44.361
A Super-Saiyan? What's that?

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:46.967
Excuse me for a moment...

00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:50.374
Indulge an old man and
step up to my side here.

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:52.110
'Kay...

00:07:53.914 --> 00:07:58.055
Please... may I draw
from your home's past?

00:07:59.726 --> 00:08:00.928
Sure...

00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:05.537
[electronic noises]

[evil laughter]

00:08:22.471 --> 00:08:24.842
Oh dear... I see now...

00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:27.782
An evil crept into him
and split the body...

00:08:27.816 --> 00:08:31.823
[chuckle]

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:50.026
[maniacal laughter]

00:08:52.097 --> 00:08:54.736
The two halves remained
equal in power

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:56.873
But the pure-hearted
Kami could never subdue

00:08:56.906 --> 00:08:59.579
the dark mirror image
born of the rift...

00:08:59.612 --> 00:09:03.588
And thus Piccolo was wrought.

00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:05.256
Oh, the pain of it...

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.732
Poor creature... Our Namekian
heritage within him divided...

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:12.404
If only he could have
become whole again...

00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:15.577
He might still be
among you, today.

00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:17.448
You saw that?

00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:19.251
Yes, and your intentions...

00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:22.858
And I find the only thing purer
than they is your courage...

00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:25.832
So holding to the principle
of my sacred trust...

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:29.505
I give this to you...
The Dragon Ball in my keeping.

00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:31.275
Thank you!

00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:33.914
Yes, thank you
Grand Elder...

00:09:34.816 --> 00:09:37.522
Wow, this thing's
got some heft to it.

00:09:37.555 --> 00:09:38.890
Awesome!

00:09:38.924 --> 00:09:42.298
Alas, I fear your wish
isn't likely to be granted.

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:43.432
Whaddya mean? Why not?

00:09:43.465 --> 00:09:44.702
I am ancient...

00:09:44.735 --> 00:09:46.472
What time I have
left on this world

00:09:46.506 --> 00:09:49.244
will end in a few days.

00:09:49.278 --> 00:09:51.884
Do you think you'll be able
to win back the Dragon Balls

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:55.056
already in enemy clutches
with so little time?

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:59.432
It seems an insurmountable
task, and once I die...

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:03.072
[cough]

00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:09.719
...the Dragon Balls
will be extinguished.

00:10:09.753 --> 00:10:11.790
I don't care!
Forget my wish!

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:13.459
No matter what happens
I'll protect the one

00:10:13.492 --> 00:10:14.929
you've given me with my life!

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:19.070
Vegeta and his pals won't
get it. I promise you that!

00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:22.110
Thank you...

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:24.682
I don't possess the strength
to protect it myself.

00:10:24.716 --> 00:10:26.418
It's my honor, sir!

00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:30.259
You have truly incredible
reserves of strength, friend...

00:10:30.293 --> 00:10:31.763
Your power is enviable...

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:34.034
And yet so little
of it is tapped.

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:35.571
Reserves, huh? What do you...?

00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:39.344
[Grand Elder] Let us see if
the floodgates may be opened...

00:10:39.377 --> 00:10:42.519
[strange noises]

00:10:42.552 --> 00:10:43.887
Sorry...

00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:45.658
I'm pretty sure I'm already
"tapped" out, you know?

00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:48.797
I mean my training's
been wicked crazy...

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:52.638
Even right now I'm beyond

00:10:52.672 --> 00:10:55.110
my normal limits
back home, so uh...

00:10:55.143 --> 00:10:56.311

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.346
Krillin... Do your best,
but remember time is fleeting.

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:14.649
Whoa!

00:11:14.682 --> 00:11:17.387
Wha- What have you done to me?!

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.626
[crazed laughter]

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:22.497
This power!
I can feel it surge!

00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:23.967
I can't believe it!

00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:25.404
[laughter]

00:11:25.437 --> 00:11:27.474
This is just awesome!

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:29.946
I feel like I've been
totally reborn!

00:11:29.979 --> 00:11:32.718
Thank you so much,
Grand Elder!

00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:35.991
Um... Is it...

00:11:36.025 --> 00:11:38.998
Is it possible for you
to tap into anyone's power?

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.770
Like maybe...
Like a little kid's power?

00:11:41.803 --> 00:11:44.007
If the power is there
to tap, of course.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.877
I assume you have
someone in mind?

00:11:45.911 --> 00:11:48.016
Well... I mean does
unlocking someone's potential

00:11:48.049 --> 00:11:49.753
like, drain you or anything?

00:11:49.786 --> 00:11:52.090
Not at all... I only
provide the catalyst

00:11:52.123 --> 00:11:55.197
for what lay dormant--
my life force isn't affected.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.465
Then would it be okay,

00:11:56.499 --> 00:11:58.303
for me to bring a lil' buddy
of mine up here to see you?

00:11:58.336 --> 00:12:00.306
So you can be like the catalyst
or whatever for him--

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.345
'Cause I'm sure his reserves
have to be totally amazing!

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:06.185
Bring him to me...
The stronger our friends,

00:12:06.218 --> 00:12:08.189
the better chance
right has to prevail.

00:12:08.222 --> 00:12:11.696
Cool! I'll be back
in a little while!

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.536
What should I um...
do with this?

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:16.004
Take it with you, my boy...

00:12:16.038 --> 00:12:18.008
From this point forward
the fate of our world,

00:12:18.042 --> 00:12:21.916
and perhaps the universe
itself, rest in your hands.

00:12:24.387 --> 00:12:25.991
Dende... You just wait here...

00:12:26.025 --> 00:12:28.664
I'll be back with Gohan before
you have a chance to miss me.

00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:31.234
B- Be careful out there!

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:37.246
WOO-HOO!!!

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.790
[flying noise]

00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:43.193
Yeah! Ha-ha!

00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:45.831
I can get Gohan back
here in no time now!

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:48.737
How completely and totally
beyond sweet is this?!

00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:51.174
[laughter]

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.770
How is this possible?!

00:13:21.803 --> 00:13:23.239
We haven't even been
to this village yet,

00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:26.512
but someone's already gone
and laid it to waste!

00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:40.273
No one would think to
look for it underwater...

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:42.276
[evil laugh]

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.751
...and I'll be the only one
who knows where it is.

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.420
[evil laugh]

00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:51.562
I must recover it
at all costs...

00:13:55.704 --> 00:13:58.276
Tell me... Who did this to you?

00:13:58.309 --> 00:14:01.415
The Saiyan... took...
our Dragon Ball...

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:03.553
Smells like Vegeta.

00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:06.391
Please help me.

00:14:06.425 --> 00:14:07.227
[electricity sounds]

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.429
[screaming]

00:14:08.462 --> 00:14:10.567
I look like a doctor to you?

00:14:21.522 --> 00:14:23.827
Frieza, my lord.
It's Zarbon.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.630
You may enter now.

00:14:30.707 --> 00:14:32.511
Tell me that you
discovered a village.

00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:36.418
No, with all apologies, lord,
I've yet to locate one...

00:14:36.452 --> 00:14:39.491
But I'm happy to report that
Vegeta has been dealt with.

00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:42.431
Ah... Excellent...

00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:43.600
And you transformed...

00:14:43.634 --> 00:14:46.338
It's been a great while
since you resorted to that.

00:14:46.372 --> 00:14:47.441
Yes.

00:14:47.474 --> 00:14:50.246
So... I take this to mean
that Vegeta is dead?

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.252
Well... Circumstances ruled out
my finding a corpse,

00:14:53.285 --> 00:14:55.423
but even if by some
chance he's still alive

00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:58.563
I assure your lordship
his injuries are grave...

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:01.368
You mean to tell me you procured
no confirmation of his death?!

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:04.073
Uh, He- He was totally
submerged under water;

00:15:04.107 --> 00:15:05.644
the current carried
him away so I--

00:15:05.678 --> 00:15:07.815
Ah, well I guess we wouldn't
want you getting wet...

00:15:07.849 --> 00:15:10.286
Perhaps you might have retreived
him if you weren't so concerned

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.257
about getting your
stupid hair tousled!

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.394
For that matter, what gave you
the right to "deal" with him

00:15:14.428 --> 00:15:16.398
without my consent
in the first place?

00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:18.504
Had it not occurred to you
that Vegeta may very well

00:15:18.537 --> 00:15:20.239
have found a Dragon
Ball on his own and,

00:15:20.273 --> 00:15:22.044
I don't know, hidden it?!

00:15:22.077 --> 00:15:24.047
I'm- I am so sorry, my lord!

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.718
I'll go and retrieve
him at once.

00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:29.692
Sir! I've discovered a Namekian
village while out on patrol!

00:15:29.725 --> 00:15:31.963
The bad news is the village
has already been wiped out

00:15:31.996 --> 00:15:33.667
and their Dragon Ball taken!

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.035
What did you say?!

00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:37.541
[Oran] My gut tells me
it's the work of Vegeta.

00:15:37.574 --> 00:15:39.946
[Zarbon] Then he is
hiding a Dragon Ball!

00:15:39.979 --> 00:15:41.749
There was one villager who
survived the attack

00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:44.454
but I dealt with him,
filthy scum.

00:15:45.356 --> 00:15:49.431
You imbecile. You disposed
of the only witness.

00:15:49.464 --> 00:15:51.067
Frieza?

00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:53.740
[screaming]

00:15:55.142 --> 00:15:57.246
There are few things I dispise
more than a minion who

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.685
takes it upon himself to make
executive decisions.

00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:01.054
Zarbon, if Vegeta is dead

00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:03.493
then prepare yourself
to follow his example.

00:16:03.527 --> 00:16:06.264
Bring the prodigal son
back here... Now.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.168
And for your sake hope
he's still in a position

00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:10.072
to be of use to me.

00:16:10.105 --> 00:16:12.544
[Frieza] Appule!

00:16:12.578 --> 00:16:13.412
Sir?

00:16:13.445 --> 00:16:15.115
Contact Planet
Frieza immediately

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:16.953
and inform them
I require a shipment

00:16:16.986 --> 00:16:20.493
of replacement scouters
without delay. Understood?

00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:24.434
Have them delivered
in care of the Ginyu Force.

00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:27.106
[Frieza] Five days
is my expectation.

00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:29.378
Understood, sir!

00:16:29.411 --> 00:16:30.781
With all due respect,
Lord Frieza--

00:16:30.814 --> 00:16:33.787
isn't calling the Ginyu
Force perhaps a bit excessive?

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.123
I realize things look dire,

00:16:35.156 --> 00:16:36.592
but surely the situation
hasn't spiraled

00:16:36.626 --> 00:16:39.130
so hopelessly out-of-control
that we need their help...?

00:16:39.163 --> 00:16:42.403
My sense of foreboding would
tend to suggest otherwise.

00:16:42.437 --> 00:16:44.709
What... sort of
foreboding, my lord?

00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:47.446
A notion has plagued me
for quite some time now...

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.351
The idea... that
somewhere out there,

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:51.121
a Saiyan has come into his own

00:16:51.155 --> 00:16:54.294
and is destined
to become my enemy.

00:16:54.327 --> 00:16:56.632
[Frieza] Vegeta of course was
the likeliest candidate,

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:58.670
but now I'm not so sure...

00:16:58.704 --> 00:17:00.005
Yes, but... My lord, I...

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.374
Again with all due respect

00:17:01.408 --> 00:17:03.780
the only Saiyans left
in existence apart from him

00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:08.155
are this what's-his-name on
Earth and his infant son, yes?

00:17:08.188 --> 00:17:10.326
And based on what I've
come to understand, sir...

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.497
Their powers are well
below even Vegeta's--

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.435
So you're telling me
this sense of foreboding

00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:16.272
is little more than
childish paranoia...

00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:17.374
No sir!

00:17:17.407 --> 00:17:18.777
Then stop yammering
and bring Vegeta back here

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.914
before I lose what little
patience with you I have.

00:17:20.947 --> 00:17:22.618
Yes, my lord!

00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:30.266
The Ginyu Force...

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.702
[Frieza] Even as children,

00:17:31.736 --> 00:17:35.309
Saiyans possess unfathomable
stores of raw power...

00:17:35.342 --> 00:17:36.913
What battles don't
finish them off

00:17:36.946 --> 00:17:38.850
only serve to make
them stronger...

00:17:38.884 --> 00:17:41.589
Not nearly as strong as me,
of course, but still...

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:44.327
Foresight demands I wrench
this bothersome little monkey

00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:48.335
off my back before it becomes
something more cumbersome.

00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:53.345
The fabled Super-Saiyan would be
a most inopportune foe indeed.

00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:58.623
[snoring]

00:17:58.657 --> 00:18:01.529
[snoring]

00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:09.110
I slept like a log...

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:11.716
Wonder how many
hours I've been out?

00:18:16.057 --> 00:18:18.863
Okay... Can't move...
Not good!

00:18:24.307 --> 00:18:26.779
I'm... not... finished!

00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:31.522
This... fight...
is not... done!

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.676
Unbelievable!

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.080
Still alive after
the thrashing you took...

00:18:44.114 --> 00:18:45.350
Quite the tough guy, huh?

00:18:45.383 --> 00:18:47.019
Heh, heh...
Of course you are,

00:18:47.053 --> 00:18:48.624
and that resilience
is my ticket back

00:18:48.657 --> 00:18:52.363
into Frieza's good
graces... Up we go...

00:19:00.213 --> 00:19:03.920
[beeping]

00:19:03.953 --> 00:19:05.590
Hmm? Hey, Gohan...

00:19:05.623 --> 00:19:09.163
Come here for a sec...
Take a look at the radar.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.072
[Bulma] One of the Dragon
Balls is on the move...

00:19:13.105 --> 00:19:15.209
It's headed in our direction!

00:19:15.243 --> 00:19:16.377
Um... So what do you think

00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:18.115
the chances are that
that's Krillin?

00:19:18.148 --> 00:19:20.654
Pretty good... I think
he's found one!

00:19:20.687 --> 00:19:23.091
They made it to the Grand
Elder's safe and sound.

00:19:23.125 --> 00:19:24.629
Now he's on his way
back here to us!

00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:27.333
Wait. Hold on...
There's another one...

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:30.774
Right there... Weird...
I didn't notice it 'til now.

00:19:30.807 --> 00:19:32.678
[Bulma] Huh?

00:19:32.712 --> 00:19:34.515
These five right here
have gotta be the ones

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.819
that Frieza guy
has gathered up...

00:19:36.852 --> 00:19:40.761
But then there's this one
out here all by itself. See?

00:19:40.794 --> 00:19:44.702
Hey, you're right. And
not all that far from us.

00:19:44.735 --> 00:19:49.177
In fact... It's just
over that way, right?

00:19:49.211 --> 00:19:53.987
[beeping]

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.260
Remember the village Vegeta
was attacking a while ago?

00:19:57.293 --> 00:19:59.063
That's the direction is was in!

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:00.266
[beeping]

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:03.639
[Gohan] But... He's
not there anymore...

00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:05.109
[beeping]

00:20:05.142 --> 00:20:07.715
I'd sense his energy if he was.

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.954
I get it now! The Dragon Ball
is obviously still there

00:20:10.987 --> 00:20:12.189
which means Vegeta
couldn't find it

00:20:12.223 --> 00:20:13.927
and he's moved on
out of frustration!

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.395
Yeah!

00:20:15.429 --> 00:20:16.733
He's probably off on the other
side of the planet by now

00:20:16.766 --> 00:20:19.538
and we're practically
next door to the last one!

00:20:19.572 --> 00:20:22.376
Bulma, you've gotta let me
borrow that radar... Please...

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.151
I'm gonna track that Dragon Ball
down before he comes back.

00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:28.222
You've got it
pal... Here...

00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:30.827
'Bout time we had
a little luck.

00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:32.998
[beeping]

00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:45.757
Report.

00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:47.628
His condition
is critical, sir...

00:20:47.662 --> 00:20:49.799
All vital signs are
steadily dropping.

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:51.902
Even if he does manage
to pull through...

00:20:51.936 --> 00:20:54.341
I can't guarantee he'll
regain consciousness.

00:20:54.374 --> 00:20:56.244
You are to bring him
around whatever it takes!

00:20:56.277 --> 00:20:58.850
Is that perfectly
clear, Appule?!

00:20:58.883 --> 00:20:59.885
Yes...

00:20:59.918 --> 00:21:02.657
Otherwise, my condition
will be critical...

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:09.705
[beeping]

00:21:09.739 --> 00:21:11.842
Cool... All clear...

00:21:11.876 --> 00:21:15.850
This is my chance...
None of the bad guys are nearby!

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:21.529
[Narrator] Krillin and Gohan
have made their move

00:21:21.563 --> 00:21:23.900
to take two of the Dragon
Balls out of play.

00:21:23.933 --> 00:21:26.104
But with Frieza's men
still on the prowl,

00:21:26.138 --> 00:21:27.273
Vegeta on the mend,

00:21:27.307 --> 00:21:29.311
and Goku on his way
to Planet Namek--

00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:31.382
this game is far from over!

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.653
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:43.906
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:36.245 --> 00:22:37.548
[Goku] Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:37.581 --> 00:22:39.284
Sorry, I'm a little confused.

00:22:39.317 --> 00:22:41.589
Remind me: Who's got
how many Dragon Balls?

00:22:41.623 --> 00:22:43.693
[Gohan] Frieza has five,
so he's got the most.

00:22:43.727 --> 00:22:46.164
But Krillin has one,
and if I find the last of 'em,

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:47.568
we can stop the bad guys!

00:22:47.601 --> 00:22:49.938
[Vegeta] Dream on!
I'll be the lucky one today!

00:22:49.971 --> 00:22:52.578
Get ready to answer for what
you've done to me, Zarbon!

00:22:52.611 --> 00:22:55.516
[Goku] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:59.124
"The Scheme is Shattered!
Vegeta Strikes Back at Zarbon!"

00:22:59.157 --> 00:23:02.697
I think it's about time to turn
this baby up to one-hundred!
