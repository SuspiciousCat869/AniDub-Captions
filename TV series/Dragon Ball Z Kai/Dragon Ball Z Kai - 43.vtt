[chuckling] I realize
this was my idea,

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.674

bored with this little game.

He could destroy
this entire planet

with a single blast if he
wanted to; he has the power.

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:43.299
The way I see it,
the fact that we're all

still standing here can
only mean one thing.

How did he just do
that? I don't get it!

Even at that speed,
he freed himself
