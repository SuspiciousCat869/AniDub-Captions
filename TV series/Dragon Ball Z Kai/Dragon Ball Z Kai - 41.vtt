Last Dragon Ball Z Kai--

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.516
Frieza revealed his
final transformation!

00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:10.120
And Piccolo and the
others quickly realized,

00:00:10.187 --> 00:00:11.990
despite his sleek appearance,

00:00:12.057 --> 00:00:16.365
this was the tyrant's
most monstrous form yet.

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:19.974
Suddenly, Frieza has set his
fearful gaze on Gohan!

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.011
Can the young hero survive?

00:00:22.077 --> 00:00:24.816
The struggle continues--now!

Oh man... I barely
even saw him move...

00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:47.835
[Krillin] No way I
could've dodged that...

00:02:50.407 --> 00:02:52.545
[Piccolo]
Vegeta was the only one...

00:02:52.612 --> 00:02:55.150
He could see
that attack coming...

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.388
But... how?

00:02:57.454 --> 00:03:00.561
Have his abilities really
increased that much?

00:03:00.628 --> 00:03:05.671
Um. Thank you... You saved
me again. [nervous laughter]

00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:10.514
Don't get the wrong idea...
I didn't do it for you.

00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:12.351
[chuckles]

00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:13.588
I just want to make sure I have

00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:15.759
an audience here to
witness my victory.

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:17.829
What...? Your victory?

00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:23.206
Hmm...

00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:33.159
Wait... What are you saying...?

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:35.832
You seriously think
you can beat him?

00:03:35.898 --> 00:03:37.000
Easily.

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:39.071
For... For real?

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:43.313
The rest of you stay back...
just keep your eyes peeled...

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.584
and enjoy the show.

00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:52.966
Someone's full of confidence...
You poor fool... The

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:56.405
helplessness of your situation
has made you delusional.

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.445
I doubt you'll be so
smug once you realize

00:03:59.512 --> 00:04:01.249
what you're up against.

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:02.786
Just take a good look.

00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:07.862
What stands before you now...
is the thing you fear most.

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:09.365
I am a Super Saiyan!

A Super... Saiyan...?

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.853
[Piccolo]
A "Super Saiyan"? What is that?

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.356
What is he talking about?

00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:24.629
Yes, that's it, take
a good long look at me.

00:04:31.142 --> 00:04:35.551
I never knew you had such
a sense of humor... Funny...

00:04:35.618 --> 00:04:39.491
Hmph. Fine...! You can scoff all
you like. In the meantime,

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.565
allow me to show you what a
true super-elite like me is

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:46.706
capable of--and why you were
right to fear the legends!

AAAARRRRGGGHHH!

00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:03.941
[Goku]
That energy--is that Vegeta...?

00:05:04.007 --> 00:05:05.210
Feels like he's managed

00:05:05.277 --> 00:05:07.915
to give himself a big
power-boost, too...

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.110
Whoa... Awesome...!

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:27.555

Hey...! There's about to be
some serious fireworks...

00:05:30.493 --> 00:05:32.899
We need to find some cover!

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.435
Come on!

00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:36.674
Whoa.. I don't know what
this Super Saiyan business

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.544
is all about, but
whatever Vegeta's done,

00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:39.946
this new power is amazing!

00:05:40.013 --> 00:05:42.284
That was the idea... That's
why he had me blast him,

00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:43.855
because he knew once
Dende healed him

00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:46.025
he'd come back even
stronger than ever!

00:05:46.092 --> 00:05:50.033
Oh... Well if that was the
plan all along... it worked...

I-Is it over? What happened?

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.422
What...? They're both
standing right where they were,

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:53.159
nothing's changed at all!

00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:54.596
No, everything's changed...

00:06:54.662 --> 00:06:56.800
It's all just bubbling beneath
the surface right now...

00:06:56.867 --> 00:06:59.038
Try sensing out
Vegeta's energy,

00:06:59.104 --> 00:07:01.108
you'll see what I mean!

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.599
Wow... Yeah, you're
right--all that power,

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:14.869
it's like he's a whole
different person...!

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:17.642
Hmm... Am I to assume
that little light show

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:19.780
was actually intended
to intimidate me?

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:21.616
Hmph...! You've no idea...!

00:07:21.683 --> 00:07:22.986
You should consider
yourself fortunate

00:07:23.052 --> 00:07:25.089
that you lost your
Scouter when you did...

00:07:25.156 --> 00:07:27.562
If you could read my
actual power level right now,

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:28.998
you'd tuck that tail of yours

00:07:29.064 --> 00:07:32.638
between your legs and run
away screaming for mercy.

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:35.176
That's right...! Because you
wouldn't be able to deny the

00:07:35.243 --> 00:07:38.684
fact that my power level is
now even greater than yours!

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.721
As it stands, I'll just
have to show you!

00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:44.796
You'll see the proof once I
bring you to your knees!

00:07:44.863 --> 00:07:47.000
What's wrong...? What
happened to all of those

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:51.943
witty comebacks...? Huh...?
You're not scared, are you?

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.584
Alright... I've heard enough...
Since you're so determined to

00:07:55.651 --> 00:07:58.289
carry out this farce... I
suppose I'll humor you and let

00:07:58.356 --> 00:08:00.695
you play "Super
Saiyan" for a while.

00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:03.166
Let me see your
"legendary" strength.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.969
Oh, you will!

00:08:17.828 --> 00:08:19.966
You can't run from me!

00:08:25.845 --> 00:08:28.449
Kakarot won't even
get a shot at you!

00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:30.654
He's incredible...! Look...!

00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:34.161
He's totally got Frieza
pushed back on his heels!

00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:35.998
No... damn it.

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:41.008
It's not enough...
He's... done for!

00:08:41.075 --> 00:08:42.243
What do you mean?

00:08:46.954 --> 00:08:48.624
This is a losing
strategy, Frieza!

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.328
You can't dodge me forever!

00:08:55.838 --> 00:08:58.644
What...? He was right there!
Dammit I had him!

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:01.816
But I'm a Super Saiyan... My
battle instincts should be

00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:05.056
at their peak...! How could
I lose sight of him?!

00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:07.194
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.663
What?!

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:13.373
[laughing]

00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:16.880
There...? But... how...?

00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:18.951
So I make one little
move at full speed...

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:22.625
and all of sudden your
head is spinning.

00:09:22.692 --> 00:09:26.800
Perhaps... you're
not so "Super" after all.

00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:29.572
Not good...

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.208
I don't believe it--Vegeta's
power is off the charts,

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:34.683
but... still... Frieza's
just toying with him!

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:38.189
Yes... We're no match
for that monster.

00:09:38.757 --> 00:09:42.197
Ah, Vegeta. Not to put a
damper on that new confidence,

00:09:42.264 --> 00:09:44.936
but if those are the
limits of your abilities...

00:09:45.003 --> 00:09:48.309
I'm afraid you don't have
a chance of beating me.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:49.845
Hmpf!

00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:53.787
So sad... And after all
your boasts of becoming

00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:57.995
a Super Saiyan... Of course, if
you really are what you say...

00:09:58.062 --> 00:09:59.832
Then it would seem
all this time

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:02.304
I've been worried
over nothing.

00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:04.776
[Frieza laughing]

00:10:04.842 --> 00:10:06.780
[shuddering with rage]

00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:09.852
It's almost funny... The
grand tales of the mighty

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:13.326
Super Saiyan, the most fearsome
warrior in the universe...

00:10:13.393 --> 00:10:14.428
silly legends.

[Vegeta]
How can this be?

00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:17.635
Is this really the
best I can do...?

00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:21.910
I'm a Super Saiyan! I'm
unbeatable! Aren't I?

00:10:21.977 --> 00:10:24.849
Or is Frieza just on such a
high level that not even

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.755
a Super Saiyan can touch him?!

00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:33.734
No, I... I refuse to believe it!

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:36.472
The legends are true,
I know they are!

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.842
Oh?

00:10:37.909 --> 00:10:42.350
I will not be defeated...!
I cannot be defeated!

Hmmm?
[emergency alarm sounding]

00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:09.532
I think that's enough... It's
time we ended this foolishness

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.602
before it ceases to be amusing.

00:14:14.474 --> 00:14:17.882
Unreal... He deflected a
blast of that size...

like it was nothing...!

00:14:19.418 --> 00:14:21.823
And there's no way Vegeta
was holding back.

That was all the power he had!

could anyone be that strong?

Let's see how well you fend
off one of my attacks.

00:14:35.283 --> 00:14:36.886
Ready...?

00:14:40.827 --> 00:14:43.031
[King Kai]
Poor Vegeta...

00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:48.710
At last, he understands the true
nature of the monster he faces.

00:14:48.777 --> 00:14:52.618
For the first time ever, he is
genuinely trembling. All of the

00:14:52.685 --> 00:14:57.795
fear and frustration he must be
feeling, I can only imagine...

00:14:57.862 --> 00:15:00.767
His eyes don't lie.
Those tears are real.

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:02.504
This is the first
time the proud

00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:06.612
Saiyan prince has ever known
what it is to feel helpless.

00:15:11.322 --> 00:15:14.528
Brace yourself... Here I come.

00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:21.977
[electric whirring]

00:15:22.043 --> 00:15:27.253
[vibrating hum powering up]

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.396
[blast off]

00:15:35.036 --> 00:15:36.438
[King Kai]
It's over. Frieza has

00:15:36.506 --> 00:15:40.479
already won. He's stripped
Vegeta of his will to fight...

00:15:42.852 --> 00:15:45.456
AAARRRGGGHHH!!!

00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:47.694
Mmmmmmmm!!

00:15:52.303 --> 00:15:54.307
[laughing]

00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:59.317
[smashes into water]

00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:05.864
No, don't!

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:09.103
There's nothing
we can do for him now.

00:16:17.487 --> 00:16:18.756
Hmmm...

00:16:20.995 --> 00:16:23.733
[water explosion]

00:16:49.585 --> 00:16:51.288
[screaming]

00:16:51.355 --> 00:16:53.760
Come now, I can't
have you giving up

00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:55.329
after such a glancing blow.

00:16:55.396 --> 00:16:59.137
No, I'm afraid your torment is
only just beginning.

00:17:05.818 --> 00:17:10.995
There are so many horrors
I have yet to show you.

00:17:11.062 --> 00:17:13.065
[Vegeta screaming]

00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:14.602
How's that?

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:18.008
Are you beginning to regret your
foolish attempt to defy me?

00:17:18.075 --> 00:17:20.380
Or shall I continue
to remind you of your place,

00:17:20.446 --> 00:17:22.985
you worthless Saiyan monkey!

00:17:23.051 --> 00:17:28.295
[Vegeta screaming, moaning]

00:17:28.362 --> 00:17:30.667
I thought you were different,
that you might actually prove

00:17:30.734 --> 00:17:34.108
to be useful... I took you under
my wing, gave you special

00:17:34.174 --> 00:17:37.113
treatment--and this
is how you repay me!

00:17:42.223 --> 00:17:43.727
If only you'd remained
loyal. You'd have lived

00:17:43.794 --> 00:17:46.732
your life without ever
knowing this misery.

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:13.452
[explodes into ground]

00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:20.633
[writhes in agony]

00:18:26.613 --> 00:18:27.581
[sounding terrified]

[sounding angry]

00:19:07.728 --> 00:19:11.401
Feel free to jump in and try
to save him at any time.

00:19:18.348 --> 00:19:20.186
[King Kai thinking]
At this point, it seems Piccolo

00:19:20.253 --> 00:19:21.756
and the others are incapable of

00:19:21.823 --> 00:19:24.762
lifting so much as a finger, no
matter how much they might want

00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:28.435
to... They've been so stunned
by Frieza's display of power

00:19:28.503 --> 00:19:30.907
that they've been rendered
completely helpless--

00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:36.619
[Goku]
Vegeta's energy is fading...

00:19:36.686 --> 00:19:40.093
And fast from the feel
of it... But how...?

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:41.863
After he'd made himself
so much stronger,

00:19:41.929 --> 00:19:43.933
it doesn't make sense...

00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:48.375
Unless-that's how
tough this Frieza really is!

00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:52.651
[computer beeping]

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:55.389
I'm healed!

00:19:56.358 --> 00:19:57.961
[glass shattering]

00:20:35.537 --> 00:20:38.442
I'm a lot stronger now.
Feels like I can barely

00:20:38.509 --> 00:20:40.713
keep my power under control.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.359
This is unbelievable...! I
thought I'd already gotten

00:20:47.426 --> 00:20:50.099
as strong as I could, but... I
guess I don't know my own

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:54.842
limits. I have to admit; it
feels pretty good. I just wish

00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:57.614
I had some time to
stop and enjoy it...

00:20:57.681 --> 00:21:01.723
But I don't...! Gohan...!
Krillin...! Piccolo...!

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:08.068
I'm sorry it took so long,
but I'm coming, right now!

00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:11.174
[Narrator]
At last, Goku has emerged

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:14.782
from the rejuvenation
chamber, fully restored

00:21:14.848 --> 00:21:15.984
and ready to join his

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.823
friends on the battlefield!

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.762
The ruthless Frieza has
already proved himself

00:21:21.829 --> 00:21:23.332
all but invincible.

00:21:23.398 --> 00:21:25.435
If any hope against
the tyrant remains,

00:21:25.503 --> 00:21:30.613
it is now up to Goku to find
it. Next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

[Goku]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:39.585 --> 00:22:42.122
Are you all right, Vegeta?
Even if you are a pretty bad

00:22:42.189 --> 00:22:45.395
guy yourself, no one deserves
to be treated like that...

00:22:45.462 --> 00:22:48.335
[Vegeta] Moron! You have
to be ruthless, Kakarot!

00:22:48.402 --> 00:22:50.573
Don't you get it?!
That's the only way

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.678
you'll ever become
a Super Saiyan!

[Goku] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai!

[Vegeta]
I'm begging you, Kakarot--

00:23:01.427 --> 00:23:02.831
you have to finish him.

Do it for me!
