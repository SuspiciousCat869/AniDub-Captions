same level of power as I do.

still puts you to shame.

I'll tell you
one thing, Gohan,

00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:54.996
I wish I had half your heart

achieved my perfect form...

absorbed her yet!

still be hiding

down there somewhere?

If-If she is...

00:12:36.913 --> 00:12:39.351
Maybe I can still
use the controller...

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:43.159
Only question is...
where do I look?

00:12:43.192 --> 00:12:43.994

the whole island

Why...?! Why must
I suffer this humiliation?

If only Eighteen
would show herself...

00:13:01.596 --> 00:13:04.467
Then... I would
make them all pay!

00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:12.484
Now... Hold on...

"Do" you actually believe
this "perfect form" of yours

00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:17.160

My strength,

If I absorbed Eighteen,

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.483

00:14:00.514 --> 00:14:01.616
But I still don't get it.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.923
Was he only pretending to
be weak when I fought him?

00:14:04.956 --> 00:14:05.991
No...

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:08.229
There would have been no
reason for him to do so.

00:14:08.262 --> 00:14:10.200
Since you and he fought...

00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:12.037
he has gained this power.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.072
But how is that possible?

00:14:13.105 --> 00:14:16.244
How can anyone change
that much in a few days?!

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:30.206
It's... her... She's
right down there...

00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:41.295
Man... Anyone spot
me...? Let's see...

00:14:41.328 --> 00:14:43.499
No, they're too
wrapped up in the fight.

00:14:46.438 --> 00:14:49.344
So I just push this button
to shut down Eighteen,

00:14:49.377 --> 00:14:50.246
and then I destroy her

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:52.350
so Cell can't reach
his perfect form.

00:14:52.383 --> 00:14:57.060
Problem solved,
easy as that, right...?

00:14:57.093 --> 00:14:59.666
You need to know the signal
does have a limited range--

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:02.939
you'll have to be within thirty
feet for it to work, okay...?

00:15:02.972 --> 00:15:04.975
Thirty feet, don't forget!

00:15:05.544 --> 00:15:07.346
Here goes nothin'...

00:15:21.475 --> 00:15:25.517
[panting]

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:32.029
Will you really be satisfied
ending things this way?

00:15:43.018 --> 00:15:45.223
<i>[KRILLIN] I didn't see
Android Seventeen with them...</i>

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:47.327
<i>I'm guessing that
means he got absorbed...</i>

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.198
<i>That would explain
how Cell powered-up</i>

00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:50.667
<i>and transformed like that...</i>

00:16:22.196 --> 00:16:23.298
<i>[KRILLIN]
They're right there...!</i>

00:16:23.332 --> 00:16:25.436
<i>Somehow I've gotta get
within thirty feet of 'em</i>

00:16:25.469 --> 00:16:26.037
<i>without them noticing...</i>

00:16:26.071 --> 00:16:28.276
<i>If they see me coming...</i>

00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:30.212
<i>it's all over...</i>

00:16:36.358 --> 00:16:37.293
<i>[KRILLIN]
What am I doing?</i>

00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:40.199
<i>This is no time to
let my mind wander!</i>

00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:53.326
<i>A squirrel.
Oh man, am I jumpy...</i>

00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:55.797
<i>Whoa! Don't go over there!</i>

00:17:09.725 --> 00:17:12.297
Why would I care about
seeing your perfect form?

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:13.700
As pathetic as you are now...

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:16.405
I find it hard to believe
you'd give me a challenge.

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:19.244
Ha...! I'd give you
far more than that...

00:17:19.277 --> 00:17:21.382
You wouldn't even
stand a chance.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:23.051
Really...?

00:17:27.293 --> 00:17:30.266
Don't listen,
Dad... Be smart...

00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:34.341
Yes, Vegeta...

00:17:34.374 --> 00:17:38.115
I can see, you are
interested, aren't you...

00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:42.157
You forget... I know you...

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.629
You can't help but be curious
to see what I'll become;

00:17:44.662 --> 00:17:46.265
it's in your blood.

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:49.137
Your race lives for
the thrill of battle.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.310
The stronger your opponent
the more you welcome it.

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:55.283
Anything that gives you a
chance to test your mettle.

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:59.625
Yes... It's true, isn't
it? You know I'm right.

00:17:59.658 --> 00:18:01.796
You want to see
my full power...

00:18:01.829 --> 00:18:04.568
Your pride won't let you
have it any other way.

00:18:08.308 --> 00:18:10.313
And not just your pride...

00:18:10.346 --> 00:18:12.450
You are the Prince
of the Saiyans...

00:18:12.483 --> 00:18:14.655
The pride of your
entire warrior race

00:18:14.688 --> 00:18:16.625
rests on your shoulders.

00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:27.548
