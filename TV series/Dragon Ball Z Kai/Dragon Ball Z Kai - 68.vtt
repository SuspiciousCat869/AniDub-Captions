but he's too sick to fight,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.382

the Kame House, too?

But that isn't very far

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.793
from where we discovered
the time machine.

00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:59.298
[Announcer] ...as it unfolds,
so please stay tuned.

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:01.803
Naw... couldn't be...

00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:09.753
[phone ringing]

00:10:09.786 --> 00:10:11.456
Hello? Kame House.

00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:12.759
[Bulma] Oh hey, it's Bulma.

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:14.662
Who am I talking to,
anyhow? Krillin, right?

00:10:14.695 --> 00:10:15.832
Guess you made it
to Roshi's okay?

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:16.967
Uh, yeah! So, what's up?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.435
[Bulma] What about the others?

00:10:18.469 --> 00:10:21.175
Trunks? An' Gohan? No, they
haven't gotten back here yet.

00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:23.714
Never mind that for the moment,
just turn on your TV...

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:25.718
They gotta be covering it
on every station by now,

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:28.757
but I just caught a report
about it on channel 872.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.863
[Krillin] Wait, covering what,
Bulma? What's going on?

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:33.032
Just do it, Krillin!

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.137
Hey, man... Who's on the phone?

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.041
Oh, it's Bulma...
She says that there's

00:10:37.074 --> 00:10:38.711
something on TV that
she wants us to see.

00:10:38.744 --> 00:10:41.683
The imperil... We now
have new information

00:10:41.717 --> 00:10:44.622
to report on the crisis
unfolding in Gingertown.

00:10:44.656 --> 00:10:46.693
Now, according to this
note our news producer

00:10:46.727 --> 00:10:48.496
handed me off the
air a moment ago...

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.102
Clothing believed to belong
to the missing townspeople

00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:53.707
has been found littered
all over the area.

00:10:53.741 --> 00:10:55.477
One of our reporters
has just arrived--

00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:57.414
we take you to the scene now.

00:10:57.447 --> 00:10:59.317
Whoa... kinda creepy, isn't it?

00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:02.692
Uh, We're broadcasting
live from Gingertown,

00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:04.494
where there are few
clues as to the fate

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:06.834
of the more than
15,000 residents

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:08.102
who have seemingly vanished...

00:11:08.136 --> 00:11:10.307
But we've stumbled onto
something... telling.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.610
Whoa... that's a lot.

00:11:11.643 --> 00:11:13.680
There are empty outfits
all over the ground,

00:11:13.713 --> 00:11:15.818
as though the people
who'd been wearing them

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:17.755
have melted clean away.

00:11:17.788 --> 00:11:19.859
This rifle here suggests
that the townsfolk mounted

00:11:19.892 --> 00:11:23.166
some sort of defense
against whatever took them.

00:11:23.199 --> 00:11:24.201
What?! Took 'em?!

00:11:24.234 --> 00:11:27.040
It... It's gotta be
those androids, Bulma!

00:11:27.073 --> 00:11:28.777
They're gonna
wipe out humanity,

00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:29.846
and this is just a warmup!

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.382
No-- it wasn't them.

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:32.685
Don't just take my word for it.

00:11:32.719 --> 00:11:34.689
I'm sure Trunks and
Gohan will agree.

00:11:34.722 --> 00:11:36.425
But if it wasn't
them... and look,

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:38.697
I'm still going with "if"
'cause I'm not convinced--

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:40.033
you're saying it
has something to do

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.368
with the other time machine?

00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:43.807
[Bulma] Definitely.
No question about it...

00:11:43.841 --> 00:11:46.847
Gohan and Trunks will fill you
in as soon as they get there.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.751
[Krillin] Yeah-- okay.

00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:51.857
Good news-- Goku's
resting easy up there...

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.127
That cure seems to be--

00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:55.931
Huh?

00:11:58.771 --> 00:12:00.708
Master Roshi! It's us!

00:12:00.741 --> 00:12:02.310
Can we come in?

00:12:02.344 --> 00:12:04.047
Ah--

00:12:05.718 --> 00:12:08.255
Hey... Krillin...
Whatcha lookin' at?

00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:10.393
[Krillin] Thank goodness
you're back. Now watch

00:12:10.426 --> 00:12:12.665
the news and help us figure
out what's going on!

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:13.834
Do what?

00:12:13.868 --> 00:12:15.971
[frantic, panicked yells]

00:12:16.004 --> 00:12:19.377
[Reporter] Are you
picking that up?

00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:21.482
Something is happening...

00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:25.825
People are screaming, but we
can't see them from here!

00:12:25.858 --> 00:12:27.126
And now, gunfire.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.897
I.. I hear screaming and
gunfire

00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:31.670
It's coming from the direction
where the police officers

00:12:31.703 --> 00:12:33.974
and detectives had gone
to investigate.

00:12:35.844 --> 00:12:37.380
and now...
ominous silence

00:12:37.413 --> 00:12:38.316
All right, viewers...
We're going to go in there

00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:39.585
investigate

00:12:39.619 --> 00:12:42.090
as close as we can,
to see if-- Aah!

00:12:56.418 --> 00:12:58.557
[Kami shudders]

00:12:58.591 --> 00:12:59.925
What do you see...?!

00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:03.433
Snap out of it, Kami--
what's going on down there?!

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:05.270
Please... Speak, Kami.

00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:09.912
What... manner of...
foul monstrosity is this?!

00:13:09.945 --> 00:13:12.651
What? What are
you talking about?

00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:15.758
Talk, you old fool!
What's monstrous?!

00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:20.032
[Kami shudders]

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:23.006
Hey... What happened?

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:26.178
[Yamcha] well switch it to
another channel already!

00:13:26.512 --> 00:13:27.413
[Krillin] right

00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:33.359
[people screaming in horror]

00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:40.206
[Krillin] It got quiet
again.

00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:43.980
[Piccolo] This is ridiculous!

00:13:44.014 --> 00:13:46.720
I won't be kept in
the dark any longer!

00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:51.361
You're going to tell me
exactly what you saw! Now!

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:54.970
Fine... So be it.

00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:57.140
[Piccolo] Finally!
So what is this monster

00:13:57.174 --> 00:14:00.848
you're talking about?
What is going on down there?

00:14:01.182 --> 00:14:04.588
Why go through all the
trouble of using words?

00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:08.462
Once you and I have merged
into a single Namekian, Piccolo,

00:14:08.496 --> 00:14:09.932
you shall know what I saw.

00:14:09.965 --> 00:14:11.335
[Piccolo] Ah!

00:14:11.368 --> 00:14:13.774
What? Kami...

00:14:13.807 --> 00:14:16.546
So you've finally come
to your senses, eh?

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.386
Whatever is down there, it must
really be something else.

00:14:20.587 --> 00:14:21.823
[Kami] Let's get on with it...

00:14:21.857 --> 00:14:25.564
There have been far too
many victims already...

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.267
[Piccolo] All right.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.770
But I'm not deferring to you!

00:14:28.803 --> 00:14:30.774
I'm in charge of us!
Understood?!

00:14:30.808 --> 00:14:33.580
Of course... You are
younger than I...

00:14:33.613 --> 00:14:36.653
And your power far exceeds
what I can muster now...

00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:37.955
It is only fair.

00:14:37.988 --> 00:14:39.358
[Piccolo] Hmph.

00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:41.596
My power will be at your
disposal whenever you need it.

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:45.236
And you shall have all of
my hard-won knowledge.

00:14:47.473 --> 00:14:49.210
[Kami] Hmm...

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.134
[Popo whimpers]

00:15:03.105 --> 00:15:05.611
Now... since you are
to be the foundation,

00:15:05.644 --> 00:15:08.116
place your hand upon me.

00:15:08.149 --> 00:15:09.919
Fine.

00:15:11.757 --> 00:15:13.459
Ah... Kami, please don't!

00:15:13.493 --> 00:15:16.533
[Kami] Don't worry about
me, my loyal friend...

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:20.439
It's not an overseer that
the Earth needs right now...

00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:23.445
It needs a warrior!

00:15:23.478 --> 00:15:24.615
[Popo whimpers]

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:27.588
Piccolo is different now...
For the evil that once

00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:31.161
tainted his heart has
all but faded away.

00:15:31.194 --> 00:15:32.999
Once we have merged,
I doubt we shall ever

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:36.940
be split again.
He and I will be as one.

00:15:36.973 --> 00:15:40.547
Don't go...

00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:44.789
Thank you for all your years
of service... Mr. Popo.

00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:46.960
Oh... dear Kami...

00:15:46.993 --> 00:15:53.038
[Popo cries]

00:15:58.717 --> 00:16:08.235
[Kami roars]

00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:18.690
[Piccolo gasps]

00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:31.515
[Popo whimpers, gasps]

00:17:02.912 --> 00:17:04.916
If... you can hear me, Kami...

00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:07.854
then please...
take care of yourself.

00:17:07.888 --> 00:17:10.661
I'm neither Kami
nor Piccolo now.

00:17:10.694 --> 00:17:13.066
I am only a Namekian,
who has long since

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.302
forgotten his true name.

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:24.487
Now... farewell.

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:06.204
[Goku snores]

00:18:06.238 --> 00:18:08.075
All of our attempts to
contact the news team

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:10.714
in Gingertown have been
unsuccessful so far.

00:18:10.747 --> 00:18:12.416
We think our staff may
have fallen victim

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.686
to whatever attacked
the townspeople.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.325
So... you think whatever
came out of that shell's

00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:17.661
to blame for all this?

00:18:17.694 --> 00:18:20.534
Well, yeah... that's what
makes the most sense...

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:21.837
It was nearby.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.740
[Yamcha and Roshi react]

00:18:26.613 --> 00:18:29.351
Hey ... I'll get to
the bottom of this.

00:18:29.384 --> 00:18:30.419
[Yamcha] Hold on! Wait!

00:18:30.453 --> 00:18:31.756
[Krillin] You're
kidding, right?!

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.225
[Trunks]
I'll be fine, you two.

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:36.198
Remember, I can turn Super
Saiyan if things get rough...

00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:39.204
Besides, it's the androids
we have to worry about...

00:18:39.237 --> 00:18:40.472
not some overgrown bug.

00:18:40.507 --> 00:18:43.412
[Krillin] Eh...
Yeah, I know, but...

00:18:43.445 --> 00:18:45.784
[Gohan] Then... I'm
coming with you, Trunks!

00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:46.987
Oh, no you're not!

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.525
Your poor father is
still stuck in bed!

00:18:49.558 --> 00:18:52.063
This is no time to go
looking for a fight!

00:18:52.096 --> 00:18:53.432
C'mon, Mom!

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.236
It's 'cause he's still sick
that I need to help out.

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:59.077
Listen here! I don't care
if that thing spits fire!

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.346
You are not flying away!

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.618
Aw! That's no fair!

00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:03.820
[Krillin] Uhh...

00:19:03.854 --> 00:19:07.127
[Trunks] That's all right.
I'll go by myself.

00:19:07.628 --> 00:19:09.899
Gohan, you can help
me from right here...

00:19:09.932 --> 00:19:11.502
You and the
others defend Goku

00:19:11.536 --> 00:19:13.372
from the androids,
in case they show up

00:19:13.405 --> 00:19:15.376
while I'm out dealing
with this. Okay?

00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:17.914
Uh... yeah!
We'll keep him safe!

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:20.486
Hey... Trunks...
Careful out there...

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.724
Don't go doing
anything foolish, okay?

00:19:22.758 --> 00:19:24.093
Yeah... Krillin's right...

00:19:24.127 --> 00:19:25.730
I mean... we're gonna
need you in one piece

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:29.304
when the time comes to go
toe-to-toe with those androids.

00:19:29.739 --> 00:19:32.511
Right... Well, I'm off.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:11.756
