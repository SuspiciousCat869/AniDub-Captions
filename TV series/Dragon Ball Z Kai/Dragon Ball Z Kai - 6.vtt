Do you?.. You're not following
me are you?

00:15:02.304 --> 00:15:06.278
Okay, lets try something else.
Just as high as you can.

00:15:12.057 --> 00:15:13.425
Man. It's no use..

00:15:13.526 --> 00:15:16.231
I can barely
get myself off the ground!

00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:20.339
[Kai] Ten times his own planet's
gravity and he can still jump

00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:24.949
that high? Impressive.. This guy
shows some promise.

00:16:12.343 --> 00:16:14.114
<i>[Kai] Before we begin,</i>

00:16:14.214 --> 00:16:16.151
<i>I'll need to work out
your training regimen.</i>

00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:19.525
<i>How long do you plan
on staying here?</i>

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:22.898
Well.. I'm not sure how many
days I was on Snake Way,

00:16:22.998 --> 00:16:24.434
but I don't think I have
that much time..

00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:27.407
See.. the Saiyans are on
their way to my planet.

00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:30.279
When they get there, everyone I
know is in a lot of trouble..

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.685
Nobody on Earth is powerful
enough to stand up to them..

00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:35.924
So.. that's why I need to
spend every single second

00:16:36.025 --> 00:16:38.028
I have left training
to beat them!

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:40.667
The Saiyans, huh?..
They're a nasty bunch.

00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:45.309
I sure wouldn't want to tangle
with them... (hm hm) No sir...

00:16:45.409 --> 00:16:48.282
But we still need to know
how much time you have..

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:50.419
Let me check and see where
the Saiyans are now.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.316
<i>[Kai] No doubt about
it. That's them alright.</i>

00:17:08.088 --> 00:17:10.292
Judging by their speed
and current location,

00:17:10.392 --> 00:17:12.998
I'd say they're due to
arrive on Earth in...

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:14.802
One hundred and
fifty eight days.

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:18.041
That soon?!.. But how could you
possibly be able to tell that?

00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:20.514
These antennae get all
the channels, baby!..

00:17:20.614 --> 00:17:22.684
Like a TV?.. Get it?

00:17:22.784 --> 00:17:24.889
[laughing]

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:27.794
I just couldn't
help being funny!

00:17:31.703 --> 00:17:34.909
If you don't have a sense of
humor...I will not train you.

00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:39.318
[laughing] Oh, I get it now!

00:17:39.418 --> 00:17:40.386
Good.

00:17:40.486 --> 00:17:42.256
But.. If you're sure
they'll get to Earth

00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:43.559
in a hundred and
fifty eight days,

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.263
I don't have enough
time!.. Do I?

00:17:45.363 --> 00:17:47.433
Well.. I'd like more..

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:49.438
but I still think we'll
be able to make it work.

00:17:49.539 --> 00:17:50.574
Really?

00:17:50.674 --> 00:17:52.343
Think of it this way,
it's like the gravity..

00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:55.383
Everything is multiplied here..
One hundred fifty-eight days

00:17:55.483 --> 00:17:57.921
with me is worth years of
training back on Earth.

00:17:58.021 --> 00:17:58.923
That's awesome!

00:17:59.023 --> 00:18:00.293
However...

00:18:00.393 --> 00:18:02.531
Even the best training
doesn't guarantee

00:18:02.631 --> 00:18:04.768
that you'll beat the Saiyans..
Just know that now...

00:18:04.868 --> 00:18:08.008
In particular, the two who are
on their way to Earth are among

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:11.015
the strongest and most ruthless
warriors in the universe...

00:18:11.115 --> 00:18:12.517
To be perfectly frank..

00:18:12.617 --> 00:18:15.289
these Saiyans are even
more powerful than me.

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:17.995
They are?...Are you kidding?!

00:18:18.095 --> 00:18:19.497
No, not this time.

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.803
If you're to stand any
chance of beating them...

00:18:21.903 --> 00:18:23.874
that means your powers
will have to surpass mine

00:18:23.974 --> 00:18:27.179
by the time you leave here...
Your work's cut out for you!

00:18:30.554 --> 00:18:33.225
Well.. I suppose we
should get started.

00:18:33.326 --> 00:18:36.431
Bubbles!.. Come over
here, please!

00:18:40.005 --> 00:18:42.209
[monkey sounds]

00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:46.586
First thing's first...

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:49.592
<i>You'll need to get accustomed
to the increased gravity here.</i>

00:18:49.692 --> 00:18:52.732
<i>So your first exercise
is to catch Bubbles.</i>

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:55.436
<i>I'll warn you, you'll have to
be quick; he's pretty spry.</i>

00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:57.407
<i>If you can't at least do that,</i>

00:18:57.508 --> 00:18:59.946
<i>you might as well
just give up now.</i>

00:19:00.046 --> 00:19:02.250
<i>Sure...Whatever you say.</i>

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.624
<i>Okay, Bubbles.. Get moving!</i>

00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:10.533
Wait! Slow.. down!

00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:22.691
<i>[Goku] Stupid monkey!
This is impossible!</i>

00:19:25.162 --> 00:19:26.665
<i>Stop!</i>

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.374
Okay...That's it!

00:19:33.212 --> 00:19:35.416
You're goin' down!

00:19:41.696 --> 00:19:48.744
That's better. I'm.. so..
gonna.. catch.. you!

00:19:48.844 --> 00:19:51.148
<i>[Kai] I didn't realize
he was already</i>

00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:52.918
<i>wearing weighted training gear!</i>

00:19:55.858 --> 00:19:58.529
There's no way you're gonna
get away from me this time!

00:20:03.271 --> 00:20:06.679
<i>[Narrator] And so, at long
last, Goku's intense physical</i>

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:09.685
<i>training has begun! Will he
ever be able to overcome</i>

00:20:09.785 --> 00:20:12.525
<i>the ten-times gravity on
this tiny little planet?..</i>

00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:14.995
<i>Or will his training with
King Kai come to an end</i>

00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:18.903
<i>almost as quickly as it
started? Only time will tell.</i>

00:20:19.003 --> 00:20:22.476
<i>But time is running out! One
hundred fifty eight days remain</i>

00:20:22.577 --> 00:20:24.582
<i>until the Saiyans
reach planet Earth...</i>

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:28.556
<i>The clock is ticking--next
Dragon Ball Z Kai!</i>
