[Narrator] Last
Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:06.379
Danger closed in upon Planet
Namek from the skies above--

00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:09.452
Frieza's reinforcements!
And with time running out,

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.326
Krillin, Vegeta, and Gohan
forged an uneasy alliance.

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:16.466
Elsewhere, Frieza stood by,
as his most elite team

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:19.739
of warriors made their
grand entrance.

00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:24.281
We are the Ginyu Force!

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:04.148
[Frieza] Ah, yes,
well done Ginyus...

00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:07.154
A pleasure to
see you, as always.

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.226
Thank you, Lord Frieza.
We always aim to please...

00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:13.099
I assume you have a special
mission in mind for us?

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.738
That traitor Vegeta has
stolen and run off with

00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:16.907
the Dragon Balls that I've been

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:19.345
working ever
so hard to collect.

00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:24.422
Your "mission," is to
find him, subdue him,

00:02:24.488 --> 00:02:26.660
and then bring him to
me. Then we'll see

00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:29.365
if I can't "persuade" him to
tell me where he's hidden them.

00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:32.337
Ah, well if that's all it
is, it's as good as done.

00:02:32.404 --> 00:02:34.643
Our scouters are already
tracking his location.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.280
He's actually on the move
not too far from here.

00:02:37.347 --> 00:02:39.552
And in a hurry from
the looks of it.

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.593
Is there something wrong?

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.532
It seems Vegeta's not
traveling alone...

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.134
He has two others with him,

00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:49.572
both with fairly substantial
power levels...

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.213
Really...? Ah... it must be
those same little pests

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.649
who interfered with us before..

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:57.054
So they have been working
together all this time.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.323
What do we do with them?

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.960
I don't care. Have fun.

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:04.702
As you wish... They should make
good sport for my men.

00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:07.408
Lord Frieza,
we brought those new

00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:09.279
top-of-the-line scouters
you ask for...

00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:10.782
Good. Excellent work.

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:18.329
It's Showtime, men!

Hut-hut-hut!

Ginyu! Force!

00:03:32.992 --> 00:03:34.996
Yeah!

00:03:41.844 --> 00:03:44.248
[Vegeta] The Ginyus
are on the move...

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:50.426
And they're gaining...!
Hurry! There's no time!

00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:58.878
[Computer] Now beginning final
approach to Planet Namek...

00:03:58.944 --> 00:04:00.948
Touchdown in twenty minutes.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.408
It was nice of King Kai to
send me some new clothes,

00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:16.880
but he didn't need
to send this many!

00:04:16.947 --> 00:04:21.322
So there's someone even stronger
than Vegeta down there...

00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:24.361
Hang on, guys... I'm coming.

00:04:29.272 --> 00:04:30.842
Ten more minutes.

00:04:30.908 --> 00:04:34.215
Strange, though... I don't
feel scared or nervous...

00:04:34.282 --> 00:04:35.918
If anything, I'm
perfectly calm...

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:40.060
I know what's waiting for
me, but still I feel...

00:04:40.127 --> 00:04:41.830
I feel nothing.

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:43.634
Maybe training in all
that intense gravity

00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:45.905
knocked a screw
loose or something.

00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:52.785
They're right down there!

00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:57.060
Now they're mine!

00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:05.110
Hello, Vegeta.

00:05:05.176 --> 00:05:05.912
Hi mate.

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.916
Long time no see.

00:05:07.983 --> 00:05:10.988
[Group laughter]

00:05:11.823 --> 00:05:15.463
Damn it...! A few more steps
and we were there!

00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:20.809
I don't suppose that would
be a Dragon Ball...

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:22.477
you're holding there?

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:27.755
An' lookee here...
We got five more just like it.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.031
Seems we've made
quite the score.

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:33.600
Frieza should be pleased...

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.838
The idea is to collect seven of
these things, is that right...?

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:37.943
So, we've got five,
you've got two...

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.750
I'm no mathematician, but I'd
say that adds up nicely.

00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:50.200
[group laughter]

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:52.470
You are a genius.

00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:56.947
[Krillin] Vegeta wasn't
kidding--

00:05:57.014 --> 00:05:59.218
I wouldn't last two seconds
against these guys!

00:05:59.285 --> 00:06:01.021
Their power's incredible!

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:05.598
This guy in front--

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:08.136
his power makes the rest
of 'em seem like kittens!

00:06:09.138 --> 00:06:11.810
What...! You think I'm just
going to hand this over?

00:06:11.877 --> 00:06:13.145
Forget it!

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.156
[Krillin] Well, this
one doesn't seem

00:06:18.223 --> 00:06:19.659
like he's all that
tough, at least.

00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:22.665
So, how'd he get mixed in with
the rest of these brutes?

00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:28.009
Stay back...! I can't handle
your stench.

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:30.981
Why you--!

00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:35.356
Don't try and get
greedy on us, Guldo...

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:39.431
I don't think we ever decided
this was your kill, now did we?

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:44.041
Look, Vegeta, just
give us the ball...

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:46.312
We're still gonna kill ya no
matter what you do,

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:49.519
so how 'bout it...?
Be a sport.

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:52.726
Question...! These fancy
new scouters of yours,

00:06:52.792 --> 00:06:56.065
they aren't equipped to track
Dragon Balls, are they?

00:06:56.132 --> 00:06:57.467
What if they're not?

00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:01.008
Then-- you lose!

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:28.898
Welcome back.

00:07:28.964 --> 00:07:29.800
Miss me?

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:30.868
Wha--?!

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:34.241
[group laughter]

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.486
H- How can...
anyone be that fast?

00:07:42.224 --> 00:07:44.495
I suppose you thought you
were being clever...?

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:47.702
I guess you forgot... When
it comes to raw speed,

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:50.206
Burter is the fastest
in the universe.

00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:55.150
Now then... The other one.

00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:56.786
Destroy it!

00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:06.639
Wait, where'd it go?

00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:14.756
What the--?

00:08:14.823 --> 00:08:17.061
So, it seems the rumors
are true after all.

00:08:17.127 --> 00:08:19.232
What are you talking about?
What rumors?

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:20.768
That fat little blob...

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:23.974
somehow, he has the power to
slow down or stop time at will!

00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:26.546
[laughing]

00:08:27.682 --> 00:08:29.351
But that's... impossible.

00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:31.890
Don't be so sure there, buddy.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.535
Now that we've got that
business out of the way...

00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:39.773
I say it's time we
had some fun...

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:42.410
Let's show our friends
here a good time.

00:08:42.477 --> 00:08:43.948
And when he says
"a good time"...

00:08:44.015 --> 00:08:45.751
he doesn't mean we're
gonna play dress-up

00:08:45.818 --> 00:08:47.522
and braid each other's
hair... uh-uh...

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:49.859
He means we're
gonna murder you!

00:08:49.926 --> 00:08:51.730
Did you really need
to explain that!

00:08:51.796 --> 00:08:54.267
So what now...? Are we really
gonna fight these guys?

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:56.573
I think you've already seen
that we can't outrun them...

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.411
It's best that we
all stand together.

00:08:59.478 --> 00:09:00.948
From what I saw of your
abilities on Earth,

00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:02.819
I doubt the two of you
will be worth much.

00:09:02.886 --> 00:09:04.622
But it's better than nothing.

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:06.760
I'll take Vegeta myself...

00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:08.730
The rest of you can do
rock-paper-scissors

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:11.368
or something to figure out who
gets the two little ones.

00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:14.743
--Awwww please,
--Be real Captain, you gotta
be kidding! We always get stuck

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.713
--that's so dumb!
--with the little guys.
It's not fair!

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.784
You took all the good
kills last time, too!

00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:20.988
C'mon, it's our turn
to have some fun!

00:09:21.055 --> 00:09:24.596
Fine... Fair is fair...
In that case...

00:09:24.662 --> 00:09:26.767
I'll take the Dragon Balls
back to Lord Frieza,

00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:28.102
and explain the situation...

00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:30.774
You boys can sort the
rest out on your own.

00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.077
Woo-hoo! All right!

00:09:32.144 --> 00:09:34.214
Who's the greatest captain
in the universe?!

00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:36.953
You...! Ginyu rules!

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:42.231
Okay, then the winner will get
Vegeta...And for second place...

00:09:42.297 --> 00:09:44.669
The rest... Make 'em a set.

00:09:46.372 --> 00:09:48.109
Good...let's go.

00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:49.646
Ginyus ready!

00:09:49.712 --> 00:09:55.958
Rock, paper, scissors!
Tie! Go again...!

00:09:56.024 --> 00:09:59.130
Are you sure we shouldn't
try to run away now?

00:10:05.812 --> 00:10:09.184
Yeah!.. I win!
I get Vegeta! (ha ha!)

00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:11.021
And I get the runts.

00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:14.161
Oh well... It's better than
nothing though, right?

00:10:14.228 --> 00:10:15.296
I'll tell ya what Guldo...

00:10:15.363 --> 00:10:18.770
Once I've had my fun,
you can finish 'em off.

00:10:24.849 --> 00:10:26.486
Now if you'll excuse me,

00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:30.861
Lord Frieza has a date
with immortality.

00:10:30.928 --> 00:10:32.799
No...! I won't let you have 'em!

00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:35.403
Calm down...! You can't afford
to waste your energy...

00:10:35.469 --> 00:10:38.242
Let him go for now, and focus
on beating these goons.

00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:41.716
We have to get past them
before anything else.

00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:46.593
You...Come here a minute.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.130
Aw, look...
They're makin' a plan.

00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:55.210
Don't let Guldo's ridiculous
looks fool you...

00:10:55.277 --> 00:10:56.378
He lacks power,

00:10:56.445 --> 00:10:58.216
but his psychic abilities
will make him dangerous.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:00.020
So keep your guard up.

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:01.389
Right.

00:11:01.456 --> 00:11:03.961
Now, is it true that you came
to this planet on your own?

00:11:04.028 --> 00:11:05.397
Kakarot didn't come with you?

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:08.971
No, just us... But he is on his
way. He'll be here soon.

00:11:09.038 --> 00:11:11.743
Soon isn't good enough...!
We need him here now...!

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.947
As much as I can't stand him,

00:11:14.014 --> 00:11:17.020
having him with us would
help even the odds.

00:11:17.087 --> 00:11:18.824
[Gohan] Why did we ever come
to this planet?

00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:20.794
Nothing's gone the way
we thought it would.

00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:22.196
We couldn't get
the Dragon Balls,

00:11:22.263 --> 00:11:24.703
and now some bad guy's about
to get eternal life...!

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.240
We can't just let
'em win, can we?!

00:11:36.526 --> 00:11:40.801
So who's first... Here, Guldo,
why don't you take the honors?

00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:43.005
Right... You just want me
to clear out the runts

00:11:43.072 --> 00:11:47.113
so the big boys can play...
Some honor. Thanks buddy.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.155
Quit messing around, and let's
get this over with!

00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:52.525
Hey Gohan...

00:11:52.592 --> 00:11:54.763
You remember that image training
we did back on the spaceship?

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:57.100
Yeah... I'm with you.

00:11:57.166 --> 00:11:58.436
Aww, well...

00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:00.974
This should at least be fun for
a second or two, I guess...

00:12:03.345 --> 00:12:04.949
Okay. Ready?

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.581
Fire it up! Now!

00:12:20.647 --> 00:12:24.889
[screaming]

00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:33.238
Uh... What just happened?

00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:42.490
You wish.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.129
Freeze!

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.651
[Guldo] Lousy punks... They're
gone!

00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:57.453
W-Where are they...?

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:03.834
Ha...! Now I see
'em! Over there!

00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:06.472
They got pretty far.
Quick little buggers.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:13.953
Ok now I just... damn it...
I'm running out of breath...!

00:13:24.642 --> 00:13:25.944
Well, whadda ya
know 'bout that...

00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:28.851
Guess they've got some
fight in 'em after all.

00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:32.558
Yeah... They're reading
much higher now...

00:13:32.624 --> 00:13:35.096
Looks like they can raise and
lower their power levels

00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:37.568
without transforming.
What a weird species.

00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:41.141
You got some freaky little
friends there, huh, Vegeta!

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:44.080
Unbelievable... Their speed
and power are worlds beyond

00:13:44.147 --> 00:13:47.555
what they were when I fought
them back on Earth... but...

00:13:47.622 --> 00:13:49.925
Nice moves there, Gohan...
Wow... It's like you're

00:13:49.992 --> 00:13:52.163
just gettin' stronger by the
minute there, aren't ya.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.666
Well, I don't know about that,

00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:56.405
but the power-up I got from the
Grand Elder sure did help!

00:13:56.472 --> 00:13:57.575
Still though...

00:13:57.642 --> 00:13:59.477
I'm not as fast as this
guy--he's way over there!

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:01.883
Yeah, he must've done
that time-stop thing...

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.152
Let's go again!

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:04.487
Right!

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.401
Th-They disappeared!

00:14:17.514 --> 00:14:19.217
Stop!

00:14:22.256 --> 00:14:23.927
Time Freeze!

00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:30.574
Gah! They were right on top of
me damn it!

00:14:32.143 --> 00:14:34.849
Wait a second. Why in
the heck am I running?

00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:36.687
I can take care of both
of 'em right now--

00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:38.489
starting with that brat kid!

00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:52.317
Oh crap!

00:14:52.383 --> 00:14:53.653
Over there!

00:14:54.956 --> 00:14:59.164
Ka..me..ha..me..Ha!!

00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:02.370
[explosions]

00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:06.445
We missed...! Damn it, we
almost had him that time!

00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:11.723
C'mon, get it together Guldo!

00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:13.192
Stop messing around...!

00:15:13.258 --> 00:15:15.463
For real, you're starting
to make us look bad!

00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:17.802
Yeah...! He's Right...!
You stink...!

00:15:17.869 --> 00:15:19.805
If you can't beat these little
pests then we're gonna have

00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:22.745
to give some serious thought
to kickin' you off the team!

00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:24.114
At the very least,

00:15:24.181 --> 00:15:26.418
we'll make you sit at the
kiddie table for lunch!

00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:30.861
W-Wait...! They caught me by
surprise, that's all...!

00:15:30.928 --> 00:15:32.097
But now that I
know their moves,

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:33.566
I'm gonna finish 'em
both off, right now!

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:37.608
There... He's distracted...
Now's our chance, Gohan!

00:15:37.674 --> 00:15:38.676
Right!

00:15:40.112 --> 00:15:42.083
Whoa! Here they come!

00:15:44.187 --> 00:15:48.061
Shaa...! Time to bust out
my secret weapon!

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:54.174
[yelling]

00:16:04.395 --> 00:16:07.233
[Krillin] W-What happened? Why'd
we stop?

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.073
[Gohan] I-I can't move! It's
like I'm frozen!

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:14.047
[laughing] That's my Paralysis
Spell...!

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:17.386
You're not gonna move
'til I decide to let you go.

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:26.404
Looks like all that fire you
had before just went out...

00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:28.075
Whoop-see!

00:16:35.122 --> 00:16:37.360
[laughing] Guldo must really be
feelin' the pressure

00:16:37.427 --> 00:16:39.699
if he's bustin' out the big
guns... He hardly ever

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:42.538
uses his paralysis trick
unless he gets in trouble.

00:16:42.604 --> 00:16:45.142
And against these little wimps.
No doubt.

00:16:45.209 --> 00:16:47.313
[laughing] Now I'm gonna show
you what happens

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.585
when you embarrass me
in front of the boys.

00:16:49.985 --> 00:16:55.630
[screaming]

00:17:04.682 --> 00:17:06.652
[laughing]

00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:15.537
[screaming]

00:17:16.038 --> 00:17:18.041
[laughing]

00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:25.557
[Guldo] Uh-oh! Here comes a
big ol' scary stick!

00:17:25.624 --> 00:17:28.563
You better move out of the way
or you're gonna get skewered!

00:17:30.332 --> 00:17:32.537
C'mon hurry--
it's getting closer!

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:36.411
[struggling]

00:17:36.612 --> 00:17:39.919
[Vegeta] Idiots...
What were they thinking?

00:17:39.986 --> 00:17:41.823
Even after I told
them how dangerous

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.192
Guldo's psychic powers were...

00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:45.196
they still went charging
in like fools!

00:17:45.262 --> 00:17:48.169
Hey...! What's the
matter...?! Do something...!

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:49.605
It's not even moving fast--

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:52.811
are you really gonna let it
get you? How embarrassing!

00:17:54.715 --> 00:17:57.153
Oh, what's that you say...?
You still can't move...?

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.560
Aww... Then I guess one of
you's just gonna get stuck--

00:18:00.627 --> 00:18:02.397
how 'bout you in the
orange jumpsuit...

00:18:02.464 --> 00:18:04.602
I'll think of something
even more ridiculous

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:06.071
to finish the kid.

00:18:06.171 --> 00:18:08.577
[struggling]

00:18:08.644 --> 00:18:12.417
Hey Gohan... If you're gonna
break loose, now'd be the time!

00:18:12.484 --> 00:18:16.626
Sorry, I can't...! My whole
body's still frozen stiff!

00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:19.732
[laughing]

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:21.502
Here it comes!

00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:27.179
[lightning sound]

00:18:30.554 --> 00:18:32.090
Whoa! Close one!

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.195
[gurgling]

00:18:42.544 --> 00:18:47.754
[gurgling]

00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:50.527
Damn it, Vegeta. No fair!

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:55.537
This... This was
supposed to be a fight

00:18:55.604 --> 00:18:58.743
between me and those
runts. Just us!

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.316
I believe those were your rules.
I never agreed to follow them.

00:19:02.383 --> 00:19:05.489
All is fair in war, Guldo.
You should know that by now.

00:19:05.557 --> 00:19:08.162
[gasp] Never would I have
guessed I'd go down like this...

00:19:08.229 --> 00:19:11.536
...not in a million years.
Killed by a damn saiyan.

00:19:11.603 --> 00:19:13.439
Oh this really is embarrassing.

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:16.044
[Vegeta] Well you won't have to
feel that way for long.

00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:17.480
[screams]

00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:21.254
[explosion]

00:19:23.392 --> 00:19:26.933
Can't believe I'm saying this
but, we owe you one, Vegeta.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.536
Yeah, thanks.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.874
Dhh. Keep your thanks.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.447
Do you think I care whether the
two of you live or die?

00:19:34.515 --> 00:19:36.686
I saw an opportunity to
strike, and I took it.

00:19:36.753 --> 00:19:40.560
It's that simple. Saving you
had nothing to do with it.

00:19:40.627 --> 00:19:44.167
Now, pull yourselves
together... This isn't over...

00:19:44.234 --> 00:19:46.539
and we won't get
lucky a second time.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.747
What tha hell?!
You seeing this?!

00:19:50.814 --> 00:19:53.118
Damn Guldo went
and got himself killed!

00:19:53.185 --> 00:19:55.423
Whoa... This is bad!

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.293
Yeah, right, without Guldo...

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.532
that means our trademark
Ginyu Force fighting pose

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:01.702
is gonna be all outta whack!

00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:09.718
Recoome!

00:20:10.887 --> 00:20:12.490
Burter!

00:20:13.826 --> 00:20:15.496
Jeice!

00:20:16.464 --> 00:20:22.243
We are the Ginyu Force!

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.215
Yup... I knew it,
the balance is all off...

00:20:25.282 --> 00:20:27.353
The Captain's not gonna
be happy about this...

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.257
We worked real hard
on that pose...

00:20:29.324 --> 00:20:31.996
Now he's gonna have to
come up with a new one!

00:20:32.062 --> 00:20:33.498
That's later...! Right now,

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.469
we need to pick who's
gonna step in for Guldo

00:20:35.537 --> 00:20:37.273
and finish off these
little runts.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.377
I still got Vegeta.

00:20:39.444 --> 00:20:42.049
All right, Jeice! You n' me!
Rock-paper-scissors!

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:42.984
You're on!

00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:44.253
And... go!

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:50.432
Rock, paper, scissors! Tie!
Go again...! Tie! Go again...!

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:52.671
Crazy... What's with
these guys...?

00:20:52.738 --> 00:20:54.542
It's all just one
big game to them.

00:20:54.609 --> 00:20:57.548
Yeah, I think that's the part
that scares me most of all.

00:20:57.615 --> 00:21:03.726
Tie! Go again...! Tie! Go
again...! Tie! Go again...!

00:21:03.793 --> 00:21:06.999
I have a feeling the real hell
is about to begin.

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:13.345
[Narrator] Goku's arrival on
Namek is but moments away.

00:21:13.412 --> 00:21:15.684
However, waiting for him
on the planet below

00:21:15.751 --> 00:21:18.623
is an enemy unlike
any other--Frieza,

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.664
the most ruthless tyrant the
universe has ever known.

00:21:22.731 --> 00:21:23.966
Elsewhere,

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:25.804
Krillin and Gohan prepare for
the fight of their lives.

00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:29.645
Can they withstand the onslaught
of Burter, Jeice, and Recoome?

00:21:29.712 --> 00:21:33.853
Their struggle continues,
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:22:38.215 --> 00:22:39.685
[Goku] Hey, it's me, Goku!

00:22:39.752 --> 00:22:41.454
Sorry to keep you
waiting, guys.

00:22:41.522 --> 00:22:43.860
Just hold on a few more
minutes and I'll be there.

00:22:43.927 --> 00:22:46.064
[Krillin] This Recoome
guy is a real monster!

00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:48.435
I don't even know if Vegeta
can stand up to him!

00:22:48.502 --> 00:22:49.939
[Gohan] You can do it, Vegeta!

00:22:50.006 --> 00:22:53.613
Don't let him beat you! You
show that big bully who's boss!

00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:56.585
[Goku] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:59.692 --> 00:23:01.195
[Krillin] What is with
these Ginyu creeps?

00:23:01.261 --> 00:23:03.398
They're totally insane!
