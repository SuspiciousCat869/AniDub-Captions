it seemed that

an easy victory over
the vicious Saibamen, until...

Y'know, I gotta admit,

I like that guy a heckuva lot

live for now...

you want with him.

back to life once before...

realize how pointless it is

to try and battle a Saiyan,

longer before Goku gets here...

And I know exactly
how to do it...

00:22:49.103 --> 00:22:50.139
[GOKU]
I'm coming, guys!

00:22:50.172 --> 00:22:51.341
I'm almost there now,

00:22:51.374 --> 00:22:53.245
and I promise I'm moving
as fast as I can!

00:22:53.278 --> 00:22:56.351
Next time on
Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:56.384 --> 00:22:57.954
"Will Goku Make it In Time?!

00:22:57.988 --> 00:23:00.660
Three Hours Until
the Battle Resumes!"

00:23:00.693 --> 00:23:03.398
