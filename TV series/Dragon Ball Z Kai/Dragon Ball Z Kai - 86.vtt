the Dragon Balls?

I seemed pretty certain

00:10:20.073 --> 00:10:23.279

for this kind of thing.

that was it!

you the a-okay...

have the new Dragon Balls

00:10:35.003 --> 00:10:36.740

If the old
Dragon Balls still exist,

00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:51.335
then all I need is a model
of the Earth Dragon Shenron...

00:10:51.368 --> 00:10:53.306

working again right away!

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.273
have they power
to grant three wishes,

00:11:10.306 --> 00:11:11.910

00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:12.645
Sure.

While you re at it, Dende...

00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:16.085
Can you work on something
where a single wish

00:11:16.118 --> 00:11:19.091
is able to bring back
more than one person at a time?

00:11:19.124 --> 00:11:21.295
For instance,
Restore all the people

00:11:21.329 --> 00:11:23.800
who were absorbed by Cell.

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:25.537
Yes... It s nothing
the Dragon Balls

00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:27.140
can t be made to do
as long as I know

00:11:27.174 --> 00:11:29.144
about it going
into the process...

00:11:29.178 --> 00:11:32.217
but the total number of wishes
is going to drop down to two.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.323
Huh...? That s really
the only down-side?

00:11:35.356 --> 00:11:36.392
Uh-huh.

00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:37.695

Cell is stronger than he is
and that he doesn t know

00:14:02.952 --> 00:14:07.260
if he can win... So then...
why is he so relaxed?

more than what you guys know...

I dunno... if he s telling you
to look forward to it,

00:14:17.582 --> 00:14:18.784
then he must have some

waiting to show off.

Goku... there s something you
need to know going into this.

00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:50.012
So you how we, uh...
how we asked Dende

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:51.381
to set up the Dragon Balls

00:19:51.415 --> 00:19:53.787
to bring a bunch of
people back with just one wish?

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.688
Yeah.

00:19:54.722 --> 00:19:56.726
Well it turns out...
by doing that...

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:59.131
means it won t work for people
like us who ve already

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:01.335
been wished back before.

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.671
I m very sorry...

00:20:02.704 --> 00:20:03.807
I should have
thought to mention

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.844
that right at the beginning.

00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:09.819
Hey, don t beat yourself
up about it, Dende...

00:20:09.852 --> 00:20:12.223
As long as we don t
get defeated, we ll be fine!

00:20:12.256 --> 00:20:13.693
[KRILLIN] How do
we pull that off?!

00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:15.597
[KRILLIN] This is Cell
we re talking about!

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.435
We ll be fine--
you ll see... Now come on...

00:20:18.469 --> 00:20:21.307
It s almost time
for the tournament.

We decided to tag along...

00:20:47.026 --> 00:20:50.968
Not to fight, but we figured
we d lend some moral support.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:53.438
Thanks... We ll take it.

00:20:58.115 --> 00:21:01.454
