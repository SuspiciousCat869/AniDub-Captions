[Narrator]
Last Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.781
Krillin and Bulma stood shocked
as Vegeta settled the score

00:00:06.847 --> 00:00:08.551
with Zarbon,

00:00:08.618 --> 00:00:11.657
I was just...
fo-following orders...

00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:13.828
I... beg you... mercy...

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:15.932
After all the years
of being spat on and taunted

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.437
by you, I'm expected
to show you mercy?

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:21.108
Together... we could
prevail over Frieza...

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.536
♪ Opening Song

00:01:37.294 --> 00:01:39.566
If defeating Frieza were just
a matter of teaming up,

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:42.505
it'd be too easy.
Bet on it...

00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:47.481
Well... There's no telling
how you managed to do it,

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.786
but I'd say someone upped
the scales on his powers

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:51.557
since last we met...

00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:55.164
Be that as it may, you're
still no match for me.

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.334
Now, that Dragon Ball...
Are you going to

00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:59.405
hand it over quietly
without making a scene?

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:01.476
Or are you going
to play the hero?

00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:03.346
Yeah... I'm guessing
it's pretty stupid

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:05.417
to try and strike a bargain
with a guy like you...

00:02:05.484 --> 00:02:07.355
but if I hand this over
do I have your word

00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:09.425
that you'll leave us alone?

00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:11.764
You want to strike a
bargain with me...?

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:14.603
How civilized... Well,
I suppose as long as

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.241
I get what I'm after, there's no
sense in wasting any more time.

00:02:17.308 --> 00:02:18.811
You... You really mean it?

00:02:18.877 --> 00:02:21.684
Don't press your luck...
Quickly... Put the Dragon Ball

00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:24.756
in my hands before I
have a change of heart.

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.772
No... Krillin...

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.912
Today's your lucky day, runt.
Having all seven of these

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:38.684
puts me in a very
forgiving mood indeed...

00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:41.289
But I guess the knowledge that
I'm about to rule the universe

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:43.594
in Frieza's place would
have that effect.

00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:46.432
That, and of course,
immortality.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.804
[laughing]

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:59.258
Not to rub salt on your wounds
or anything... But you, uh...

00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:02.331
...well, you kind of blew it,
huh...? You'd think you'd be

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:03.968
a little more reluctant
to hand something over

00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:06.840
you'd gone to so much
trouble to get.

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:10.447
Exactly what choice did I have
but to hand it over to him...?

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:12.819
He would have killed us both
if I'd tried to resist...

00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:14.589
You know he would've.

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:18.496
Still... Trust me... It's not
so bad... We've still got

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.235
an ace in the hole. Don't
forget about the Dragon Ball

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:23.807
Gohan's looking for...
Vegeta had it first

00:03:23.874 --> 00:03:25.545
but he must've tucked it
away somewhere to keep

00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:27.214
Frieza and his goons
from finding it...

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:28.984
If we get that one...
we're still in the clear.

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.523
Oh...yeah...Yeah! You're
right...! Gohan will have

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.395
totally found it by now...! He's
got the radar...! It's funny,

00:03:34.461 --> 00:03:36.900
I hadn't even thought of
that...! Ha! The kid's probably

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.606
headed back here with
the goods as we speak!

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:42.546
Probably, yeah...
But... Let's just hope

00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:43.981
they don't cross paths.

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.429
[shock]

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:54.035
Whoa! Something's headed
straight for me!

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:56.506
And... It's... powerful...!

00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:04.054
[shock] No!

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:08.764
I'm sensing another power level
somewhere close by.

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:15.512
[thinking] I have to
conceal my energy...

00:04:15.578 --> 00:04:18.182
Hmm. It just disappeared...
How the...?

00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:21.623
Is my mind playing tricks on me?

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:33.581
Come on. Just ignore
it and go away.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:36.754
[Vegeta] Wherever you're hiding,
come out now...! It's no use

00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:38.624
trying to pull one over on me.

00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:40.762
Step out from whatever rock
you're cowering behind

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:43.534
or I'll reduce this
whole area to rubble!

00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.604
Would he really do that?!

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.812
What's wrong...? Scared, huh?

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.719
I dunno. I think I might
have to go out and face him.

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:54.723
Still, I know what
Krillin would say...

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.893
Gohan...
You've got to play it safe...

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.897
Vegeta could
crush you like a bug.

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:00.968
What if it's the only
way I can keep Vegeta

00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:03.841
from getting his hands
on another Dragon Ball?

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:07.949
[Vegeta] So you
still believe you can

00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:10.086
hide from me, is that it...?

00:05:10.153 --> 00:05:12.157
Well, we'll just see then.

00:05:12.626 --> 00:05:14.195
[electric sounds]

00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.531
[gasp]

00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:21.676
This is it...! Your last chance!
[laughing] And then I fire!

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:24.115
AHHHH--

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:25.584
Wait!!!

00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:32.298
Please, just don't
let him find this.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:34.167
There. Happy now?

00:05:35.972 --> 00:05:37.842
[laughing]

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:54.008
Well, it's Kakarot's
brat... (heh)...

00:05:54.075 --> 00:05:57.615
Can't say I expected that...
Quite the surprise.

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:01.757
I suppose you tagged along with
the other Earthlings, eh...?

00:06:01.824 --> 00:06:04.897
I already had the pleasure
of bumping into them...

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:07.601
Oh no!

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:10.140
How'd you get your hands...
on that?

00:06:10.207 --> 00:06:13.346
[heh] Oh, this? Just a token
of friendship...

00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:16.720
They were so happy to see me,
they gave it to me as a gift.

00:06:16.787 --> 00:06:22.097
You monster...! You... You
killed my friends... didn't you?

00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:24.936
No. But I'm more than happy
to go back and do so

00:06:25.003 --> 00:06:27.274
if that's what you like...

00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:29.779
As a matter of fact...
Out of sheer joy

00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:32.786
at being the proud new owner
of all seven Dragon Balls...

00:06:32.853 --> 00:06:34.388
I let them live...

00:06:36.794 --> 00:06:39.866
So... you've finally
got what you came for.

00:06:44.743 --> 00:06:46.179
[flying sounds]

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:47.515
[shock]

00:06:47.582 --> 00:06:50.220
So...What's that contraption
you've got in your hand there?

00:06:50.287 --> 00:06:54.629
Ah, it's...Nothing...!
It's a clock!

00:06:54.696 --> 00:06:56.967
Just a clock? You mean
to tell me a civilization

00:06:57.034 --> 00:06:59.038
capable of interstellar
flight can't keep time

00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:01.175
on something smaller than that?

00:07:01.242 --> 00:07:02.879
Well maybe we like it that way!

00:07:02.946 --> 00:07:05.183
Of course... Speaking
of interstellar flight,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.385
is Kakarot here?

00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:09.058
No he's not...! We came
without him. We didn't know

00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:11.296
there'd be bad guys
like you on this planet.

00:07:11.362 --> 00:07:12.464
[chuckling]

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:15.036
[Vegeta] So I'm a "bad guy,"
huh?

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:17.775
[laughing]

00:07:18.944 --> 00:07:22.986
All the same...
It's a pity he's not here.

00:07:23.052 --> 00:07:24.789
We three... We're special...

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:28.964
The last of our kind,
in fact... Aren't we...?

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:35.443
Pay attention... I want you to
relay a message to him for me.

00:07:40.486 --> 00:07:41.356
HAA!!

00:07:41.422 --> 00:07:43.860
[shrieking]

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:48.102
Listening now... Yes? Very
good...Tell him I'll be paying

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:51.008
Earth another visit soon...
But that this time,

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:53.747
there won't be a happy ending.

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:56.252
Now then... I think you're
overdue for a naptime...

00:07:56.318 --> 00:07:58.256
You seem a bit grouchy.

00:07:58.323 --> 00:08:01.161
Run along back home now,
why don't you.

00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:03.399
[laughing]

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.688
Well...That wasn't fun...

00:08:13.754 --> 00:08:20.099
...Still... The Dragon Ball
is safe and sound.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:20.802

[struggling]

00:09:04.822 --> 00:09:08.897
Yeah. I think that definitely
calls for a senzu bean...

00:09:17.681 --> 00:09:20.621
Okay...That time was a little
too close for comfort.

00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:23.092
I've got to be more careful...
Don't want all that

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:25.564
intense training to
go to waste now, right?

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:28.469
Just two more days until
I get there... Well...

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:31.408
That's two more days I can train
like there's no tomorrow...

C'mon... Where is he?

00:09:39.058 --> 00:09:40.661
[gasping] Is Gohan coming...?

00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:43.333
I just finished packing all of
the gear back into capsules...

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.136
How much longer you
think he's gonna be?

00:09:45.203 --> 00:09:48.511
There's no sign of him
yet... Oh man... I hope he

00:09:48.577 --> 00:09:51.683
didn't run into Vegeta...
That would be really bad.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.123
That bastard knows where we are
now...! We've got to relocate,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.530
and fast...! What could
be taking Gohan so long

00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:01.836
to get back...?
Come on... Hurry!

I found it!

--[Krillin] Yes...! Are we
ever glad to see you!

[laughing]

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.621
Right. Now... There's
really no time to explain,

00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:29.057
but if the three of us
don't get outta here,

00:10:29.124 --> 00:10:30.895
we're gonna be in for
some serious trouble.

00:10:30.962 --> 00:10:32.865
Yeah, I know already.
I got stopped

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:34.903

But... Good news is, I managed
to keep it hidden from him,

00:10:38.543 --> 00:10:40.514
so he never even
suspected I had it.

00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:43.486
I think that might make you
the luckiest person alive...

[Bulma growling] Yeah... yeah...
that's great...

00:10:45.624 --> 00:10:47.528
we can talk when
we're outta here...

Only this time around,

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:08.938
I've come to finish the job...

I love it when a plan
comes full circle.

00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:13.045
[splash]

00:11:13.112 --> 00:11:15.918
[underwater sounds]

00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:18.255
[thinking] All seven are about
to be mine...

00:11:18.322 --> 00:11:21.262
Eat your heart out, Frieza!
My rule over the universe

00:11:21.329 --> 00:11:24.200
is just one simple
little wish away!

00:11:31.817 --> 00:11:34.121
Okay, that's odd.
It had to have sunk

00:11:34.188 --> 00:11:36.258
to the bottom
somewhere around here...

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:46.847
It's vanished!
But that's impossible!

00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:48.249
The kid!

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:51.790
There's no way he
just happened to be

00:11:51.857 --> 00:11:54.161
exactly halfway between here
and the cave where his friends

00:11:54.228 --> 00:11:58.637
were hiding when I ran across
him! That wretched little brat!

00:11:58.704 --> 00:12:00.941
But how the hell
did he even manage

00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:03.379
to find it in the first place?

00:12:04.816 --> 00:12:06.954
Nothing...! It's a clock!

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.062
That was no clock!
That was a damned radar!

00:12:11.128 --> 00:12:12.965
Damn it...!

00:12:16.238 --> 00:12:18.777
[giant splash]

00:12:20.313 --> 00:12:24.121
Filthy double-crossers...!
You'll rue the day...!

00:12:24.188 --> 00:12:25.891
You hear me?!!

00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.895
[thundering waves]

00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:30.768
You're finished!

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:31.903
[crash]

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.876
You will pay!

00:12:34.943 --> 00:12:36.746
[giant splash]

00:12:50.306 --> 00:12:54.815
Come out and face me...!
Accept your fate like a warrior!

00:13:06.138 --> 00:13:09.912
[explosion]

00:13:14.421 --> 00:13:16.258
They saw this coming...

00:13:18.062 --> 00:13:21.201
Where've they gone...? They
couldn't have gotten very far...

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:23.506
Ugh, but the little vermin
can push their power levels

00:13:23.573 --> 00:13:25.844
down to zero, can't they?

00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:27.915
I don't stand a chance
of finding them like this,

00:13:27.982 --> 00:13:31.055
the miserable little cheats...
Can't believe I fell for it...

00:13:31.122 --> 00:13:33.426
Duped by a trio of weaklings!

00:13:33.492 --> 00:13:37.033
[growling] But... If they intend
to make their own wish,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.937
they'll have to seek me out
at some point...

00:13:39.004 --> 00:13:41.543
Because save the one
they have, I hold the cards!

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.479
And I can wait...

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.417
It's pretty well hidden,
so I think this outta work.

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:06.492
You are completely
out of your mind

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.697
if you think I'm gonna play
house in a dump like this!

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:11.301
Come on, Bulma.
Beggars can't be chosers, right?

00:14:11.368 --> 00:14:13.206
Try to be reasonable.
We're laying low here,

00:14:13.273 --> 00:14:14.508
not giving tours.

00:14:14.575 --> 00:14:16.478
Dad will be here soon; you can
tough it out until then...

00:14:16.546 --> 00:14:17.648
It'll be fun!

00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:19.017
Oh yeah, sure... it'll be
a barrel of monkeys... !

00:14:19.084 --> 00:14:21.723
A lady like me sharing a space
narrower than a circuit board

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.759
with a couple of roughnecks...

00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:26.498
Oh, and a non-existent bathroom!
[groaning]

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:29.437
That's just it. You'll have
the place to yourself...

00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:31.442
See, uh, my plan is to
take Gohan with me back

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.811
to the where the
Grand Elder lives.

00:14:32.878 --> 00:14:34.649
It's actually gonna take us
a while to get there...

00:14:34.716 --> 00:14:37.120
Huh? Why do I have to go?

00:14:37.187 --> 00:14:39.224
Ugh. This was your plan...?
To ditch me...?

00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:41.228
So now I've got to stay
in this hole by myself?

00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:43.734
Trust me on this one...
I know what I'm doing...

00:14:43.801 --> 00:14:46.171
Sure, it'll suck for you to
have to stay here alone, but...

00:14:46.238 --> 00:14:48.076
once I've taken Gohan
to the Grand Elder...

00:14:48.142 --> 00:14:50.514
he just might be able
to take on Vegeta.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.861
[laughing]

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:01.401
Zarbon is certainly
taking his time.

00:15:06.311 --> 00:15:11.656
He's failed me... And I do
hate those who fail me...

00:15:11.722 --> 00:15:13.660
At this point, I can only
assume that he has either

00:15:13.727 --> 00:15:17.734
fled or else been dealt with...

00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:19.972
Such a mess...
Had I expected this,

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:23.111
I would have called for the
Ginyu Force much sooner.

00:15:38.643 --> 00:15:40.981
[Vegeta thinking] So what now...? If
the earthlings really do

00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:43.319
have some kind of a radar
that can locate Dragon Balls,

00:15:43.386 --> 00:15:45.891
I don't dare leave this spot.

00:15:47.427 --> 00:15:50.366
Slippery little runts will be
hunting for the six I've got...

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:52.538
Nothing left for me to do,
but sit here and wait for them

00:15:52.605 --> 00:15:55.376
to make the next move.
Whatever it may be.

00:15:55.443 --> 00:16:03.961
[flying sounds]

00:16:04.027 --> 00:16:08.737
[explosion]

00:16:08.804 --> 00:16:11.374
Well, at least I'm not the
only one who's stuck...

00:16:11.441 --> 00:16:13.412
It appears Frieza's not
too happy that I blasted

00:16:13.479 --> 00:16:16.017
the engine of his
precious spaceship.

00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:27.908
Vegeta, you meddling insect!

00:16:30.013 --> 00:16:34.622
[charging sounds]

00:16:34.688 --> 00:16:38.395
[explosion]

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:41.736
[nervous]

00:16:41.803 --> 00:16:44.742
Great! That's just the thing
I need right now: an earthquake.

00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:47.313
[glass rolling]

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:52.156
[whining]

00:16:52.223 --> 00:16:54.763
I have officially had just
about all I can stand

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:56.566
of this stupid planet...

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:58.770
[glass rolling]

00:16:58.836 --> 00:16:59.773
[explosion]

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:01.275
[shriek]

00:17:01.342 --> 00:17:04.582
[flying sounds]

00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:06.986
[explosion]

00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:11.997
[flying sounds]

00:17:12.063 --> 00:17:16.338
[explosion]

00:17:18.976 --> 00:17:21.214
[thinking] If Frieza did call in
reinforcements to bring

00:17:21.281 --> 00:17:23.587
a new batch of scouters,
at most it'll take them

00:17:23.654 --> 00:17:27.995
a few days to arrive. I've got
to settle this before then.

00:17:28.062 --> 00:17:31.235
However mighty he is, putting
my boot to his neck will only be

00:17:31.302 --> 00:17:34.007
a matter of strategy once I've
been granted eternal life...

00:17:34.608 --> 00:17:35.911
I just have to strike before

00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:38.148
Frieza has a chance to see me coming.

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:42.357
At this speed it's gonna
take us almost twice as long

00:17:42.424 --> 00:17:44.061
to get there as
I thought it would...

00:17:44.127 --> 00:17:46.432
But if we try to boost our
power levels up any more--

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:49.939
Vegeta will sense it and
be able to get the drop on us...

00:17:50.006 --> 00:17:52.276
I don't know how it's possible,
but he's gotten even stronger

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:55.249
since the last time we saw
him... As it stands right now,

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:57.454
not even both of us together
could take him down.

00:17:57.522 --> 00:18:00.359
Uh... Well, yeah... But that's
been the case since he first

00:18:00.426 --> 00:18:02.163
came to Earth... are you
sure the Grand Elder's

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.001
going to be able to
even the odds...?

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:06.171
I just don't think I'm
all that strong...

00:18:06.238 --> 00:18:07.774
Look at how much more
powerful he made me

00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:09.846
-and I'm not even a Saiyan!
We get him to bring out

00:18:09.913 --> 00:18:11.983
your hidden power and we're
talking about a serious chance

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.991
to give Vegeta a run for his
money... Worth a shot, right?

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:22.872
[flying sounds]

00:18:22.939 --> 00:18:29.585
[heavy breathing]

00:18:35.897 --> 00:18:42.077
Aaauuuugggghhhh! Kaio-ken!!!

00:18:42.144 --> 00:18:46.217
[charging sounds]

00:18:46.284 --> 00:18:54.602
[grunting]

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:55.504
HA!

00:18:55.571 --> 00:19:00.380
[mystical sounds]

00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:01.582
Okay...

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:23.527
Ka... me... ha... me... ha!!!

00:19:23.594 --> 00:19:28.001
[thunderous sound]

00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:29.304
[fearful gasp]

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.111
[explosion]

00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:49.611
Oh wow... I'm alive...
I guess that's a good sign

00:19:49.678 --> 00:19:52.618
that all this work is actually
starting to pay off.

00:19:53.587 --> 00:19:57.661
[Soldier] Lord Frieza, I have
news...! We've just received

00:19:57.728 --> 00:20:00.233
a transmission from the Ginyu
Force... They're currently in

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:03.607
the vicinity of sector
9035-YX and should be arriving

00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:05.543
on planet Namek shortly.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.184
[Frieza] Excellent... Finally
someone who'll give me results,

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.555
though seeing as how I'm
still intact, Vegeta's gambit

00:20:11.622 --> 00:20:15.062
must have reached a stalemate...
Ah. How infuriating it must be

00:20:15.129 --> 00:20:17.467
for our treacherous friend...
to come this close to his goal

00:20:17.535 --> 00:20:18.803
only to falter.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.177
Oh, he may run... Indeed. But
once the Ginyu Force brings

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:24.347
their cutting-edge scouters...
try though he might...

00:20:24.414 --> 00:20:27.654
scrape though he might...
Vegeta won't be able to hide.

00:20:28.623 --> 00:20:33.098
[Narrator] Just who or what is
this so-called Ginyu Force,

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:36.137
now making its
way to Planet Namek?

00:20:36.204 --> 00:20:38.241
And will their
arrival really mean

00:20:38.308 --> 00:20:42.751
certain victory for Frieza,
as the tyrant believes?

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:46.191
[Narrator] This rowdy band
of mercenaries make their

00:20:46.258 --> 00:20:50.165
dramatic entrance...
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:20:53.840 --> 00:21:02.724
♪ Closing Song

00:21:37.426 --> 00:21:39.164
[Goku] Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.068
Whoa. This training
regimen's gotten me

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:42.837
so bulked up it's crazy.

00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:44.541
Just hold on a
little longer guys.

00:21:44.608 --> 00:21:45.877
I'll be there
before you know it.

00:21:45.944 --> 00:21:48.348
[Gohan] Yeah, but... Someone or
something with a really high

00:21:48.415 --> 00:21:50.286
power level is on the
way too, Dad. And I think

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:51.856
they'll get here first!

00:21:51.923 --> 00:21:54.161
[Vegeta] Freiza,
you snake! You wouldn't!

00:21:54.227 --> 00:21:56.765
[Goku] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:00.406 --> 00:22:03.178
[Gohan] I've got a
bad feeling about this...
