we'll either need to find
him and destroy him...

figure out a way

the sole purpose

of absorbing Seventeen

He's gonna keep
wiping out cities

those androids,

with Frieza's DNA
in his make-up,

00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:28.496

If Cell wants to
absorb these androids,

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.049

me the trouble

of hunting them
all down one-by-one.

If Cell absorbs
Seventeen and Eighteen,

00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:50.473

Yeah... Right...

where the androids
didn't exist,

But... even so,
I think Dad..

that training with a partner

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:54.522
can produce much faster
results than training alone...

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:56.291
It'll be good for both of us.

00:09:56.358 --> 00:09:59.364

there was definitely

only used his genius for good,

00:12:01.074 --> 00:12:04.114
he could have done some truly
wondrous things for the world.

00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.151
Looks like he started
with human base

00:12:06.218 --> 00:12:07.722

the organic tissue

00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:09.291

"Fun" is something
humans have...

00:17:24.522 --> 00:17:26.592
And last time I checked,

we're not humans anymore.

00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:32.671
And so, three
days came and went,

00:17:32.738 --> 00:17:36.011
and still, Cell's
terror spree continued...

00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:38.148
We're receiving reports

According to
initial estimates,

00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:44.562
it appears that over
half the population

00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:46.431

All we have to
do is find him,

00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:16.492
and then Piccolo
can swoop in

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.830
with his new powers
to take care of the rest!

going to be that easy.

land right on him,
