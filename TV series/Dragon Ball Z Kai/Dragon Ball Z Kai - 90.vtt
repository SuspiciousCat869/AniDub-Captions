Far be it for me to deny credit
where credit is deserved, Goku.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.446
That was quite impressive.

it was somethin', alright.

Hey, momma... What are
we all looking at?

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:48.724
I'm telling you, Harold,
that's the ragamuffin

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.461
Chichi went and got
herself married to

all those years ago...

00:03:52.297 --> 00:03:53.667

he was going through

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.971

Ah! Yeah...
I think you're right...

no mistaking that getup.

Hang in there, sweetheart!

We're depending
on you to win it!

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:17.615
[Bulma] No, no, no! He was
so close! This is torture!

00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:19.753
I don't know if
he was that close...

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:20.922
[Bulma] Huh?

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.559
Keep in mind, Cell appeared
to be on the brink,

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:25.531
but just look at him now.
He's still got quite a bit

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.869
of latitude, a sight
more than Goku.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.808
Huh? So what does that mean?

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:34.348
I hate to say this, but I think
our boy's met his match...

00:04:34.414 --> 00:04:37.254
Judging by his attitude,
I suspect he plunged into this

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:39.225
knowing it was a fight
he couldn't win.

00:04:39.291 --> 00:04:40.862
[Bulma] Ah?!

00:04:40.928 --> 00:04:43.534

[Cell breathes heavily]

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.010
[Cell] Am I imagining things,
or did your power level

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:06.813
just drop like a stone?

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.420
I suggest you eat one
of those little beans...

00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:13.360
The last thing we want is for
the festivities to get dull.

[Goku breathes heavily]

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:17.635
[Trunks] This is our chance!

00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:19.639
Quick, toss Goku a senzu bean!

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:21.777
Once he's back to full
strength, we can all jump in

00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:24.583
and attack together!
Cell won't stand a chance!

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.387
Hey, yeah! That's a great idea!

00:05:28.657 --> 00:05:30.794
C'mon, it's our best shot.

00:05:47.662 --> 00:05:50.367
What are you waiting for?
Throw Goku a senzu bean--

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.538
[Vegeta] That's enough, Trunks!

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:54.843
You spit on your
Saiyan heritage!

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.080
Kakarot has neither asked
for your assistance,

00:05:57.147 --> 00:05:58.483
nor does he want it!

00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.523
Win or lose, this is his
battle and his alone!

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.627
Do you honestly think
his efforts have anything

00:06:03.694 --> 00:06:06.432
to do with "saving the
world" at this point?

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.572
The only thing he's
fighting for is pride.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.047
But he won't be... He won't
be able to keep this up.

00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:17.454
No question about it...
He's not going to win.

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:18.791

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.667
Gah! It's an agony
to admit this, but...

00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:25.370
For all I've pushed
myself to come

00:06:25.437 --> 00:06:27.542
within striking distance
of Kakarot's power,

00:06:27.608 --> 00:06:30.146
he's surpassed me
at every single turn.

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:34.590
He has a gift... And still,
Cell exceeds even his power!

00:06:34.656 --> 00:06:37.060
To him, that gift is a toy!

00:06:38.496 --> 00:06:41.102
And you think we should
just stand here and watch?!

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:42.906
Do nothing while Goku loses?

00:06:42.973 --> 00:06:45.745
Settle down. You yourself
suggested that Kakarot

00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:48.851
must have some grand
strategy up his sleeve...

00:06:48.918 --> 00:06:51.890
Now we wait, and
hope you're right.

00:06:55.664 --> 00:06:59.138
[Trunks] Goku... Whatever
you've got planned,

00:06:59.204 --> 00:07:01.342
now's the time to spring it.

00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:02.812

[Cell chuckles]

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:06.620
[Cell] What's the issue?
Does your pride not care

00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:08.490
for the taste of magical beans?

00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:12.397
[Goku breathes heavily]

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:14.536
Your little display
now did cost me

00:07:14.603 --> 00:07:16.507
a considerable
amount of strength...

00:07:16.574 --> 00:07:18.610
and slim as your chances
of defeating me are,

00:07:18.677 --> 00:07:20.582
restoring yourself
to full power

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.619
would at least keep
things interesting.

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:26.326
[Goku breathes heavily]

00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:27.796
If I can't enjoy myself,

00:07:27.862 --> 00:07:29.498
all of this will have
been for nothing.

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:31.436
Now ratchet up your power
level and come to me!

00:07:31.503 --> 00:07:36.813
[Goku breathes heavily]

00:07:37.882 --> 00:07:39.585

00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:03.867
[Goku] I'm done.

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:05.270
[Gohan gasps]

00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:07.340
Let's call it here...

00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:08.878
Now that I've sized
up your strength,

00:08:08.944 --> 00:08:11.248
it's pretty obvious
that I can't win...

00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:12.852
I'm throwing in the towel.

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:13.654
[Cell ] Hmm?!

00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:15.390
You... You what?!

00:08:15.457 --> 00:08:16.492
He's giving up?!

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.762
You can't mean it!

00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:19.532
But... he's never turned
his back on a match!

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.401
Impossible! This
is not happening!

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:25.344
What kind of cheap stunt does
he think he's trying to pull?!

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.884
No... You can't quit...

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:30.655
The guy who's never backed
down from anything

00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:33.159
in his life is suddenly
calling it a day?!

00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:39.939
[Cell seethes]

00:08:47.154 --> 00:08:48.691
He's serious.

00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:50.326
He is... I don't believe it.

00:08:50.393 --> 00:08:51.896
[Gohan gasps]

00:08:55.672 --> 00:08:59.311
You're calling it
quits? Pathetic...

00:08:59.378 --> 00:09:02.418
You mean to end this fight
before it's barely even begun?

00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:05.924
Pretty much... Victory
goes to you, Cell.

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:10.668
I can't hear a thing from here;
what did he just say?

00:09:10.734 --> 00:09:11.970
If I heard him right...

00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:13.640
then I think the guy in
orange is giving up...

00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:15.878
Well, Goku-- I hope
you're prepared

00:09:15.945 --> 00:09:18.517
to accept the consequences
of your actions...

00:09:18.584 --> 00:09:19.619
Yep!

00:09:19.686 --> 00:09:20.921
[Cell] You can quit if you want,

00:09:20.988 --> 00:09:22.190
but if there's no one
else to challenge me,

00:09:22.257 --> 00:09:24.796
I'm going to reduce
this planet to rubble!

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:27.569
The entire human race,
wiped from existence!

00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:29.672
[Goku] Not so fast, Cell!
I may be giving up,

00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:31.610
but that doesn't mean
the tournament's over!

00:09:31.677 --> 00:09:33.514
There's still one fighter left!

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.651
You're not serious...

00:09:37.688 --> 00:09:40.393
And tell me exactly which
of these pitiful specimens

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.899
you had in mind
to face me, Goku.

00:09:42.966 --> 00:09:45.638
Maybe Trunks, Piccolo or Vegeta?

00:09:45.704 --> 00:09:48.309
Please, don't waste my time!

00:09:49.812 --> 00:09:51.716
Aaaaand the moment
has arrived!

00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:53.620
Round 2 between
Cell and Hercule!

00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:55.892
[Hercule] Hmm?!

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:56.927
Hmm...

00:09:56.993 --> 00:09:59.197
You're clearly rested
and raring to go.

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.102
Any comments on the
can of smack-down

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:02.304
you're about to open?

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.644
Oooh! Tell us, boss!
What are you going to do?

00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:07.515
Show him who the real boss is!

00:10:07.582 --> 00:10:09.585
[Hercule] Uhh...

00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:11.355
Well, the first
thing I'll do...

00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:14.796
is plant my foot right up
that monster's backside!!

00:10:14.862 --> 00:10:16.767
[pupils cheer and laugh]

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:20.107
[Hercule cries out in pain]

00:10:20.173 --> 00:10:22.679
Uh... What is it, champ?

00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:24.616
It's my stomach! Ohh!

00:10:24.683 --> 00:10:27.087
Just give me a minute
here, people...

00:10:27.153 --> 00:10:30.126
I'm gonna grind that
scrawny wannabe Cell in--

00:10:30.193 --> 00:10:33.767
into the dust! Ohh, I--
but-- but the pain!!

00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:38.544
[Announcer] Uh...

00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:39.946
Tell you what, as long
as you're ready,

00:10:40.013 --> 00:10:42.685
I'll go ahead and pick your
next challenger for you.

00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:45.657
So you seriously intend
to go through with this...

00:10:45.724 --> 00:10:47.728
[Vegeta] <i>Has Kakarot
lost his mind...?!</i>

00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:50.734
<i>None of us is a match for Cell!</i>

00:10:50.801 --> 00:10:52.739
One way or another,
I can promise...

00:10:52.806 --> 00:10:54.910
this next round's
gonna be the last.

00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:57.181
If my pick loses,
then nobody else here

00:10:57.247 --> 00:10:59.417
can defeat you. Period.

00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:05.463
But now that I've
gauged your power,

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:08.637
I'm one-hundred-percent certain
he's gonna win. No contest.

00:11:08.703 --> 00:11:09.939
What's that?

00:11:10.006 --> 00:11:11.776
That's why I figure I
might as well step aside

00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:13.814
and let him be the
one to finish this.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.785
This makes no sense...

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:17.555
You're suggesting
whoever this person is

00:11:17.622 --> 00:11:19.926
outshines even you
in raw power?

00:11:19.992 --> 00:11:20.861
Yeah.

00:11:33.754 --> 00:11:35.658
[Cell laughs]

00:11:35.725 --> 00:11:37.728
[Cell] Ridiculous!
Even if it <i>were</i> true,

00:11:37.795 --> 00:11:39.900
he'd have to be ten
times stronger than you

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:41.870
to make a difference!

00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:43.674
[Goku] Well, I think
you'd be surprised.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.878
[Cell] Oh, then by
all means, surprise me!

00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:48.282
What is this great
warrior's name?

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:52.191
Sounds like he's about to
pick the next challenger...

00:11:52.257 --> 00:11:52.992
Okay...

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:54.963
[Hercule] <i>Ah, this is bad...</i>

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:59.238
<i>He's gonna say me,
I just know it...</i>

00:11:59.305 --> 00:12:01.108
Uh, hey, listen...

00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:04.047
Go tell this guy I'm not
ready... Say the raw eggs

00:12:04.114 --> 00:12:07.020
I had with breakfast
this morning were bad.

00:12:27.327 --> 00:12:30.534
Time for you to
take over... Gohan.

00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:33.206
[Gohan, Krillin
and Trunks gasp]

00:12:33.272 --> 00:12:34.374
He's insane!

00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:36.178
[Piccolo] <i>No! That fool!</i>

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:38.583
<i>No way Gohan's up for
this, and he knows it!</i>

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.119
You're joking...

00:12:40.186 --> 00:12:42.558
Of all the fighters you
might have chosen...

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:44.028
That's the one you go with...

00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:45.597
Alright... I don't know who,

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:47.568
but he just told
someone to "go on."

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.973
[Announcer] Ah...?

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.912
The entire world is waiting to
hear him name the next fighter,

00:12:52.979 --> 00:12:55.249
and all he can think of
to say is "Go on"...?

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.856
My sincere apologies to
all our viewers at home.

00:12:57.922 --> 00:13:00.561
[Chichi] Has he
completely lost his mind?!

00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:02.698
Goku! If you think
I'm gonna let you

00:13:02.765 --> 00:13:04.569
put my little boy
near that monster,

00:13:04.636 --> 00:13:06.438
you've got a nasty surprise
in store for you, mister!

00:13:06.506 --> 00:13:09.044
[Ox King] Calm down,
you're going to hurt--

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:17.360
[Gohan gasps, shudders]

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.445
[Gohan gasps]

00:13:29.885 --> 00:13:32.491
You're up for this... right?

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:35.263
Me? Take <i>him</i> on? I don't...

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.100
[Piccolo] This is
madness, Goku!

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:39.037
There's no way the boy can win!

00:13:39.104 --> 00:13:41.141
I'll admit, Gohan's
abilities are far beyond

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:43.814
what they used to be...
But you're pitting him

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.485
up against a foe even
you couldn't beat!

00:13:46.553 --> 00:13:48.455
Listen... You have to trust me.

00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:50.460
Gohan has a power
within him that's greater

00:13:50.527 --> 00:13:52.631
than anything you could
possibly imagine.

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:54.434
Just think about it
for a second...

00:13:54.502 --> 00:13:57.307
He's been fighting alongside
us ever since he was little...

00:13:57.374 --> 00:14:00.313
against some of the
toughest enemies around!

00:14:01.114 --> 00:14:03.687
I remember what I was like
back when I was his age...

00:14:03.753 --> 00:14:06.358
I wasn't half as strong--
not even close.

00:14:06.425 --> 00:14:07.427
Hey... c'mon, man...

00:14:07.494 --> 00:14:09.264
It's great that he's
already a Super Saiyan,

00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:11.001
but what you're
askin', it's, uh...

00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:14.241
it's kind of a
tall order... right?

00:14:14.308 --> 00:14:16.045
I realize it's
a big challenge...

00:14:16.111 --> 00:14:17.882
But you didn't see what I
saw when we were training

00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:21.254
in the Hyperbolic Time
Chamber. He's ready.

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:28.169
What do you think?
You see Cell hit me

00:14:28.236 --> 00:14:30.139
with anything you
couldn't handle?

00:14:30.206 --> 00:14:33.880
You see me go at him with
anything you don't have?

00:14:33.947 --> 00:14:37.053
Well... I don't
think so, no...

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.556
But you were both
holding back, right?

00:14:38.623 --> 00:14:42.364
I'm sure it'd be a lot different
if you were going all out.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.299
[Goku chuckles lightly]

00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:45.236
Now I don't know
about Cell, but...

00:14:45.303 --> 00:14:47.708
I was giving it
everything I had!

00:14:47.774 --> 00:14:50.413
You thought I was holding back,
because the whole time,

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.952
you were gauging my
energy against your own!

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:55.590
Gohan, answer me.
Is this true?

00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:57.226
Yeah.

00:14:57.293 --> 00:14:58.997
Vegeta] <i>What?! That battle...?</i>

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:01.301
<i>That had the rest of us
standing here in awe...</i>

00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:03.573
<i>And this boy
thought nothing of it?!</i>

00:15:06.245 --> 00:15:07.782
[Cell] Hm.

00:15:07.849 --> 00:15:09.653
[Goku exhales]

00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:11.454
Alright, whaddya say?

00:15:11.522 --> 00:15:14.829
I need you to go out there
and win this one for us, okay?

00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:16.632
Then we can all go home.

00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:24.949
Okay, Dad... I'll do it.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.990
[Piccolo sighs angrily]

00:15:29.057 --> 00:15:31.328
Eh... Gohan...

00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:33.131
[Vegeta seethes]

00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:43.586
[Gohan grunts]

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.671
Ah! Looks like the next
challenger has taken the field!

00:15:52.738 --> 00:15:55.376
And it astounds me to
report this brave warrior

00:15:55.443 --> 00:15:57.113
seems to be little
more than a child!

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.650
"Brave Warrior"?!

00:15:58.717 --> 00:16:02.190
No way, that kid's just
a waterboy or somethin'!

00:16:03.593 --> 00:16:05.631
Uh...

00:16:05.697 --> 00:16:07.735
[Hercule groans in pain]

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:10.339
Now that you mention it...
it would only make sense

00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:13.747
for Cell to pause for a bit of
refreshment between rounds...

00:16:13.814 --> 00:16:15.382
Which means the
wait continues...!

00:16:15.449 --> 00:16:18.355
The next fighter will
appear after a water break!

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:23.332
Ugh... Risky move, fellas...

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.604
I don't think Gohan's
improved enough

00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:28.175
to take on someone like Cell.

00:16:31.181 --> 00:16:34.254
Krillin... I think I'll
take a senzu bean now...

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.791
Still got any on you?

00:16:35.857 --> 00:16:38.797
Uh... Yeah.

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:40.399
[Goku] Thanks.

00:16:41.536 --> 00:16:42.939
Hey, Cell!

00:16:43.006 --> 00:16:44.508
[Krillin shrieks]

00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:49.184
It's called a senzu
bean... Eat up.

00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:51.388
Gah! Is your brain
on vacation...?!

00:16:51.455 --> 00:16:53.059
Why in the world
would you do that?!

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:54.828
[Goku] Hey, take it easy...

00:16:54.895 --> 00:16:56.465
Cell's used up a
lot of his energy...

00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:58.335
It's only fair to
let him fight Gohan

00:16:58.402 --> 00:17:00.507
at full strength,
don'tcha think?

00:17:00.574 --> 00:17:02.577
What... Do you hear
yourself talk?!

00:17:02.644 --> 00:17:05.116
I don't think now's the time
to make a point of fair play!

00:17:05.183 --> 00:17:07.588
[Cell chuckles]

00:17:07.654 --> 00:17:10.894
Incredible... With
everything at stake...

00:17:10.961 --> 00:17:12.230
you still can't
help but be a slave

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:15.002
to your better
nature. Sickening.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.007
All the same, I gladly accept

00:17:17.074 --> 00:17:18.843
this token of
"good sportsmanship."

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:23.018
But mark my words! I'll see
to it you regret the gesture.

00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:24.655
[Cell chuckles]

00:17:24.722 --> 00:17:28.830
[Cell chews and swallows]

00:17:28.897 --> 00:17:34.073
[Cell grunts, yells]

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.844
Oh, no...!

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:42.056
Thank you, Goku...
That has a little kick to it!

00:17:42.123 --> 00:17:45.229
'Kay... That was officially
a bad idea! So bad!

00:17:45.296 --> 00:17:48.035
Yeah. That was
just reckless, Goku!

00:17:48.102 --> 00:17:50.205
By every standard of the word!

00:17:53.178 --> 00:18:03.398
[Gohan grunts, yells]

00:18:06.105 --> 00:18:15.356
[Gohan yells]

00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:17.961
Is that really Gohan?

00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:19.565
[Vegeta gasps]

00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:30.887
[Krillin and Trunks gasp]

00:18:30.954 --> 00:18:34.360
[Piccolo, 16
and Vegeta gasp]

00:18:43.212 --> 00:18:45.584
I... I don't believe my eyes...

00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:48.088
It's like he's become a
whole different person...

00:18:48.155 --> 00:18:51.061
No! How is this happening?

00:18:51.127 --> 00:18:52.965
How does a miserable
little brat like him

00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:55.369
get so strong so quickly?!

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.281
Apparently Goku wasn't
overselling your abilities

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:05.156
nearly as much as I'd
assumed... Still though,

00:19:05.223 --> 00:19:07.695
he did go a bit far
singing your praises...

00:19:07.762 --> 00:19:10.499
I'm afraid winning's
not in the cards, kid.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.887
You're really up
for this, huh?

00:19:20.954 --> 00:19:22.524
Well, best of luck
to you, then...

00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:25.262
This is going to hurt
a great deal, Gohan.

00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:27.100
But I'm not without kindness;

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.772
I'll be sure the pain
only lasts a second.

00:19:34.114 --> 00:19:35.917
[Cell grunts]

00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:46.672
[Cell shouts]

00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:49.010
That's it! Come on!

00:19:49.077 --> 00:19:50.814
[Vegeta and Piccolo groan]

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.852
Watch it... Careful...

00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:54.420
Gohan...

00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:04.407
[Tien and Yamcha gasp]

00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:10.954
Spry little runt, aren't you?

00:20:11.021 --> 00:20:12.257
Now then, let's see
how you maneuver

00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:14.393
against my true speed!

00:20:17.199 --> 00:20:24.848
[Gohan grunts
repeatedly in pain]

00:20:24.915 --> 00:20:27.988
[Chichi] Gohan, no!
Somebody get him out of there!

00:20:28.055 --> 00:20:30.025
Please! Gohan!

00:20:32.196 --> 00:20:34.067
