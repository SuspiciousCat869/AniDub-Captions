can keep that up Trunks.

00:18:14.053 --> 00:18:16.424
[KRILLIN]
No... Trunks...

00:18:19.464 --> 00:18:22.236
[KRILLIN]
He... can't win...

00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:34.529
<i>[KRILLIN]
I get it...</i>

00:18:34.596 --> 00:18:37.433
<i>He's just drawing Cell away
so I can rescue Vegeta...</i>

00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:51.394
[KRILLIN]
You just had to go

00:18:51.461 --> 00:18:52.931
and let Cell reach
his perfect form...

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:55.236
Now look at you.

00:18:55.303 --> 00:18:56.773
You're just lucky
Trunks is still here

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:58.543
to clean up your mess...

00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:02.283
Otherwise... we'd've
all been history.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.299
[KRILLIN]
Your son's fighting

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:12.136
at a level you could
only dream of...

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:13.773
And because of
your stupid pride,

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.610
you'll never
get to see it.

00:19:17.046 --> 00:19:18.349
Personally, I've
always thought

00:19:18.416 --> 00:19:20.788
that you were more trouble
than you were worth...

00:19:20.854 --> 00:19:22.924
But Trunks seems to
feel differently...

00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:33.947
Still... I don't have
the slightest clue

00:19:34.014 --> 00:19:35.950
what he sees in you.

00:20:12.624 --> 00:20:14.061
[CELL] I take it
we can finally fight

00:20:14.127 --> 00:20:16.097
without distractions?

00:20:16.164 --> 00:20:18.870
Right...? Now that
Vegeta's gone?

00:20:19.672 --> 00:20:22.076
[TRUNKS] You...
knew I was stalling?

00:20:22.143 --> 00:20:23.680
[CELL]
Of course I did.

00:20:23.747 --> 00:20:25.618
Just like I knew you were
intentionally steering

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:28.088
our fight away from
where he'd fallen...

00:20:28.155 --> 00:20:29.591
[TRUNKS]
So you say...

00:20:29.658 --> 00:20:31.094
Then why did you
let him escape?

00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:35.870
[CELL] Why not? I no longer
have any interest in Vegeta.

00:20:35.937 --> 00:20:38.676
I'd rather see
what you can do.

00:20:49.197 --> 00:20:51.569
[TRUNKS] Be careful
what you wish for, Cell.

00:20:52.872 --> 00:20:54.373
[CELL]
That's good...!

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.744
I only hope you
can provide me

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.749
a better challenge
than your father did.

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:11.543
[NARRATOR] At last, with
Vegeta safely out of the way,

00:21:11.609 --> 00:21:14.749
Trunks prepares to
reveal his true power!

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:17.621
But will this level
beyond Super Saiyan

00:21:17.688 --> 00:21:21.829
be enough to overcome the
terrifying Perfect Cell?

00:21:21.895 --> 00:21:25.302
The stage is set for a
showdown of epic proportions,

00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:28.510
and the fate of the world
hangs in the balance--

00:21:28.576 --> 00:21:31.849
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:10.894
