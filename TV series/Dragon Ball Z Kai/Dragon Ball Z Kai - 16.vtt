[NARRATOR]
Last Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:04.643
Goku had fallen
into enemy hands

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:08.116
when an unlikely hero
swooped in; Yajirobe.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.186
But the fight was
far from over...

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.258
With Goku still
down for the count,

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:14.563
Gohan tried his best,
but it was Krillin

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:17.836
who found himself entrusted with
everyone's last and only hope.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.042
[GOKU] Unless you can take him
down in one shot, we're dead.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:25.417
One shot, huh?
Well, here goes...

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:36.506
â™ª Opening Song â™ª

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:56.032
[NARRATOR] "Defeat
the Invincible Vegeta!

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:59.138
Work a Miracle, Gohan!"

[VEGETA chuckles]

00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:05.918
[GOHAN panting]

00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:08.323
I can't believe
how strong he is.

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:10.427
And after all that fighting
he was doing with my dad,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.366
he's probably even too
worn out to fight his hardest.

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.072
[VEGETA] He's a
feisty little snot...

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:35.878
but it seems he's
reaching his limit.

00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:41.255
Heh...

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:42.525
[VEGETA yells]

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:49.371
Masenko! Haa!

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:52.578
Ha! That's it?
Your final shot...?

00:02:54.448 --> 00:02:55.450
Ahh...!

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.462
One more!

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:02.497
[GOHAN yells]

00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:12.484
Damn... Unless he's
standing still...

00:03:12.518 --> 00:03:15.825
I can't hit him...
not from here!

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:17.127
Huh...?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.131
[KING KAI] You do not aim the
Spirit Bomb by what you see,

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.467
but what you feel...

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:24.008
Sense the evil energy
of the Saiyan and let go!

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.779
Hey! Who's there?!

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:27.047
[KING KAI]
I am King Kai...

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:30.822
I'm the one who taught Goku
how to use the Spirit Bomb.

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:33.226
Uh... The... actual King Kai?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.563
[KING KAI]
Yes, thank you...

00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:37.334
You've only got one shot
at this, so use it wisely.

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:39.171
Once you do it, the
spirit bomb in your hand

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:42.478
will determine the fate
of your entire world.

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:43.747
Uh...

00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:47.622
You're saying everybody on
the planet is depending on me?

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.299

[VEGETA laughs]

00:03:55.237 --> 00:03:56.540
Join forces if you'd like...

00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:58.544
A few more won't
make any difference...

00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:00.548
not against an
elite like me...

00:04:00.582 --> 00:04:02.618
You don't stand a chance.

00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:05.758
Your fates were
decided the minute

00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:08.329
I set foot on this
miserable planet.

00:04:08.362 --> 00:04:09.933
[VEGETA laughs]

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:16.613
[KRILLIN] Okay, Krillin.
You can do this!

00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:19.786
Feel his evil
energy and let go.

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:23.360
[KING KAI] You've only
got one shot at this...

00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:25.631
so use it wisely.

00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:31.008

an end to this.

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:56.793
You can't run from me forever!

00:04:56.827 --> 00:04:59.232
[KRILLIN] This has to
work! It just has to!

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:02.204
I've got to focus
on sensing his energy!

[YAJIROBE] That's one
massive ball of energy!

00:05:13.694 --> 00:05:15.531
Krillin's not messin' around.

00:05:15.564 --> 00:05:17.267
Except I don't know
what he's waitin' for...

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.271
hurry up and do
something already!

00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:31.195
I hope you're watching
closely, Kakarot,

00:05:31.228 --> 00:05:32.498
because this is the last time

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:35.671
you'll ever see your
pathetic excuse for a son!

00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:38.243
I've got it!

00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:39.712
Well, what in the heck are you
doing just standing there?!

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:41.917
Are you ever gonna
throw that thing or not?!

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.885
[VEGETA] Huh...?

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.058
What an idiot! Here goes!

00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:48.797
[VEGETA yells]

00:05:52.404 --> 00:05:54.408
What... What... is that?!

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.947
Go! Come on!

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.982
Ahh...

00:05:58.382 --> 00:05:59.753
[KRILLIN yells]

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:00.855
I missed him!

00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:01.990
[GOKU breathes deeply]

It's hopeless!

[GOKU] Gohan! You have
to bounce it back!

[GOHAN gasps]

00:06:15.483 --> 00:06:17.387
The Spirit Bomb was aimed
at Vegeta's evil energy.

00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.493
If you don't have any
evil in you, you'll be okay.

[KRILLIN laughs]

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.972
[KRILLIN] We did it, Goku!
We really did it!

[KRILLIN laughs]

00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:18.611
I can't believe it!

00:07:18.644 --> 00:07:21.248
I didn't think we could do it,
but then we did! Yeah!

[GOHAN laughs]

00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:33.439
[GOKU] I told you,
you could do it, didn't I?

00:07:33.472 --> 00:07:34.843
[GOHAN] Yeah...

00:07:34.876 --> 00:07:36.747
[KRILLIN] Things got kinda
hairy there for a second,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.015
but somehow
we pulled it off...

00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:40.754
[GOKU] You both...
must be really exhausted.

00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:44.061
Well... not as
much as you.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.737
Huh...?

It's him again!

00:08:07.207 --> 00:08:09.412
It's okay
Gohan, he's dead.

[KRILLIN sighs]

00:08:15.924 --> 00:08:17.194
[KRILLIN]
You were a monster...

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:19.465
but I guess we can't
just leave your body here.

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:23.574
The least we can
do is dig you a grave.

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:25.310
That's a luxury you won't get!

00:08:25.343 --> 00:08:26.245

[KING KAI] But... how?
This shouldn't be possible.

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:38.202
Nobody can take a Spirit

[VEGETA breathes heavily]

00:08:43.747 --> 00:08:47.254
[VEGETA] I have to admit,
you really did a number on me.

00:08:47.287 --> 00:08:50.393
For a minute there I even
thought I was done for.

You may have succeeded
in wounding me,

00:08:57.742 --> 00:08:59.378
but I still have
enough strength

00:08:59.411 --> 00:09:02.050
to take care of a
weakling like you.

And once I finish
all of you off here,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.674
I'll replenish my
strength and then

00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:16.646
come back to destroy every
living thing on this planet.

You've made me
use more of my power

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.969
than I have in
a very long time...

00:09:28.003 --> 00:09:29.338
and to think that
you're just a bunch

00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:31.743
of puny, spineless
Earth trash...

00:09:31.776 --> 00:09:33.212

I'm finished playing
your stupid little games.

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.763
Now, your time is finally up.

00:09:41.797 --> 00:09:43.801
So... prepare to
be the first humans

00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:45.671

00:11:42.538 --> 00:11:44.909
now... before it's too late!

That... little brat!

00:12:06.352 --> 00:12:10.828
His tail...! It grew back!

00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:12.899
Yeah? So what?

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:14.736
When Goku was young...

00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:17.340
his tail used to grow back too.

00:12:17.373 --> 00:12:20.781

Hey, look what
I did, everybody!

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.756
[YAJIROBE] I killed the
bad guy! Ha, Heh, Heh...

00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:16.025
Come on...
check it out, you guys!

00:13:16.058 --> 00:13:17.961
Look what I did!
Heh, Heh...

See, I told you
he wasn't so tough!

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:22.739
I'm better than you!

00:13:22.772 --> 00:13:23.907
You hear that, Saiyan?

00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:25.844
Nobody messes with
Yajirobe and lives!

00:13:25.878 --> 00:13:27.648
Tough luck for you!

Woah, time out!
I was just playin'!

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:54.602
Hold on.

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:57.307
You didn't think I was really
trying to hurt you, did ya?

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.645
No way I'd ever start a fight
with a guy as strong as you!

00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:02.718
In fact, I was thinkin' maybe
you and me could join forces!

[KRILLIN] Y-Yajirobe...

If you think you can spill
the royal blood of Prince Vegeta

00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:34.982
and live to tell about it,
you are sadly mistaken.

00:14:35.015 --> 00:14:37.420
That bastard...!

00:14:39.057 --> 00:14:43.534

Gohan, can you hear me?

00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:45.771
Gohan!

00:14:45.804 --> 00:14:49.144
[GOHAN] That... that
sounds like Dad's voice!

00:14:50.614 --> 00:14:52.752
[thud]

00:14:52.785 --> 00:14:54.956
[GOKU] Gohan, I need
you to focus for me.

00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:56.826
Can you do that?

00:14:56.859 --> 00:14:58.530
Yeah... I'll try.

00:14:58.563 --> 00:15:00.901
[GOKU] See that big
ball of light in the sky?

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.939
Look at it real close, okay?

00:15:02.972 --> 00:15:07.614

at it, Dad. I see it.

You little brat!

00:15:39.579 --> 00:15:41.682
I'm not gonna let
you transform... I won't!

[GOHAN roars]

00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:50.399
I have to kill him now,
while I still can!

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:53.039
[GOKU] Gohan...
It's up to you now!

00:15:53.072 --> 00:15:55.811
It's risky to let
Gohan transform...

00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:58.449
but... it might be
the only chance we have!

00:15:58.482 --> 00:15:59.719
His tail...

00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:01.622
I was so focused on
stopping his transformation

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:03.159
I almost forgot about it!

00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:04.762

[KRILLIN] Oh, no...
This is bad...

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:49.150
Whenever Goku transformed,
he totally lost control...

00:16:49.184 --> 00:16:52.123
He turned into
a complete monster!

Like father,
like son, I guess...

00:16:57.969 --> 00:16:59.204
But is he really
out of control?

00:16:59.237 --> 00:17:01.809
That Vegeta guy wasn't
when he transformed.

00:17:01.843 --> 00:17:03.513
Maybe when Gohan
and Goku change,

00:17:03.547 --> 00:17:07.253
they can't keep their Saiyan
instincts from running wild.

Alright!

Either we're really
lucky or there's still

00:18:00.025 --> 00:18:01.830
a little bit of Gohan
in there somewhere.

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:05.036

up one heck of a fight!

The moon I created won't go
out for at least another hour.

If I want to end this
before he crushes me,

00:18:18.062 --> 00:18:19.632
I have to get to his tail.

The greatest warrior

[VEGETA grunts]

00:20:55.109 --> 00:20:56.779
Ah...

00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:05.129
No... He has to pay for
everything he's done.

00:21:05.162 --> 00:21:08.001
Time... to finish... him off!

I'm proud of you
for making it this far.

00:22:42.724 --> 00:22:44.662
[KRILLIN] I just
wish everybody else had.

00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:46.632
[GOHAN] And I wish
Piccolo was still here.

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:49.337
Then Kami and the Dragon
Balls would be here, too.

00:22:49.371 --> 00:22:50.406
[KRILLIN] I have an idea.

00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:51.742
It's a long shot,
but if it works,

00:22:51.776 --> 00:22:53.814
we might be able to find
some more Dragon Balls!
