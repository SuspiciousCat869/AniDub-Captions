How did you manage to survive

00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:00.240
Yeah, now that you mention it...

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.647
Frieza's spaceship was too
damaged to fly, right...?

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:05.484
I mean, King Kai said
that was the only way

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.321
you could make
it off the planet.

[GOKU] Lucky for me...
I managed to find some

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:43.694
of those round space

The five Ginyu Force ships--

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.902
I'd forgotten that
they were still there!

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.373
Anyway... I jumped into one...

00:02:50.473 --> 00:02:53.680

Well, it isn't Earth

but it sure could have
been a whole lot worse.

00:03:33.527 --> 00:03:34.863
[VEGETA] The Ginyu Force
must have been planning

00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:37.235
to attack Yardrat.

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:38.804
That would make sense...

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:41.408
That's why their spaceships
were programmed to fly there...

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.381
Of course, it still doesn't
explain that absurd outfit.

00:03:44.482 --> 00:03:45.417
[GOKU]
Right...

00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:46.553
My clothes were all ripped up,

00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:48.022
so the Yardratians
gave me these.

00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:49.492
They're actually pretty friendly

00:03:49.593 --> 00:03:50.494

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:51.764
Just not the most stylish...

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:52.966
Don't hold out on me...!

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.235
What did you learn from them...?

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:55.738
You were among them
for all that time...

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:58.544
They're weak people that
rely on strange techniques.

00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:00.882
Did they share them with you?

00:04:00.982 --> 00:04:02.218
They sure did!

00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:03.120
I get it...!

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.455
You were training...!

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:05.959
So that's why you
didn't come home earlier!

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.094
Awesome...!

00:04:07.194 --> 00:04:08.463
Show us a move...!
I want to see!

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:09.666
I didn't have much time...

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:11.604
and it was really
tough to learn...

00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:13.206
but I finally got it down...

00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:15.311
I learned one
Yardratian technique.

00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:17.314

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:25.197
Can you demonstrate it?

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:27.467
Demonstrate...? Yeah, sure.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.006
For this move...
you focus... hard...

00:04:30.107 --> 00:04:32.044
but not on a
place--on a person...

00:04:32.144 --> 00:04:33.714
Then you lock on
to their energy...

00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:34.783
After that...

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:36.520
you immediately go
to wherever they are.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.160
Now... where do I want
to I travel first...?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.965

00:04:51.482 --> 00:04:52.518

Just high-speed
smoke and mirrors.

00:04:54.623 --> 00:04:57.294
Oh yeah...? Recognize these?

00:04:57.394 --> 00:04:58.463
They... look like...

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:00.433
Master Roshi's glasses!

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:02.906
They can't be!

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:04.474
But... Roshi's place must be

00:05:04.576 --> 00:05:06.111
nearly seven
thousand miles away...

00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:08.316
maybe more...!
And round trip--

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:10.320

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:14.963
[GOKU] Krillin... Give these
back to him for me, 'kay?

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:16.901
[KRILLIN]
Sure. You got it.

00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:20.006
Wow, there really is
nothing you can't do, huh?

00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:21.610
Right... So...

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.979
Let's meet at the
site of the attack

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.582
three years from now...

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:26.953
Just say where... And
did he mention a date?

00:05:27.053 --> 00:05:32.866
Yeah, he did... but...
I might have sort of forgot.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:33.701
May the twelfth...

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:35.371
at ten o'clock in the morning...

00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:37.876
on an island nine
miles off of South City.

00:05:37.976 --> 00:05:39.847
But I think we should
all plan to arrive

00:05:39.947 --> 00:05:41.282
no later than nine a.m.

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:42.719
in case the young
man's information

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.124
isn't one-hundred
percent accurate.

00:05:45.224 --> 00:05:46.392
[GOKU]
Yea, what he said!

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:47.628
Great... Thanks...

00:05:47.728 --> 00:05:49.966
I'm glad one of us
was listening, Goku!

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:53.105
I will say this--the faint
of heart should stay back...

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:54.509
If these enemies
are half as fearsome

00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:56.145
as they were described...

00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:58.182
every move we make
will be critical.

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:00.054
We can't have anyone
slowing us down.

00:06:00.154 --> 00:06:02.024
So... stay home... ya.

00:06:02.124 --> 00:06:04.095
Yeah. Heh heh heh...

00:06:04.195 --> 00:06:05.263
Don't make me laugh...

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:07.067
If anyone should
stay home, it's you.

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.236
You're a liability.

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:10.541
Then try me and
see how you fare!

00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.614
Whoa, guys... relax!

00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:16.787
Hey, so, guys...

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:19.124
I've got an idea that
just might work...

00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:22.599
Okay. If we could just
find this Dr. Gero guy...

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.542
Maybe we can stop him.

00:06:27.642 --> 00:06:29.478
We don't even have to
find him ourselves...

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:30.514
Think about it...!

00:06:30.614 --> 00:06:32.217
We could use the Dragon Balls...

00:06:32.318 --> 00:06:34.255
I'll bet Shenron
knows where he is...

00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:36.560
After that we just
show up on his doorstep

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.196
and make him stop.
Problem solved.

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:39.532
Hey, yeah...!

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.068
We won't have to fight
at all if we do that!

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:44.809
The future Earth will be safe!
Great idea, Bulma! Way to go!

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:46.980
If any of you so much
as think of doing that...

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.686
you will pay dearly
for it! Got that?

00:06:49.786 --> 00:06:51.623
Have you lost
your tiny mind...?

00:06:51.723 --> 00:06:53.193
This isn't a game,
you know that...?

00:06:53.293 --> 00:06:55.397
If lose, we lose everything!

00:06:55.497 --> 00:06:58.236
Goku, please tell
me you're on my side!

00:06:58.336 --> 00:06:59.940
[whimpers]

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.278
Well, I actually kind
of want to fight them too

00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:04.214
to tell you the truth.

00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:05.383
And besides that...

00:07:05.518 --> 00:07:06.886
The guy hasn't
invented anything yet,

00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:08.557
so there is no
reason to hurt him,

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.761
that's a little drastic, right?

00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:12.230
[BULMA]
Don't listen to them!

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.534
They're Saiyans!

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:15.437
They can't help being
muscleheaded freaks!

00:07:15.538 --> 00:07:18.109
We can stop this
before it happens!

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:19.546
These guys are too strong!

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:22.150
You won't be able to stop them!

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.453
That may be true...

00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:25.991
but I have to know
what I'm capable of.

00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:30.466
So... Whatever it
costs me... I will fight.

00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:32.572
Oh, good grief.

00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:34.208
Hey... Bulma... Look...

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:36.446
I've been doing some thinking...

00:07:36.547 --> 00:07:37.882
We're all friends... but...

00:07:37.982 --> 00:07:40.320
it hasn't always been
like that, remember...?

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.257
I mean, I used to hate Goku!

00:07:42.357 --> 00:07:43.594
[nervous laughter]
Eh heh heh heh...

00:07:43.694 --> 00:07:45.096
But not anymore...

00:07:45.196 --> 00:07:47.936
Whenever we faced an enemy
we put all that behind us...

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:48.971
We had to...

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:50.975
And before we knew
it, we were friends.

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:51.977
Ordinarily,

00:07:52.077 --> 00:07:54.248
this group would
never train together...

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:55.718
And let's face it,

00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:57.254
some of these guys can be
pretty nasty on their own.

00:07:57.354 --> 00:07:59.224
What are you trying to say?

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.233
I'm saying we wouldn't
be friends right now

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:04.536
without a common enemy.

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:06.005
Piccolo might be okay...

00:08:06.105 --> 00:08:07.609
but who knows what
Vegeta's going to try

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:10.246
once he thinks he
can get away with it.

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:13.119
Nice speech... Well...

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:15.490
it was right up until
the very end there.

00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:16.826
Come on...

00:08:16.926 --> 00:08:18.062
I was just telling the
truth, and you know it.

00:08:18.162 --> 00:08:19.331
Fine, I get it...

00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:20.968
Do what you want,
you savages...

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:22.671
You're such a pain,
you know that...?

00:08:22.772 --> 00:08:24.976
I don't know how a civilized
person like me got mixed up

00:08:25.076 --> 00:08:27.281

away to train again...?

If we want to
beat these androids,

you put it like that,
