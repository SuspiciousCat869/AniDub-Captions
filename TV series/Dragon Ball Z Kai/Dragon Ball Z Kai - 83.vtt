held three years later;

one of the most
brutal on record...

00:09:58.697 --> 00:10:00.735
Everyone in attendance
swore up and down it was

00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:03.707
the closest competition
they'd ever seen.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.379
Not only was Goku a blushing
newlywed at that point;

Piccolo took the
tournament by storm

under the assumed
named Ma Junior

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.659

with his opponents.

00:10:12.692 --> 00:10:15.363
Kami even possessed
a man just to compete.

Heh... Normal fighters
were afraid to enter.

00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:22.044

Piccolo and Goku locked horns--

the fate of the world,
hanging in the balance...

When the smoke cleared,

00:10:26.118 --> 00:10:29.458

as the strongest man

00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:30.995
on the face of the planet.
