00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.464
[TIEN] No... there has to be
some way to do it...

00:09:42.532 --> 00:09:44.201
Just think!

00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:45.838
How about something like this?

00:09:45.904 --> 00:09:49.111
We have Shenron turn back
time to before Goku left--

00:09:49.178 --> 00:09:50.313
that'd work, wouldn't it?

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.817
[YAMCHA] Yeah...!
That's a great idea!

00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:54.823
[PICCOLO] Except that Cell would
also be brought back again ...

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:57.695
and we'd be right back
where we started.

00:09:57.762 --> 00:09:59.031
[KRILLIN]
Oh, yeah.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.233
[DENDE]
Hey-- I know!

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.538
We just have to take
our wish to Porunga instead.

00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:03.540
He could do it!

00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:05.511
Yes, of course...
the Namekian dragon

00:10:05.578 --> 00:10:07.515
doesn't have the same
limitations as Shenron.

00:10:07.582 --> 00:10:10.153
He can bring a person
back any number of times...

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.322
Well, okay...!

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:13.159
Then we just have to
get ourselves back to Namek!

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:14.495
That's easy, we
can zap straight

00:10:14.562 --> 00:10:16.399
there with wish number two!

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:19.572
[GOKU] Hey...!
Don't I get a say in this?

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:22.511
[GOKU]
Hi everybody! It's me!

00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:23.480
It's Goku!

00:10:23.547 --> 00:10:25.149
Dad... what's going on?

00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:26.687
[GOKU] I'm speaking to
you from Other World,

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:28.724
so I'll make it quick.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.862
Y'know... Bulma said
something to me years ago

00:10:30.928 --> 00:10:32.063
that's stuck with me...

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.536
She told me I was like a
magnet for all the bad guys

00:10:34.603 --> 00:10:36.038
that were always popping up...

00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:37.074
And if you think about it,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.344
that's really not
too far off the truth.

00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:40.648
[GOKU] I get the feeling
that Earth's gonna be

00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:43.486
way more peaceful if I
just stay where I am now.

00:10:43.553 --> 00:10:45.490
And King Kai agrees with me.

00:10:45.558 --> 00:10:47.662
I'm gonna miss you guys,
but don't worry,

00:10:47.728 --> 00:10:48.931
I'll be just fine up here...

00:10:48.997 --> 00:10:50.333
It's really not so bad.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.705
And King Kai says they're
gonna give me special treatment

00:10:52.772 --> 00:10:55.243
on account of all the times
I helped to save the Earth.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.181
[GOKU] Most people,
and definitely bad guys,

00:10:57.247 --> 00:10:58.517
just turn into spirits here,
but they're gonna

00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:00.353
let me keep my body.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.725
And if that's not enough,
I won't ever get any older.

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:04.729
And there are a bunch
of old fighting masters

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:06.299
here from before my time,

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:08.336
so it's not like I won't
have plenty to do.

00:11:08.403 --> 00:11:09.539
Should be fun!

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:11.510
King Kai's back to normal
thanks to Shenron,

00:11:11.576 --> 00:11:13.446
but he says he's gonna
take some time off

00:11:13.514 --> 00:11:14.616
and show me around,

00:11:14.683 --> 00:11:16.887
so I've already got one
friend to keep me company.

00:11:16.954 --> 00:11:19.191
[GOKU] I know it's kind of a
raw deal for you and your Mom,

00:11:19.258 --> 00:11:22.598
Gohan, but you don't
have to wish me back, okay?

00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:26.739
Besides, son, you're so
strong now I have

00:11:26.806 --> 00:11:28.376
nothing left to teach you!

00:11:28.442 --> 00:11:32.050
But, that doesn't
mean I don't need you!

00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:34.088
[GOKU] I'm sorry, guys,
I'm outta time...

00:11:34.154 --> 00:11:35.758
But take care, okay...?

00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:37.261
Live your lives to the fullest,

00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:39.131
and I'll see ya again
when you're done!

00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:40.735
Goodbye!

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.170

00:11:47.181 --> 00:11:48.750
[KRILLIN]
Y'know...

00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:51.155
...he seemed pretty cheerful
given the circumstances,

00:11:51.222 --> 00:11:53.259
so I guess he's okay
with how things turned out.

00:11:53.326 --> 00:11:55.832
Yeah... suppose he's always
been laid back like that,

00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:58.202
ever since he was a kid.

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.077
Where did it go...?!

00:12:02.143 --> 00:12:04.516
My tail! It's all gone!

00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:05.651
Eh. Oh well!

00:12:05.718 --> 00:12:08.657
Guess...
nothin's changed... huh?

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:10.861
Yeah you're right...

00:12:10.928 --> 00:12:12.264
[YOUNG GOKU]
Where's my Power Pole?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.170
Kay, I'm off...! Yahoooooo!

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:16.305
And he's been rushing on

00:12:16.372 --> 00:12:18.577
ahead of us all the
years that we've known him.

00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:20.747
Eat this. You'll feel better.

00:12:20.814 --> 00:12:22.585
There was no one
else like him...

00:12:22.652 --> 00:12:24.488
He was always willing
to show mercy,

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:25.991
even to an enemy,
and no matter how

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:27.427
powerful he became,

00:12:27.494 --> 00:12:30.934
he valued his friends
over anything else.

00:12:32.103 --> 00:12:35.510
My dad was always kind,
to everybody who met him...

00:12:39.284 --> 00:12:41.288
...and he made me feel brave,

00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:44.729
even when things
were looking really bad.

00:12:51.075 --> 00:12:53.947
Thank you, Dad...
for everything.

Uh... you do know...

00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:22.771
I have been waiting for your
second wish this whole time...

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.142
Any day now...

00:13:29.384 --> 00:13:31.389
[SHENRON]
Well, how about it...?

00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:33.893
Speak your second wish.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.900
Whatever you desire,
I shall grant.

00:13:36.966 --> 00:13:39.238
[YAMCHA] So, if not Goku,
then what? Anybody?

00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:42.310
[TIEN] Shenron's going to vanish
if we don't decide soon.

00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:46.853
Have you no wish?

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.389
[YAMCHA LAUGHS]

00:13:48.456 --> 00:13:49.693
I've got this lady-friend
who'd really like

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:50.994
an expensive necklace,

00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:54.000
if nobody else has a more
selfless wish in mind.

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:55.637
That okay?

00:13:57.941 --> 00:13:59.646
No point wasting it, right?!

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:03.285
[SHENRON] A necklace?
Is that your wish?

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:07.528
Hey... Shenron...
Is there any chance

00:14:07.594 --> 00:14:10.066
that you can transform
Androids 17 and 18

00:14:10.133 --> 00:14:12.938
back into the
people they used to be?

00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:15.777
That fool!

00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:19.785
This I cannot do...

00:14:19.852 --> 00:14:23.425
I am sorry. The androids
are beings whose power

00:14:23.492 --> 00:14:25.697
far exceeds my own.

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:30.874
[SHENRON] I cannot revert them
to the humans they once were.

00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:33.445
[KRILLIN] I was afraid you'd
say something like that.

00:14:34.447 --> 00:14:36.384
Why include Seventeen, huh?

00:14:36.451 --> 00:14:39.357
I mean, that's nice and all,
but he's long gone, isn't he?

00:14:39.424 --> 00:14:40.928
Well... don't forget
that we used

00:14:40.995 --> 00:14:43.900
our first wish to
restore all of Cell's victims...

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:45.971
He was definitely among them...

00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:49.278
It's not unreasonable to think
that he's out there somewhere.

00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:50.915
[YAMCHA] I guess that
all makes sense...

00:14:50.981 --> 00:14:52.483
Still, man, what are you--?

00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:54.822
Hey, if you can't turn them
back into regular humans,

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:56.592
you can you at least get rid
of the bombs they're

carrying around
in their chests?

I mean that's
easy enough, right?

Yes. It is.

Why would you make a wish
like that, Krillin?

just felt bad for em...

to remove Seventeen's

00:17:37.882 --> 00:17:39.885
I seriously don't get it.

00:17:40.486 --> 00:17:41.957
[YAMCHA] Yeah... just stick
to fighting Piccolo,

00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:43.594
it's what you do best.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.100
[YAMCHA LAUGHS FOLLOWED
BY GROUP LAUGHTER]

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:49.872
It... feels weird,
our laughing about stuff...

00:17:49.939 --> 00:17:53.078
and not having Goku
around to join in like usual.

00:17:53.145 --> 00:17:54.548
[YAMCHA]
No kidding...

00:17:57.053 --> 00:17:58.389
I'm heading back home...

00:17:58.455 --> 00:18:01.796
Chiaotzu's probably
worried sick by now.

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:05.504
I guess... our paths might not
cross again in this lifetime...

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.075
Take care... All of you.

00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:09.110

You, too, my friend.

Say hey to Chiaotzu for me.

Of course... Gohan...

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.988
I'll never forget your father,

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:17.460
or the amazing
sacrifice he made...

00:18:17.527 --> 00:18:20.099
Take good care of
your mother, you hear?

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:21.168
Uh-huh!

00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:22.370
And you Trunks...

00:18:22.437 --> 00:18:23.438
You've grown strong enough

00:18:23.506 --> 00:18:25.777
to defeat the androids
in your time, easily...

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:27.681
Make good use of what
you've learned here...

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:28.983
You'll do fine.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.321
Right...! Thank you so much
for all of your help, Tien.

00:18:31.388 --> 00:18:32.824
Farewell.

00:18:34.094 --> 00:18:34.996

[GOHAN]
Thanks again!

00:18:38.102 --> 00:18:40.674
[YAMCHA] Well...
we should be going, too.

00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:42.010
When are you heading back...?

00:18:42.076 --> 00:18:43.312
Back to the future, I mean.

00:18:43.378 --> 00:18:45.349
I think I'll get a
full night's sleep...

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.053
and then I'll head out
in the morning.

00:18:47.119 --> 00:18:49.391
Kay, then... We'll swing
by to see you off.

00:18:49.457 --> 00:18:50.393
Right.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.630
So, uh, Piccolo...

00:18:51.696 --> 00:18:53.198
Are you gonna live up
here from now on?

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.169
Yes. Why do you ask?

00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:57.373
Is it all right if I drop
in once in a while?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.110
You had better.

00:19:00.112 --> 00:19:02.684

My dad really did all that?

Oh yea...!
When Cell dropped you,

I've ever seen before...
