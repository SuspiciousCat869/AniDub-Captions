trying to hit each other
with that strange light attack--

00:04:01.148 --> 00:04:02.384

must have knocked me out cold.

what went down?!

revived along with the others...

from the same model

as the old one so their powers
must have similar limitations...

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.464
[TIEN] No... there has to be
some way to do it...

00:09:42.532 --> 00:09:44.201
Just think!

00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:45.838
How about something like this?

00:09:45.904 --> 00:09:49.111
We have Shenron turn back
time to before Goku left--

00:09:49.178 --> 00:09:50.313
that'd work, wouldn't it?

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.817
[YAMCHA] Yeah...!
That's a great idea!

00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:54.823
[PICCOLO] Except that Cell would
also be brought back again ...

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:57.695
and we'd be right back
where we started.

00:09:57.762 --> 00:09:59.031
[KRILLIN]
Oh, yeah.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.233
[DENDE]
Hey-- I know!

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.538
We just have to take
our wish to Porunga instead.

00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:03.540
He could do it!

00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:05.511
Yes, of course...
the Namekian dragon

00:10:05.578 --> 00:10:07.515
doesn't have the same
limitations as Shenron.

00:10:07.582 --> 00:10:10.153
He can bring a person
back any number of times...

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.322
Well, okay...!

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:13.159
Then we just have to
get ourselves back to Namek!

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:14.495
That's easy, we
can zap straight

00:10:14.562 --> 00:10:16.399
there with wish number two!

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:19.572
[GOKU] Hey...!
Don't I get a say in this?

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:22.511
[GOKU]
Hi everybody! It's me!

00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:23.480
It's Goku!

00:10:23.547 --> 00:10:25.149
Dad... what's going on?

00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:26.687
[GOKU] I'm speaking to
you from Other World,

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:28.724
so I'll make it quick.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.862
Y'know... Bulma said
something to me years ago

00:10:30.928 --> 00:10:32.063
that's stuck with me...

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.536
She told me I was like a
magnet for all the bad guys

00:10:34.603 --> 00:10:36.038
that were always popping up...

00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:37.074
And if you think about it,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.344
that's really not
too far off the truth.

00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:40.648
[GOKU] I get the feeling
that Earth's gonna be

00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:43.486
way more peaceful if I
just stay where I am now.

00:10:43.553 --> 00:10:45.490
And King Kai agrees with me.

00:10:45.558 --> 00:10:47.662
I'm gonna miss you guys,
but don't worry,

00:10:47.728 --> 00:10:48.931
I'll be just fine up here...

00:10:48.997 --> 00:10:50.333
It's really not so bad.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.705
And King Kai says they're
gonna give me special treatment

00:10:52.772 --> 00:10:55.243
on account of all the times
I helped to save the Earth.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.181
[GOKU] Most people,
and definitely bad guys,

00:10:57.247 --> 00:10:58.517
just turn into spirits here,
but they're gonna

00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:00.353
let me keep my body.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.725
And if that's not enough,
I won't ever get any older.

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:04.729
And there are a bunch
of old fighting masters

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:06.299
here from before my time,

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:08.336
so it's not like I won't
have plenty to do.

00:11:08.403 --> 00:11:09.539
Should be fun!

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:11.510
King Kai's back to normal
thanks to Shenron,

00:11:11.576 --> 00:11:13.446
but he says he's gonna
take some time off

00:11:13.514 --> 00:11:14.616
and show me around,

00:11:14.683 --> 00:11:16.887
so I've already got one
friend to keep me company.

00:11:16.954 --> 00:11:19.191
[GOKU] I know it's kind of a
raw deal for you and your Mom,

00:11:19.258 --> 00:11:22.598
Gohan, but you don't
have to wish me back, okay?

00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:26.739
Besides, son, you're so
strong now I have

00:11:26.806 --> 00:11:28.376
nothing left to teach you!

00:11:28.442 --> 00:11:32.050
But, that doesn't
mean I don't need you!

00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:34.088
[GOKU] I'm sorry, guys,
I'm outta time...

00:11:34.154 --> 00:11:35.758
But take care, okay...?

00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:37.261
Live your lives to the fullest,

00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:39.131
and I'll see ya again
when you're done!

00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:40.735
Goodbye!

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.170

00:11:47.181 --> 00:11:48.750
[KRILLIN]
Y'know...

00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:51.155
...he seemed pretty cheerful
given the circumstances,

00:11:51.222 --> 00:11:53.259
so I guess he's okay
with how things turned out.

00:11:53.326 --> 00:11:55.832
Yeah... suppose he's always
been laid back like that,

00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:58.202
ever since he was a kid.

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.077
Where did it go...?!

00:12:02.143 --> 00:12:04.516
My tail! It's all gone!

00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:05.651
Eh. Oh well!

00:12:05.718 --> 00:12:08.657
Guess...
nothin's changed... huh?

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:10.861
Yeah you're right...

00:12:10.928 --> 00:12:12.264
[YOUNG GOKU]
Where's my Power Pole?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.170
Kay, I'm off...! Yahoooooo!

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:16.305
And he's been rushing on

00:12:16.372 --> 00:12:18.577
ahead of us all the
years that we've known him.

00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:20.747
Eat this. You'll feel better.

00:12:20.814 --> 00:12:22.585
There was no one
else like him...

00:12:22.652 --> 00:12:24.488
He was always willing
to show mercy,

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:25.991
even to an enemy,
and no matter how

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:27.427
powerful he became,

00:12:27.494 --> 00:12:30.934
he valued his friends
over anything else.

00:12:32.103 --> 00:12:35.510
My dad was always kind,
to everybody who met him...

00:12:39.284 --> 00:12:41.288
...and he made me feel brave,

00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:44.729
even when things
were looking really bad.

00:12:51.075 --> 00:12:53.947
Thank you, Dad...
for everything.

Uh... you do know...

00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:22.771
I have been waiting for your
second wish this whole time...

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.142
Any day now...

00:13:29.384 --> 00:13:31.389
[SHENRON]
Well, how about it...?

00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:33.893
Speak your second wish.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.900
Whatever you desire,
I shall grant.

00:13:36.966 --> 00:13:39.238
[YAMCHA] So, if not Goku,
then what? Anybody?

00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:42.310
[TIEN] Shenron's going to vanish
if we don't decide soon.

00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:46.853
Have you no wish?

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.389
[YAMCHA LAUGHS]

00:13:48.456 --> 00:13:49.693
I've got this lady-friend
who'd really like

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:50.994
an expensive necklace,

00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:54.000
if nobody else has a more
selfless wish in mind.

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:55.637
That okay?

00:13:57.941 --> 00:13:59.646
No point wasting it, right?!

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:03.285
[SHENRON] A necklace?
Is that your wish?

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:07.528
Hey... Shenron...
Is there any chance

00:14:07.594 --> 00:14:10.066
that you can transform
Androids 17 and 18

00:14:10.133 --> 00:14:12.938
back into the
people they used to be?

00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:15.777
That fool!

00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:19.785
This I cannot do...

00:14:19.852 --> 00:14:23.425
I am sorry. The androids
are beings whose power

00:14:23.492 --> 00:14:25.697
far exceeds my own.

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:30.874
[SHENRON] I cannot revert them
to the humans they once were.

00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:33.445
[KRILLIN] I was afraid you'd
say something like that.

00:14:34.447 --> 00:14:36.384
Why include Seventeen, huh?

00:14:36.451 --> 00:14:39.357
I mean, that's nice and all,
but he's long gone, isn't he?

00:14:39.424 --> 00:14:40.928
Well... don't forget
that we used

00:14:40.995 --> 00:14:43.900
our first wish to
restore all of Cell's victims...

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:45.971
He was definitely among them...

00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:49.278
It's not unreasonable to think
that he's out there somewhere.

00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:50.915
[YAMCHA] I guess that
all makes sense...

00:14:50.981 --> 00:14:52.483
Still, man, what are you--?

00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:54.822
Hey, if you can't turn them
back into regular humans,

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:56.592
you can you at least get rid
of the bombs they're

carrying around
in their chests?

I mean that's
easy enough, right?

Yes. It is.

Why would you make a wish
like that, Krillin?

just felt bad for em...

to remove Seventeen's

00:17:37.882 --> 00:17:39.885
I seriously don't get it.

00:17:40.486 --> 00:17:41.957
[YAMCHA] Yeah... just stick
to fighting Piccolo,

00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:43.594
it's what you do best.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.100
[YAMCHA LAUGHS FOLLOWED
BY GROUP LAUGHTER]

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:49.872
It... feels weird,
our laughing about stuff...

00:17:49.939 --> 00:17:53.078
and not having Goku
around to join in like usual.

00:17:53.145 --> 00:17:54.548
[YAMCHA]
No kidding...

00:17:57.053 --> 00:17:58.389
I'm heading back home...

00:17:58.455 --> 00:18:01.796
Chiaotzu's probably
worried sick by now.

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:05.504
I guess... our paths might not
cross again in this lifetime...

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.075
Take care... All of you.

00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:09.110
[YAMCHA]
You, too, my friend.

00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:10.313
See ya, Tien...

00:18:10.379 --> 00:18:12.117
Say hey to Chiaotzu for me.

00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:13.653
Of course... Gohan...

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.988
I'll never forget your father,

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:17.460
or the amazing
sacrifice he made...

00:18:17.527 --> 00:18:20.099
Take good care of
your mother, you hear?

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:21.168
Uh-huh!

00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:22.370
And you Trunks...

00:18:22.437 --> 00:18:23.438
You've grown strong enough

00:18:23.506 --> 00:18:25.777
to defeat the androids
in your time, easily...

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:27.681
Make good use of what
you've learned here...

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:28.983
You'll do fine.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.321
Right...! Thank you so much
for all of your help, Tien.

00:18:31.388 --> 00:18:32.824
Farewell.

00:18:34.094 --> 00:18:34.996
Bye!

00:18:35.063 --> 00:18:36.231
[GOHAN]
Thanks again!

00:18:38.102 --> 00:18:40.674
[YAMCHA] Well...
we should be going, too.

00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:42.010
When are you heading back...?

00:18:42.076 --> 00:18:43.312
Back to the future, I mean.

00:18:43.378 --> 00:18:45.349
I think I'll get a
full night's sleep...

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.053
and then I'll head out
in the morning.

00:18:47.119 --> 00:18:49.391
Kay, then... We'll swing
by to see you off.

00:18:49.457 --> 00:18:50.393
Right.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.630
So, uh, Piccolo...

00:18:51.696 --> 00:18:53.198
Are you gonna live up
here from now on?

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.169
Yes. Why do you ask?

00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:57.373
Is it all right if I drop
in once in a while?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.110
You had better.

00:19:00.112 --> 00:19:02.684
[DENDE] Congratulations on
saving the Earth, everyone!

00:19:02.751 --> 00:19:04.120
[GOHAN] Bye, Dende.
I'll see ya later.

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:06.058
Don't be a stranger, okay?

00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:07.394
[GOHAN]
Take care, Mr. Popo.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.563
Mm-hm.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.172
C'mon, let's go!

00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:15.075
Tomorrow is a whole new day!

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:21.722
See ya soooon!

Until then, guys!

00:19:37.654 --> 00:19:39.491
[TRUNKS]
My dad really did all that?

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:41.095
Oh yea...!
When Cell dropped you,

00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:42.263
that old man of yours

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.735
blew his stack worse than
I've ever seen before...

00:19:44.802 --> 00:19:47.774
And for a hothead like Vegeta,
that's really sayin' somethin'.

00:19:47.841 --> 00:19:49.845
Yeah? No kidding...

00:19:51.615 --> 00:19:53.185
For me, huh?

Oh, Mom... It's okay...

00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:02.971
Even though he's
not here anymore,

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:05.009
we'll always have him
in our hearts, right...?

00:20:05.076 --> 00:20:06.178
And it's not as though
we're not gonna

00:20:06.244 --> 00:20:07.447
see him again someday.

00:20:07.515 --> 00:20:08.749
That's right...

Your son is a smart boy...
Chichi... Goku thought of you,

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:15.597
