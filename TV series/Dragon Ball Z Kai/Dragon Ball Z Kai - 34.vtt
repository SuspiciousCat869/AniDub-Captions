that Captain Ginyu creep,

00:09:37.454 --> 00:09:40.092
can you believe that?
We even hid...

00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:42.598
So from the looks of things
you not only defeated the guy,

00:09:42.632 --> 00:09:45.002
but you convinced his
partner to join our side...

00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:48.777
Sure sure... Whatever you
say, kid... Why not...

00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.148
So you dug up
the Dragon Balls?

00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:53.788
Well... we're not
completely useless, y'know...

00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:55.090
Once we got the radar,

00:09:55.123 --> 00:09:57.060
finding where they were
was no problem at all...

00:09:57.093 --> 00:10:00.333
Wait, you've got a radar?
So, we hid them for nothing.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.605
You didn't actually manage
to make a wish, did you?

00:10:02.638 --> 00:10:04.776
That's just it...
We couldn't get 'em to work.

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:07.347
We tried summoning the
dragon the way we do on Earth,

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.451
but I guess the way
you do it here is different,

00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:11.756
'cause he was
a total no-show.

get them to work...

whole "scouter" thing

you got going on?

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:27.555
You trying to make some kind
of freaky fashion statement?

00:10:27.588 --> 00:10:29.191
Not exactly.

00:10:29.224 --> 00:10:32.932
Get out of there!
Whoever that is, it's not Dad!

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:36.338
Hurry, Krillin!
Run away!

Huh. Another one just
like our old friend! Crafty!

power level concealed.

it all the way down to zero

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:52.204
if they need to.

00:10:52.237 --> 00:10:54.208
[Krillin] Hey...
What's the big idea Goku?

00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:56.411
[Gohan]
It's not really him, Krillin!

00:10:56.445 --> 00:10:58.416
That's what I'm
trying to tell you!

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.152
Huh?

00:11:01.422 --> 00:11:03.694
But... How could
he not be Goku?

00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:05.631
I mean look at him...

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.568
Who the heck
else could he be?!

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:09.104
I... I don't know...

00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:11.976
But... that's not my
dad, I'm sure of it.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:17.788
[Laughter]

00:11:19.057 --> 00:11:21.362
You see right
through me, kid...

00:11:21.395 --> 00:11:26.071
This body was much stronger
than my old one, so I traded up.

00:11:26.104 --> 00:11:27.207
You did what?!!

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.112
[Vegeta thinking]
That bastard switched bodies.

00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:31.883
And now...

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:44.942
It's the Ginyu Force
Red Magma... Jeice.

00:11:48.283 --> 00:11:50.788
And last but not least...!

00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:54.595
It's the leader of
the Ginyu Force!

00:11:54.629 --> 00:12:01.976
The one and only
Captain Ginyu!

00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:16.640
You stole Goku's
body from him...?

00:12:16.673 --> 00:12:18.409
How is that even possible?!

00:12:18.442 --> 00:12:19.713
[Ginyu]
Even if I explained,

00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:22.518
I doubt you could wrap
your minds around it...

00:12:22.551 --> 00:12:24.689
So instead...

00:12:24.722 --> 00:12:26.125
I think I'll try

00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:28.564
putting this hundred-eighty
thousand power level to use.

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:30.568
Wait! No...!
Please don't...!

00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:31.870
You've gotta snap
out of this, Goku.

00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:33.239
You're being controlled!

00:12:33.272 --> 00:12:35.209
Like from hypnosis
or something!

00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:44.328
[Vegeta thinking] Whether
he's actually swapped bodies

00:12:44.361 --> 00:12:46.165
or is using some
kind of mind control,

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:48.436
the fact remains that
Kakarot's strength

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:50.039
belongs to Ginyu now...

00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:53.445
Dammit... our situation's
just gone from bad to worse.

00:12:53.479 --> 00:12:56.620
[Goku (Ginyu's Body)] This is
bad... I can't even sense

00:12:56.653 --> 00:13:00.126
anyone's energy
in this stupid body...

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.232
Hold on a sec...
That's it...!

00:13:03.266 --> 00:13:06.606
If I'm having such a hard
time adjusting to his body...

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:08.275
then he probably
hasn't had enough time

00:13:08.308 --> 00:13:10.279
to get used to
mine yet, either!

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.722
[Ginyu (Goku's body)] C'mon, I'm
just gettin' warmed up...!

00:13:14.756 --> 00:13:16.225
You think this is brutal--

00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:18.630
wait 'til I've cranked this
body up to its full potential!

00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:19.397
[beeping]

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:22.505
[Jeice]
Captain Ginyu...!

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:25.409
Looks like we've got some
company on the way, sir.

00:13:29.653 --> 00:13:31.956
[Goku]
There you are!

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:42.979
[Ginyu] And here I thought
you'd be out of commission.

00:13:43.012 --> 00:13:45.383
If that's the worst
damage I can do to myself,

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:47.755
I was right to change.

00:13:47.788 --> 00:13:51.061
Krillin! Gohan!
Listen carefully!

00:13:51.094 --> 00:13:52.965
That looks like
me, but it's not!

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.537
Our bodies have been switched!

00:13:56.939 --> 00:14:00.246
Y-You mean
he's telling the truth?!

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.256
But... That means...
You're my Dad!

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:09.565
[Ginyu's voice] Woo-hoo...!
Ah, that's the stuff!

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:13.005
Y-You can't be...
You just can't!

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:14.743
Gohan! Listen...!

00:14:14.776 --> 00:14:16.947
That guy up
there really is Ginyu!

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.482
But he's not as
strong as he was!

00:14:18.516 --> 00:14:20.888
If you two team up, there's
no way he can beat you!

00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:22.223
Give him
everything you've got!

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:23.860
[Krillin]
What are talking about?

00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:27.067
Have you lost your mind too?!

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.004
[Ginyu] No way I can
beat them, is there?

00:14:29.038 --> 00:14:31.676
Need I remind you
how strong this body is?

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:34.716
We're talking a hundred-eighty
thousand power level here!

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.254
I'll slaughter 'em!

00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:40.026
Well... Only one
way to find out, huh?

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:42.363
See, that's still...
my body...

00:14:42.396 --> 00:14:45.103
And just because you're in
it... well that doesn't mean

00:14:45.136 --> 00:14:47.307
you've figured out
how to control it yet...

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.779
Unless your mind and
body are totally in sync,

00:14:49.812 --> 00:14:51.449
you won't get much
power out of it...

00:14:51.482 --> 00:14:53.987
and forget the Kaio-ken!

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.356
You really think
such an obvious bluff

00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:57.995
is gonna have
any effect on me...?

00:14:58.029 --> 00:15:01.369
If there's only one
way to find out, let's do it!

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:02.136
Jeice!

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.607
Sir!

00:15:03.707 --> 00:15:04.843
[beeping]

00:15:04.876 --> 00:15:15.129
[Powering up yell]

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:18.369
[Laughing]

00:15:18.402 --> 00:15:19.505
Have a look...!

00:15:19.538 --> 00:15:21.709
Tell our friends how high
my power level is now!

00:15:21.743 --> 00:15:27.254
[beeping]

00:15:27.287 --> 00:15:30.660
I-It's only at
twenty-three thousand...

00:15:30.694 --> 00:15:33.332
What?!
Stop mumbling! Speak up!

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:38.777
It's... Well...
Twenty-three thousand, Sir!

00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:40.279
[laughing]

00:15:40.312 --> 00:15:44.755
That's right!
You hear that...?!

00:15:44.788 --> 00:15:47.194
A whopping
twenty-three thousand!

00:15:47.227 --> 00:15:51.536
How's that for power?!

00:15:51.569 --> 00:15:52.871
Wait, what?

00:15:52.905 --> 00:15:56.044
That...
that's what it says...

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.054
[Ginyu]
Twenty-three thousand...?

00:16:01.087 --> 00:16:03.927
But that's ridiculous;
how could it be that low?

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.298
It's like I was
trying to tell you...

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.336
You need to be in tune
with your body's energy

00:16:08.369 --> 00:16:10.607
before you can push
it to its full potential,

00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:13.513
and that takes a
lot of training!

00:16:13.546 --> 00:16:15.149
Krillin! Gohan!

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.019
Show this
poser what I mean!

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:19.457
[yelling]

00:16:20.894 --> 00:16:24.234
Dammit!
This shouldn't be happening!

00:16:24.268 --> 00:16:27.440
It's true...! This guy
may have Goku's body,

00:16:27.474 --> 00:16:30.915
but he sure as hell doesn't have
his strength! Let's do this...

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.483
Right!

00:16:34.755 --> 00:16:36.759
Now, Gohan!

00:16:42.136 --> 00:16:43.339
Do something!

00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:45.777
It's... Dad...

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.457
Gohan! What the heck
were you waiting for?

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.329
I-I'm sorry...
But he looks like Dad.

00:16:55.363 --> 00:16:57.568
I couldn't bring myself
to actually try to hit him,

00:16:57.602 --> 00:16:59.471
you know?

00:16:59.906 --> 00:17:01.408
Trust me, I get it...

00:17:01.442 --> 00:17:03.780
Goku's my best friend; the last
person I'd ever wanna fight...

00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:06.185
But... you're just gonna
have to focus on the fact

00:17:06.218 --> 00:17:09.959
that it's really
Ginyu in there... Okay?

00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:11.730
[Goku thinking]
Come on, guys...

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:13.667
Kay... I think I'm ready...

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.069
Right.

00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:47.801
[Ginyu] Jeice!
Am I alone in this...?!

00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:50.039
Feel free to jump in any time!

00:17:50.072 --> 00:17:51.308
Right...! Coming!

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:52.778
[Vegeta]
Not so fast...

00:17:52.812 --> 00:17:55.850
I'm afraid you're going to
have to get through me first.

00:17:58.322 --> 00:18:00.392
[Goku thinking]
Vegeta...

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.672
You little punk!

00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:19.063
If that's all you've got...
I almost feel sorry for you!

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:22.871
This... can't be...!
This body has got

00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:26.278
a one hundred eighty thousand
power level I've seen it!

00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:27.481
[Krillin] I'm guessing

00:18:27.515 --> 00:18:29.618
you're not a very
good listener, are you?

00:18:30.352 --> 00:18:31.889
Face it... your
mind and that body

00:18:31.922 --> 00:18:34.127
have no chance
of being in sync.

00:18:34.996 --> 00:18:36.064
You might as well surrender

00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:37.835
while you still have
some pride left.

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:39.805
Me...?
Surrender...?

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:42.811
The one-and-only
Captain Ginyu?

00:18:44.281 --> 00:18:46.752
You're out of your mind!

00:18:49.023 --> 00:18:50.359
You little...!

00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:51.495
[Jeice] You've got more
nerve than you do brains...

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:54.167
challenging me at
your power level!

00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:59.143
That's right...
keep talking big.

00:19:03.318 --> 00:19:05.624
How did you manage to
creep in under the radar?

00:19:05.657 --> 00:19:07.393
Our scouters should've
been able to scope you out

00:19:07.427 --> 00:19:08.495
from the other
side of the planet!

00:19:08.529 --> 00:19:09.932
Anyone ever tell you,
you fools

00:19:09.965 --> 00:19:12.604
put way too much stock in
those silly little gadgets?

00:19:12.637 --> 00:19:13.907
I'd think fighting
these Earthlings

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.378
would have taught
you that by now.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.720
Of course, since
you're about to die,

00:19:20.754 --> 00:19:22.390
I'd say it's a moot point!

00:19:22.423 --> 00:19:23.594
Don't get cocky, Vegeta!

00:19:23.627 --> 00:19:25.363
I'm still a member
of the Ginyu Force...

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:28.402
the greatest team of fighters
this universe has ever seen!

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:31.876
No halfwit space gorilla is
gonna get the best of me!

00:19:36.586 --> 00:19:40.059
[Vegeta Laughing]

00:19:40.093 --> 00:19:42.965
So transparent, Jeice.
Tough as you sound,

00:19:42.998 --> 00:19:45.871
a novice could detect the
twinge of fear in your voice.

00:19:45.904 --> 00:19:48.075
What?!

00:19:48.109 --> 00:19:49.812
I'm stronger than you think...
Take a look

00:19:49.846 --> 00:19:52.384
at your precious scouter
if you don't believe me.

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:55.824
Oh, sure-- One look
at your power level

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:58.963
and I'll run away
screaming like a little girl!

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:02.170
[beeping]

00:20:02.204 --> 00:20:06.345
Wha... What the...?

00:20:06.378 --> 00:20:11.021
Ah, piece of junk!

00:20:11.054 --> 00:20:13.125
[Vegeta]
Oh, it's not malfunctioning.

00:20:13.158 --> 00:20:14.895
You... bastard!

00:20:14.928 --> 00:20:17.500
You see, each time I've
crawled back from the brink,

00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:19.304
I've grown more powerful--

00:20:19.337 --> 00:20:22.376
to the point that I scarcely
know my own strength anymore.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.882
And at this rate-- there's
no limit to how strong

00:20:24.915 --> 00:20:26.519
I can become...

00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:29.257
I belong to an
elite warrior class;

00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:31.528
I represent the
pinnacle of my race...

00:20:31.562 --> 00:20:36.438
And at last, it seems I'm truly
discovering what that means.

00:20:36.472 --> 00:20:39.912
I'm becoming a Super Saiyan.

00:20:39.945 --> 00:20:41.949
You expect me to believe that?!

00:20:41.982 --> 00:20:43.587
[laughing]

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.657
The old legends speak
of the Super Saiyans'

00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:48.664
ruthlessness and unquenchable
thirst for battle!

00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.534
This is where I hold
the edge over Kakarot--

00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:53.239
he's not the stone
cold monster I am!

00:20:53.272 --> 00:20:57.413
No... You... You Lie!

00:21:17.821 --> 00:21:19.191
Please, spare me!

00:21:19.224 --> 00:21:19.992
I beg--

00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:25.537
[explosion]

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.375
[Narrator] Is Vegeta truly
becoming a Super Saiyan?

00:21:28.408 --> 00:21:31.281
Can Goku regain his
body from Captain Ginyu?

00:21:31.314 --> 00:21:34.521
Find out, next
Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:35.323 --> 00:21:45.510
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:38.115 --> 00:22:39.519
[Goku] Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:39.552 --> 00:22:40.921
That's enough, Vegeta!

00:22:40.954 --> 00:22:43.392
You're going to destroy my
body if you keep this up!

00:22:43.425 --> 00:22:45.664
[Ginyu] If this body
refuses to cooperate,

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:48.001
I'll just hop around
'til I find one that will!

00:22:48.035 --> 00:22:50.741
Who needs immortality
when you can do this?

00:22:50.774 --> 00:22:53.746
Whatever that creep's got up
my sleeve, I don't like it...

00:22:53.779 --> 00:22:56.719
Next time, on
Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:59.892 --> 00:23:00.894
[Ginyu] Just you wait!

00:23:00.927 --> 00:23:04.000
I'll be someone else
in the blink of an eye!
