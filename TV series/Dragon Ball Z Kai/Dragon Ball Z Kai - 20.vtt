00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.407
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.979
Bulma, Gohan, and
Krillin safely landed

00:00:06.012 --> 00:00:08.985
on planet Namek in search
of new Dragon Balls...

00:00:09.018 --> 00:00:11.222
Meanwhile, Vegeta
sprang back into action

00:00:11.255 --> 00:00:12.926
and headed for Namek himself,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.263
landing just moments
after our heroes.

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:16.701
Daunting though it seemed,

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:18.236
our heroes still had no idea

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.940
that a far greater
threat than Vegeta

00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:22.044
was already on the scene.

00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:25.183
Forces collide
on Namek... Now!

[SURBORDINATE BONNET HEAD]
Sire, here it is!

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.191
[FRIEZA] Good. Now only
three remain to be "discovered."

00:02:09.225 --> 00:02:11.630
[chuckles]

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.137
[FRIEZA] Hold
on to those two

00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:16.974
as you would your
own life, Dodoria...

00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.848
We aren't the only ones
searching for them, after all.

00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:22.451
[ZARBON] Hmm...

00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:26.292
Ah... My lord,
it would appear

00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:29.833
that Cui has touched down in
pursuit of Vegeta as I speak.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.405
[ZARBON] Also, the
two large power levels

00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:33.908
I was picking up earlier...

00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:35.411
shortly before
Vegeta's arrival,

00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:37.281
they seem to
have disappeared.

00:02:37.314 --> 00:02:38.751
But don't worry...

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:40.287
Our men are currently
combing the area

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.657
where the
readings came from...

00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:44.461
so... in any case, we
should find them soon.

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:46.667
[FRIEZA] Fine. But our
main concern right now

00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:49.171
is how best to deal with
that traitorous Vegeta

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:50.341
before he becomes a pest.

00:02:50.374 --> 00:02:51.577
[ZARBON] With respect, lord,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.514
the problem is
no problem at all.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:56.820
As I said, Cui is en route to
mete out punishment right now.

00:02:56.853 --> 00:02:59.424
Tensions have been building
between the two for years.

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:02.031
And considering that their
powers are so evenly matched,

00:03:02.064 --> 00:03:03.701
however the battle pans out,

00:03:03.735 --> 00:03:06.807
Vegeta won't emerge
from it unscathed.

00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:12.217
[CUI] Where are
you hiding...? Ha!

00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.159
[CUI] There we
are now... Ha...!

00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:17.996
Sticking out like
a sore thumb...

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.271
A sore thumb that Frieza will
be pleased to see me chop off!

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:24.042
[VEGETA] Oh Cui...
Think now...

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:25.511
Do you really believe
you'll be the one

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:27.214
to take down the
likes of me...?

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:29.786
If so, by all means
don't hold back!

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.855
[CUI]
Hahahaha!

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.357
There's that mouth again,

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:34.663
trying to talk all
tough when any moron

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:37.133
could see the truth
by reading his scouter:

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:39.338
that my power
puts yours to shame!

00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:44.716
[BULMA]
Whatever happens,

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:46.787
we can't just sit
here like this...

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.891
So, uh... Guess I should
let the two of you

00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:51.328
get started on
your search--

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.670
[BULMA]
Now...

00:03:54.703 --> 00:03:56.038
Like I said, I should be
back in a couple of months...

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:57.675
You boys stay
out a trouble...

00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:02.250
[GOHAN] Heads up, guys...!
Somebody's coming!

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:08.730
[SUBORDINATE BLONDE]
I'd say those power levels

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:10.568
were comin' from
somewhere around here.

00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:12.104
[SUBORDINATE PURPLE SKULL]
Probably one of the locals.

00:04:12.137 --> 00:04:13.439
[BULMA]
Well, who is it?

00:04:13.473 --> 00:04:16.011
[KRILLIN] Uh... Maybe
one of the Namekians?

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.857
[BULMA] I... I don't think
those two are native...

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.330
[SUBORDINATE BLONDE]
Hey... look.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.033
[SUBORDINATE PURPLE SKULL]
I don't know who they are,

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.837
but they're not
from around here!

00:04:30.407 --> 00:04:31.376
[SUBORDINATE BLONDE]
Heh heh heh heh...

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:32.579
Well it's not like

00:04:32.612 --> 00:04:34.048
we gotta ask them
their names, now is it?

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.651
We have strict
orders to kill whoever

00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:39.759
we come across on this
ball of dirt. Heh heh heh...

00:04:41.664 --> 00:04:43.199
[BULMA] Those suits
look familiar...

00:04:43.232 --> 00:04:45.203
[KRILLIN] They're identical
to the ones the Saiyans wore,

00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:47.474
but these guys aren't Saiyan...

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.978
[GOHAN] Yeah,
you're right!

00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:50.982
[KRILLIN] Eeaah...
I don't know what's going on,

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:52.585
but I've got a bad feelin'...

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:53.854
[BULMA] Yeah,
no kidding!

00:04:53.888 --> 00:04:55.557
I mean those faces
don't exactly scream out:

00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:57.461
"Hey, you wanna
be friends with us?"

00:04:57.495 --> 00:04:58.797
[KRILLIN]
Gohan...

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.433
Just... charge your energy,
but keep it hidden.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:01.703
Don't let 'em see
your full strength.

00:05:01.737 --> 00:05:03.072
[GOHAN]
Okay.

00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:08.283
[SUBORDINATE PURPLE SKULL]
What are these losers,

00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:09.652
a bunch of
tourists or somethin'?

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:12.792
Their power is pathetic...
Talk about a mercy kill.

00:05:12.826 --> 00:05:13.927
[SUBORDINATE BLONDE]
Heh heh heh heh...

00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:15.263
First thing's first:

00:05:15.296 --> 00:05:17.401
let's guarantee they stay put.

00:05:17.434 --> 00:05:19.606

Sounds like a plan.

[SUBORDINATE PURPLE SKULL]
Sorry, kiddos...

00:05:28.658 --> 00:05:31.329
I guess this wasn't a good
time to go sightseeing?

Hey-hey! Did you hear that?

[SUBORDINATE BLONDE]
Not very nice.

have feelings, too!

are skyrocketing!

00:05:53.006 --> 00:05:53.974
[KRILLIN] Showtime.

00:05:54.007 --> 00:05:55.511
[GOHAN] Right!

00:06:08.436 --> 00:06:10.908
[KRILLIN]
Heh hey! Nice moves!

00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:13.847
[BULMA] Who cares
about your moves?!

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.468
[BULMA] What are we
supposed to do about that?

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:31.248
[FRIEZA]
Something troubles you...

00:06:31.282 --> 00:06:33.152
What is it, Zarbon?

00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:34.689
[ZARBON] Yes...
Well, my lord...

00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:37.895
It concerns the men who
were mobilized earlier.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.634
[ZARBON] The... uh...
two power readings

00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:42.838
they were sent to investigate
not only reappeared,

00:06:42.872 --> 00:06:44.943
but apparently
whoever they belong

00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:46.614
to overwhelmed our
men before dropping

00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:48.717
below the radar again...

00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:51.723
[FRIEZA] Oh? Well now,
isn't that bizarre...

00:06:51.757 --> 00:06:54.395
You're certain Vegeta's
not behind it somehow?

00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:55.898
[ZARBON] Yes lord,
quite certain...

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:57.535
We're still tracking
Vegeta separately

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.806
and these read at about
fifteen-hundred each.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.910
[FRIEZA] Ah,
fifteen-hundred, eh...?

00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:03.647
Well... I think
we can safely let

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.186
that little mystery
sort itself out.

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:07.387
They're insignificant...

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.757
[FRIEZA] And...

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:11.763
they can be easily eliminated,
if the need arises.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.750
[BULMA] It's hopeless...!
I'll never get back...!

00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:25.324
I'm stuck on this heap for
the rest of my natural life!

00:07:25.357 --> 00:07:27.427
[KRILLIN] C'mon,
Bulma, don't be like that.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.264
Let's just focus on
getting away from here

00:07:29.298 --> 00:07:30.366
and findin' someplace safe

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.203
before anyone
else shows up, okay?

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:33.607
[GOHAN] Yeah,
Krillin's right.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.477
Those two weren't alone,
there's more of 'em out there.

00:07:35.512 --> 00:07:37.381
And... if they're
friends of Vegeta's,

00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:40.955
I don't think we wanna
be here to meet 'em.

00:07:40.988 --> 00:07:42.659
[KRILLIN] This is
just a minor setback...

00:07:42.692 --> 00:07:44.094
[GOHAN] That thing
was built here...

00:07:44.127 --> 00:07:47.100
I'll bet the Namekians'll
fix it for us if we ask 'em.

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:53.413
[BULMA] Yeah, well...
What if we can't find them?

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:55.083
[KRILLIN]
Bulma, don't...

00:07:58.623 --> 00:08:00.928
[VEGETA] Heh...
So you did come...

00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:02.765
Not too smart.

00:08:13.553 --> 00:08:15.490
[CUI] Oh, this is
so refreshing...

00:08:15.524 --> 00:08:16.827
You have no idea

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.731
how long I've been looking
forward to this day...

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:20.835
Now... Whaddya say
we finally settle

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:23.874
the score between us
like we were meant to?

00:08:23.907 --> 00:08:26.513
[CUI] That is...
if you're feeling up to it.

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:28.382
[VEGETA] As we
were meant, you say?

00:08:28.416 --> 00:08:30.053
[chuckles]

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:32.825
Yes... I do believe
I'm feeling up to it...

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:34.227
In fact, this is
the perfect time

00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:37.034
to showcase a few new
tricks I learned on Earth...

00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:38.804
[CUI] What tricks?
Like running away...?

00:08:38.838 --> 00:08:41.442
I really don't see
anything new about that...

00:08:41.476 --> 00:08:45.083
[VEGETA] I've learned
how to conceal my power.

00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:47.988
[CUI] What the...?
His power level is rising!

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:50.561
[VEGETA]
That's right...

00:08:50.594 --> 00:08:51.563
Now remind me--

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:52.699
what was it you
said back there

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:55.303
about your power
putting mine to shame?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.942
[CUI]
B-But... But how...?!

00:08:57.975 --> 00:09:00.146
The two of us have always
been on par with each other!

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.117
[VEGETA] Imbecile...!
My body's been subjected

00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:04.990
to combat situations you
could only dream of...!

00:09:05.023 --> 00:09:07.561
The battle on Earth
nearly claimed my life!

00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:09.766
Do you really think I'd
be on par with someone

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.306
content to hide behind
Frieza his whole career?

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:14.909
Yaaaahhhh...!

00:09:14.943 --> 00:09:16.713
[CUI]
N-Nineteen, no, twenty,

00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:19.853
no... twenty-one...
twenty-two thousand...!

00:09:19.886 --> 00:09:21.188
[crash]

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.694
[DODORIA] What
happened, Zarbon?

00:09:23.727 --> 00:09:25.698
[ZARBON] I'm...
not entirely certain.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:26.866
A malfunction, perhaps.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.637
I had my scouter
tuned to Vegeta,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.773
but it just
showed a power level

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:31.643
of over twenty-two
thousand...

00:09:31.676 --> 00:09:32.912
[DODORIA]
Oh, come on...

00:09:32.946 --> 00:09:34.649
I told you you should've
upgraded your scouter

00:09:34.682 --> 00:09:36.787
to one of the new
models like mine.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.590
The old ones were
always glitchy...

00:09:38.624 --> 00:09:43.266
Let me take a look.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:44.569
[ZARBON]
What's your reading?

00:09:44.602 --> 00:09:46.438
[DODORIA] Wha...?
This is impossible...

00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:48.476
Mine must be on
the blink as well...

00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:50.514
It's saying he's at
twenty-four thousand!

00:09:50.547 --> 00:09:51.783
[ZARBON]
That's absurd...

00:09:51.817 --> 00:09:53.553
Something must be
interfering with the scan;

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:55.189
otherwise that
means Vegeta's power

00:09:55.223 --> 00:09:56.827
has surpassed our own...!

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.630
[DODORIA] No there's...
there's no way.

00:09:58.663 --> 00:10:01.503
His power level was maybe
eighteen-thousand at best.

00:10:01.536 --> 00:10:02.738
[FRIEZA]
Hahahahaha...

00:10:02.772 --> 00:10:04.809
Hardly a surprise, if
you think about it...

00:10:04.842 --> 00:10:07.213
We must remember that
Vegeta's been on the frontlines

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:08.884
for some time now...

00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:11.422
Heh... I do believe
this Earth must have

00:10:11.455 --> 00:10:13.360
taught our friend
a thing or two.

00:10:13.393 --> 00:10:14.729
[ZARBON]
But, sir...

00:10:14.763 --> 00:10:16.432
[FRIEZA] He's only at
twenty-four thousand, right?

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:17.701
With both your
efforts combined,

00:10:17.735 --> 00:10:20.473
that should be child's
play; a mere exercise...

00:10:20.508 --> 00:10:23.078
Surely the thought
doesn't trouble you?

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:29.559
[CUI] Wait! Just
hear me out, okay...?

00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:31.428
I've got the craziest idea...

00:10:31.461 --> 00:10:33.399
Whaddya say me
and you team up?

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:35.704
We... We could
take on Frieza...!

00:10:35.738 --> 00:10:37.441
I mean, I don't
like the guy...!

00:10:37.474 --> 00:10:38.610
I never liked the guy--

00:10:38.644 --> 00:10:40.781
I was just followin'
orders! You know!

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:42.852
[CUI] Come on,
Vegeta...! Think...!

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:44.321
We could have the
whole ball of wax

00:10:44.355 --> 00:10:45.791
all to ourselves, man...!

00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:47.996
We can start right now
with Zarbon and Dodoria

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:49.533
and just work our on way up!

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.102
[VEGETA] Spare me
this pathetic display

00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:54.809
and scrounge up some
dignity before you die!

00:10:56.579 --> 00:10:59.050
[CUI] J-Just trust
me... Please...

00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:02.056
[CUI] Ah!
My lord! Finally!

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.594
[VEGETA]
What?!

00:11:03.694 --> 00:11:05.764
[CUI] Made ya
look!!! Hyaaa!

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.072
[explosions]

00:11:12.678 --> 00:11:15.684
[explosion]

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:21.696
[CUI]
Huh?

00:11:21.729 --> 00:11:29.912
Ha ha... ha ha ha...
Haha... hahahahahaha!!

00:11:31.282 --> 00:11:32.618
[CUI] I can't believe
you actually fell

00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:33.653
for that old gag!

00:11:33.687 --> 00:11:35.023
Fat lot of good
all that power

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:37.260
did you at the
moment of truth, huh?

00:11:37.294 --> 00:11:38.763
[VEGETA]
Really?

00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:40.634
[VEGETA] So that
was it, then...?

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:41.903
I have to say,

00:11:41.937 --> 00:11:43.841
even for you that was
a pretty dismal move.

00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:45.143
[CUI] No...
No, it can't be!

00:11:45.176 --> 00:11:46.613
[VEGETA] If there
was brain one

00:11:46.647 --> 00:11:47.916
in that head of yours,
you'd have realized...

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:50.454
My speed is
increased as well.

00:11:50.922 --> 00:11:52.491
[VEGETA] Which means,
unfortunately for you,

00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:56.265
that little ruse only
succeeded in pissing me off...

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.974
[VEGETA]
Goodbye.

00:12:17.007 --> 00:12:19.110
[boom]

00:12:20.213 --> 00:12:22.818
[VEGETA] Cui,
I'm afraid you're fired.

00:12:35.978 --> 00:12:37.380
[DODORIA]
Wait...

00:12:37.413 --> 00:12:38.917
Turns out this thing wasn't
malfunctioning after all--

00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:40.855
the reading it gave for
Vegeta was accurate...

00:12:40.888 --> 00:12:43.359
He just beat Cui
like it was nothing...!

00:12:43.392 --> 00:12:45.831
[FRIEZA] Even so,
it's no real concern...

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:47.033
For now, let's
just stay focused

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:49.471
on finding the
fifth Dragon Ball.

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:52.377
[VEGETA] The scouters
will have alerted them

00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:53.680
to what I've done...

00:12:53.713 --> 00:12:56.085
If by some misstep I'm careless
enough to cross their path,

00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:59.826
I can only conceivably
handle Zarbon and Dodoria.

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:02.531
Frieza himself is
too much for me...

00:13:02.564 --> 00:13:04.635
Judging by the transmissions
I've been picking up

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:05.971
from his henchmen, though,

00:13:06.005 --> 00:13:07.942
the Dragon Balls
apparently only work

00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:10.379
after you've gathered
all seven together,

00:13:10.413 --> 00:13:12.384
which works out perfectly.

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:15.957
[VEGETA] I only need to find
one to disrupt his plans...

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:18.229
That'll prevent Frieza
from being able to use them;

00:13:18.262 --> 00:13:21.468
meanwhile they'll uncover
the other six for me.

00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:23.907
[VEGETA] If I
play this right,

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.312
I'll not only have Frieza's
neck under my boot--

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:28.149
but eternal life itself!

00:13:28.617 --> 00:13:30.153
[SUBORDINATE RED SPOTS] I'm
picking up about ten Namekians,

00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:32.090
lord; somewhere
in that direction.

00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:33.893
[FRIEZA] Well, that's
perfect timing...

00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:35.698
And wouldn't it be nice
if they just happened

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:38.069
to have the fifth
Dragon Ball on hand...?

00:13:38.102 --> 00:13:40.173
Let's go see.
But stay vigilant.

00:13:40.206 --> 00:13:42.578
[FRIEZA] We now know
Vegeta isn't the only pest

00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:44.381
crawling around this planet.

00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:45.249
[ALL] Sir.

00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:47.120
[FRIEZA] Let the
games continue...

00:13:49.825 --> 00:13:50.995
[VEGETA] With
Frieza out of the way,

00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:53.332
I'll be uncontested...

00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:55.771
I, Vegeta, the
Prince of all Saiyans,

00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:57.941
will rule the universe!

00:14:03.587 --> 00:14:04.822
[KRILLIN]
Come on, Bulma!

00:14:04.856 --> 00:14:06.491
You gotta pick up the
pace a little bit...!

00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:08.663
We're sittin' ducks out
in the open like this!

00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:11.035
[panting]

00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:13.005
[BULMA] Can't you both
just carry me and fly...?

00:14:13.038 --> 00:14:14.909
I mean my feet are
killing me here...

00:14:14.942 --> 00:14:16.880
[GOHAN] Believe me,
we'd love to help you...

00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:18.517
But Krillin and
I have to stay on foot

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.153
to keep our energies hidden.

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:21.321
[KRILLIN]
Hey check it out...

00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:22.792
There's a perfect
spot for us to hide

00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:26.165
just a few more
steps up the hill.

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:27.701
[BULMA]
Oh... great...

00:14:27.735 --> 00:14:30.574
So I get to spend the rest of
my days as a cave-dweller now...

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:35.049
[GOHAN]
Krillin!

00:14:35.082 --> 00:14:37.822
[GOHAN] You feel any power
comin' from over there?

00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:39.859
[KRILLIN] I do...
But it's different...

00:14:39.892 --> 00:14:41.896
It doesn't feel like the
ones from before...

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.835
Maybe this time it'll
actually be the Namekians--

00:14:44.869 --> 00:14:46.271
[KRILLIN]
Take cover!

00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:48.576
There's someone else comin'
at us from that direction!

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.913
[BULMA] What do
we do...?! I...

00:14:49.946 --> 00:14:51.415
[KRILLIN]
Bulma, get in here!

00:14:51.448 --> 00:14:54.187
[BULMA] We're doomed,
aren't we?! I know we are!

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.858
[KRILLIN] They're
headed this way...

00:14:55.891 --> 00:14:57.093
[GOHAN] I don't
like this...

00:14:57.126 --> 00:14:58.764
You think they're
searching for us?

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:00.399
[KRILLIN]
Possibly.

00:15:03.807 --> 00:15:05.209
[KRILLIN]
Look!

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.185
[BULMA] Okay,
crisis averted...

00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:27.387
Whatever they're
on the prowl for,

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.191
I guess it's safe
to say it's not us...

00:15:29.224 --> 00:15:30.627
Thank our lucky stars...

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.633
But then what do you think
that was all about just now?

00:15:38.275 --> 00:15:39.478
[BULMA] Did I
miss something...?

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:41.081
What's with the look?

00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:44.822
[KRILLIN]
Bulma...

00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:47.728
I need you to check
the Dragon Radar again.

00:15:47.761 --> 00:15:49.131
[BULMA]
Sure... but why?

00:15:49.164 --> 00:15:50.968
[KRILLIN] When you looked
at it when we got here...

00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:52.203
There were four
Dragon Balls

00:15:52.236 --> 00:15:54.542
all gathered together
in the same place...

00:15:54.575 --> 00:15:56.546
Take a look and see
where they are right now.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.384
[BULMA] Fine... But...
I don't see the point...

00:16:01.989 --> 00:16:03.961
[BULMA] All four of
them are on the move...!

00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:05.964
There's no way
that's a coincidence;

00:16:05.997 --> 00:16:08.803
those guys who flew over
us must be carrying them!

00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:11.509
[KRILLIN] That's
what I thought...

00:16:11.542 --> 00:16:13.245
Why us?! Gohan.

00:16:14.982 --> 00:16:16.185
[KRILLIN] Gohan!

00:16:16.218 --> 00:16:17.721
[GOHAN] Yeah,
what is it?

00:16:17.755 --> 00:16:19.759
[KRILLIN] Did you see the one
flyin' second from the front...?

00:16:19.792 --> 00:16:21.228
More importantly,
did you sense him?

00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.666
[GOHAN]
Yeah... I did...

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.572
And his power
is unbelievable.

00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:27.473
[KRILLIN] I know...

00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:30.781
The moment I saw
him, my heart sank.

00:16:30.814 --> 00:16:31.916
[KRILLIN]
I think...

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:33.319
I think whoever
we're dealing with here

00:16:33.352 --> 00:16:35.524
outranks Vegeta
by a long shot...

00:16:35.558 --> 00:16:37.326
His buddies all looked
like they could do ugly

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.663
with the best of
'em, too, but...

00:16:38.696 --> 00:16:41.168
There's no doubt in my
mind: that one's the boss.

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:42.905
[BULMA] But...
Seriously...?! Vegeta...?

00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:44.241
Someone worse
than Vegeta?!

00:16:44.274 --> 00:16:45.710
[KRILLIN]
A whole lot worse...

00:16:45.744 --> 00:16:48.415
I think his minions are like
Vegeta's fellow officers...

00:16:48.448 --> 00:16:51.155
They all had on the same
stupid-looking uniform...

00:16:51.188 --> 00:16:52.925
[KRILLIN] Damn it...!
This is impossible!

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:54.562
How we supposed to get
the Dragon Balls away

00:16:54.595 --> 00:16:56.431
from a crew like that?!

00:16:56.699 --> 00:16:58.236
[BULMA]
Hang on... Look...

00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:59.705
According to the radar,

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:02.009
they're moving full speed
toward another Dragon Ball...

00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:04.281
I guess that means
they've got a radar, too.

00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:05.984
[KRILLIN]
What's the location?

00:17:06.018 --> 00:17:07.387
[BULMA]
That way.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.991
It looks like it's just a
few miles away from here.

00:17:09.024 --> 00:17:10.092
[GOHAN] And that's
where we were sensing

00:17:10.126 --> 00:17:11.562
all that other
energy a minute ago.

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:13.332
Maybe that's where
the Namekians live.

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.805
[KRILLIN] Yeah... I'm
gonna go and have a look...

00:17:15.838 --> 00:17:17.808
You guys... Stay here.

00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:18.910
[GOHAN]
I'm going, too!

00:17:18.944 --> 00:17:20.647
[BULMA] Hey!
You can't just take off!

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.352
I'll be all by myself
in an alien wilderness!!!

00:17:23.386 --> 00:17:24.722
[KRILLIN] Look,
make the most of it;

00:17:24.756 --> 00:17:27.160
you'll be way safer here
than where we're headed.

00:17:27.194 --> 00:17:29.932
[BULMA] Fine... But that
doesn't mean I like it.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.670
[KRILLIN] 'kay...
We'll be back soon.

00:17:31.703 --> 00:17:34.074
[BULMA] Don't you
dare forget about me!

00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:35.142
[KRILLIN] Alright,
little man--

00:17:35.175 --> 00:17:36.478
go ahead and
suppress your power

00:17:36.512 --> 00:17:38.415
so they don't see us
coming and we'll head out...

00:17:38.448 --> 00:17:38.983
Can you do that?

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:39.919
[GOHAN]
Yeah!

00:17:39.953 --> 00:17:41.321
[KRILLIN]
Good.

00:17:44.427 --> 00:17:46.231
[BULMA]
And away they go...

00:17:46.264 --> 00:17:48.368
I sure hope they have
some kind of plan...

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:49.672
Oh wait...

00:17:49.705 --> 00:17:51.810
I've gotta call home and tell
everyone what's going on...!

00:17:51.843 --> 00:17:53.178
[GOKU]
Really...?!

00:17:53.212 --> 00:17:54.882
So then, Gohan and the
others made it there okay...

00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:56.352
[ROSHI] Yes...
The journey there

00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:59.825
was smooth sailing
the whole way... But...

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:01.562
As it turns out,
they aren't alone...

00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:04.067
In fact, the place
is kinda popular...

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.105
That last Saiyan
you fought, Vegeta...

00:18:06.138 --> 00:18:07.406
He showed up, as well.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.277
[GOKU] Vegeta...?!
Are you kiddin' me?!

00:18:09.311 --> 00:18:10.680
[ROSHI] Hold on,
it gets worse...

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.685
A whole gang of brutes
just like him showed up

00:18:12.718 --> 00:18:16.091
and blasted Kami's
ship--they're stranded.

00:18:16.125 --> 00:18:17.494
[ROSHI] Bulma tells
me there's over a

00:18:17.528 --> 00:18:19.497
dozen of these Vegeta
knock-offs casing the planet--

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:21.201
each one stronger
than the next.

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:22.738
[GOKU] Wait! And
they're stuck there?!

00:18:22.772 --> 00:18:23.807
[ROSHI]
'fraid so.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.942
And the ring-leader
of the bunch

00:18:24.975 --> 00:18:26.245
apparently has a
power level so massive

00:18:26.278 --> 00:18:28.014
he makes the
rest look tame.

00:18:28.048 --> 00:18:29.552
[GOKU] So you're
tellin' me... You...

00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:32.758
You're sayin' there's someone
stronger than Vegeta...

00:18:39.337 --> 00:18:41.542
[YAJIROBE] Hey...
You're not dead yet...

00:18:41.576 --> 00:18:44.949
Jeeze, what's with the
long faces? Anyway...

00:18:44.982 --> 00:18:46.251
[YAJIROBE]
The Senzu beans are ready,

00:18:46.284 --> 00:18:48.288
but there's only a few...
Seven to be exact...

00:18:48.321 --> 00:18:49.592
Korin told me to
give 'em to ya...

00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:52.163
So here I am bein' your
personal delivery boy.

00:18:52.196 --> 00:18:53.299
[GOKU]
Ha...! Great!

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:54.535
And your timing
couldn't be better...!

00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.305
Toss one over
so I can eat one!

00:18:56.338 --> 00:18:57.641
[GOKU'S DOCTOR]
See here...!

00:18:57.674 --> 00:18:59.979
You can't just feed my
patient whatever he wants!

00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:01.615
[YAJIROBE]
Heads up.

00:19:16.612 --> 00:19:18.082
[GOKU] Man,
I've been wantin'

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:21.088
to tear outta this hospital
getup like nobody's business!

00:19:21.723 --> 00:19:23.527
[GOKU] King Kai sent me
some new training gear,

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.597
but I haven't had a
chance to try it on yet...

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.268
Heh, heh...
I sure hope it fits.

00:19:29.906 --> 00:19:31.141
[GOKU]
Nice...!

00:19:31.175 --> 00:19:32.812
Now I guess I'm ready
to get to Planet Namek!

00:19:32.845 --> 00:19:34.080
[GOKU] And
I better take

00:19:34.114 --> 00:19:35.683
the rest of those Senzu
Beans, just to be safe.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.120
[ROSHI] Not to
rain on your parade,

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:39.157
but how are you gonna
get to Planet Namek?

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.226
[GOKU]
Oh, that...?

00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:41.394
When Bulma's dad
came to visit me,

00:19:41.428 --> 00:19:43.065
I asked him to build
another spaceship

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.702
in case something
like this came up...

00:19:44.735 --> 00:19:45.704
He's had a whole week,

00:19:45.737 --> 00:19:47.474
so he's prob'ly got
it finished by now.

00:19:47.508 --> 00:19:48.810
[YAJIROBE]
Wait, hold on...

00:19:48.843 --> 00:19:50.647
he said he could build
another ship like Kami's?

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.116
[GOKU] No, that one
was built outta stuff

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.285
you can't get
here on earth,

00:19:53.319 --> 00:19:54.521
so I doubt even
someone as smart

00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:56.258
as Bulma's dad
could pull that off.

00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:58.395
[ROSHI]
So... then...?

00:19:58.429 --> 00:20:00.299
[GOKU] Well... See...
I thought about it real hard

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:01.503
and I realized
there were at least

00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:03.438
two other alien
spaceships on this planet

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:05.343
besides the one
Kami came in...

00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:07.080
There's the pod my
brother took to get here

00:20:07.113 --> 00:20:08.617
so he could
try to find me

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.752
and get the place
ready for his pals...

00:20:09.785 --> 00:20:11.856
And there's the
one I was found in...

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.458
[ROSHI] Hah!
Of course!

00:20:13.492 --> 00:20:15.162
[GOKU] My brother's ship
got blown up pretty bad

00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:16.298
while we were
fighting him,

00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:17.734
but Bulma's dad
tracked down my old ship

00:20:17.768 --> 00:20:19.738
and it turns out it was
still in decent shape!

00:20:19.772 --> 00:20:22.109
He said it needed a few repairs
before it would fly again,

00:20:22.143 --> 00:20:23.412
but he thought
he could do it!

00:20:23.446 --> 00:20:26.117
He even said he'd put in
some new extras for me!

00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:28.121
Hey! Flying Nimbus!

00:20:28.155 --> 00:20:30.125
Alright...
Wish me luck guys!

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:31.261
[ROSHI]
Right.

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:36.705
[GOKU] Take me
to Bulma's house!

00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:41.248
[YAJIROBE] So what's the
big hurry all 'f a sudden.

00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.118
[ROSHI]
Well, y'see...

00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:44.354
[YAJIROBE]
Huh...?!

00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:45.690
But if he's up against
somethin' like that,

00:20:45.723 --> 00:20:47.661
what the hell he'd have
a smile on his face for?!

00:20:47.694 --> 00:20:48.530
Is he nuts?!

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:49.497
[ROSHI] Must be
that Saiyan blood

00:20:49.531 --> 00:20:50.934
coursing through
his veins...

00:20:50.967 --> 00:20:52.136
I mean,
helping his friends

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.940
has always been
his first concern...

00:20:53.974 --> 00:20:55.309
But he's also
always seemed

00:20:55.343 --> 00:20:56.478
to get a thrill out
of the challenge

00:20:56.512 --> 00:20:58.983
of facing a
powerful opponent.

00:20:59.017 --> 00:21:00.352
[YAJIROBE]
That Goku...

00:21:00.386 --> 00:21:02.123
I just can't get my head
around the way he thinks...

00:21:02.156 --> 00:21:04.494
The guy's
crazy for sure.

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:05.698
[GOKU] I can't
believe it...

00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:07.334
There's actually
someone out there stronger

00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:10.439
than the toughest
enemy I've ever faced!

00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:15.015
[NARRATOR]
Ominous clouds hang low

00:21:15.048 --> 00:21:16.785
over the peaceful
Planet Namek...

00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:20.158
Will Vegeta successfully
thwart Freiza's dark designs

00:21:20.192 --> 00:21:22.396
and win immortality
for himself...?

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.933
Or will this chilly
tyrant continue

00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:27.641
to carve a path of destruction
towards his goal unabated?

00:21:27.674 --> 00:21:31.415
One thing's certain, a battle
like no other awaits Goku--

00:21:31.448 --> 00:21:33.953
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:44.808
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:38.082 --> 00:22:39.483
[GOKU] Hey, it's me, Goku!

00:22:39.518 --> 00:22:42.089
Man, this spaceship's a
lot bigger than I expected.

00:22:42.122 --> 00:22:45.096
And I can get to Namek
in just six days? Awesome!

00:22:45.129 --> 00:22:47.433
[FRIEZA] The natives here
are frustratingly willful.

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:49.572
But, if they wish to
fall defending each other,

00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:52.911
I'm happy to oblige
them--young and old alike.

00:22:52.944 --> 00:22:55.349
[GOHAN] Ugh! These
guys are so mean!

00:22:55.382 --> 00:22:58.455
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:01.962 --> 00:23:04.901
[GOHAN] Whoa... They
all look like Piccolo...
