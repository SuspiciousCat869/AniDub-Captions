WEBVTT

00:00:02.438 --> 00:00:05.076
Goku's true strength
bursts forth

00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:09.285
in his fierce battle
against Ginyu.

00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:17.802
95,000...!

00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:21.309
I-Impossible!

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:23.479
110,000!

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.673
"Full Power, Son Goku!
A Trembling Ginyu's Secret
Plan?!"

00:02:03.213 --> 00:02:08.056
1-120,000... 130,000...

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:11.897
1-140,000...!

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:17.742
1-150,000! This can't be!

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:23.988
1-180,000!

00:02:24.088 --> 00:02:29.431
U-Unbelievable! This
is your true power?!

00:02:29.532 --> 00:02:36.814
N-No wonder we couldn't beat
him. How can a Saiyan be so
strong?

00:02:36.914 --> 00:02:38.551
Let me be clear.

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:42.593
This still ain't the sort of
power I can put out for short
moments.

00:02:42.693 --> 00:02:44.629
W-What?!

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:54.381
D-Don't tell me...

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:58.757
Don't tell me you're a...

00:02:58.857 --> 00:03:02.397
...S-Super Saiyan?!

00:03:02.497 --> 00:03:05.638
That's what Vegeta
was saying, too.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.278
But I've got no
idea what it means.

00:03:09.378 --> 00:03:14.288
A Super Saiyan?
The all-powerful warrior of
legend?!

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:18.931
How can that be?!

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.436
He's... he's...

00:03:21.537 --> 00:03:26.814
...a Super Saiyan, the one thing
that Freeza-sama fears?!

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:30.655
I hate to say it, but
you can't beat me.

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:33.928
I want to avoid any
unnecessary fighting.

00:03:34.028 --> 00:03:37.635
You guys, get off
of this planet!

00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:45.083
What? Do you
seriously mean that?

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:46.887
I mean it.

00:03:46.988 --> 00:03:49.458
Especially with you being a
warrior who fights fairer than I
expected.

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:51.128
I don't want to kill you.

00:03:51.228 --> 00:03:53.567
You don't want to kill me?

00:03:54.703 --> 00:03:58.409
He says he wants to avoid
unnecessary fighting?

00:04:02.084 --> 00:04:05.090
Get off of this planet?

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.596
A-A Super Saiyan
is supposed to be

00:04:07.696 --> 00:04:10.100
the mightiest warrior
in the universe,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.239
one who relishes
blood and battle.

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.210
Then that's it!

00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.283
You are not a Super
Saiyan, are you?

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:21.389
You have not fully
become a Super Saiyan!

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.998
I see, so you are
not a Super Saiyan.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.973
You don't say.

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:38.422
Grand Elder, it's Nail-san!

00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:52.852
Why have you returned? I ordered
you to help the earthlings, did
I not?

00:04:52.952 --> 00:04:54.488
I am terribly sorry,

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:59.298
but with respect, my ultimate
duty is to defend your life,
Grand Elder.

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:00.901
But...

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:04.543
Grand Elder, if you die,
the Dragon Balls will disappear,
too.

00:05:04.643 --> 00:05:09.084
If that happens, the earthlings
will not have their wish
granted.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.367
There it is!

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:18.971
Bulma-san!

00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:21.509
We need the Dragon Radar!

00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:30.394
Bulma-san!

00:05:30.494 --> 00:05:33.968
Geez... Every moment counts,

00:05:34.068 --> 00:05:37.542
but right when we really
need her, she's never around.

00:05:37.642 --> 00:05:39.913
Kuririn-san, over here.

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:44.956
That's a jet-bike track.

00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:49.866
Where could Bulma-san
have gone on a jet-bike?

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.037
Let's go after her! We have
to get the Radar from her

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:54.842
and find the Balls before
we run out of time!

00:05:56.045 --> 00:05:57.748
Right!

00:06:01.923 --> 00:06:04.094
That must be it.

00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:14.181
Sure enough, they've finally
gotten wind of this place.

00:06:14.281 --> 00:06:15.518
They're almost here.

00:06:15.618 --> 00:06:17.221
Dende, come here.

00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:19.024
Right.

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:45.176
Now go, Dende.

00:06:45.276 --> 00:06:49.853
The earthlings need you.
I have drawn out your power,

00:06:49.953 --> 00:06:53.393
so you should reach them
in a short amount of time.

00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:56.733
--B-But...
--Hurry and get going.

00:06:59.038 --> 00:07:03.580
Very well. Grand Elder,
please don't die.

00:07:11.228 --> 00:07:17.875
Will I be killed first, or
will my time come first?

00:07:31.603 --> 00:07:36.546
No matter. I will leave
the speck of dust alone.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.257
He is here.

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:09.545
Do you want something?

00:08:09.645 --> 00:08:12.317
My name is Freeza, and
I have a certain wish

00:08:12.418 --> 00:08:16.459
that I would like to have
granted with the Dragon Balls.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.797
I have gotten all
seven of them together,

00:08:18.897 --> 00:08:22.437
but I just cannot seem
to have my wish granted.

00:08:22.538 --> 00:08:25.778
And so, I would like
you to tell me...

00:08:25.878 --> 00:08:28.917
What shall I do to
have my wish granted?

00:08:29.017 --> 00:08:34.762
I must ask you to leave. I
cannot tell that to someone who
is evil.

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:39.539
I think it would be better
for you to be more amiable.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:42.812
There is no reason for
me not to kill you.

00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:44.816
There are two of
you here, right?

00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:48.423
I can get my answer
from either one of you.

00:08:48.524 --> 00:08:50.126
Then that's what you should do.

00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:53.332
But before we fight, I
will tell you this much:

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:58.275
The other one, inside the house,
is the Grand Elder of the
Namekians.

00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:02.985
The Dragon Balls were
created by the Grand Elder.

00:09:03.754 --> 00:09:07.060
Now listen, and get
this into your head:

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.870
If you kill the Grand Elder,
the Dragon Balls will disappear,
too.

00:09:12.672 --> 00:09:15.143
Grand Elder...?

00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:30.708
Hmm, indeed.

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:33.847
You appear to be
telling the truth.

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:38.958
He is indeed different
from the other Namekians.

00:09:39.058 --> 00:09:45.337
Grand Elder, I suppose you have
no intention of telling me,
either.

00:09:45.437 --> 00:09:48.844
However, I doubt you will
be able to keep it from me

00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:51.716
once this man is on
the verge of dying.

00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:56.960
Nail will not be defeated
as easily as you think.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.870
He is the strongest warrior-type
Namekian on the planet.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:08.382
He is not like the other
Namekians you have killed up to
now.

00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:13.527
Apparently, you do not wish
to tell me, no matter what.

00:10:13.627 --> 00:10:19.071
It is in your hands, Nail.
Please buy as much time as you
can.

00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:20.874
Understood.

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:26.686
Very well. If you are
going to be this unkind,

00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:28.155
I will show you
how terrifying I,

00:10:28.255 --> 00:10:31.796
the greatest warrior in
the universe, can be!

00:10:48.095 --> 00:10:50.935
As you have probably noticed...

00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:54.241
...the Grand Elder's
life is near its end.

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:57.280
If we fight here, and he
is caught in the crossfire,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.586
it will not serve you, either.

00:10:59.686 --> 00:11:01.956
Let's change locations.

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:08.537
I doubt that the battle
will become that serious,

00:11:08.637 --> 00:11:10.741
but very well.

00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:13.713
Wherever you like.

00:11:33.587 --> 00:11:35.223
Forgive me, Nail.

00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:42.905
Please, try to hold out at least
until Dende reaches the
earthlings.

00:11:46.312 --> 00:11:52.290
At this point, the fate of
this world is in their hands.

00:12:03.112 --> 00:12:04.916
What are you laughing at?

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:08.590
How can I not laugh,

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.563
with someone as strong
as you are here?

00:12:11.663 --> 00:12:13.701
So why are you laughing?

00:12:13.801 --> 00:12:15.269
Because I, Ginyu, am so glad

00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:19.144
that I've met someone so
much stronger than I am!

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:31.001
--Jheese!
--Y-Yes, sir!

00:12:32.572 --> 00:12:35.410
S-So that's it! Commander
Ginyu is about to...

00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:40.387
Hold on tight to my Scouter,
so that you don't drop it.

00:12:40.487 --> 00:12:42.958
That's it, all right.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.343
How far are we going?

00:12:53.547 --> 00:12:55.951
Enough, already!

00:12:57.253 --> 00:13:00.894
There is no need to go
any farther than this!

00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:07.875
Right.

00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:21.435
My, my, there certainly are
a lot of people on this planet

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:26.244
who want to die. What
is a person to do?

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:45.450
This is amazing. Your battle
power has risen to 42,000.

00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:48.155
I see. You truly do
seem to be different

00:13:48.256 --> 00:13:51.495
from the other
Namekians up to now.

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:55.136
You have surprised me. That is
an outstanding battle power.

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:58.743
I can see why you would
be called a warrior-type.

00:13:58.843 --> 00:14:01.182
Enough that I would like
you as one of my own.

00:14:01.282 --> 00:14:03.086
However, just for
your information,

00:14:03.186 --> 00:14:05.356
as the opponent you
are about to fight,

00:14:05.456 --> 00:14:09.799
shall I first inform
you of my battle power?

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:12.404
My battle power...

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:15.210
...is 530,000.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.447
However, you need not worry.

00:14:17.548 --> 00:14:21.088
I do not, of course, plan to
fight you with my full power.

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:22.357
What?!

00:14:22.457 --> 00:14:26.800
I know. I will fight using
only my left arm for you.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.140
That might be
somewhat entertaining.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.210
Enough!

00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:44.134
That will not do, will it?

00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:46.338
And here I stretched
out my neck for you,

00:14:46.438 --> 00:14:50.581
so you would be certain to hit
it, and this is the best you
have?

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:56.391
Oh, but then, at 42,000,
I suppose that is to be
expected.

00:15:09.586 --> 00:15:12.558
Oh my, that was quite
unmannerly of me.

00:15:12.658 --> 00:15:15.129
I will return it to you.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.678
It might be better for you not
to strain yourself, might it
not?

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.522
I do think that it would
be best if you told me,

00:15:27.622 --> 00:15:29.692
before you get killed.

00:15:41.817 --> 00:15:45.123
Oh, this is a surprise!

00:15:45.223 --> 00:15:46.993
You can regenerate yourself?

00:15:47.093 --> 00:15:50.634
However, while you may be back
to normal, your plight is the
same.

00:15:50.734 --> 00:15:53.974
It seems you are unable to
regenerate your strength,
though.

00:15:54.074 --> 00:15:57.113
Your battle power has fallen.

00:16:02.524 --> 00:16:04.695
My, my, even after being
shown how great a difference

00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:08.068
there is between you and me,
you still wish to continue?

00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:11.008
My word, I have
absolutely no idea

00:16:11.108 --> 00:16:13.814
what the people of this
world are thinking.

00:16:13.914 --> 00:16:16.485
I won't let you...

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:18.388
I won't let you...!

00:16:21.128 --> 00:16:22.598
What is this?! What?!

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:26.706
Does this planet have
something against me?!

00:16:32.183 --> 00:16:34.788
This time I've had it for sure!

00:16:36.358 --> 00:16:40.099
Lucky! If I can make
it inside that cave...

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:43.071
A little farther...

00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:48.215
I-I made it! I'm saved!

00:16:56.298 --> 00:17:01.408
H-Huh? Am I saved?

00:17:10.794 --> 00:17:13.498
You meanie! You meanie!

00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:21.481
I'm done for sure now!

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:24.354
Farewell, everyone!

00:17:29.798 --> 00:17:31.602
Ow!

00:17:37.949 --> 00:17:41.388
Eh? What? What happened?

00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:47.067
No! Stay back! You perv!
You letch! You idiot! You fiend!

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:50.272
--You moron! You sicko!
--B-Bulma-san!

00:17:52.209 --> 00:17:56.719
G-Gohan-kun...? Th-Then...

00:17:59.324 --> 00:18:03.666
Th-That was mean, Bulma-san.

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:05.504
What are you guys up to?!

00:18:05.604 --> 00:18:07.440
No sooner do you show up
out of nowhere with Vegeta

00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:10.446
and take the Dragon Ball, than
you head off again somewhere
else!

00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:12.718
Just what is going on here?!

00:18:12.818 --> 00:18:16.292
Do you think you can get away
with leaving a delicate young
lady

00:18:16.392 --> 00:18:18.796
all alone in a dangerous
place like this?!

00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:23.305
Y-Yeah, but we just saved you
from those dinosaurs, didn't we?

00:18:23.405 --> 00:18:26.244
B-Bulma-san, we need
the Dragon Radar!

00:18:26.344 --> 00:18:28.783
If we're lucky, we can
get our wish granted!

00:18:28.883 --> 00:18:33.325
What?! You still haven't
gotten our wish granted?!

00:18:33.426 --> 00:18:35.931
I saw on the Radar that all
seven of them were together,

00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:39.873
so I figured you had collected
them all, and I was on my way
over!

00:18:39.973 --> 00:18:42.176
And what is this now?!

00:18:42.276 --> 00:18:45.784
Good grief. What are you
dilly-dallying around for?

00:18:45.884 --> 00:18:48.189
D-Dilly-dallying. Right.

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:50.660
Bulma-san, excuse me.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.004
Kuririn-san, I found them!
They're in that direction!

00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:57.908
All right, let's go!

00:18:58.877 --> 00:19:01.749
Hey! Tell me what's going on!

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:04.420
We're in a hurry now,
so we'll tell you later!

00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:07.561
Bulma-san, please wait
for us back on that island!

00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:13.139
Huh?! You've gotta be kidding
me! Do you expect me to walk
back?!

00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:14.975
What is this! What is this?!

00:19:15.075 --> 00:19:17.982
Oh, yeah! Father is here!

00:19:18.082 --> 00:19:19.819
Eh? Really?

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:23.826
So, how about it?
Has he gotten even stronger?

00:19:26.264 --> 00:19:27.969
Gohan, let's hurry!

00:19:28.069 --> 00:19:29.738
Right!

00:19:32.811 --> 00:19:34.749
Son-kun, huh?

00:19:34.849 --> 00:19:38.957
I never thought he'd
grow up to be so dashing.

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:43.298
Yamucha's supposed to be my
boyfriend, and all we ever do is
fight.

00:19:51.415 --> 00:19:53.653
Maybe I missed the boat.

00:20:05.476 --> 00:20:08.381
W-What are you...?!

00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:14.360
What the...?

00:20:16.464 --> 00:20:23.145
Y-You may not be...
a Super Saiyan...

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:29.658
...b-but I like... that
strong body of yours...

00:20:29.758 --> 00:20:32.697
Y-You like it?

00:20:39.946 --> 00:20:45.022
S-Sure enough,
Commander Ginyu is going to do
it.

00:20:51.235 --> 00:20:56.946
I-Incredible. Where in that body
of his did he get this much
power?

00:21:01.522 --> 00:21:03.894
H-Here it comes...

00:21:03.994 --> 00:21:09.270
Ch-Change!!

00:22:37.848 --> 00:22:39.150
Heya! I'm Goku!

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.223
What in the world is going on?
I see me, right before my eyes!

00:22:42.323 --> 00:22:43.793
Starting next episode, I, Ginyu,

00:22:43.893 --> 00:22:45.830
will be taking your place
as the main character.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.135
What do you think about
"Ginyu Special Corps Kai:

00:22:48.235 --> 00:22:50.372
Freeza-sama and His Merry Men"?

00:22:50.472 --> 00:22:52.043
I don't think anything of it!

00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:54.682
I don't want my father
to be anything like that!

00:22:54.782 --> 00:22:56.552
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:22:56.652 --> 00:22:59.992
"Surprise! Goku is Ginyu
and Ginyu is Goku?!"

00:23:00.092 --> 00:23:03.431
You good earthling boys and
girls, make sure to watch it!
