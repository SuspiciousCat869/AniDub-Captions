But his life would be
forever changed when he

met a girl named Bulma,

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:29.171
and joined her on her quest
to find the Dragon Balls--

seven magic orbs that
when gathered together,

00:04:31.643 --> 00:04:35.884
would call forth the dragon
Shenron to grant a single wish.

00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:39.292

when he faced
the powerful villain,

King Piccolo.
But the help of the

00:04:57.562 --> 00:05:00.868

to tap into vast reserves

to hatch one final scheme...

and resume his evil plans.

Another epic battle ensued.

And though the two were
almost equally matched,

still could not
withstand Goku's might.

00:13:46.252 --> 00:13:48.923
He can't be that
powerful, can he...?

00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:51.529
This is only
one way to find out...

00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:57.340
[PICCOLO chuckles]

00:13:59.812 --> 00:14:01.816
[RADITZ laughs]
You call that an attack?

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.286
Pathetic.

00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:04.221
Although...

00:14:04.254 --> 00:14:06.358
...it is effective at
kicking up dust.

00:14:11.335 --> 00:14:13.305
You finished?
That all you've got...?

00:14:13.339 --> 00:14:16.445
In that case, why don't
I show you one of my moves?

00:14:16.478 --> 00:14:18.182
[RADITZ chuckles]

00:14:22.724 --> 00:14:23.960
A new signal...

00:14:23.994 --> 00:14:26.364
It looks like another
strong power level...

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:33.312
[scouter beeping]

00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:34.315
It's that way...

00:14:34.348 --> 00:14:36.953
Range: twelve-nine-oh-nine
and closing...

00:14:36.986 --> 00:14:38.356
It's a big one...

00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:42.063
...certainly the biggest
power level on this puny planet.

00:14:42.097 --> 00:14:44.502
This is it...
It must be Kakarot!

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:54.420
[PICCOLO panting]

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.928
Who... was that...?

00:14:57.961 --> 00:14:59.064
He's miles away,

00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:01.636
and I still can't
stop trembling...

00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:25.082
[WOMAN]
Hello in there! Guess who!

00:15:26.285 --> 00:15:27.320
Bulma!

00:15:27.354 --> 00:15:30.126
Yep...! I got your
invitation, so here I am!

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.997
Ah, good! I wasn't
sure you'd make it...!

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.067
It's been way too long, huh?

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:35.203
I miss this place...

00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:36.906
Hasn't changed a bit!

00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:38.711
Well, don't be
such a stranger...

00:15:38.744 --> 00:15:39.779
You don't always have to

00:15:39.812 --> 00:15:42.652
wait for an invitation,
you know.

00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:44.021
Here.

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:45.957
[BULMA] I brought
you some goodies.

00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:47.193
Ah, that's sweet.

00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:49.230
But you didn't have to
go to all that trouble.

00:15:49.264 --> 00:15:50.768
I mean, you could just
give me a sample

00:15:50.801 --> 00:15:53.005
of those other goodies...

00:15:55.711 --> 00:15:57.748
I see you still
can't take a joke!

00:15:57.781 --> 00:16:00.220
And I see you're
still a dirty old creep!

00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:02.558
Oh yeah, that reminds me--
where's Yamcha?

00:16:02.592 --> 00:16:03.961
Thought he'd be with you.

00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:05.162
Yamcha? That jerk...?

00:16:05.196 --> 00:16:07.067
How should I know?!

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.235
He can be out chasing

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:09.706
every girl in the
city for all I care!

00:16:09.739 --> 00:16:11.141
I'm done with him!

00:16:11.174 --> 00:16:13.278
I didn't even tell him we
were getting together today!

00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:14.548
But who needs that guy...!

00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:17.020
Right...?! We can still
have fun without him!

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:19.391
Guess nothing's changed
with those two, either.

00:16:19.424 --> 00:16:20.827
Nope, guess not.

00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:22.665
Anyway,
why isn't Launch here?

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:24.033
[KRILLIN]
Oh, she's long gone.

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:27.340
She went chasing after
Tien Shinhan five years ago.

00:16:27.373 --> 00:16:28.743
[laughs]

00:16:31.716 --> 00:16:37.561
[scouter beeping]

00:16:37.595 --> 00:16:38.429
[RADITZ] Very good.

00:16:38.462 --> 00:16:41.268
This power
level is moving fast.

00:16:42.137 --> 00:16:43.507
[GOKU]
Hey, look. We're here!

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.409
Master Roshi's house!

00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:49.552
Hello!

00:16:50.821 --> 00:16:51.488

00:16:52.491 --> 00:16:53.292
Hey!

00:16:53.326 --> 00:16:53.927
Hi!

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.630
Uh... So who's the kid?

00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:56.599
Yeah, what gives...?

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:59.371
Are you babysittin'
him for somebody?

00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:00.741
He's my son!

00:17:00.774 --> 00:17:02.277
[ROSHI] Yours, Goku?!

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.446
[GOKU]
Yep, that's right.

00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.416
Crazy, huh?

00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:09.692
Come on... Say hi.

00:17:09.725 --> 00:17:11.294
[GOHAN] Um, hello.

00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:12.363
--Good to meet'cha.
--Right. Hello.

00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:14.669
[ROSHI]
Hello to you, little guy.

00:17:14.702 --> 00:17:16.772
[GOKU]
His name is Gohan.

00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:20.146
Gohan, eh...? I see...!

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:22.885
So you named him after your
dear ol' grandpa, did ya?

00:17:22.918 --> 00:17:24.154
Uh-huh.

00:17:24.188 --> 00:17:26.124
[ROSHI] I have to admit,
this is some surprise.

00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:28.730
I honestly didn't think
you had it in you, Goku!

00:17:28.763 --> 00:17:29.933
[BULMA]
He's so cute...

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.169
So... how old are you?

00:17:33.072 --> 00:17:34.909
One... Tw--I'm four, miss.

00:17:34.942 --> 00:17:36.813
Wow, aren't you
the little gentleman.

00:17:36.846 --> 00:17:38.082
Sure he's yours?

00:17:38.115 --> 00:17:40.319
Well, he gets that from Chi-Chi.

00:17:42.223 --> 00:17:44.394
[BULMA] So tell us some more
about yourself, Gohan.

00:17:44.428 --> 00:17:46.331
What do you wanna
be when you grow up?

00:17:46.364 --> 00:17:48.135
I'm gonna be a great scholar.

00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:52.476
Oh...! You--
You don't say... ahhh.

00:17:55.016 --> 00:17:56.218
A tail?

00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:59.424
Uh-huh! Just like I
used to have, remember?

00:17:59.457 --> 00:18:01.763
[KRILLIN]
Oh yeah, that's right...

00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:03.365
[laughs]

00:18:03.398 --> 00:18:06.171
So, uh, Goku...
have you noticed anything,

00:18:06.205 --> 00:18:09.077
I don't know,
strange about your boy?

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.814
Whaddaya mean?

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:13.051
For example, does he
start acting "different"

00:18:13.085 --> 00:18:15.089
when he sees a full
moon, or anything?

00:18:15.122 --> 00:18:16.959
Sees a full moon?

00:18:16.993 --> 00:18:20.299
No... but we go
to bed pretty early.

00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:23.238
Why d'you ask?

00:18:23.272 --> 00:18:25.075
Uh! N-Never mind!

00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:26.345
[ROSHI]
It's nothing. It's nothing!

00:18:26.378 --> 00:18:27.715
[KRILLIN]
He sure takes after you

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:29.251
in the looks department, Goku.

00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:31.789
So is he strong like you, too?

00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:33.927
Well uh...

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.063
[GOKU]
It's hard to say.

00:18:35.096 --> 00:18:36.666
It seems like it sometimes.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.704
But I can't give him any
martial arts training

00:18:38.737 --> 00:18:40.106
to find out for sure.

00:18:40.139 --> 00:18:41.642
Chi-Chi won't let me!

00:18:41.675 --> 00:18:43.212
And... Go...!

00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:44.480
--[GOHAN] 1... 2... 3...

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:45.550
--[KRILLIN] Why not...?
--[GOHAN] 1... 2... 3...

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.484
Seems like a
waste if you ask me.

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:47.387
I know...

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.190
[GOKU] But Chi-Chi won't budge.

00:18:49.224 --> 00:18:51.395
She says the world's
been at peace for so long now,

00:18:51.428 --> 00:18:53.566
there's no reason to
teach him how to fight.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:56.672
She says he's got to
focus on studying in school.

00:18:56.706 --> 00:18:58.677
[chuckles]

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.015
So... that little
firecracker wife of yours

00:19:01.048 --> 00:19:03.386
turned out to be a real
schoolmarm, did she?

00:19:03.419 --> 00:19:04.722
Daddy!

00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:06.057
[laughs]

00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:09.131
Oh... I can't believe I didn't
notice this on Gohan's hat...

00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:10.233
Is that a Dragon Ball?

00:19:10.266 --> 00:19:12.203
Yep...! It's the
Four-Star Ball...

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:14.542
[GOKU] It was my Grandpa's
most prized possession.

00:19:14.576 --> 00:19:17.279
I put it on there
to remember him by.

00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:19.619
I also found the Three-Star
and the Six-Star Ball

00:19:19.652 --> 00:19:21.388
when I was out
looking for this one...

00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:23.159
I keep them back at home.

00:19:23.192 --> 00:19:24.361
[sighs]

00:19:24.394 --> 00:19:25.730
Now that takes me back.

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:27.734
We had some crazy times
searching for those things,

00:19:27.768 --> 00:19:28.703
didn't we?

00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:30.740
[GOKU chcukles]

00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:32.912
[GOKU]
What's that?!

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:33.680
[ROSHI] What's wrong?

00:19:33.713 --> 00:19:34.782
I... I don't know...

00:19:34.815 --> 00:19:36.886
Something's coming
this way.

00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:43.365
[KRILLIN] Uh...
You sure about that?

00:19:43.398 --> 00:19:45.202
[BULMA]
I don't know...

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:46.371
[GOKU] This power...

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:49.277
I've never sensed
anything like it...!

00:19:57.894 --> 00:19:59.732
[GOKU] There!

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:01.468

What the--?
Who--Who is that?

00:20:10.352 --> 00:20:13.391
[ROSHI] This is trouble.
I can feel it.

00:20:28.054 --> 00:20:30.860
[RADITZ]
So, we finally meet.

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:35.002
You're all grown up.

00:20:35.704 --> 00:20:39.745
But I could tell it was
you at a glance,... Kakarot.

00:20:39.778 --> 00:20:41.314
Kaka... what?

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:44.788
My, how you look
like our father.

00:20:44.822 --> 00:20:46.058
Huh?

00:20:46.091 --> 00:20:47.193
What does that mean?

00:20:47.227 --> 00:20:48.729
Wait, hold on a sec...

00:20:48.763 --> 00:20:50.032
You know this guy?

00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:51.201
Kakarot...!

00:20:51.235 --> 00:20:52.303
What the hell have
you been doing here

00:20:52.337 --> 00:20:53.540
all these years...?

00:20:53.573 --> 00:20:55.577
Your mission was to
terminate every native

00:20:55.611 --> 00:20:57.346
life form on this planet!

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.852
So, why haven't
you carried it out?

00:20:59.886 --> 00:21:02.557
Uh... Huh?

00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:04.795
Now look you...

00:21:04.828 --> 00:21:05.764
I don't know
who you are,

00:21:05.798 --> 00:21:07.935
but I think we've heard
just about enough.

00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:09.805
[KRILLIN]
Time to leave.

00:21:10.172 --> 00:21:11.876
Shoo...! Go...!

00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:13.044
Or...

00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:15.482
since you don't seem to
be good at taking a hint...

00:21:15.516 --> 00:21:18.155
Maybe you need me to point
you in the right direction.

00:21:18.188 --> 00:21:20.058
Krillin, get back!

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:25.637
Krillin!

00:21:27.206 --> 00:21:28.743

with a tail who
claims to know Goku?
