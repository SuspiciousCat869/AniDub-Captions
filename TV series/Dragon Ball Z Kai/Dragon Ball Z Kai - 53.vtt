00:14:37.053 --> 00:14:40.560
One day... We can
bring all of them back.

00:14:40.594 --> 00:14:42.464
You'd better be
here too, Dad...

00:14:42.497 --> 00:14:44.067
when that day comes...

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.639
Krillin wouldn't
have it any other way!

00:15:14.127 --> 00:15:15.598
I can't take this...!

00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:17.333
What's going on down there?!

00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:19.939
Is Frieza taken
care of or not?!

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.088
The tyrant
is no more.

00:15:28.122 --> 00:15:29.257
He begged for mercy

00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:30.527
before it was all
over and done with,

00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:33.399
and Goku didn't have the
heart to ignore him...

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:36.907
He actually gave Frieza
some of his surplus energy...

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.445
Never one to miss a
cheap shot, though,

00:15:39.478 --> 00:15:42.484
Frieza turned on him
at the last moment.

00:15:42.518 --> 00:15:46.592
Goku had no choice
but to defend himself.

00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:50.399
Okay... And by "defend
himself" you mean...?

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:52.671
Not even Frieza
was a match for Goku

00:15:52.705 --> 00:15:54.475
in his Super Saiyan form.

00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:57.748
The universe is now
free from his rule.

00:15:57.782 --> 00:16:00.086
Ha! Yeah!

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.623
<i>[TIEN] Guess this
whole Super Saiyan thing</i>

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:03.660
<i>is serious business...</i>

00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:05.531
<i>With Frieza out of the picture,</i>

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:09.505
<i>Goku's essentially the greatest
warrior in the known universe.</i>

00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:12.612
<i>Heh. I'm sure glad
he's on our side...</i>

00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:15.651
Hold on... There's more.

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:18.489
Goku might be able to
claim the victory, yes...

00:16:18.523 --> 00:16:20.728
But he's hardly out
of the woods just yet.

00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:22.565
How do you figure?

00:16:22.598 --> 00:16:24.167
In only a matter of moments,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.940
Planet Namek will
be space dust.

00:16:26.973 --> 00:16:28.509
He has no hope
of making it back

00:16:28.543 --> 00:16:30.246
to the space pod
he traveled there in

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:31.916
before the planet explodes...

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.522
He's making a bee-line
for Frieza's spaceship,

00:16:34.555 --> 00:16:35.924
which he actually stands

00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.427
a good chance of
reaching in time...

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.700
But from the look of things
it may be too damaged to fly...!

00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:45.844
Hey...

00:16:45.878 --> 00:16:47.748
Relax; it's not like we're
talkin' about just anybody...

00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:50.253
Goku's pulled through
worse scrapes than this...

00:16:50.286 --> 00:16:51.656
Besides, in Super Saiyan form

00:16:51.689 --> 00:16:54.595
the guy's like in peak condition
times a million, right?

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:55.897
Come on... Think...!

00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:59.773
No way he's not gonna get
out of there with time to spare!

00:16:59.806 --> 00:17:01.441
Yeah...

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:02.611
Do whatever you
have to, Goku;

00:17:02.645 --> 00:17:05.049
just do it quickly!

00:17:09.892 --> 00:17:11.596
There!

00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:24.420
<i>Please let there
be enough time...!</i>

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:32.303
<i>Where is the control room?!</i>

00:17:52.678 --> 00:17:53.379
Okay...!

00:17:53.412 --> 00:17:54.882
The controls are configured

00:17:54.916 --> 00:17:56.620
a lot like the
ones on my pod.

00:17:56.653 --> 00:18:00.360
<i>Which means the "start"
button should be...</i>

00:18:00.393 --> 00:18:02.096
There...

00:18:07.307 --> 00:18:09.712
<i>That's it...
You can do it...!</i>

00:18:14.153 --> 00:18:17.160
Come on! Don't let me down...

00:18:17.193 --> 00:18:19.898
You can do this...! Start up!

00:18:30.152 --> 00:18:32.524
C'mon, c'mon! Get it in gear!

00:19:38.322 --> 00:19:42.798
No! That ship was
his only hope...!

00:19:42.832 --> 00:19:44.134
He'll never make it!

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:45.036
What just happened...?!

00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:47.107
What's going on?!

Frieza's ship;

Goku's last chance of
getting off Namek...

00:19:51.716 --> 00:19:55.557
Is now fathoms
deeps in molten lava!

00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:58.696
So, then what's he
supposed to do now?

00:19:58.729 --> 00:20:00.700
[KING KAI]
Nothing, I'm afraid...

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:03.840
There's absolutely
nothing he can do...

This isn't fair!!!
