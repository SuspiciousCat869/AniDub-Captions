00:17:48.637 --> 00:17:50.807
we wouldn't have known
about Dad's heart virus,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.876
or the androids.

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:53.446
It all just would
have happened...

00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:56.553
I mean, he even brought back
that medicine from the future.

00:17:56.586 --> 00:17:59.558
You're very considerate,
aren't you, my little cutie!

00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:01.996
You know what... maybe
my dad's taken the medicine

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.000
and he's
feeling better already.

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:05.504
I'm sure he's
fine by now.

00:18:05.538 --> 00:18:08.643
Yeah, you're right.
Let's go find out!

[PICCOLO]
Dr. Gero hides
his lab in a cave

00:18:15.122 --> 00:18:17.628
in one of these
mountains here, correct?

00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:20.834
[KRILLIN]
Coulda' done us a favor and
picked some place warmer...

00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:22.203
What's the plan?

00:18:22.237 --> 00:18:23.907
There are mountains as far
as the eye can see, Piccolo.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.543
Not to mention the
fact that Dr. Gero

00:18:25.577 --> 00:18:28.282
can sense our energy without
giving off any of his own

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:29.852
for us to pick up on.

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:31.355
We'll have to
split up and search.

00:18:31.388 --> 00:18:34.528
If you find anything, signal
the others. Don't go it alone.

00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:35.429
A signal, huh?

00:18:35.463 --> 00:18:36.566
What exactly do
you have in mind?

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.603
Raise your energy
high as you can...

00:18:38.636 --> 00:18:39.505
We'll notice that.

00:18:39.538 --> 00:18:40.239
Good thinking.

It's so cold here...!

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.124
Tough it out. You're not
the only one who's cold.

00:18:49.157 --> 00:18:51.428
Humans are so delicate.

00:18:51.462 --> 00:18:52.597
Now focus!

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:55.336
We need to find these
androids as fast as we can.

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:57.073
Right... Let's
get to it, then.

00:18:57.106 --> 00:18:58.476
Don't forget,

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.514
the fate of the planet's
resting on our shoulders, guys.

00:19:00.547 --> 00:19:01.348
Wait a second!

00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:02.752
Yes, you're
freezing. We know!

00:19:02.785 --> 00:19:04.087
Uh, I was thinking

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.858
you should probably
take some senzu beans...

00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:07.293
...better safe
than sorry.

00:19:07.326 --> 00:19:09.398
Good idea...
Thanks, Krillin.

00:19:09.431 --> 00:19:11.167
[KRILLIN]
Okay, so there's
half a dozen left.

00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:14.407
Divide that by the three
of us, that's two each.

00:19:14.441 --> 00:19:16.278
[PICCOLO]
Well if everything
goes according to plan,

00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:18.616
we won't
even need them.

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:28.468
My theory held up...
they know about my lab,

00:19:28.503 --> 00:19:30.239
but I think they'll find
that tracking it down

00:19:30.272 --> 00:19:33.479
is another matter...
Prepare to fail, fools!

00:19:33.513 --> 00:19:37.386

I'll defeat you soon enough!

Why do you insist
on following me?

00:19:41.027 --> 00:19:44.367
What, are you going to tattle
to your mommy?! Get out of here!

00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:45.771
I'll turn around...

00:19:45.804 --> 00:19:48.475
...as soon as you promise
not to fight the androids!

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.679
So what do you plan to do

00:19:49.712 --> 00:19:51.481
once I've tracked
down that laboratory?

00:19:51.515 --> 00:19:53.486
Will you destroy
the sleeping androids,

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.624
even if it means
you have to go through me?

00:19:55.657 --> 00:19:56.559
If I have to...

00:19:56.593 --> 00:19:57.994
I'll say it one
more time, though,

00:19:58.028 --> 00:20:00.065
17 and 18 are
more powerful

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:01.869
than you could
possibly imagine!

Don't you get it?
Telling that to a real Saiyan

makes him want to fight
these creatures even more!

00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:09.117
Now you could just
make yourself useful

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.689

find Gero's laboratory!
