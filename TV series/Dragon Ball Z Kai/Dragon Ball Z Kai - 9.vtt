<i>[Narrator] Yamcha's Struggle!
The Terrible Saibamen.</i>

00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:36.159
Who are they?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:37.729
What are they?!

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:39.465
They call this place
Earth, right?...

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:42.606
It's not as bad as
I was expecting.

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:44.943
Yeah.. but before we start
with the sight-seeing,

00:01:44.977 --> 00:01:47.014
how 'bout we say
hello to the locals?

00:01:47.048 --> 00:01:49.418
[laughing] Go easy on 'em.

00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:05.016
[Tien] What the...darn it...

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.456
It must be them...What have
those monsters done?!

00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.999
[Tien] Oh man!

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:14.769
Whoa.. This is
intense.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.540
[Laughing] I don't think I made
a big enough impression.

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:34.943
Maybe I should try again.

00:02:34.976 --> 00:02:37.114
It'd be best if we left
it at that, Nappa...

00:02:37.148 --> 00:02:39.018
The more damage we do now

00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:40.955
the less of a price we'll get
when we sell this planet.

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:42.960
Oh, right. Well, that's fine...

00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:45.097
We should probably start
looking for those

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.602
what-cha-macallit Balls
that grant wishes anyway.

00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:51.342
They're called Dragon Balls...
And the first thing we need to

00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:53.080
do is find the one
who beat Raditz

00:02:53.113 --> 00:02:55.685
and extract a little information
about their whereabouts.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.087
Oh yeah...

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.058
Now of course, if
the Dragon Balls

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:01.697
were being held somewhere
in this vicinity...

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.968
Then our chance to wish
for eternal life..

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.573
just went up in smoke..
Now, didn't it?

00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:10.147
All because you had
to "say hello".

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.253
S- Sorry Vegeta...Guess I
really wasn't thinkin'...

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:14.956
It won't happen again.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.961
Forget about it.
What's done is done.

00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:18.665
Now, let's try to scope out

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.902
the highest power
level on this planet.

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:24.041
Finding the one who beat Raditz
should be as simple as that.

00:03:25.912 --> 00:03:29.886
That's strange...
According to my scouter

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.859
there are multiple readings for
power levels over one-thousand.

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.432
Why would there be
so many of 'em?

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:40.273
Just take it easy...There's no
reason for us to be alarmed...

00:03:40.306 --> 00:03:43.113
As I said we find the one
with the highest power level

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:44.314
and go after him.

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:52.532
I got him. Looks like two
fairly high readings

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.134
right next to each other.

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:58.176
Yes. Seems you're right... What
do you say we go have some fun.

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:09.465
The cause behind the large-scale
earthquake is still unknown

00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:12.104
<i>to authorities at this time.
Reports are flooding in</i>

00:04:12.138 --> 00:04:14.175
<i>that attempts to
contact Metro East,</i>

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.814
<i>which is in the epicenter,
have been unsuccessful,</i>

00:04:16.847 --> 00:04:19.719
<i>causing grave concern for
those within the city.</i>

00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:23.326
No...No... It's the Saiyans--
they've arrived...

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:26.499
Let's go then. This thing'll
tell us exactly where they are.

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:28.036
Did you see what just happened?

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.639
There's no way I'm
going with you!

00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:33.046
Wait.. I'll go with you Bulma!..
I'm sure Yamcha will be there,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.216
and he'll need all
the help he can get!

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.826
Hold on now.. We better not...
It wouldn't be a good idea...

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.165
Our power levels are much too
weak for us to be effective...

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.140
Our best bet is to stay here
and just hope for the best.

00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:52.752
Oh, Goku.. Where are you?
We need you, Goku!

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:59.164
<i>[Goku] Hold on guys. I'm coming
as fast as I can!</i>

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:11.088
This is fantastic!...

00:05:11.122 --> 00:05:14.228
Compared to Planet Vegeta, the
gravity here's next to nothing!

00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.265
Makes flying around a breeze!

00:05:23.514 --> 00:05:26.787
Here they come...man,
they are movin' fast...

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:29.593
They're heading in the direction
of those other two big powers.

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:31.597
That must be Piccolo and Gohan.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.636
Gohan.. Be ready.
They're coming right for us.

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.939
Right.

00:05:35.972 --> 00:05:38.309
Chiaotzu...Go find a safe
place to hide, okay?

00:05:38.343 --> 00:05:40.515
No way!.. I'm coming, too!

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:42.017
There is nothing to fear...

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.756
Remember, compared
to one year ago,

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.927
you and I have managed to
increase our power ten-fold.

00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:48.329
I'm ready.

00:05:48.363 --> 00:05:50.868
There's someone else closing
in from that direction!

00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:53.640
And there, too! Feels like
they've got us surrounded!

00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:56.445
Wait, so you mean there are more
than two Saiyans coming for us?!

00:05:58.684 --> 00:05:59.719
Look out, they're here!

00:05:59.752 --> 00:06:03.193
Hey!... Long time no see..
Piccolo.

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:04.896
Oh, it's just you, huh.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.469
And what exactly do you
think you're doing?..

00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:11.008
You do know that you're
just gonna get in the way.

00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:12.344
Then again...

00:06:12.378 --> 00:06:14.682
I'm guessing you won't be the
only fool taking part in this.

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:17.622
Right... The whole gang's
coming... I just happened to be

00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:19.191
the one who's closest
to where you were.

00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:20.894
I remember now...

00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:23.466
You're the one I saw at
Master Roshi's place, right.

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:25.036
Yeah, the name's Krillin..

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.675
You sure have bulked up since
the last time I saw you...

00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:30.147
Almost exactly like Goku,
when he was your age.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.719
And you grew up with
my dad, didn't you?..

00:06:32.752 --> 00:06:34.856
He's told me lots of
stories from back then...

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.728
So you're the one who used to
train to make up for being short

00:06:37.762 --> 00:06:41.369
Hold on.. Goku told
you what now?

00:06:41.402 --> 00:06:44.374
Hey you two...enough of your
small talk! They're here!

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:54.896
[laughing] Look at what we
found.

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:58.838
Three pathetic insects doing
their best to look tough.

00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:01.075
You can give them
credit for one thing.

00:07:01.109 --> 00:07:03.513
They at least seem
to know who we are.

00:07:16.238 --> 00:07:19.244
It looks like they've
been waiting for us.

00:07:21.248 --> 00:07:24.623
I'll say this once.
Forget whatever business

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:27.127
you have here and
leave this planet.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.066
This is your first and last
chance to get out of this alive.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.770
That voice! I see...

00:07:31.804 --> 00:07:34.710
You're the one who defeated
Raditz a year ago, huh?

00:07:34.743 --> 00:07:35.711
How do you?

00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:38.083
Come now...Didn't Raditz
tell you?..

00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:43.326
Our scouters also work
as communicators.

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:46.132
Hey.. I think the green
one's a Namekian.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:49.138
Yes...No doubt about it... It
almost makes sense in a way

00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:52.077
that Raditz would've had a hard
time with the likes of him.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.814
Okay, so what's a Namekian?

00:07:53.847 --> 00:07:57.722
Not only are they known to have
above-average power levels,

00:07:57.756 --> 00:07:58.824
Namekians are said to have

00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:02.798
mysterious hidden
abilities as well.

00:08:02.832 --> 00:08:07.107
<i>[Piccolo] So.. I'm.. one of
these.. Namekians?</i>

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.846
<i>[Vegeta] I've also heard that a
chosen few are capable</i>

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.121
<i>of performing tricks, almost
like a magician... A ha...</i>

00:08:14.155 --> 00:08:19.030
You must be the one who created
these Dragon Balls. Aren't you?

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:22.905
No way! How could those two
know about the Dragon Balls?

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:25.745
We not only know about 'em, it's
the main reason we're here...

00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:28.751
Now just hand 'em
over, nice and easy...

00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:30.922
Your friend here
may be Namekian..

00:08:30.955 --> 00:08:32.692
but you're bugs to us;

00:08:32.725 --> 00:08:35.430
and you're gonna be crushed
by our Saiyan power.

00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:38.637
Is that..right?... I
guess I should start

00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:41.442
by thanking you for teaching
me about my ancestry...

00:08:41.476 --> 00:08:43.881
But.. you're wrong
about two things...

00:08:43.914 --> 00:08:47.454
Firstly, I had no hand in
making the Dragon Balls.

00:08:47.488 --> 00:08:53.299
As you can see.. I'm more of a
warrior than a simple magician.

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.972
And you're wrong if you
think your "Saiyan power"

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:57.174
will save you from me!

00:08:57.207 --> 00:08:58.944
Oh Kami.

00:08:58.978 --> 00:09:01.516
I...I had no idea...

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.889
For the first time in my life
I have heard about my origin.

00:09:04.923 --> 00:09:09.866
...Now I know why I have always
possessed special powers.. Yes.

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:13.808
It's true.. I'm the one who
created the Dragon Balls..

00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:16.880
a very long time ago.

00:09:16.914 --> 00:09:20.253
It all makes sense now.
I attempted to create

00:09:20.286 --> 00:09:22.926
the Dragon Balls in answer
to a deep yearning.

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:27.267
When I finally succeeded, I felt
as if I had made it home...

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:31.910
or rather, as if a piece of home
had found its way to me...

00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:34.749
Oh, and Nappa.
Take off your scouter.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:35.985
What

00:09:36.018 --> 00:09:38.690
These pests are able to raise
and lower their power levels

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:40.026
in response to
their opponent...

00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:42.932
Which makes our scouters
totally unreliable.

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:46.540
Right, good thinking,
Vegeta... I remember now,

00:09:46.573 --> 00:09:49.011
that's how that weakling
Raditz got himself killed.

00:09:49.045 --> 00:09:51.783
He got fooled by his scouter's
readings and lowered his guard.

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:56.459
Raditz? Isn't he the
Saiyan that was so tough

00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:58.295
that you and Goku had
to team up on him?

00:09:58.329 --> 00:10:00.433
And still you were just
barely able to beat him?

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:01.970
They're calling him weak?

00:10:02.004 --> 00:10:03.940
Alright.. Enough talking.

00:10:03.974 --> 00:10:06.379
Let's see how these pests
handle themselves in action...

00:10:06.412 --> 00:10:07.916
Hey Nappa..

00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:11.021
We still have six of those
saibamen left, don't we?..

00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:12.424
Get them ready, would you.

00:10:12.457 --> 00:10:15.798
Ah, Vegeta...You and your
twisted sense of humor.

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:17.300
S-Saibamen?

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:19.204
What..are they?

00:10:19.238 --> 00:10:22.044
Yep, looks like six it is.

00:10:22.077 --> 00:10:24.148
This soil should do nicely.

00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:27.187
Soon you'll be telling us
everything we wanna hear.

00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:33.634
Woah.. What the heck
are they doing?

00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:35.002
There.

00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:37.608
[crubling earth]

00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:46.225
Eww.. They're gross!...

00:10:46.258 --> 00:10:48.730
But, at least they're
shorter than I am...

00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:51.034
[creepy alien barking]

00:10:56.779 --> 00:10:58.750
[alien yelling]

00:11:18.355 --> 00:11:20.861
Your targets are the
three in front of you...

00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:23.065
Give them a once
over, Saibamen.

00:11:28.075 --> 00:11:29.979
[alien yelling]

00:11:32.718 --> 00:11:35.624
[fight sounds]

00:11:57.902 --> 00:12:00.073
Gohan...Do not lose your nerve.

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:01.475
Right.

00:12:06.119 --> 00:12:08.022
It's about time we
go on the offensive!

00:12:08.055 --> 00:12:09.424
<i>[Chiaotzu] Krillin!</i>

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:18.008
Tien, hey! And Chiaotzu...
You came too?

00:12:20.213 --> 00:12:21.616
<i>[Tien] I was under
the impression</i>

00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:23.285
<i>there were only two Saiyans.</i>

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:26.392
Well.. a lot's happened...
Now there's eight.

00:12:26.425 --> 00:12:31.101
Two, eight, makes no difference
to me...So who's the kid?...

00:12:31.134 --> 00:12:32.905
I assume that's
Goku's little boy?

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:35.844
<i>[Krillin] Yeah.. Piccolo here's
done a good job
of training him.</i>

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:46.098
What's up?...
Sorry I'm a bit late.

00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:47.234
Hey, Yamcha!

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.104
<i>[Yamcha] Looks like everyone's
here but Goku, huh?</i>

00:12:49.137 --> 00:12:54.147
<i>[Vegeta] One.. Two.. Three..
Four.. Five.. and Six.</i>

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.483
Interesting...

00:12:55.517 --> 00:12:58.289
That's the exact same number
of Saibamen we have.

00:12:58.323 --> 00:12:59.658
What do you say?...

00:12:59.692 --> 00:13:02.599
Each of you can take turns
fighting one of our Saibamen.

00:13:02.632 --> 00:13:05.269
Let's see what happens.

00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:07.307
You know...a game...

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.179
We're not here to play games!..

00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:12.417
And we're not going to
fight on your terms!..

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.321
We'll take you all on at once!

00:13:14.355 --> 00:13:18.931
Whoa Whoa, Easy now. Maybe it's
not such a bad idea after all.

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:22.437
This game can buy us some
time until Goku gets here.

00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:25.844
I'm up for it. These little
creeps don't scare me...

00:13:25.877 --> 00:13:27.915
I could use a good warm up...

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:32.490
[laughing] That's the spirit!
Fresh meat for the grinder!..

00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:35.263
But give it a minute --
you won't be so cocky

00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:38.369
when you see what these
'little creeps' can do...

00:13:38.403 --> 00:13:42.845
You'll be going first...hit him
as hard as you can... Got it?

00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:13.139
Yeah!!

00:14:13.172 --> 00:14:15.142
Oh yeah, that'll show 'em, Tien!

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:18.215
Awesome!

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:24.895
There's no way!

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:27.200
A Saibaman's power level
is twelve-hundred!...

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:29.004
Every one of these guys
is supposed to be

00:14:29.037 --> 00:14:30.373
about as strong as Raditz was!

00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:31.676
<i>[Vegeta] All that means,</i>

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:34.414
<i>is that the three-eyed
freak here is stronger.</i>

00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:35.550
B-But I...

00:14:37.354 --> 00:14:39.090
A simple miscalculation.

00:14:39.124 --> 00:14:41.195
But the data says...

00:14:41.228 --> 00:14:43.365
[laughing] It's fine... If
anything,

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:46.171
it should make our little game
here even more entertaining...

00:14:57.393 --> 00:15:00.433
Vegeta...Wh-What was.. that for?

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:03.406
He made the grave mistake of
underestimating his opponent...

00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:09.184
And I believe I specifically
told him to hold nothing back.

00:15:09.217 --> 00:15:11.389
Man...That guy's a creep...

00:15:11.422 --> 00:15:12.592
<i>[Piccolo] He's ruthless...</i>

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.896
<i>If this is the way he
treats his allies...</i>

00:15:14.929 --> 00:15:18.302
<i>don't expect he'll be showing
any mercy to his enemies...</i>

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:21.308
Now.. Who wants to be next?

00:15:21.342 --> 00:15:24.481
Uh...Yeah...I'm ready
for ya.

00:15:24.516 --> 00:15:25.551
[Yamcha] Hold on Krillin.

00:15:25.584 --> 00:15:26.986
Yamcha?

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.561
Let me have a crack at 'em... I
think it's time I showed these

00:15:30.594 --> 00:15:33.399
thugs that no one comes to
earth and pushes us around.

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.504
But Yamcha...
I'm just as capable of...

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:38.209
You've already been wished back
with the Dragon Balls before.

00:15:38.242 --> 00:15:40.479
I haven't. So, if anything
bad does happen,

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:42.651
at least we know that I
can be revived, right?

00:15:42.684 --> 00:15:44.555
Let me take care of this one...

00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:47.728
I'm gonna wipe out all
five of 'em at once.

00:15:47.761 --> 00:15:51.134
Ah, look at the
friends. How precious...

00:15:51.168 --> 00:15:53.540
Well?.. What are
you waiting for?

00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:57.681
All right then... Let's get
this over with! C'mon!

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.823
<i>[Goku] I don't know why,</i>

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.326
<i>but I've got a bad
feeling all of a sudden...</i>

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:05.429
<i>Hold out for as long
as you can, Piccolo..</i>

00:16:05.462 --> 00:16:08.235
<i>I won't slow down until
I'm there. I promise!</i>

00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:17.989
They...vanished!

00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:20.459
Wrong Gohan...They're just
moving incredibly fast...

00:16:20.493 --> 00:16:22.765
Try to feel out their
energies, like I taught you!

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:24.768
Feel.. their energy?

00:16:25.904 --> 00:16:28.443
<i>[Piccolo] Come on...You're the
only one who can't see them.</i>

00:16:28.476 --> 00:16:30.279
What?.. Everyone but me?

00:16:33.252 --> 00:16:34.321
<i>[Piccolo] Concentrate...</i>

00:16:34.354 --> 00:16:36.492
<i>Let your body take in
your surroundings...</i>

00:16:36.526 --> 00:16:39.297
<i>[Gohan] See with my body,
not my eyes.</i>

00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:45.677
[distant fight sounds]

00:16:55.095 --> 00:16:57.099
See them now?

00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:05.316
I see them!

00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:37.280
Got him!

00:17:37.314 --> 00:17:39.050
No.. way.

00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:40.687
Alright, that's it!
Yes, way to go!

00:17:40.721 --> 00:17:42.456
Woah.. did you see that?!

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:46.498
[cheering]

00:17:56.051 --> 00:17:57.420
Not again!

00:18:04.768 --> 00:18:07.306
It looks like these
little Saibamen of yours

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.779
aren't nearly as powerful as
you made them out to be.

00:18:09.812 --> 00:18:11.415
Why you...!

00:18:11.448 --> 00:18:13.920
Easy, Nappa.

00:18:13.953 --> 00:18:15.490
I'll save my friends
the trouble

00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:17.894
and take care of the
last four by myself.

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:22.103
[Vegeta] Now that,
I'd like to see.

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:24.240
Too bad I won't
get the chance...

00:18:24.273 --> 00:18:25.644
[Yamcha] What?

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:32.858
Get off!

00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:48.355
No...Fight 'em...

00:18:52.063 --> 00:18:54.067
[explosion]

00:18:56.038 --> 00:18:57.406
Yamcha, no!

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:04.955
There... Now that's
more like it.

00:19:04.989 --> 00:19:08.563
That thing's insane!...
It just blew itself up!

00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:14.040
Is he--?

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.770
Guys.. We lost him.

00:19:30.005 --> 00:19:33.045
Yamcha no! Tell me
it's not true!

00:19:33.078 --> 00:19:43.132
Please Yamcha, get up! Please!
Yamcha! Yamcha! Yamcha! No!

00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:49.812
Please Yamcha, get up! Please!

00:19:49.845 --> 00:19:52.183
You must've had a feeling
somethin' like this would

00:19:52.216 --> 00:19:56.826
happen, huh? That's why you
insisted on going before me...

00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:59.230
Darn it!

00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:03.974
Why'd you have to go and play
the hero, you stupid jerk!

00:20:04.007 --> 00:20:07.347
What am I s'posed to tell
Puar and Bulma, huh?

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.685
What was that idiot
Saibaman thinkin'?...

00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:10.921
I don't wanna see a draw!

00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:14.529
I wanna see a win! C'mon!
Let's go to the next round!

00:20:14.562 --> 00:20:17.167
[Vegeta] Calm down, Nappa. Now
let's give 'em a moment

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.571
to clear this trash
off the battlefield.

00:20:22.978 --> 00:20:28.689
How dare you! Everyone..
stand back!

00:20:28.723 --> 00:20:34.333
'Kay buddy... This one's for
you. I won't let you down...

00:20:37.107 --> 00:20:40.112
I'm gonna make them pay...
for what they did!

00:20:43.485 --> 00:20:46.191
[Narrator] The Saiyans have
claimed their first casualty.

00:20:46.224 --> 00:20:49.766
Yamcha...Anguished by the
loss of his friend,

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:53.139
Krillin's fury is about
to be unleashed--

00:20:53.172 --> 00:20:56.177
next Dragon Ball Z Kai

00:21:39.565 --> 00:21:40.800
<i>[Goku] Hey! It's me, Goku!...</i>

00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:43.840
<i>I still have a little ways to
go, so hang in there everyone!</i>

00:21:43.873 --> 00:21:45.777
<i>[Tien] Chiaotzu, why in the
world would you want to</i>

00:21:45.811 --> 00:21:46.946
<i>fight one of those monsters?!</i>

00:21:46.979 --> 00:21:48.683
<i>[Gohan] Chiaotzu, no!</i>

00:21:48.717 --> 00:21:52.356
<i>[Tien] I'll do everything in my
power to avenge your sacrifice,</i>

00:21:52.389 --> 00:21:56.632
<i>Chiaotzu...Take this,
Saiyans! It's all I've got!</i>

00:21:56.666 --> 00:22:00.339
<i>[Goku] Next time on Dragon Ball
Z Kai: Sit Tight, Chiaotzu!</i>

00:22:00.372 --> 00:22:02.544
<i>Tien's Screaming Tri-Beam!</i>

00:22:02.578 --> 00:22:05.583
<i>[Gohan] Hurry up, Dad! We need
you!</i>
