WEBVTT

00:00:01.102 --> 00:00:02.639
[NARRATOR] On the last
Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.112
Gohan, Krillin, and Piccolo
waged a desperate battle

00:00:06.146 --> 00:00:09.485
against Nappa, hoping to buy
what little time they could.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.791
Meanwhile, Goku raced
toward the battlefield

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:13.393
on his Flying Nimbus...

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:15.030
But with the Earthlings'
attacks against

00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:17.235
the Saiyans
proving ineffective,

00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:20.341
the hero's arrival
may come too late...!

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:24.281
The Saiyans close
in for the kill--

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.551
Now!

00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:36.138
♪ Opening Song ♪

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:02.144
[NAPPA] Ah!

00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:09.592
Yaaaaahhh!

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:21.850
[PICCOLO]
Auuugh!

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.537
[GOHAN]
Why'd you do that?!

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:52.746
[PICCOLO] Just run...
Gohan... Before it's--

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:54.481
[thud]

00:02:58.624 --> 00:03:00.594
[GOHAN] No...!
You can't die like this--

00:03:00.628 --> 00:03:04.101
not by saving
me...! Piccolo!

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:07.041
[PICCOLO] Da... Damn it,
boy--run away...

00:03:07.074 --> 00:03:09.813
While there's still time...

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:10.782
[GOHAN]
Forget about it!

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:11.850
I'm not gonna
run away--

00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:14.488
not if it means leaving
you here like this...

00:03:14.523 --> 00:03:17.295
Just hold on...
Dad's coming...

00:03:17.328 --> 00:03:18.564
[NAPPA] Ah, dang it...

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.935
I had intended on
saving that one for last,

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:22.070
but oh well...

00:03:22.104 --> 00:03:24.475
I guess it's all
the same in the end.

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.228
[GOKU] Someone's power
is fading rapidly...

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:37.267
Someone's dying!

00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:48.524
[KAMI] So this how my
story ends, after all...

00:03:48.558 --> 00:03:52.231
Goku couldn't make it in time
to prevent Piccolo's death...

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:53.433
but in his last moments

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:56.272
my dark counterpart
outshone even me...

00:03:56.306 --> 00:03:58.443
An encouraging thought...

00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:06.392
[MR. POPO]
Kami, nooo!!!

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:10.000
[PICCOLO] What a sorry
excuse I've become...

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.806
Me: Piccolo,
laying down his life

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.945
to protect some whiney
little pipsqueak...

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:19.786
[GOHAN]
Piccolo...

00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:24.095
[PICCOLO]
Gohan...

00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:25.430
You're the only
person I've ever known

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:28.704
who didn't treat
me like a monster...

00:04:29.672 --> 00:04:31.977
[GOHAN] Yeah, but my
dad used to tell me...

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.413
He said ever since
you were reborn,

00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:35.652
you're not nearly as
bad as you used to be.

00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:38.557
He said now you're
more grumpy than evil.

00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:40.828
I don't know--I think
he was kinda right...

00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:42.064
But... I mean my mom

00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:44.468
is still totally
scared of you and all...

00:04:45.237 --> 00:04:46.607
[GOHAN]
No fair...

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.376
You promised you wouldn't
use your eye beams thing.

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.646
[PICCOLO] And
what if I did...?

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:51.316
You can never
trust your enemy,

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:52.952
especially in a fight!

00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:55.090
[GOHAN]
Yeah...? Well...

00:04:55.124 --> 00:04:57.628
But you're not the enemy.

00:04:57.662 --> 00:04:59.098
[PICCOLO] Tru...
Truth be told,

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:02.104
this last year...
wasn't so bad...

00:05:02.137 --> 00:05:03.841
[GOHAN]
Piccolo, please!

00:05:05.077 --> 00:05:08.985
[PICCOLO]
Thank you, Gohan.

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:13.359
[GOHAN] Nooooooo!

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:15.164
[KAMI] Take care,
old friend...

00:05:15.197 --> 00:05:17.034
I leave the rest to you.

00:05:17.068 --> 00:05:19.005
[MR. POPO]
Kami...!

00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:22.344
Kami!!!

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:34.903
[NAPPA] Alright...!
Bring it on!

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:37.508
[GOHAN]
Masenko...!!!

00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:40.480
[KRILLIN]
Gohan...?

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:47.863
[VEGETA] Seven-hundred...
Fifteen-hundred...

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:49.666
What the...?

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.872
[VEGETA] These
Earthlings can hide

00:05:52.905 --> 00:05:54.643
their true strength--
Nappa, look out!

00:05:54.676 --> 00:05:55.744
The little one's power level

00:05:55.778 --> 00:05:57.582
has risen to
twenty-eight hundred!

00:05:57.615 --> 00:05:59.719
[NAPPA] That's
more like it, boy!

00:05:59.752 --> 00:06:02.157
[GOHAN] Haaaaaa!

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:05.397
[NAPPA] Yaaahh!

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.436
[explosion]

00:06:11.643 --> 00:06:13.346
[NAPPA] Hey, not a
bad move there, kid...

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.853
That actually kinda
stung. Ha ha ha...

00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:19.692
You're just full
of surprises, huh?

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:22.497
[VEGETA] Hmm...
Well, well... Heh.

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:24.401
His power's dropping
like a stone now--

00:06:24.435 --> 00:06:26.906
the brat used it
all on one shot.

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:33.186
[GOHAN] Piccolo...
I'm sorry...

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.123
i tried to avenge you

00:06:37.427 --> 00:06:38.496
[KRILLIN] Run!
Get out of there!

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:39.833
He's gonna kill you!

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.304
[NAPPA] Ha ha! Be sure
to tell your dead friends

00:06:42.337 --> 00:06:45.277
I said hello.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.747
[GOHAN]
No, Krillin.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.484
I just don't have the
strength any more...

00:06:50.754 --> 00:06:53.326
[NAPPA] Ahh... don't
worry about it kiddo,

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:54.361
'cause when
your dad sees you

00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:56.065
crushed to a bloody pulp--

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.672
I'll be sure and tell
him how noble you were!

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:15.804
[GOHAN]
Ni-Nimbus...?

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:26.893
[GOHAN]
It's my dad!

00:07:27.094 --> 00:07:28.930
[KRILLIN]
He made it.

00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:39.719
[VEGETA] Nice
of you to drop by.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.894
[VEGETA] Still... I'm a
little embarrassed for you,

00:07:43.927 --> 00:07:45.330
I have to admit...

00:07:45.363 --> 00:07:48.202
I mean, I sincerely hope you
didn't come all this way--

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:49.438
back from the dead even--

00:07:49.471 --> 00:07:52.278
believing you stood
any chance against us...

00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:54.247
That would be a shame.

00:08:01.897 --> 00:08:04.536
[GOKU]
What happened to him?

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:07.975
[GOHAN] He died... trying
to protect me from them.

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:16.926
[GOKU] Tien...

00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:22.505
[GOKU] Yamcha...

00:08:22.538 --> 00:08:23.808
[NAPPA] Ha ha ha!

00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:25.110
Does seein'
these losers dead

00:08:25.143 --> 00:08:27.682
send your blood pressure
through the roof...?

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.552
There was another one
around here somewhere--

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:32.591
but I guess there wouldn't
be much left of him now.

00:08:35.396 --> 00:08:36.700
[NAPPA] A strong
little runt.

00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:38.738
You might say he went
out with a bit of a bang.

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:41.776
[GOKU] Those bastards!
They killed Chiaotzu...!

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.949
And now Kami,
too...? Damn it!

00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:49.324
[NAPPA] Hey, look
on the bright side--

00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:50.594
no need to grieve...

00:08:50.628 --> 00:08:52.598
You're all about
to be reunited!

00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:54.167
And here you've gone
through all the trouble

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.238
of coming back to life...

00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:05.791
[VEGETA] His power level's
increasing exponentially!

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:11.903
[NAPPA]
Somebody's eager...

00:09:11.937 --> 00:09:14.174
You really miss
'em that much?

00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:17.581
[NAPPA] Well you'll
get no argument from me.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.923
[VEGETA] And he's fast!

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:24.127
[GOKU]
This way, buddy...

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:27.502
[GOKU] Krillin...

00:09:27.535 --> 00:09:28.904
[KRILLIN]
W-Welcome back.

00:09:28.938 --> 00:09:30.541
[GOKU] Sorry it
took me so long...

00:09:30.574 --> 00:09:33.312
But hey... You two
held your own, huh...?

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:35.918
Here you go...

00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:37.988
Eat up--I want each
of you to take half.

00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:39.826
[KRILLIN]
A senzu bean...?

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:42.799
I... I didn't think
Korin had any left...

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.236
[GOKU] You're lookin'
at the last one.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.873
[KRILLIN]
You eat it, then.

00:09:46.907 --> 00:09:48.610
It would just
be wasted on me.

00:09:48.644 --> 00:09:49.912
[GOKU]
Don't talk like that--

00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:51.850
I had one on the
way here anyhow.

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:53.754
[KRILLIN] Trust me, you'll
wanna hold onto it...

00:09:53.788 --> 00:09:55.390
You know, just in case...

00:09:55.423 --> 00:09:56.993
Besides, even at
the top of my game

00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:59.431
I'm pretty much useless
against these guys.

00:09:59.464 --> 00:10:00.434
[GOKU] Yeah, well
I've got the bean

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:01.770
so it's my decision...

00:10:01.803 --> 00:10:04.943
If you don't eat half
I'm gonna throw it away...

00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:06.613
Come on.

00:10:07.314 --> 00:10:08.817
[KRILLIN]
Thanks, Goku.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.821
[GOKU]
Okay, now. You too.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.068
[GOKU] Krillin--
you've gotten a lot

00:10:18.102 --> 00:10:20.340
more powerful
this last year, huh?

00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:21.509
[KRILLIN]
Yeah, I thought so too

00:10:21.543 --> 00:10:23.045
before we actually
started to fight...

00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:24.683
Then it felt like
the best I had in me

00:10:24.716 --> 00:10:26.385
was some kinda joke...

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:27.922
They died...
All of them...

00:10:27.956 --> 00:10:30.293
It's a miracle any
of us even survived.

00:10:30.326 --> 00:10:33.199
[GOKU] Gohan, I barely
recognized you at first...

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:34.234
Heh...

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:36.339
You've been trainin'
really hard, haven't ya?

00:10:36.372 --> 00:10:37.542
[GOHAN] That's right,

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:38.944
I've been training
all year with Piccolo...

00:10:38.977 --> 00:10:41.617
He was teaching me to
be strong like you are...

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.286
[GOHAN] But now...
He's gone...

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:45.123
And that means we can't
use the Dragon Balls

00:10:45.156 --> 00:10:49.766
to bring him or anyone
else back to life...

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:51.034
[KRILLIN] I say
it's payback time...!

00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:53.239
Right...? There's three
of us, two of them...

00:10:53.273 --> 00:10:54.643
Yeah...! And hey...

00:10:54.676 --> 00:10:56.078
You've been training
with the great King Kai...

00:10:56.112 --> 00:10:58.082
With all that goin'
for us, well...

00:10:58.115 --> 00:10:59.184
we should be
able to take down

00:10:59.218 --> 00:11:01.122
at least one of 'em,
dont'cha think?!

00:11:01.155 --> 00:11:01.924
[GOKU] Yeah.

00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:03.092
Only thing, though...

00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:04.896
You two aren't part
of the equation...

00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:07.200
This is my fight...
Don't try to interfere...

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:09.471
I want the both of you
sittin' on the sidelines.

00:11:09.505 --> 00:11:10.975
[KRILLIN] But that...
That's nuts...!

00:11:11.008 --> 00:11:12.712
Look, you may have
gotten super strong...

00:11:12.746 --> 00:11:14.982
But these freaks...
They're unreal...!

00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:16.953
You can't even imagine
what they're capable of...!

00:11:16.987 --> 00:11:18.322
You can't take
'em by yourself!

00:11:18.356 --> 00:11:21.896
[GOHAN] Dad, you gotta
listen...! He's right!

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.559
[KRILLIN] Goku...

00:11:36.592 --> 00:11:37.962
[GOHAN] Where are
you going?! Dad!

00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:39.331
[KRILLIN] Wait--it
might not be a good idea

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.701
to get in his way...

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:42.738
[GOHAN]
What's he gonna do?

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.978
[KRILLIN] I've never seen
Goku so angry before...

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:47.982
He's like a different guy...

00:11:48.016 --> 00:11:49.786
I don't think there
is a place for us

00:11:49.819 --> 00:11:52.390
in this fight, Gohan...

00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:02.010
[NAPPA] Oh, no.

00:12:02.043 --> 00:12:04.849
You do not wanna make
that face at me...

00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:06.018
Unless that's the
look you wanna greet

00:12:06.051 --> 00:12:08.389
your friends with
on the other side!

00:12:08.422 --> 00:12:10.260
[GOKU]
This ends now...

00:12:10.293 --> 00:12:12.163
And you're gonna pay!

00:12:41.488 --> 00:12:42.758
[GOHAN]
Dad's power, it's...

00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:43.526
It's awesome!

00:12:44.394 --> 00:12:46.365
[VEGETA]
Seven-thousand...

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:47.769
Eight-thousand... No...

00:12:47.802 --> 00:12:50.406
This... This is impossible!

00:12:52.477 --> 00:12:54.882
[GOKU] Yaaaaaa!

00:13:03.934 --> 00:13:05.269
[NAPPA] Vegeta...!

00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:07.574
What does the scouter
say about his power level?!

00:13:08.175 --> 00:13:10.480
[VEGETA] It's over
eight-thousand... ugh!

00:13:10.514 --> 00:13:11.850
[NAPPA]
Eight-thousand...!

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:13.119
Come on that
can't be right...

00:13:13.152 --> 00:13:15.156
it must be broken,
or something!

00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:16.526
[GOKU]
You're going down...

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.595
And I doubt I'll even have

00:13:17.628 --> 00:13:19.699
to use the Kaio-ken
against you.

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:20.668
[VEGETA] Kaio-ken...?

00:13:20.701 --> 00:13:22.538
[NAPPA]
You don't scare me!

00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:23.774
[NAPPA]
Nobody but nobody

00:13:23.807 --> 00:13:28.048
intimidates the mighty Nappa!

00:13:35.463 --> 00:13:36.833
[VEGETA] What?!

00:13:37.902 --> 00:13:41.007
[KRILLIN] How...
How did he do that?

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:47.655
[NAPPA] How'd you
get back there?

00:13:47.688 --> 00:13:50.561
[NAPPA]
You... You...!

00:13:50.594 --> 00:13:51.662
[GOKU] You know,

00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:52.497
as much as you
puffed yourself up,

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:55.003
I'm kinda disappointed.

00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:56.807
[NAPPA]
What did you say?!

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.209
[NAPPA] Are you...

00:13:58.242 --> 00:14:00.112
Are you tryin' to tell me
I'm all bark and no bite?!

00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:01.248
[GOKU] If that
flailin' around

00:14:01.281 --> 00:14:03.385
was your idea of
an attack, then yeah.

00:14:06.927 --> 00:14:09.397
[NAPPA] Oh really...

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.639
Then maybe you should
teach me a thing or two!

00:14:12.672 --> 00:14:14.575
Yaaaaah!

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:27.400
[VEGETA]
How strange...

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:28.804
To think that his
power could increase

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:30.106
so much now,

00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:32.310
when he was more or
less an equal to Raditz...

00:14:33.847 --> 00:14:37.053
[NAPPA] Hyaaa!

00:14:39.457 --> 00:14:40.660
[GOKU] Over here!

00:14:43.766 --> 00:14:44.936
[KRILLIN] Um...

00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:47.473
Okay, that I didn't
even see... Did you?

00:14:47.508 --> 00:14:49.512
[GOHAN]
Uh uh...

00:14:49.546 --> 00:14:50.680
But, wow...

00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:57.995
[VEGETA] I refuse
to believe this...

00:14:58.028 --> 00:15:00.099
How could anyone
gain so much power

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:02.504
in such a short
amount of time?

00:15:25.784 --> 00:15:26.586
[GOKU]
Just so you know...

00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:28.422
That was for Chiaotzu.

00:15:38.743 --> 00:15:47.093
[NAPPA] Damn you!

00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:49.598
[GOKU] And this
is for Yamcha!

00:15:54.408 --> 00:15:58.516
[NAPPA] Filthy, arrogant,
wretched little...

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:02.323
[NAPPA] Sc... Sc...
Scum sucking pig!

00:16:10.173 --> 00:16:12.276
[GOKU]
Ha...! Seriously?

00:16:28.877 --> 00:16:30.412
[NAPPA] Huh?

00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:41.201
[NAPPA] What the...?!

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:42.404
[VEGETA]
Is this possible...

00:16:42.437 --> 00:16:45.176
he just dodged it
with a powerful shout?

00:16:45.209 --> 00:16:47.079
[NAPPA]
That was luck!

00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:49.718
[GOKU]
This one's for Tien!

00:16:50.452 --> 00:16:52.390
[NAPPA] What's
wrong with me...!

00:16:52.424 --> 00:16:56.700
How can Kakarot be so
much more powerful...?!

00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:58.837
Wait, no...!

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.742
[GOKU] And this one...
Is for Piccolo!

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:26.224
[KRILLIN] Wow!
Look at him go...!

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:29.030
He's invincible...! Goku!

00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:30.032
[GOHAN]
Yay Dad!

00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:31.502
[KRILLIN]
Keep it up!

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:40.286
[crash]

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:47.466
[NAPPA]
Bastard! Haaaaahhh...

00:17:49.705 --> 00:17:54.380
[NAPPA]
You're gonna die!

00:17:54.414 --> 00:17:55.517
[GOKU]
That's some strength...

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.753
I'd be more impressed
if you knew what

00:17:56.786 --> 00:17:58.088
to do with it, though.

00:17:58.121 --> 00:18:00.426
[NAPPA] I am a member of
an elite warrior class...!

00:18:00.459 --> 00:18:04.333
I will not be made a fool
of by some bottom-feeder!

00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:05.504
[NAPPA] You'll
be beggin' for death

00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:08.475
by the time
I'm done with you!

00:18:08.509 --> 00:18:10.346
[VEGETA] Nappa!
Use your head...!

00:18:10.379 --> 00:18:13.185
Don't let his nonchalant
attitude get under your skin--

00:18:13.219 --> 00:18:15.222
that's what's giving
him the advantage!

00:18:15.255 --> 00:18:17.326
[VEGETA]
Calm down and think!

00:18:23.305 --> 00:18:25.877
[NAPPA] You're right.
Thanks, Vegeta.

00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:31.321
I've got to stay
level-headed...

00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:33.593
[NAPPA] Almost
lost my composure...

00:18:34.896 --> 00:18:36.732
[VEGETA]
Brick-headed, spastic...

00:18:36.766 --> 00:18:40.039
The way things are going
I'll have to step in.

00:18:40.073 --> 00:18:41.341
[NAPPA] I gotta
hand it to ya;

00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:42.377
pretty sneaky move there,

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.180
getting' me all worked up...

00:18:44.213 --> 00:18:46.485
That's not gonna fly from
here on out, though...

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:49.424
From here on out,
I'm a machine.

00:18:49.457 --> 00:18:50.961
[GOKU] Now that's
what I like to hear...

00:18:50.995 --> 00:18:53.165
Show me whatcha got.

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:55.470
[NAPPA] You sure like
to talk big, don't ya?

00:18:55.504 --> 00:18:57.407
[VEGETA] It's not
just talk, you idiot...

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.408
Any halfwit
could see he's got

00:18:58.442 --> 00:19:01.281
the confidence
to back it up.

00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:16.846
[KRILLIN]
Whoa... Okay.

00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:18.482
[GOHAN]
What are they doing?

00:19:18.517 --> 00:19:26.699
[NAPPA]
Rrrrrrgh! Haaaaaaaaugh!

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.609
[loud explosion]

00:19:50.245 --> 00:19:52.283
[NAPPA]
I can see you!

00:20:07.548 --> 00:20:09.384
[GOKU] Whoa...
You weren't kiddin'!

00:20:09.418 --> 00:20:11.622
This is much more like it!

00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.528
[NAPPA] Much more
like it, huh...?

00:20:14.562 --> 00:20:16.097
You're about to
have those words

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:19.203
crammed right back
down your throat...

00:20:19.237 --> 00:20:21.675
[NAPPA]
Compliments of my own.

00:20:37.439 --> 00:20:38.676
[VEGETA] He's a
freak of nature--

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.179
no one with their head
on straight would try

00:20:40.212 --> 00:20:42.717
to strike back so quickly
at such close range!

00:20:49.932 --> 00:20:51.702
[GOKU] If I had taken
that blast full-on,

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:53.840
I might've been
in pretty bad shape.

00:20:53.873 --> 00:20:55.143
[NAPPA]
But that was my...

00:20:55.176 --> 00:20:56.244
My ultimate technique,

00:20:56.277 --> 00:20:58.181
and he just
brushed it aside...!

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.186
Like some kind
of old plaything...

00:21:00.219 --> 00:21:01.522
[GOKU] You really are
a tough one, huh...?

00:21:01.555 --> 00:21:03.159
The Kamehame-Ha
should've at least done

00:21:03.192 --> 00:21:05.329
a little bit
of damage to ya...

00:21:05.363 --> 00:21:06.231
Neither of
us are gonna make

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.634
much headway at this rate.

00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:09.103
[VEGETA]
That's enough, Nappa.

00:21:09.136 --> 00:21:10.573
Back down...!

00:21:10.607 --> 00:21:14.080
I believe the traitor has
proven himself to be your match.

00:21:14.113 --> 00:21:15.316
[NAPPA] What?!

00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:16.786
[VEGETA] Don't
give me that look!

00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:18.657
Thanks to your
monumental incompetence,

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.126
it seems I have no
choice but to step in

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:22.163
and finish this myself.

00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:25.136
[KRILLIN] I think the shorter
one's done just standin' by...

00:21:25.169 --> 00:21:26.204
Man, I don't like this--

00:21:26.237 --> 00:21:28.510
even the big
guy's scared of him.

00:21:28.543 --> 00:21:31.315
[NARRATOR] The true
test of Goku's skills...

00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:34.955

♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:39.350
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:39.384 --> 00:22:40.653
Some of my best
friends have fallen

00:22:40.687 --> 00:22:42.323
because of this
Vegeta guy...

00:22:42.356 --> 00:22:43.593
[VEGETA]
Be grateful!

00:22:43.627 --> 00:22:45.597
Nobody like you gets a
one-in-a-million chance

00:22:45.631 --> 00:22:48.636
to be schooled by a warrior
so out of his league!

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.239
[GOKU] I hate to
break it to ya, pal,

00:22:50.272 --> 00:22:51.909
but this nobody's
about to move

00:22:51.943 --> 00:22:52.844
to the head of the class.

00:22:52.878 --> 00:22:54.047
[VEGETA] Then
prepare to be given

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.416
a lesson in humility!
