[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:06.514
Having finally
returned from Snake Way,

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:10.120
Goku easily took control
of the battle with Nappa.

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:11.256
That was my...

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.759
My ultimate technique,
and he just...

00:00:12.793 --> 00:00:13.928
[VEGETA]
That's enough, Nappa.

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:15.397
Back down...!

00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:18.838
I believe the traitor has proven
himself to be your match.

00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:20.207
Don't give me that look!

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.110
Thanks to your
monumental incompetence,

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:23.714
it seems I have
no choice but to

00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:25.785
step in and finish this myself.

Yeah... This is stupid!

I can't believe I have to turn
over your execution to Vegeta.

00:02:09.793 --> 00:02:12.833
But orders are orders.
Vegeta will finish you off.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:16.607
Still, I can't just walk away
without destroying someone!

Take your injured friend
and leave this planet.

Just go back to where
you came from, right now.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.585
[VEGETA] What did I
just witness...?

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.827
For just a split second his
speed and power skyrocketed.

00:03:18.262 --> 00:03:20.869
[KRILLIN] Uh... Goku,
how did you do that?

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:22.639
Was that one of the new
techniques that you learned

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:24.542
from King Kai while
you were off training?

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:28.416
Yeah... It's called
the Kaio-ken.

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.289
By controlling every ounce
of energy in your body,

00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:33.292
you can amplify
it for a short burst...

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:35.631
When you do it correctly,
your power, speed,

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:40.207
destructive force and defensive
force can all be increased alot.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.343
That's awesome...!

00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:42.879
As strong as
you already are,

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:45.818
you mean you can make yourself
even stronger, just like that?!

00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:47.922
Heh... That's right.

00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:49.626
Goku, why do
you tease us?

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.863
This isn't a good time
to be playing around...

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:54.401
If you had that trick up
your sleeve the whole time

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:56.674
then you should've
used it right away!

00:03:56.707 --> 00:03:59.478
[GOKU] Sorry, but that
wasn't an option.

00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:01.282
If I don't stay
in complete control

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:02.552
while I'm boosting my energy,

00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:04.556
then I could really
mess myself up.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.558
Uhh...

00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:06.994
Y'see...

00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:08.463
[KING KAI]
Now listen carefully...

00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:10.267
At your level you
simply cannot use

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.639
the Kaio-ken too much
at any one time.

00:04:12.672 --> 00:04:14.776
If at any point in
the process you lose control

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:16.780
you could severely
harm your body...

00:04:16.813 --> 00:04:18.383
That's why you should
raise your power

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:19.886
to no more than double.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.692
Performing a Kaio-ken at
more than double your power

00:04:22.726 --> 00:04:24.996
will put too much
strain on your body.

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.399
In other words,

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.604
your body won't be able to
keep up with the Kaio-ken

00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:31.510
and the entire move will
end up backfiring on you.

00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:34.248

Mm Hmm... I understand.

00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:35.350

much for us...

If we stick around here
we aren't gonna be any help.

making Goku worry about us

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.923
a way you could move
this fight to another location.

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:08.991
Huh...?

back to life...?

00:07:15.905 --> 00:07:19.345
But Piccolo's dead,
which means Kami is too...

I hate to say it, Krillin...

You should feel lucky.

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:31.997
Not every low-class
warrior gets the chance

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.637
to spar with a
super-elite like myself.

00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:41.115
Not long after Saiyans are born

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:43.887
their skills as a
soldier are tested.

00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:45.858
The scum whose scores
are ranked the lowest

00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:47.394
are sent to the outer worlds

00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:51.469
where the opponents are weak,
much like you were, Kakarot...

00:10:51.503 --> 00:10:52.805
In other words...

00:10:52.838 --> 00:10:54.876
You were cast out like a dog!

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.880
Yes, and as a result
I was lucky enough

00:10:56.913 --> 00:10:58.449
to come here to Earth.

00:10:58.482 --> 00:11:01.188
I'm grateful for
that... Besides...

00:11:01.222 --> 00:11:03.226
Maybe even a
lower-classed outcast

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:06.365
can surpass an elite
if he puts his mind to it.

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:12.310
That's a nice

00:11:12.344 --> 00:11:13.714
Now let me show you a wall

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:16.185

the ability to scale....

Surely you can put up
a better fight than this!

when you were fighting Nappa,

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:35.811
so why not me?!

We've just begun to fight and
already his speed and technique

strength you've been hiding?

[VEGETA]
He's laughing...!

00:14:05.356 --> 00:14:08.129
Has he lost his mind or
has he given up all hope?

00:14:08.162 --> 00:14:10.534
Perhaps he can raise
his power even higher

00:14:10.567 --> 00:14:12.303
and he's trying to disguise it.

00:14:12.337 --> 00:14:14.876
Come on...!
Are you done already?

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:17.113
I guess you're all
talk then, huh...?

In that case allow me to show
you something before you die...

00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:25.564

of a Saiyan super-elite!

that one easy...

and power are unreal!

enough to keep up with him.

This may destroy my body
but it's better than dying...

go Kaio-ken times three!

gotten this close,

So the big question is...

How long will my body
be able to hold out

Kaio-ken times three?

option at this point...

do you much good...

Even among the
other Saiyans...

I was always the
most powerful by far.
