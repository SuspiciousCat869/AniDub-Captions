Under Mr. Popo's guidance,

our heroes discovered
the ancient alien spaceship

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.327
in which Kami first arrived on
planet Earth untold ages ago...

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.098
And found it more
than flight-worthy...

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:18.236
Hoping to locate
more Dragon Balls,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.673

course for planet Namek.

thought to install

doesn't exist anymore.

Well wherever he went,

I'm sure he couldn't
have gotten very far...

00:04:57.528 --> 00:04:58.931
That, and I'd imagine
he'd choose a place

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:02.304
with the right technology
to treat his wounds.

what that weirdo

and selling it lock, stock and
barrel to the highest bidder?

I just wonder if the world
Vegeta's retreated to

is one of their
old "renovation" projects.

00:05:17.735 --> 00:05:20.073

it's far enough away from Earth

Why would he bother
holding a silly grudge

00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:15.129
when he's finally got the
prospect of eternal life

00:10:15.162 --> 00:10:16.132
in his reach?

00:10:16.165 --> 00:10:17.835
Are you... Are you
trying to tell me that

00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:20.307
Frieza's headed
for planet Namek?!

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.277
Of course! Where else?

00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:23.581
[VEGETA] I'm a fool!

00:10:23.614 --> 00:10:25.651
Frieza's been eaves
dropping on the Scouters!

00:10:25.684 --> 00:10:26.887
If I don't beat
him to the punch,

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.091
I'll be that bastard's
puppet for eternity!

00:10:29.124 --> 00:10:30.627
Now don't tell me
you wanted to keep

00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:31.896
the Dragon Balls
all to yourself

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.401
and not let the Big Man
in on your secret...?

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:35.838
After all he's done for you?

00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:38.176
Oh and I hate to dash
your own dreams of inmortality

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:41.215
but he's going to kill every
last Namekian when he's done.

00:10:41.248 --> 00:10:43.553
[VEGETA]
Like hell he will!

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:45.924
[KEWIE]
Hey...! Get back here!

00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:49.331
[DOCTOR]
Sir, are you a...

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:51.837
[VEGETA]
Give me that!

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.809
Looks as though I'll be needing
this absurd relic after all!

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.088
[KEWIE] Vegeta!!!

00:11:04.094 --> 00:11:07.433
They belong to me!
The Dragon Balls are mine!

00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:26.739
[horns honking]

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:30.480
[GOKU grunts]

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:31.683
Oh, not again...

00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:36.926
[GOKU grunts]

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:40.366
Good. Now four more.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.670
You can't keep doing this!

00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:42.972
[GOKU] Uhh...
But it's ok nurse lady...

00:11:43.005 --> 00:11:45.877
I promise...
I'm all better now.

00:11:45.911 --> 00:11:48.149
The boy's always
been a fast healer!

00:11:48.182 --> 00:11:48.918
[NURSE screams]

00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:51.221
[NURSE breathes heavily]

00:11:51.254 --> 00:11:52.090
I'm so sorry.

00:11:52.123 --> 00:11:53.426
Did the hand do
something naughty?

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:56.065
At my age, the darn thing
has a mind of it's own!

00:11:56.098 --> 00:11:58.168
[NURSE] I do not get
paid enough for this!

00:11:58.202 --> 00:12:00.574
Care to share a
sponge bat--cake?

00:12:00.607 --> 00:12:02.845
[NURSE] Ughhh!
What a dirty old man!

00:12:02.878 --> 00:12:04.583
[GOKU grunts]

00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:05.383
Eh...?

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:10.360
[GOKU grunts]

00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:11.563
[GOKU'S DOCTOR coughs]

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:12.397
Uhh...

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.068
Just in time!

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:17.473
I'm a reasonable man...
Must you try me?

00:12:17.508 --> 00:12:18.844
[GOKU'S DOCTOR]
Goku, listen to me.

00:12:18.877 --> 00:12:20.446
If you keep these
shenanigans up,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.950
you might as well move in.

00:12:21.983 --> 00:12:24.187
But, doc!
I'm fine... see look!

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:24.856
[GOKU grunts]

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:26.358
More like a maraca...

00:12:26.392 --> 00:12:27.361
Maybe you can't appreciate

00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:29.599
the extent of your
injuries, but I can...

00:12:29.632 --> 00:12:31.870
Stop treating
this place like a gym.

00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:33.673
Okay, doctor.

00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:35.578
Come on,
Grandpa happy hands...

00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:36.914
Help him up.

00:12:36.947 --> 00:12:38.850
Grandpa happy hands?!

00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:41.857
Some bedside manner
you have there.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.894
Ah... Well now...

00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:45.797
[NURSE laughs]

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.204
Grandpa happy hands...

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:50.708
[ROSHI sighs]

00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:54.314
Do I dare ask where
this man's wife has gone?

00:12:54.348 --> 00:12:55.618
She, uh...

00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:58.122
...just stepped out for some
fresh air before you came in.

00:13:08.176 --> 00:13:11.315
Gohan. Mommy's worried
about her little boy...

00:13:11.348 --> 00:13:12.450
You said you'd write.

00:13:12.483 --> 00:13:14.922
Is one letter a day really
all that much to ask?

00:13:14.955 --> 00:13:18.329
Maybe the mail was backed up...

00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:19.364
Oh, whatever...

00:13:19.397 --> 00:13:23.172
Just come back to me
soon... Safe and sound.

00:13:24.608 --> 00:13:25.811
[NARRATOR]
Thirty four days after

00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:27.614
leaving behind the
comforts of home,

00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:31.222
Bulma, Krillin and Gohan have
reached their destination:

00:13:31.255 --> 00:13:35.030
planet Namek, fabled
home of the Dragon Balls!

00:13:35.063 --> 00:13:38.302
[BULMA] Take a look,
fellas! There it is!

00:13:38.336 --> 00:13:39.104
Beautiful!

00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:42.277
Wow! So that's
planet Namek, huh?

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.445
No doubt about it!

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:45.383
The computer confirms it as
the bona fide birthplace

00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:47.154
of Kami and Piccolo!

00:13:47.187 --> 00:13:49.358
[GOHAN] We got here right
on schedule, didn't we?

00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:52.196
Pretty impressive spaceship,
wouldn't you say?

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.368
It didn't fly itself.
We had a good captain.

00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:55.972
Oh, please...
You're just sayin' that

00:13:56.005 --> 00:13:57.708
'cause it's absolutely true.

00:13:57.741 --> 00:14:00.280
Now buckle up so
I can land this puppy...

00:14:00.313 --> 00:14:01.916
Okay!

00:14:04.689 --> 00:14:08.495
Initiate landing sequence for
the first spot you can find!

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.644
[KRILLIN yells]

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.453
[KRILLIN] Whoa!

00:14:37.486 --> 00:14:39.892
[BULMA] Gentleman, welcome
to the lovely planet Namek!

00:14:39.926 --> 00:14:41.295
[GOHAN] We made it!

00:14:41.328 --> 00:14:45.671
[GROUP laughs]

00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:46.939
Alright, then...

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:48.577
Let me just check the
atmospheric composition.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.881
I installed a special set
of barometric sensors

00:14:50.914 --> 00:14:52.284
for that purpose.

00:14:52.317 --> 00:14:55.022
Man, I gotta tell ya...
I think of everything. Heh...

00:14:55.055 --> 00:14:57.026
See, there won't
be much oxygen...

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.632
but yours truly also
thought to pack...

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:00.868
Uh...

00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:01.870
What did they...

00:15:01.903 --> 00:15:03.774
[boom]

00:15:03.807 --> 00:15:05.610
[thud]

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:10.319
Wow this...

00:15:10.353 --> 00:15:12.157
This place is a lot like
where Piccolo took me

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.329
to train while Dad
was off in Other World.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.704
Yeah... Same kinda
spot where we fought

00:15:18.737 --> 00:15:20.439
Vegeta and Nappa
for the first time...

00:15:20.472 --> 00:15:24.113
Guess he was kinda drawn to
the landscape by instinct.

00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:27.822
I miss him.

00:15:28.657 --> 00:15:31.028
Do you two geniuses share
half a freakin' brain cell

00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:32.364
between you or something...?!

00:15:32.397 --> 00:15:33.800
For all you knew
this air could've been

00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:35.738
made up of cow flatulence!

00:15:35.771 --> 00:15:37.975
Wow, okay...
Way to keep your cool.

00:15:38.008 --> 00:15:39.244
Oh, ha ha...

00:15:39.278 --> 00:15:42.350
Let's just focus on the
task at hand, shall we?

00:15:42.384 --> 00:15:43.252
Sheesh...

00:15:43.286 --> 00:15:43.787
[beeping]

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.089
[BULMA gasps]

00:15:45.122 --> 00:15:47.427
Eureka...!
Feast your eyes on that!

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.930
Alright!

00:15:48.963 --> 00:15:50.166
[GOHAN gasps]

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:53.573
[KRILLIN] We found them!
We found them! Yeah!

00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:57.514
Uh... Guys, I think I...
I think feel something.

00:15:57.548 --> 00:15:58.917
[KRILLIN and BULMA laugh]

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.085
Huh...?

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:02.658
Me too...

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:05.329
[GOHAN]
There's so many of them!

00:16:05.363 --> 00:16:07.801
Yeah... And their power's
nothin' to sneeze at.

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:09.872
In fact... It's way
off the charts!

00:16:09.905 --> 00:16:11.909
Oh, come on you guys,
don't be scared.

00:16:11.943 --> 00:16:13.445
It's probably
just the Namekians.

00:16:13.479 --> 00:16:16.184
I mean when you think about how
powerful Kami and Piccolo were,

00:16:16.217 --> 00:16:17.522
is it any surprise
their home world

00:16:17.555 --> 00:16:20.226
is full of people
just as extraordinary?

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.865
But this power...
feels kinda evil, doesn't it?

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.401
[BULMA]
I'm telling you it's fine.

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:26.539
Remember what King
Kai told us, silly...

00:16:26.573 --> 00:16:28.342
The Namekians are
peaceful by nature.

00:16:28.375 --> 00:16:30.246
We've got nothing
to worry about.

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:32.317
Now, let's just stay focused
on what we came here to do

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.954
and find those Dragon Balls...

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:35.156
And while we're at it,

00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:36.693
we'll introduce ourselves
to the natives.

00:16:36.726 --> 00:16:38.462
Yeah... Uh... Okay...

00:16:38.495 --> 00:16:40.968
I mean it's gotta be
the Namekians, right?

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.236
[KRILLIN laughs]

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.907
And the two of us are
all scared, and stuff!

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.783
[KRILLIN laughs]

00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:49.952
Uhh...

00:16:49.985 --> 00:16:50.754
[GOHAN gasps]

00:16:50.787 --> 00:16:51.990
[BULMA gasps]

00:16:52.023 --> 00:16:53.292
[KRILLIN shudders]

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:56.699
Looks... like...
we've got company.

00:16:59.304 --> 00:17:00.975
[KRILLIN]
That's a Saiyan spaceship!

00:17:01.008 --> 00:17:03.478
We're totally doomed!

00:17:06.653 --> 00:17:08.657
[loud crash]

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.659
It can't be!

00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:12.364
[BULMA] Seriously,
this isn't even fair!

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:15.169
Gohan, mask your
energy! They'll find us!

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:16.404
Uh, yeah... okay!

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:21.448
It... It's Vegeta...
I just know it!

00:17:21.482 --> 00:17:22.518
Why now?!

00:17:22.552 --> 00:17:25.991
[BULMA] But how could he
have already recovered?

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:27.194
[KRILLIN grunts]

00:17:27.227 --> 00:17:28.162
[KRILLIN] He knows
about the Dragon Balls.

00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:30.266
That's gotta be why he's here.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.374
What do we do now?!
It's hopeless...!

00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:36.512
We've have to get back home
while the getting's good!

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:38.750
Please...! Let's just leave
before we're discovered!

00:17:38.784 --> 00:17:40.887
[KRILLIN] That monster
finds the Dragon Balls,

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.457
it's all over!

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.693
Listen Bulma...

00:17:43.726 --> 00:17:45.196
I need you to get in touch
with the guys back on Earth

00:17:45.229 --> 00:17:47.333
and tell them what's
going on here, right away.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:49.705
Gohan and I will stay and try
to collect the Dragon Balls.

00:17:49.739 --> 00:17:50.975
But I want
you to go home.

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:52.310
What?!

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:53.980
We'll be alright...
We've got the Dragon Rader,

00:17:54.013 --> 00:17:56.118
so chances are
we'll find them first.

00:17:56.152 --> 00:17:57.320
You with me, Gohan?

00:17:57.353 --> 00:17:58.523
You bet!

00:17:58.557 --> 00:17:59.692
[BULMA] Okay then...

00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:00.827
I'll run home, pick up Goku,

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.332
and bring him back here
as soon as I possibly can.

00:18:03.365 --> 00:18:06.606
Now, we're talkin' a round trip
of at least two months.

00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:09.143
And I mean at least...

00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:10.647
Buuuuut...

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.816
Those two months will be up
before you know it, trust me.

00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:13.018
Just think of it as sixty days;

00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:14.421
or fourteen-hundred
and forty hours,

00:18:14.454 --> 00:18:16.291
or maybe eighty-six thousand,
four-hundred minutes,

00:18:16.324 --> 00:18:19.497
or just five-million,
tiny seconds!

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:20.534
Uh... Yeah...

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:23.038
Two months...
I think we got it.

00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:27.681
[KRILLIN and GOHAN laugh]

00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:43.379
[VEGETA] Frieza,
you rotten little freak...

00:18:43.412 --> 00:18:47.219
Don't think I'll let you cheat
me... Not over this prize...

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:50.527
I'm more than capable of
taking his lackeys down.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.865
But best to avoid a tumble
with the Big Man himself.

00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:53.967
At least for now...

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.335
I'll have to swallow my pride

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:57.541
and go about collecting the
Dragon Balls covertly...

00:18:57.575 --> 00:19:00.580
Ugh... Using a
Scouter, no less...

00:19:03.654 --> 00:19:05.690
[beeping]

00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:07.961
And there they are.

00:19:07.994 --> 00:19:09.732
[VEGETA grunts]

00:19:10.466 --> 00:19:14.908
Damn... He's brought Zarbon
and Dodoria along for the ride.

00:19:17.715 --> 00:19:20.052
[ROSHI] Hold on, you're
not making any sense!

00:19:20.085 --> 00:19:21.188
Now slow down!

00:19:21.221 --> 00:19:22.724
[BULMA] Would you
just listen to me,

00:19:22.758 --> 00:19:23.626
you stupid old man?!

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.062
You have to tell
Goku and the others

00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:27.399
exactly what I'm telling
you. Understand...?

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:29.605
And by everyone
I mean not Chi-Chi.

00:19:29.638 --> 00:19:30.808
That's right.

00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:35.750
Yes... Well, no, it's like
I just told you... No...!

00:19:35.784 --> 00:19:37.020
And why am I not surprised

00:19:37.053 --> 00:19:39.290
that you of all people
would go there...

00:19:39.323 --> 00:19:43.198
No... Quit asking...!
Just tell them... Goodbye!

00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:44.669
[BULMA grunts]

00:19:44.702 --> 00:19:47.307
Oh, for heaven's sake...
What is it now?

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:53.520
[KRILLIN and GOHAN shudder]

00:19:53.553 --> 00:19:56.024
Uh... What?

00:19:56.057 --> 00:19:57.694
[BULMA yells]

00:20:03.573 --> 00:20:07.247
Uh... Didn't that ship
already fly by once?

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.856
Yeah... I was, uh...
Just thinkin' that.

00:20:11.889 --> 00:20:14.360
[loud crash]

00:20:34.134 --> 00:20:36.572
Here it is, sire...

00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:40.547
[FRIEZA]
Ah, excellent...

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.022
Now only three remain
to be "discovered."

00:20:45.055 --> 00:20:48.262
[FRIEZA laughs]

00:20:48.295 --> 00:20:52.269
[DODORIA laughs]

00:20:56.077 --> 00:20:59.217
[NARRATOR] At last, the evil
mastermind and his minions

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.188
rear their insidious heads.

00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:04.595
Behold Frieza,
bane of the universe...!

00:21:04.628 --> 00:21:05.898
And as if that weren't enough,

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.570
Vegeta has thrown
himself back into play,

00:21:08.603 --> 00:21:10.473
ruthless and cunning as ever...

00:21:10.507 --> 00:21:12.711
It would seem our heroes
have landed themselves

00:21:12.745 --> 00:21:16.284
in the middle of
a full-blown crisis.

00:21:17.787 --> 00:21:22.564
This is bad. This...
This is most definitely bad.

00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:24.200
[NARRATOR] Will Gohan
and the others be able

00:21:24.233 --> 00:21:25.704
to gather up the Dragon Balls

00:21:25.737 --> 00:21:28.710
without incident when not
only a merciless old foe,

00:21:28.743 --> 00:21:32.417
but a terrifying new one are
already two steps ahead of them?

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:35.056
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:35.423 --> 00:21:45.610
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:39.919
[GOKU] Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:39.952 --> 00:22:42.122
There's really someone
stronger than Vegeta out there?!

00:22:42.156 --> 00:22:44.060
[VEGETA] I don't stand a
chance against Frieza, yet.

00:22:44.093 --> 00:22:46.030
But his feeble underlings
won't know what hit 'em!

00:22:46.064 --> 00:22:48.002
[GOKU] Looks like if I'm
gonna be any help on Namek,

00:22:48.035 --> 00:22:50.206
I've got a lot of trainin'
to get under my belt

00:22:50.239 --> 00:22:51.742
before I set foot there.

00:22:51.776 --> 00:22:54.281
[VEGETA] Ha! Train all you want,
the Dragon Balls are still mine!

00:22:54.314 --> 00:22:57.052
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:00.694 --> 00:23:02.430
[GOHAN] Wow, these
sure are a lot bigger

00:23:02.463 --> 00:23:05.068
than the ones back on Earth...
