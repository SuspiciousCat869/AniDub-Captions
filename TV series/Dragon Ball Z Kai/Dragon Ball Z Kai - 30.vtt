[Gohan] We just barely managed
to get by the one named Guldo.

are just too strong!

no stopping him...?!

like they were nothing!

something, and quickly...

could've used that opening

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:17.635
to attack Recoome instead!

Please, you have to!

00:12:07.053 --> 00:12:11.797
No... It's okay...
It's... It's over...

Too...fast... And they...

have...all of the
Dragon Balls...

Aw...! I goofed, didn't I...?

Guess I should'a eased
back on the power some...!

around with him a little longer.

but you did it with
such apparent ease

00:14:10.568 --> 00:14:12.103
that I'm upset with
myself for not having

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.540
called your men in sooner.

00:14:13.607 --> 00:14:16.245
Praise from you is high
praise, indeed, Lord Frieza.

00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:18.182
Nothing could fill
me with greater pride.

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:20.353
At last, eternal
life will be mine!

00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:23.059
It's right here, in
the palm of my hand.

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:25.029
I want to savor the moment!

00:14:25.096 --> 00:14:26.933
[Ginyu] This calls for
a special performance,

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:28.637
to commemorate the occasion.

00:14:28.704 --> 00:14:31.542
In your honor...
The Dance of Joy!

00:14:33.814 --> 00:14:35.183
[Ginyu]
Feel the joy!

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:37.955
Um... Perhaps you could
do that for me the next time.

00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:39.057
Whatever you say.

00:14:39.124 --> 00:14:40.827
[Frieza laughing]
Nyahahahahaha!!

00:14:40.894 --> 00:14:42.130
I still can't believe it,

00:14:42.197 --> 00:14:44.902
my dream of immortality
is about to come true!

00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:46.940
I don't mind
admitting it to you...

00:14:47.007 --> 00:14:48.577
I'm a bit excited.

00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:49.813
And why not?

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:51.181
In a few seconds,
you'll cement your place

00:14:51.248 --> 00:14:53.820
as supreme ruler of
the universe, forever!

00:14:53.887 --> 00:14:55.758
Now... my Dragon Balls...!

00:14:55.824 --> 00:14:57.160
I, Frieza, command you

00:14:57.227 --> 00:14:59.999
to grant my wish of
immortality and eternal youth!

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:07.413
[yelling]
Aaaaahhh!!!

00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:14.093
[thinking]
W-What is this...?

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.999
This... deep
foreboding I sense...

00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:27.253
The Grand Elder...
He's in danger...

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.527
the evil ones will soon
come for him, I know it...

00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:33.734
Forgive me, earthlings...

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.641
But I'm afraid I have a greater
duty that I must uphold!

00:15:58.115 --> 00:16:00.687
Strange... Nothing's
happening, is it...

00:16:00.754 --> 00:16:03.760
Maybe it's already done.
Do you feel immortal yet?

00:16:03.827 --> 00:16:07.366
[Frieza] No...
No, I don't think so...

00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:13.580
Why...? What's wrong?

00:16:13.647 --> 00:16:16.218
Here...just take it, if
that's what you want...

00:16:16.285 --> 00:16:18.557
It's not going to do
you any good, anyway...

00:16:18.623 --> 00:16:20.928
Even if you outworlders
gather all seven,

00:16:20.995 --> 00:16:23.232
you'll never be able
to unlock their power!

00:16:23.299 --> 00:16:26.271
[Frieza] Of course...! What
that second Namekian Elder said,

00:16:26.338 --> 00:16:28.876
when I took his
Dragon Ball from him.

00:16:28.943 --> 00:16:31.682
At the time, I thought he
was just being a sore loser...

00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:36.191
But he said, "You outworlders"
will never unlock their power...

00:16:36.258 --> 00:16:38.796
"You outworlders!"

00:16:38.863 --> 00:16:40.668
There must some sort
of key required

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:42.203
to use the Dragon Balls!

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.274
Some secret ritual or something
known only to the Namekians,

00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:46.779
that will unlock their
power and grant wishes!

00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:48.449
So, What is it...?!
A password...?!

00:16:48.517 --> 00:16:51.756
A location...?! Some specific
way of arranging the balls?!

00:16:51.822 --> 00:16:53.960
I need a Namekian here! Now!

00:16:54.027 --> 00:16:55.496
That may be a slight problem.

00:16:55.564 --> 00:16:58.368
Are there even any
Namekians left?

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:03.547
Well, I just found
Vegeta and the others...

00:17:03.614 --> 00:17:06.218
I suppose it's possible that
he or one of his little friends

00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:08.222
might have the
answers we need...

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:10.627
In that case, I'll call
off my men right away,

00:17:10.694 --> 00:17:12.798
and tell them to bring
them back for questioning!

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:18.475
Oh...? Hmm, wait. Redirect your
scouter to coordinate 8829401.

00:17:18.543 --> 00:17:19.812
If I'm not mistaken,

00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:22.116
I'm reading what would appear
to be two more Namekians...

00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:23.653
And as a bonus,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.525
there's also a third reading
moving towards their location.

00:17:26.592 --> 00:17:28.496
Since we never
attacked that area,

00:17:28.564 --> 00:17:30.332
it seems these three
have been lucky enough

00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:32.871
to escape our
attention until now.

00:17:32.938 --> 00:17:34.107
Just leave it to me.

00:17:34.174 --> 00:17:35.610
I'll track them down
and force them

00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:37.915
to tell me how to make the
Dragon Balls grant your wish.

00:17:37.981 --> 00:17:39.317
No, that won't be necessary.

00:17:39.384 --> 00:17:42.423
I think it would be best
if I talked to them myself.

00:17:43.826 --> 00:17:45.330
After all, in my time here,

00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:47.266
I've managed to gain quite
a bit of experience

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:48.804
dealing with the natives.

00:17:48.871 --> 00:17:51.509
While I'm gone, I will trust
you to watch the Dragon Balls.

00:17:51.576 --> 00:17:53.412
Right...! You can
count on me...!

00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:55.316
I will guard them with my life!

00:17:55.382 --> 00:17:57.353
Good luck, Lord Frieza!

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:04.868
Now... you're mine,
Namekians...! Hahahahaha!!

00:18:05.837 --> 00:18:08.910
Right...! Here we go!

00:18:08.977 --> 00:18:12.416
Recoome! Boooomer!

00:18:15.623 --> 00:18:25.644
[explosions]

00:18:27.782 --> 00:18:30.587
[Recoome laughing]

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.261
Oh! Here I am!

00:18:34.328 --> 00:18:37.601
[Gohan screaming]

00:18:38.604 --> 00:18:41.141
[Recoome laughing]

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:09.163
Just... stay down...
Gohan... please...

00:19:16.378 --> 00:19:22.524
[Recoome laughing]

00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:26.464
[Gohan] I've... gotta
be strong... like Dad...

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:37.521
He'd... keep... fighting...
I won't... I won't give up...!

00:19:37.655 --> 00:19:41.127
Well...! Look'it you!
Still comin'...!

00:19:41.194 --> 00:19:42.697
You're a tough one!

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:45.804
Guess they grow 'em
stubborn on your planet, huh?

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.079
Ha...! And I should know...!
I'm stubborn too!

00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:55.089
I won't quit...!
I won't let you win...!

00:19:55.156 --> 00:19:58.228
[Gohan yelling]

00:20:08.048 --> 00:20:10.285
[surprise]

00:20:13.659 --> 00:20:16.297
[crash]

00:20:19.872 --> 00:20:22.009
[despair]

00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:24.948
[beeping]

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.320
Hmph... So much
for that one...

00:20:27.387 --> 00:20:29.959
His power level just
crashed down to zero.

00:20:30.025 --> 00:20:33.699
What'd you expect?... I heard
his neck snap from here.

00:20:34.902 --> 00:20:35.970
[Krillin] Gohan...

00:20:37.406 --> 00:20:39.945
That...pathetic
little...runt...

00:20:40.012 --> 00:20:43.553
And... here I thought... he'd
actually gained some strength...

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.460
What a jip... You guys were
all just a bunch of pushovers.

00:20:47.528 --> 00:20:50.601
Seriously. I didn't even get
a chance to break a sweat!

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.604
I don't know why Frieza'd
even bother callin'

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:55.844
in the Ginyu Force to
deal with you losers...

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.350
Guess I'll just finish you all
off and be done with it.

00:21:02.824 --> 00:21:04.427
What...?

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:08.536
[Jeice] It's landing...

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.325
[Narrator] At last,

00:21:20.392 --> 00:21:22.831
Goku's ship has touched
down on Planet Namek!

00:21:22.897 --> 00:21:26.004
But with Gohan and the others
hanging on by a thread,

00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:28.442
has our hero arrived too late?!

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.815

♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:38.282 --> 00:22:39.652
[Goku] Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:39.719 --> 00:22:42.557
Gohan! Krillin! I'm sorry
I cut it so close there,

00:22:42.624 --> 00:22:44.094
but everything's okay now.

00:22:44.161 --> 00:22:46.899
I'll take care of all three of
these guys, don't you worry.

00:22:46.966 --> 00:22:48.068
[Vegeta] Impossible!

00:22:48.135 --> 00:22:50.907
Kakarot's power level
has gone up exponentially!

00:22:50.974 --> 00:22:53.947
Somehow, he's surpassed
his own Saiyan limitations!

00:22:54.013 --> 00:22:56.819
[Goku] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:00.092 --> 00:23:03.799
[Gohan] Wow! My dad
really is the greatest!
