[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:07.414
When Gohan transformed
into a giant Saiyan Ape,

00:00:07.447 --> 00:00:09.787
and dealt a major
blow to Vegeta,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.424
victory seemed within reach.

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:14.429
Beaten and badly injured,

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:16.667
Vegeta struggled to
reach his spaceship

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:18.003
in an attempt to escape...

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:20.106
But Krillin had other plans.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.781
[KRILLIN] You monster...
You killed my friends.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.585
Now it's your turn!

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:36.472
♪ Opening Song ♪

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:54.663
[NARRATOR] "Dawn
of a Fierce Battle!

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:58.403
The Star of Hope is
Piccolo's Homeland!"

00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.113
[KING KAI] Whew! What a relief!

00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:05.184
They had me worried
for a minute there.

00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:07.656
I know that I'm not really
supposed to take sides...

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.996
but that Saiyan was a
menace to the entire universe.

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.398
[KING KAI] Someone
as evil as that is bound

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:15.270
to get a taste of his own
medicine sooner or later.

00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:17.675
It was just a matter of time.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.380
But still... no one
will be safe until

00:02:20.414 --> 00:02:23.521
the root of this evil is
cut off at the source.

00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:26.425
[KING KAI] This is not over yet.

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:30.902
[KRILLIN] Die!

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:34.175
[GOKU] Krillin, don't do it!

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.245
[KRILLIN] G... Goku?

00:02:36.278 --> 00:02:37.682
Woah... Why am I hearing voices,

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:40.956
and why don't they want
me to kill the Saiyan?

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.159
Goku... That was you, right?

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:45.097
Yeah... it was me...

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.869
Sorry, but I still
can't talk very loud...

00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:50.207
Please...
Krillin... It's over...

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.182
so... stop... Please
just let the Saiyan go.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.417
You gotta be kidding me!

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.120
Four of our friends are
dead because of him

00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:58.591
and you want to let him
get into his spaceship

00:02:58.624 --> 00:03:01.496
and fly away like
nothing ever happened?!

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.765
If we don't finish him now,

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.536
he's gonna lay low until
he has his strength back

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.141
and then come here,
wipe out the rest of humanity!

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:09.746
[GOKU] You're right...
He probably will.

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:10.748
[KRILLIN] He will!

00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:12.351
Piccolo may've had
a change of heart,

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:13.954
but this guy's pure evil!

00:03:13.987 --> 00:03:15.525
People like him don't change.

00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:18.631
If we let him live, he'll just
keep on hurting people!

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:21.069
And I don't want him
to have that opportunity.

00:03:21.102 --> 00:03:23.507
[GOKU] I know...
I know how strong he is,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.443
and how much damage he can do.

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:28.517
As long as he's alive,
nobody on earth is safe.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.320
But you've got to listen to me.

00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:33.493
This might sound crazy...
in fact, I'm sure it does...

00:03:33.527 --> 00:03:36.499
but just now, when it looked
like you were about to kill him,

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:38.805
I couldn't help but think...

00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:40.708
It'd be such a waste.

00:03:41.977 --> 00:03:44.750
Wha... what are
you talking about?

00:03:44.783 --> 00:03:47.622
[GOKU] After I finished training
with King Kai in Other World

00:03:47.655 --> 00:03:51.062
I thought I'd gotten as strong
as I could possibly get.

00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:52.833
Then I saw Vegeta fight...

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:56.038
and he's so much faster,
so much more powerful than me.

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:59.378
The things he was capable of,
it... it was overwhelming!

00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:03.119
But I've got to admit,
deep down I was pretty excited.

00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:04.890
Maybe it's because
I'm a Saiyan too,

00:04:04.923 --> 00:04:07.461
but when I see somebody
who's that strong...

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:08.965
my heart starts racing,

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:11.837
because I realize I still
have farther to go.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.475
It makes me want to train
myself even harder...

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.047
to push myself to their level.

00:04:20.253 --> 00:04:22.324
[GOKU] Krillin...
I know it's wrong,

00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:25.397
but please,
let him go... for me.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.971
I need to be able to
fight him again someday!

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.950
Okay, then... I don't like it,

00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:54.823
but if you say we should let
him live, that's enough for me.

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:56.259
[KRILLIN] After all,
if it wasn't for you,

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:58.263
we'd be all dead right now...

00:04:58.296 --> 00:05:00.668
But you gotta
promise me something...

00:05:00.702 --> 00:05:02.071
The next time
you fight this guy,

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:04.475
I want you to make him regret
that he was ever born!

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.813
Yeah... You got it.

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:11.857
Well... It's about time
for me to make my exit...

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.629
But this isn't over,
not by a long shot...

00:05:14.663 --> 00:05:17.669
and there won't be a miracle
to save you next time...

00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:20.841
That... I can
personally guarantee!

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:08.003
You okay, Gohan?

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:09.806
It's all over now.

00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:14.649
[YAJIROBE] Uh... Alright,
guess my work here is done!

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:17.989
What's Baldy's deal?
He just let him go!

00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:20.327
No way he woulda gotten
away from me like that!

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.698
I wouldn't have been so nice!

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.272
Thanks, Krillin.
I know that wasn't easy.

00:06:26.306 --> 00:06:27.742
[chuckjles]
It really wasn't...

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:29.211
And it didn't feel
right letting him go

00:06:29.244 --> 00:06:30.615
after everything he did...

00:06:30.648 --> 00:06:32.552
[KRILLIN] But I've got an
idea... and if it works,

00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:35.490
we might be able to undo
the damage that he's do...

00:06:37.427 --> 00:06:40.033
Oh... he's coming back?

00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:47.548
[MASTER ROSHI] Hey!

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:51.055
Hey! [laughing]

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:01.042
[CHI-CHI] Gohan!

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:03.514
Woah... Is that Chi-Chi?

00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:06.619
[CHI-CHI] Gohan! Where is he?

00:07:07.287 --> 00:07:09.191
My baby!

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:17.073
Gohan!

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:26.726
[CHI-CHI] Gohan! Are you okay?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.731
It's alright, baby,
Mommy's here!

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:31.435
Come on, Gohan! Wake up, baby!

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:32.805
You're going to be okay...

00:07:32.838 --> 00:07:34.843
Mommy's here...
Mommy's here!

00:07:34.876 --> 00:07:37.549
Don't worry. Gohan
will be just fine.

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.084
[KRILLIN] Goku's the
one who's really hurt.

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:41.790
He'll live, but he's
in pretty bad shape...

00:07:41.824 --> 00:07:45.063
Hey... Hey, d'you
hear me? He's over--

00:07:45.096 --> 00:07:46.298
You poor thing...

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:48.302
I promise, from now on I'm
never gonna leave your side,

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:49.539
do you hear me?

00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:51.643
Your Mommy won't let
anything happen to you!

00:07:51.677 --> 00:07:53.948
Oh, Gohan! I've
missed you so much!

00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:56.620
What have they
done to my poor baby?!

00:07:57.254 --> 00:07:59.893
[KRILLIN] Goku had a pretty
rough time of it too, you know.

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.095
That's just wrong!

00:08:01.128 --> 00:08:02.330
[BULMA] Oh, no... No!

00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:03.333
Goku?

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:05.805
We're here!

00:08:05.838 --> 00:08:08.176
[BULMA] Talk to me,
Goku. Are you okay?

00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:10.346
[MASTER ROSHI] Looks like they
really did a number on you.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.287
It's... not so bad... but I'm
sorry... He got away... guys.

00:08:14.321 --> 00:08:18.429
Well done! Not just anyone can
run off a Saiyan warrior.

00:08:18.462 --> 00:08:20.802
[GOKU] Korin? Is that you? Hey!

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:22.506
[KRILLIN] You're right...
You wouldn't believe

00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:24.374
how strong that guy was.

00:08:24.408 --> 00:08:26.212
The four of us were
lucky to survive.

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:29.184
I just wish I could say the
same for everybody else...

00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:31.590
Bulma, I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but...

00:08:31.623 --> 00:08:33.560
Krillin... it was on TV!

00:08:33.594 --> 00:08:34.929
Then you know, huh!

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:36.800
Then I guess you also
know about Piccolo and Kami!

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:39.238
Since they're gone...
that means...

00:08:39.271 --> 00:08:41.776
the Dragon Balls are gone, too.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.719
[BULMA] I know all that,
okay? Just shut up!

00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:51.997
I guess you already explained?

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.134
Yes... Sadly.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.840
It's just a shame
that Piccolo wasn't

00:08:56.873 --> 00:08:58.711
one of the ones to make it.

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:01.148
Excuse me... for livin'!

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.056
Who asked you?!

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.660
[BULMA] The only reason you're
still standing is because

00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:09.699
you were hiding like a big fat
coward the whole time.

00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:13.006
Hey... You take that back!

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.308
[BULMA] If you'd been
there, maybe Piccolo

00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:15.578
wouldn't've gotten
killed and then

00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:16.747
everyone else could come back!

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.151
You ever think of that, jerk?!

00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:30.006
Hey! if it hadn't've been for my
help...

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:32.779
everybody here would be dead,
including Piccolo!

00:09:32.812 --> 00:09:34.949
It's not like I asked
for this headache!

00:09:34.982 --> 00:09:35.684
Leave me alone!

00:09:35.718 --> 00:09:36.820
Alright... alright!

00:09:36.853 --> 00:09:38.356
Bickering is not
gonna solve anything.

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:40.761
We need to get our friends
some medical attention...

00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:43.032
'Cause I'm all
out of senzu beans.

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:48.743
[MASTER ROSHI] Easy, now...
Careful... Watch your step!

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.819
[CHI-CHI] Sleep Gohan...

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:31.863
This is where the
battle started, right?

00:10:31.896 --> 00:10:33.299
Where Yamcha
and Tien went down?

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:36.840
We're close. I think it was
a little farther that way.

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:44.188
[KRILLIN] Please
don't cry, Bulma...

00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:46.025
I know it looks
pretty bad right now...

00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:47.628
it is bad... but
that doesn't mean

00:10:47.662 --> 00:10:49.464
we should just quit
trying, you know?

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:51.001
Not yet... Not when
there's a chance

00:10:51.034 --> 00:10:53.006
we might be able
to fix everything.

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:56.746
It's definitely a long shot...
but... it might work...

00:10:56.779 --> 00:10:58.149
And unless I'm
missing something,

00:10:58.182 --> 00:11:00.053
I think it's possible
that everyone the Saiyans

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.758
killed can be
brought back to life.

00:11:04.294 --> 00:11:05.764
But... how's that possible?

00:11:05.797 --> 00:11:07.167
Good question!

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.637
Well... I don't
wanna get everyone's

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.006
hopes up if it's nothing.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.645
Wait, that's right...
He started to say something

00:11:12.678 --> 00:11:15.283
about this before
I fought Vegeta.

00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:19.659
[GOKU] It's okay, Krillin...
What are you thinking? Tell us.

00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:21.529
Well... the truth is....

00:11:21.562 --> 00:11:24.902
I'll explain it all later...
It looks like we're here.

00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:27.206
[KRILLIN] Go ahead and set
her down here, Master Roshi.

00:11:28.142 --> 00:11:31.048
[KRILLIN] We'll start
getting the bodies on board.

00:11:47.715 --> 00:11:49.986
Alright... One more to go...

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.761
But I haven't seen Chiaotzu
anywhere... Have you?

00:11:53.794 --> 00:11:55.765
[KRILLIN] There's no body...
he blew himself up

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:57.535
trying to kill a Saiyan.

00:11:57.568 --> 00:11:59.271
Oh. . . right...

00:11:59.304 --> 00:12:02.344
[KORIN] Goodness, it's terrible.
Such a senseless loss...

00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:04.616
If there was only some
way to turn back the clock

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:06.819
and prevent this
tragedy from happening.

00:12:06.853 --> 00:12:09.057
The way things stand...
far too many decent people

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.295
have made too
great a sacrifice.

00:12:11.328 --> 00:12:15.236
This is wrong... and here we are
powerless to change anything!

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.508
It's so infuriating!

00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:25.390
Well...

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:29.464
[BULMA] Let's get going...
I'll take the wheel, okay?

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:32.404
There... I'm
calmer already.

00:12:32.437 --> 00:12:34.542
Good... That's good.

00:12:39.586 --> 00:12:42.056
Gohan! You're finally awake!

00:12:43.793 --> 00:12:45.731
There there, now! You can relax!

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.635
Your mommy's right here!

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:50.006
Mom, is that really you?

00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:52.645
My precious baby boy!

00:12:52.678 --> 00:12:54.081
You must be traumatized!

00:12:54.114 --> 00:12:56.786
After everything
you had to go through!

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:57.855
We're all proud of you, Gohan.

00:12:57.888 --> 00:12:59.559
You really came
through out there.

00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:01.162
We couldn't have
done it without you!

00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:03.933
[GOHAN] But what happened?
Where's the Saiyan?

00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:08.475
Well... I guess I kinda sorta...
might've let him get away.

00:13:08.944 --> 00:13:10.013
But... who cares?

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:11.415
After that beating we gave him,

00:13:11.448 --> 00:13:13.553
I wouldn't be surprised if we
never saw Vegeta again!

00:13:13.587 --> 00:13:16.926
Especially now that he knows
what we're capable of!

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.200
Hey, where's Dad?

00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:23.038
I'm right here, Gohan.
Right behind you.

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:24.675
I made it, and it's
all because of the

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:28.550
great job you
did back there.

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:31.957
[BOTH chuckling]

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.160
[YAJIROBE] You sure are
somethin', you know that, lady?

00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:36.498
Hey... Aren't you were
supposed to be Goku's wife?

00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:38.637
You haven't even looked at
the guy since you got here...

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.843
Put down your "baby" and go
check on your husband, already!

00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:44.481
Why... you little brat!. No way!

00:13:44.515 --> 00:13:46.686
It's because of him that
my son got into this mess

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.922
in the first place!

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:50.026
There's no reason Gohan
had to get involved!

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:52.497
But... They needed me, Mom!
I had to help save the Earth!

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:54.401
I don't want to hear
another word on the subject!

00:13:54.435 --> 00:13:58.275
It's a mother's duty to protect
her children... not the Earth!

00:14:00.313 --> 00:14:02.919
[YAJIROBE] Hey, Goku... She
give you this kinda lip at home?

00:14:02.952 --> 00:14:04.487
You never finished....

00:14:04.522 --> 00:14:07.628
What did you say about...
bringing everyone back?

00:14:07.662 --> 00:14:09.464
Well... it's just a thought.

00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:12.470
Okay... Here it goes...

00:14:12.504 --> 00:14:14.976
See... The Saiyans already
knew about the Dragon Balls

00:14:15.009 --> 00:14:17.146
when they got here, they
heard us talking over that

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.786
[KRILLIN] communicator
Goku's brother was wearing.

00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:21.422
They weren't here for revenge...

00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:22.625
At least not entirely.

00:14:22.658 --> 00:14:24.227
They seemed a heck of alot
more interested in finding

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.398
the Dragon Balls, so
they could make a wish.

00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:27.267
You think so?

00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:28.202
Yeah.

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:29.104
But it's what they
said about Piccolo

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:30.373
that caught my attention...

00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:32.678
Do you remember
what they said he was?

00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:34.749
They... called him a "Namekian."

00:14:34.783 --> 00:14:36.351
[ALL gasp]

00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:39.491
Which means... Piccolo
and Kami... well...

00:14:39.526 --> 00:14:42.264
It sounds like the two of
them might have been aliens.

00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:45.303
You just figured that out?
Dude, they're both green.

00:14:45.336 --> 00:14:49.211
But it's what Vegeta said after
that, that's got me thinking.

00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:52.250
Play time is over.
Eliminate them! Now!

00:14:52.283 --> 00:14:54.421
What about the Dragon
Balls? I thought--

00:14:54.455 --> 00:14:57.093
[VEGETA] The Namekian is
of no use to us anymore.

00:14:57.127 --> 00:14:58.997
Let's just say I have
a hunch that if we put

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:01.002
our green friend's home
world next on the list

00:15:01.035 --> 00:15:04.341
of planets to conquer...
we'll get answers.

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:08.482
So? They know where
Piccolo's from... Big deal.

00:15:08.517 --> 00:15:09.786
[GOHAN] I heard that, too!

00:15:09.819 --> 00:15:11.221
I just didn't know
what they meant...

00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:12.658
but they acted like
they'd be able to

00:15:12.691 --> 00:15:14.494
find more Dragon Balls on Namek!

00:15:14.528 --> 00:15:17.300
That's right. So If we can
get to this planet Namek...

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:18.837
and I know that's
a really big "if,"

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.373
but if we can find it somehow...

00:15:20.407 --> 00:15:23.479
then we might be able to bring
those Dragon Balls back here!

00:15:23.513 --> 00:15:24.582
Oh, I get it...

00:15:24.615 --> 00:15:26.185
All we'd have to do
then is wish for everyone

00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:28.924
who was killed by the Saiyans
to be restored to life.

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:30.894
And I'd get to
see Piccolo again!

00:15:30.927 --> 00:15:32.932
Gohan! What are-- What
are you talking about?!

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:34.234
They'd all be alive!

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.405
And if Piccolo comes back,
then Kami will, too!

00:15:36.438 --> 00:15:37.641
And if Kami comes back,

00:15:37.674 --> 00:15:40.279
so will the Dragon Balls,
or if not, he can make more!

00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:43.252
Yes! That's an
amazing idea!

00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:45.457
It... might even
actually work!

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.859
We at least have to try!

00:15:46.893 --> 00:15:49.498
[KRILLIN] Hello, friends.
Goodbye, Saiyans!

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.673
[BULMA] Guys... That's a whole
lot easier said than done.

00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:56.311
We could never pull that off...

00:15:56.345 --> 00:15:59.183
It's like finding a needle in a
haystack... It's hopeless.

00:15:59.217 --> 00:16:02.223
[KRILLIN] Not for you... I
bet you could find it, right?

00:16:02.256 --> 00:16:03.826
Do you know how
many planets there are?

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.332
Maybe if we had some clue
where to look for this No-Neck,

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:08.536
or whatever it's
called, but we don't!

00:16:09.572 --> 00:16:11.710
[GOKU] Don't worry...
Leave that to me.

00:16:11.743 --> 00:16:13.245
You hear that, King Kai?

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.285
I bet you know just about every
planet in the universe, right?

00:16:16.318 --> 00:16:18.222
[GOKU] Do you know
where Planet Namek is?

00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:19.358
[KING KAI] What kind
of question is that?

00:16:19.391 --> 00:16:21.261
Of course I know
where Planet Namek is!

00:16:21.295 --> 00:16:24.067
I'd be a pretty sorry king
if I didn't know my own realm.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.105
I can give you its
exact coordinates.

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:27.407
That's... incredible!

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.546
He's the King Kai
you told us about?

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:30.848
But... we all hear him!

00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:32.450
It's like he's in
the room with us!

00:16:32.484 --> 00:16:33.419
Alright, King Kai...

00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:34.956
You're coming
through loud and clear.

00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:36.893
Go ahead, we're all listening!

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:39.799
Hm... Namek... Namek...

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.102
Let me try to give
you coordinates

00:16:41.135 --> 00:16:42.605
in Earth terminology.

00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:44.441
Here we are... Now... um...

00:16:44.474 --> 00:16:47.748
It says here you'll keep a
bearing of SW-sixty-six.

00:16:47.782 --> 00:16:49.519
Hold on... No,
that's not right...

00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:51.388
[KING KAI] This thing might
as well be written in Japanese.

00:16:51.421 --> 00:16:56.198
Maybe this is it:
SU-eighty-three by 9045-YX...

00:16:56.232 --> 00:16:57.568
Yeah, yeah. Try that one.

00:16:57.601 --> 00:16:59.337
Wait... I wanna make
sure I heard right.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.509
You said Nine-Zero-Four-Five-YX?

00:17:01.543 --> 00:17:04.749
You... understood that? I'm
glad somebody did. I'm lost.

00:17:04.782 --> 00:17:06.017
[BULMA] Hey, Master Roshi...

00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:07.522
Can you take the wheel
for a couple a minutes?

00:17:07.555 --> 00:17:08.623
I need to do some math.

00:17:08.656 --> 00:17:10.392
Okay... Sure.

00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:14.635
[KING KAI] As I recall, Planet
Namek was once an extremely

00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:17.908
beautiful world, populated
by many, many Namekians.

00:17:17.941 --> 00:17:20.246
But a long time ago
there was a major change

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.482
in the planet's climate...

00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:23.787
horrible... and as a
result, all but a few

00:17:23.821 --> 00:17:25.256
Namekians were wiped out.

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:27.694
Cool. That's it.
The Balls are gone.

00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:29.431
Big whoop. Let's
get outta here.

00:17:29.464 --> 00:17:30.634
Eeh... you jerk!

00:17:30.668 --> 00:17:31.902
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:35.142
We don't know what it's like on
Planet Namek these days...

00:17:35.175 --> 00:17:37.815
But... I'll check my antennae...

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:40.452
Hm...

00:17:40.486 --> 00:17:43.358
[humming]

00:17:43.392 --> 00:17:45.029
[gasp] I think I found it!

00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:46.432
Yes... I see...

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:49.772
So... Kami, or... the Namekian
who would become Kami,

00:17:49.806 --> 00:17:52.844
escaped from his home planet and
came all the way here to Earth.

00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:54.447
And... if that's
the case, that means

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.018
two things must have happened.

00:17:56.051 --> 00:17:57.453
Either Kami lost his memory...

00:17:57.487 --> 00:17:58.990
or he was too
young to remember...

00:17:59.024 --> 00:18:02.297
Either way, it's safe to assume
he's had quite a difficult past.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.802
So have I.
But I don't get it.

00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:05.971
It doesn't
make any sense...

00:18:06.005 --> 00:18:07.741
These Dragon Balls
can grant any wish?

00:18:07.775 --> 00:18:09.979
If they made 'em... then
they could have like...

00:18:10.012 --> 00:18:12.184
I don't know... wished
the climate normal again

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:14.053
and all those
Namekians wouldn'ta died!

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:15.523
[MASTER ROSHI] I doubt
that would have worked.

00:18:15.557 --> 00:18:17.695
Think about what
Shenron said to us.

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:19.297
We asked him to get
rid of the Saiyans,

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:21.302
but he couldn't grant a
wish beyond the power

00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:23.472
of the one who
created the Dragon Balls.

00:18:23.506 --> 00:18:24.976
They were too much for Kami...

00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:26.712
so they were too
much for Shenron, too!

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:29.150
See? It's because the
Dragon Balls have limits

00:18:29.184 --> 00:18:31.088
that we're in this
mess to begin with.

00:18:31.121 --> 00:18:32.624
Well what good are they, then?

00:18:32.657 --> 00:18:33.693
I mean, come on!

00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:35.897
You might as well not
even bother with them!

00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:39.872
[laughing]

00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:41.174
I've been dying
to do that!

00:18:41.207 --> 00:18:42.443
[KING KAI] I
found the Namekians!

00:18:42.476 --> 00:18:44.381
It looks like there
are almost a hundred...

00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:46.217
Not nearly as many as
there were before...

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.723
but they're
flourishing! Wonderful!

00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:51.128
Wait... There's a
hundred more guys like

00:18:51.161 --> 00:18:53.465
Piccolo and Kami out there?

00:18:57.273 --> 00:18:58.643
[KING KAI] Yes, that's right...

00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:00.580
But I wouldn't worry about
it too much if I were you.

00:19:00.613 --> 00:19:02.718
The Namekians are known
for their gentle nature...

00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:05.524
They're nice... Like Kami was on
your planet...

00:19:05.557 --> 00:19:06.826
[KING KAI] Piccolo
had a mean streak,

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.532
but that was more the
exception than the rule.

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:12.303
Remember, Piccolo and
Kami used to be one.

00:19:12.336 --> 00:19:14.542
Kami was exposed to
evil in humans that he

00:19:14.575 --> 00:19:16.278
never would have known on Namek.

00:19:16.312 --> 00:19:18.216
And when he decided to
purge the darkness that

00:19:18.249 --> 00:19:20.754
crept into his nature,
Piccolo was born--

00:19:20.788 --> 00:19:23.993
the embodiment of all
the evil he had encountered.

00:19:24.628 --> 00:19:26.331
[YAJIROBE] Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:19:26.364 --> 00:19:27.768
No wonder he
was so mean...

00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:30.540
There are enough jerks out
there to turn anybody bad.

00:19:30.573 --> 00:19:31.743
How true.

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.345
Alright! Then there isn't
anything stopping us from

00:19:33.378 --> 00:19:35.517
going to Planet Namek and
using their Dragon Balls

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.554
to bring everyone
back to life!

00:19:37.587 --> 00:19:39.859
[BULMA] Are you serious?
That is so naïve!

00:19:39.892 --> 00:19:42.463
Even if we do know exactly
where this Namek place is,

00:19:42.496 --> 00:19:43.933
how do you plan
on getting there?

00:19:43.967 --> 00:19:45.336
Have you considered that?

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:47.107
[KRILLIN] How? Well, I dunno...

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.210
I guess I figured we'd
go in a spaceship.

00:19:49.244 --> 00:19:51.114
Oh, sure! And I
figured you might've

00:19:51.147 --> 00:19:52.651
[BULMA] used
your brain for once!

00:19:52.685 --> 00:19:55.356
I just ran a few calculations
to see how long it would take

00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:56.859
a spaceship with the
world's best engine-

00:19:56.892 --> 00:19:59.064
built by my dad-
to get us to the coordinates

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:00.366
that King Kai gave us.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.538
Well? Guess... Never mind.

00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:04.340
I doubt you'd
come remotely close...

00:20:04.374 --> 00:20:07.147
Four thousand three hundred
and thirty nine years...

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.816
and over three months...

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.688
If we survived that long.

00:20:10.721 --> 00:20:11.723
Oh, no.

00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:13.893
[KRILLIN] Well... That
had me worried, too,

00:20:13.927 --> 00:20:15.997
but I'm pretty sure I
have it figured out...

00:20:16.031 --> 00:20:19.103
Something was bugging me about
the spaceship Vegeta escaped in,

00:20:19.137 --> 00:20:20.339
and then it hit me.

00:20:20.372 --> 00:20:22.076
[KRILLIN] It was so
small! Barely big enough

00:20:22.109 --> 00:20:23.513
for one person.

00:20:23.546 --> 00:20:25.684
There's no way both Saiyans
came here in the same pod!

00:20:25.718 --> 00:20:27.888
Which would mean the ship that
the other Saiyan came here in

00:20:27.922 --> 00:20:30.326
should still be sitting right
where he landed it!

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:31.829
Hey! You're right!

00:20:31.862 --> 00:20:34.602
I bet we could find the one
that Raditz came here in, too!

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:38.009
Actually, we can't... Not
after what Gohan did to it.

00:20:38.042 --> 00:20:39.410
[GOKU] That's my boy.

00:20:39.444 --> 00:20:41.683
Still... one alien
spaceship might be enough!

00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:43.318
I can't say for
sure until I see it,

00:20:43.352 --> 00:20:44.788
but I bet I can
figure something out!

00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:47.661
It's probably going to be
somewhere around Metro East.

00:20:47.694 --> 00:20:50.499
After the Saiyans landed, it
was the first area destroyed...

00:20:50.534 --> 00:20:52.904
We'll have to look
for it another time.

00:20:52.938 --> 00:20:54.407
[chuckles]

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.980
Or... we could just use this
and it'll lead us right to it.

00:20:57.013 --> 00:20:58.816
See? It belongs to Vegeta...

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.520
It's what he used
to summon his ship.

00:21:00.553 --> 00:21:02.056
I saw it lying on
the battlefield

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.425
and I thought it
might come in handy.

00:21:03.459 --> 00:21:05.496
So what do you think,
was I right?

00:21:09.639 --> 00:21:13.145
Ha! You're right!
This could actually work!

00:21:13.178 --> 00:21:14.615
[ALL laughing]

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:18.255
Yes! There's still maybe hope
for our friends after all!

00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:20.192
[laughing]

00:21:20.225 --> 00:21:22.864
To Namek! And the Dragon Balls!

00:21:26.304 --> 00:21:27.974
[NARRATOR] Suddenly,
Planet Namek doesn't seem

00:21:28.008 --> 00:21:30.680
so far out of reach. But
the crew has much to do

00:21:30.714 --> 00:21:32.417
before they can
start their journey.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.855
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:44.875
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:38.215 --> 00:22:39.886
[GOHAN] Hey, it's me, Gohan!

00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:41.054
Bulma, what did you do?!

00:22:41.087 --> 00:22:43.626
The spaceship just blew up
into a million pieces!

00:22:43.659 --> 00:22:44.896
[CHI-CHI] That's not
for you to worry about!

00:22:44.929 --> 00:22:46.665
You should be
focusing on your lessons!

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:49.470
Do you have any idea how behind
you are in your homework?

00:22:49.505 --> 00:22:51.341
[GOHAN] I don't care,
Mom! Homework can wait.

00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:53.846
There are more important
things to do right now!

00:22:53.879 --> 00:22:56.318
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:58.188
"The Ship Resting in Yunzabit!

00:22:58.221 --> 00:23:00.527
Time to Blast Off
for Planet Namek!"

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.433
[GOKU] The original Shenron on
his home planet? I wanna go!
