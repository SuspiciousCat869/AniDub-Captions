[GOKU] I ve been waiting
for this moment...

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:15.531
for a really long time now...

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:17.703
and I m not about to
let it pass me by.

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:19.338
Hand-to-hand combat, eh...?

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:24.583
Oh, alright My, this really is

[GOHAN]
Hey, Bulma!

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:16.540
Gohan...? Is that you?

00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:19.311
What s the big idea?!
You left me...!

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:21.951
I can t believe you ran off
and left me alone again

00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:23.721
Yeah, I m sorry about that.

00:02:23.755 --> 00:02:26.593
Where are we?
I don t recognize any of this.

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:28.865
I don t know, but it sure
doesn t look like Namek.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.771
The last thing I remember
I was on board the spaceship.

00:02:31.804 --> 00:02:36.212
That s weird... Where do
you think the spaceship went?

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.336
It s it s you again.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:54.449
Goku!

00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:56.654
Piccolo!

00:02:56.687 --> 00:02:57.589
Gohan.

00:02:57.622 --> 00:03:00.093
You re really here...!
And so is Dende.

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:04.168
Wait... Hold on. Oww!
Guess I m not dreaming!

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:07.241
I know I had a hard
time believing it as well.

00:03:07.274 --> 00:03:10.113
So is Krillin here, too?

00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:12.018
I haven t seen him.

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:13.353
Maybe he didn t make it.

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:15.424
[NAMEKIAN A]
It... It s the Grand Elder!

00:03:15.457 --> 00:03:17.662
[DENDE AND GOHAN]
Did he say Grand Elder ?

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.682
I m struggling to comprehend
what you could possibly

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:30.822
be trying to accomplish...
What a pathetic little display!

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:33.259
We ve got different ideas
about what s pathetic...

00:03:33.293 --> 00:03:35.665
cause if you ask me,
pathetic is a monster like you

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:37.902
getting beat by a
Saiyan monkey like me.

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:40.407
I admire your ability to
continue making threats

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.478
even though we both
know how empty they are,

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:45.718
but it s starting to get old!

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.871
This may come as a
bit of a shock

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:32.144
but the planet we find
ourselves on is Planet Earth.

00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:33.347
Wha--?!

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.618
Earth...? Wait, then...
then we re home?!

00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:38.422
Something truly incredible
has happened here.

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:41.997
Listen to me, everyone. Our
time together is short.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.370
Before much longer I will
once again be called away.

00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:48.376
But before I go, it s
important for all of you

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.948
to know just how we
came to be here.

00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:53.352
So that explains where we are,

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:56.458
but what about
Frieza and Kakarot?

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:24.281
Wait... are you telling me

00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:27.622
Frieza and my dad
are still on Namek?

00:05:28.423 --> 00:05:30.294
Did it explode yet...?
If it hasn t,

00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:32.231
there s still a chance
he s okay, right?

00:05:32.264 --> 00:05:34.468
Unfortunately... I can
no longer sense

00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:38.844
what s happening on Namek
The distance is far too great.

00:05:39.713 --> 00:05:40.615
Goku

00:05:40.648 --> 00:05:43.587
[PICCOLO]
Don t worry about him.

00:05:44.388 --> 00:05:46.159
[GOHAN]
Why not?

00:05:46.192 --> 00:05:48.697
[PICCOLO]
Your father will be fine.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.603
I hope you re right about that.

00:05:55.176 --> 00:05:57.380
Come back, Dad.

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:01.121
Please, Goku
Be careful out there.

00:06:03.193 --> 00:06:04.896
Goku.

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:18.924
Please dad !

00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:31.315
The mighty Frieza will
not succumb to a monkey!

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.555
Especially not
a filthy Saiyan ape!

00:06:44.474 --> 00:06:46.580
[KING KAI]
Goku! Can you hear me?

00:06:46.613 --> 00:06:49.552
[TIEN] What is it, King Kai...?
What s the matter?

00:06:49.585 --> 00:06:51.756
[KING KAI] It s incredible.
They re so evenly matched.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.529
Goku is keeping up with
Frieza blow-for-blow!

00:06:54.562 --> 00:06:56.198
But they re running
out of time.

00:06:56.231 --> 00:06:58.035
Namek will explode
any moment now!

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:00.440
If they don t stop fighting
like this-- and soon--

00:07:00.473 --> 00:07:01.943
Goku doesn t stand a chance!

00:07:01.977 --> 00:07:04.147
But... you just said
he was doing fine.

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:07.755
Mmm... Namek will eventually be
destroyed... When it is...

00:07:07.788 --> 00:07:11.095
Goku is finished. But Frieza
is as comfortable in space

00:07:11.128 --> 00:07:13.366
as he is on land.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.837
[YAMCHA] But King Kai,
th-there has to be

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.441
something we can do
to save Goku, right?

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:20.213
Goku choose this path
and he must walk it alone.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:22.450
It s not fair.

00:07:23.888 --> 00:07:24.589
Yamcha.

00:07:24.623 --> 00:07:26.559
[YAMCHA]
Goku!

00:07:31.503 --> 00:07:33.707
Please no.

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:44.897
Well, Saiyan? Are you
having second thoughts about

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.702
challenging a superior
warrior to battle?

00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:49.438
I cannot be defeated!

00:07:49.471 --> 00:07:51.976
Not by you or anyone!

00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:16.693
You monkey!

00:08:38.837 --> 00:08:41.376
May I ask what you re doing,
Miss Bulma?

00:08:42.144 --> 00:08:45.216
This... is botanomancy ...
and I learned how to do it

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.889
when I was just a little girl...
Let s say someone you know

00:08:47.922 --> 00:08:50.828
is traveling and you want
him to come back safely.

00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:54.301
You put three leaves inside
a circle and start a fire

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:55.604
If all the leaves burn up,

00:08:55.637 --> 00:08:58.242
you know your friend is on
his way, safe and sound.

00:08:58.275 --> 00:09:02.652
Oh... You re trying to divine
what happened to Goku

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:04.555
[DENDE]
May I help?

00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:19.485
[BULMA] Look! They re burning!
Guys, this is a good sign!

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:21.956
[DENDE] So Goku must be
coming here soon!

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.229
That s right...! I m telling
you the leaves never lie

00:09:31.576 --> 00:09:33.647
[GOHAN]
That s a bunch of baloney!

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.253
My dad is coming back home!
He said he would!

00:09:38.456 --> 00:09:39.726
That s right, Gohan!

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:41.963
Just wait and see...
He s gonna beat Frieza...!

00:09:41.997 --> 00:09:44.869
He ll be back here
before you know it.

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:45.791
[FRIEZA LAUGHING]

00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:48.395
Well, now Satisfied?

00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.505
[GOKU]
Is that the best you can do?

00:10:52.538 --> 00:10:54.407
What?!

00:10:54.441 --> 00:10:56.445
I said, is that
the best you can do?

00:10:56.478 --> 00:10:59.251
Watch your tongue!

00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:21.448
[FRIEZA]
Where is he?

00:12:52.579 --> 00:12:55.116
You dare to challenge me!

00:13:37.702 --> 00:13:44.248
You! You will be repaid
a hundredfold for

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:48.155
every last impertinent
attack This I swear!

00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:58.175
Your time is up, Saiyan!

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.761
It s done.

00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:26.364
What do you mean, done ?

00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:38.455
Well...? Answer me, ape...!
Why are you giving up?

00:14:38.489 --> 00:14:40.527
You ve been coming at me
with everything you ve got,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.898
but it s finally caught up with
you and your power level is

00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:45.336
falling fast. The fact is,

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.775
I don t see the point in
fighting you anymore.

00:14:47.809 --> 00:14:51.081
Your pride is already shot and
in the end, I guess that s good

00:14:51.114 --> 00:14:54.588
enough for me You were
so sure of your own power that

00:14:54.622 --> 00:14:59.197
you never imagined anyone in the
universe could bring you down.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.974
Especially a Saiyan. Now you
know what failure feels like.

00:15:04.007 --> 00:15:06.546
See? I don t need to
keep fighting you because

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.917
I ve already won
So go crawl off

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.990
someplace and hide.
I don t really care.

00:15:12.023 --> 00:15:13.761
[GOKU CONTINUES]
Like I said it s done

00:15:13.794 --> 00:15:15.229
I m going back to Earth.

00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:19.471
If I leave now, I ll make
it back right on time

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:26.787
Your days of terrorizing
the universe are over

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.491
I don t ever want to
see your face again.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:36.706
Why, you
That is the last straw!

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:41.348
You lie.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.487
[FRIEZA]
I am not beaten!

00:15:45.858 --> 00:15:47.528
Not yet!

00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:06.331
I warned you
but you didn t listen!

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:10.540
I gave you one last chance
to walk away and you blew it!

00:16:14.347 --> 00:16:17.220
Frieza!

00:16:35.824 --> 00:16:38.362
[FRIEZA LAUGHS]

00:16:38.396 --> 00:16:40.834
[FRIEZA] That will slice through
anything in its path

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:44.174
and it will follow
anywhere you go!

00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:47.079
[FRIEZA CRAZY LAUGH]

00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:08.623
I see your strategy...!
You ll swerve at the last

00:17:08.657 --> 00:17:11.963
second and try to send
my own attack after me!

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:13.767
Do you actually think
I m going to fall for

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.539
a two-bit tactic like that?!

00:17:21.482 --> 00:17:23.151
[FRIEZA]
Try me!

00:17:33.607 --> 00:17:36.513
Take that!

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:38.549
Over here, Frieza!

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.545
An after-image, eh...?
Well done, monkey

00:17:52.578 --> 00:17:54.247
You re getting creative.

00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:57.187
I ll say again There is
just no point in fighting you

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.658
anymore, not like this
Especially now that

00:17:59.692 --> 00:18:03.700
you re resorting to amateur
attacks like that one.

00:18:03.734 --> 00:18:06.506
If you really want to decide
a winner, then fine...

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:11.348
But first, build your power back
up and learn a few new moves!

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:13.252
[FRIEZA THINKING]
Amateur attacks ...?

00:18:13.285 --> 00:18:15.657
Learn a few new moves ?!

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.551
Goku...! You re
almost out of time...!

00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:48.790
Planet Namek is
about to explode! Hurry!

00:18:58.175 --> 00:19:04.555
C mon, Dad !

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:12.904
So My technique
is amateurish...?

00:19:12.938 --> 00:19:15.944
Well, then
If that s the case

00:19:23.926 --> 00:19:26.298
Let s try two!

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.870
Come on That s it?

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:42.196
You can run... but
it doesn t matter

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.436
where you hide,
they will find you!

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:51.347
Escape is impossible
You re delaying the inevitable!

00:19:58.128 --> 00:20:01.135
Knock it off...!
Just give up already!

00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:06.411
Ah This move again You re
not as clever as I thought.

00:20:13.826 --> 00:20:16.398
Try it all you like
I ll never fall for it!

00:20:16.431 --> 00:20:18.636
