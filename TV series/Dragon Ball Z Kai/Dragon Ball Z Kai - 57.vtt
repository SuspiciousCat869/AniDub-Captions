Goku won't be here
for a little while yet,

so we might as well
relax while we wait...

have we met
somewhere before?

No, I... I
doubt it.

Hey so, where
do you know

00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:11.611
my dad from, anyway?

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:12.444

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:13.814
of meeting
him face to face...

Can't tell you.

Oh, you can't...?!

who you are...!

a boy like you

kind of power?!

00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:32.451
[GOHAN]
Um, when you
defeated Frieza

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:33.988
and that big
guy with him,

00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:35.925
you were a
Super Saiyan, huh!

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:38.096
I... guess you
could say that, yeah.

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:39.967
Give me a break!

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:41.269
There are
exactly two Saiyans

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.074
left in the universe...
myself and Kakarot.

00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:46.312
Three, if we count this
little half-breed here.

00:01:46.412 --> 00:01:47.615
Frieza saw to
it that our race

00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:50.087
was all but wiped
out from existence!

00:01:50.187 --> 00:01:51.122
So there is no way

00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:53.528
that you could
be a Saiyan.

00:01:53.628 --> 00:01:54.763
Right?

00:01:54.863 --> 00:01:56.967
[GOHAN]
Yeah, but...he was
totally a Super Saiyan

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:58.036
when he beat Frieza.

00:01:58.136 --> 00:01:59.005
He even had the
crazy blond hair

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:00.107
and everything.

00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:01.610
And the hair
of a real Saiyan

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.514
would be black
the rest of the time.

No, I'm definitely
not an employee.

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:15.337
Didn't think so.

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:16.774
Well, then
what's your name...

00:02:16.874 --> 00:02:19.245
or is that a
big secret, too?

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:21.115
Uh, actually it is...

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:23.253
But I can tell
you I'm seventeen.

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:25.357
Odd that he won't
volunteer his name.

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:27.628
Yeah.
What is he hiding?

Hey, boys...

enough, don't you think?

What is it?

when Dende

used the Dragon Balls

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:51.850
to move to a new

to go along with them?

00:08:34.094 --> 00:08:36.366
I, uh, need to
have a word with you.

00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:37.467
Okay...

00:08:37.568 --> 00:08:41.108
But... Just
the two of us.

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:42.678
All right, then.

00:08:42.778 --> 00:08:43.847
[YAMCHA]
You just met the kid,

00:08:43.948 --> 00:08:45.483
and now you guys
are keeping secrets?

00:08:45.584 --> 00:08:47.353
Don't worry, Yamcha...
I'll be right back.

00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:48.657
[YAMCHA]
But...

00:08:52.297 --> 00:08:53.667
Here should be good.

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:55.370
Oh, I forgot to
say it back there.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.140
But thanks a lot
for taking care

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.577
of Frieza for me...!

00:08:58.678 --> 00:09:00.346
Guess I let him
off too easily, huh.

00:09:00.446 --> 00:09:01.449
You were supposed
to be the one

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.687
to defeat Frieza
and his father...

00:09:03.787 --> 00:09:05.958
But events didn't seem
to be going as planned...

00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:06.894
So I stepped in...

00:09:06.994 --> 00:09:08.898
Y'know, just to
pick up the slack.

00:09:08.998 --> 00:09:10.000
Yeah...!

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.135
Frieza must of made
some really good time

00:09:11.235 --> 00:09:12.270
in his spaceship...

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.641
I didn't think
he'd beat me back.

00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.711
He didn't learn his
lesson after Planet Namek,

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:17.748
but I woulda' taught him
not to mess with Earth.

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:19.519
He landed three
hours before you...

00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:20.621
there might
not have been

00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:22.057
an Earth by the
time you got back.

00:09:22.157 --> 00:09:23.126
That's what you think,

00:09:23.226 --> 00:09:25.531
but I had a little
something up my sleeve.

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:26.499
Oh... is that so?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.802
Yeah...

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:30.040
It's a trick they call
Instant Transmission!

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.208
Like, teleporting?!

00:09:31.308 --> 00:09:32.377
I picked it up
from the natives

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:34.015
on this planet
called Yardrat.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.318
I was about to zip
down here from my ship

00:09:36.418 --> 00:09:37.955
and mop up the
floor with Frieza,

00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:39.660
but you beat
me to the punch.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.496
[TRUNKS]
I had no idea!

00:09:41.597 --> 00:09:42.765
I didn't know you
had those sorts

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:44.936
of skills at your
disposal, Goku.

00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:46.506
I thought you
were too far away

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:49.979
to be able to stop him...!

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:51.482
Which means I
needlessly changed

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:53.186
the course of history.

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:54.421
I've muddied the timeline

00:09:54.522 --> 00:09:56.025
even more by encountering
all the others,

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:58.263
when all I had
to do was find you.

00:09:58.363 --> 00:09:59.364
"Timeline?"

00:09:59.464 --> 00:10:00.901
What's going on?

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:03.306
I'll explain, but first
I have a question.

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:04.609
Tell me, Goku.

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:06.747
How well can you control
your Saiyan abilities?

00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:09.084
Are you able to
transform at will?

00:10:09.184 --> 00:10:10.119
Oh! Well at first,

00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:11.757
I had to be really
worked up to change,

00:10:11.857 --> 00:10:13.827
but now I can pretty
much do it whenever.

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:15.631
Please, show me...

00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:17.200
I would consider
it an honor.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.369
Huh?

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.839
I have to know...

00:10:34.502 --> 00:10:35.804
All right then...

00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:50.934
He just turned Super Saiyan
like it was nothing!

00:10:53.573 --> 00:10:55.042
This what you had in mind?

00:10:55.143 --> 00:10:57.347
[TRUNKS]
Yeah. Thanks
for humoring me.

00:10:57.447 --> 00:10:58.517
This is incredible...

00:10:58.617 --> 00:10:59.619
You look exactly
like I do

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:01.724
when I go Super Saiyan.

00:11:01.824 --> 00:11:03.661
So, what do we do now?

00:11:03.761 --> 00:11:06.098
I guess I should
return the favor.

00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:10.807
[VEGETA THINKING]
Impossible...!

00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:28.442
We really do
look alike, huh...

00:11:28.543 --> 00:11:29.512
Sorry, Goku.

00:11:29.612 --> 00:11:30.814
Huh?

00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:40.568
Why didn't you try
to dodge my attack?

00:11:40.668 --> 00:11:42.572
I don't sense any
evil intentions...

00:11:42.672 --> 00:11:45.678
I knew you weren't
going to hurt me.

00:11:45.778 --> 00:11:47.548
Ah, I see.

00:11:47.648 --> 00:11:50.420
But this time, Goku,
I'm following through.

00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:52.023
Go right ahead.

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:15.170
Awesome...

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.873
People told me
you were amazing...

00:12:16.973 --> 00:12:19.344
But you're even
better than that.

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:23.019
Y'know, I beat Frieza

00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:25.023
in the blink of an eye
using this sword.

00:12:25.123 --> 00:12:26.258
Well, I'm guessing
you weren't

00:12:26.358 --> 00:12:28.195
really trying your
hardest against me.

00:12:28.296 --> 00:12:30.667
But now I know I
can trust you, Goku...

00:12:30.767 --> 00:12:32.905
It's time for
me to come clean.

see that...?!

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:35.577

off the charts...!

to tell you is...

stay strictly between us.

Fair enough.

won't go any further...

any other Saiyans left...

with his research.

Is it that whole

"I'm gonna take over
the world" thing again...

Knowing him,
probably...

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:29.037
He never issued
demands, but it lines up

00:14:29.138 --> 00:14:31.242
with what he'd
pursued back in the day.

coming to him, though.

He created those two androids
to terrorize mankind...

very first victim...

00:21:16.753 --> 00:21:19.391
he knows nothing
of Saiyan strength!

00:21:19.491 --> 00:21:21.796
[NARRATOR]
Having delivered
his dire warning,

00:21:21.896 --> 00:21:24.067
the mysterious
young man disappeared

00:21:24.167 --> 00:21:26.405
as suddenly as he'd come.

00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:28.008
Will the diabolical Androids

00:21:28.108 --> 00:21:30.346
really appear in
three years time?

00:21:30.446 --> 00:21:33.819
Find out next
Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:11.695
[CLOSING SONG]

00:22:38.281 --> 00:22:39.417
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:39.518 --> 00:22:40.720
So, we're going
to have ourselves

00:22:40.821 --> 00:22:42.390
some android trouble
in three years?

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.793
Then let's roll up
our sleeves

00:22:43.893 --> 00:22:44.962
and get training!

00:22:45.062 --> 00:22:46.766
[VEGETA]
Wipe that smile off
your face, Kakarot--

00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:48.268
I'll be far
stronger than you

00:22:48.368 --> 00:22:49.505
by the time
they get here!

00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:50.540
[GOKU]
Heck, Vegeta--

00:22:50.673 --> 00:22:51.742
with how hard
we're working,

00:22:51.843 --> 00:22:54.080
I'll be far
stronger than me, too!

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.518
Next time, on
Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:23:00.994 --> 00:23:02.531
[VEGETA]
I will become
a Super Saiyan--

00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:04.500
and then surpass it!
