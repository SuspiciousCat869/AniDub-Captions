it was surprisingly simple.

more powerful I've become...

00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:29.572
It must be
a Namekian village.

00:09:29.606 --> 00:09:31.175
Wherever there's
a Namekian village,

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:32.377
there should be a Dragon Ball...

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.681
I'll just have to convince them

00:09:33.714 --> 00:09:35.450
it's in their best interest
to give it to me!

[VEGETA laughs]

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:39.057
And since Frieza and the others

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.129
have lost their
precious Scouters,

00:09:41.162 --> 00:09:42.965
I can take the Dragon
Ball and eliminate

00:09:42.998 --> 00:09:45.938
the Namekians without
Frieza ever knowing!

what's been happening

What is that?

[VILLAGER D]
It's an alien!

I wish to speak
to your Elder.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.127
I believe you have
a Dragon Ball here

that I'll be taking
off your hands.

We do have a Dragon Ball.

00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:25.818
But I must ask how
you intend to use it.

00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:29.057
What you "must" do is hand
it over to me... right now.

I will not... I sense an
unspeakable evil in you.

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:36.205
You are not worthy to
possess our Dragon Ball.

[VEGETA laughs]

I know it's not the best

but if you want to
keep your strength up,

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:26.038
you have to eat something.

[BULMA sighs]

00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:30.514
If I'd been through what
he's just been through,

00:11:30.547 --> 00:11:32.450
I wouldn't have
much appetite, either.

Good point... Guess I never
thought of it like that.

00:11:36.092 --> 00:11:38.495
Namekians don't eat
food to survive...

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.367
We don't need
anything but water.

You're kidding...

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.005
But there were all those
fields around your village.

00:11:43.038 --> 00:11:44.341
If all you do is drink water,

00:11:44.374 --> 00:11:46.045
what would you want to
grow all those plants for?

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:48.449
The plants you saw
are Ajissa saplings.

00:11:48.483 --> 00:11:49.785
Oh. And those
are what exactly?

00:11:49.819 --> 00:11:52.992
Well... The Elder says
that a long time ago,

00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:54.662
Planet Namek was covered with

00:11:54.695 --> 00:11:57.969
thick, beautiful groves
of Ajissa trees.

00:11:58.002 --> 00:11:59.739
They were everywhere.

00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:01.308
But then...

00:12:01.976 --> 00:12:03.681
The weather suddenly changed.

00:12:03.714 --> 00:12:06.452
The Ajissa trees were
almost wiped out.

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:08.657
And so was Planet Namek.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.295
We found the few Ajissa
trees that survived,

00:12:11.328 --> 00:12:12.999
and now we're trying
to grow more of them

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:14.836
so we can make
Namek beautiful again.

Only one person could
be that heartless...

00:12:57.956 --> 00:12:59.257
It must be Vegeta...

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.863
He has to be attacking
another village somewhere!

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:04.969
Him...? That monster doesn't
care who he hurts, does he?

00:13:05.002 --> 00:13:07.140
No... And on top of that,
he's figured out a way

00:13:07.174 --> 00:13:09.846
he can sense energy without
using one of those Scouters.

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:11.214
That's a problem.

be really careful... Lay low.

if Vegeta is working alone

or if he's just following
that Frieza guy's orders.

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:21.468
[KRILLIN] Not that it matters.

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:23.372
If either of them gets their
hands on the Dragon Balls,

nobody is safe!

I don't know how
we'd go about it,

00:13:26.044 --> 00:13:27.948
but we need to find
one of the Dragon Balls

00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:29.552
and hide it somewhere they
wouldn't think to look,

00:13:29.585 --> 00:13:32.024
they can't summon the
dragon if they only have six.

[GOHAN]
We can't do that!

00:13:33.392 --> 00:13:35.263
If we did, they'd keep
looking for the last one.

00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:37.267
They wouldn't stop
torturing the Namekians

00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:38.336
until they found it!

matter what we do.

We can't hold
them off forever.

00:13:44.147 --> 00:13:45.918
It's like...
we need Goku's help,

00:13:45.952 --> 00:13:47.086
but even when he gets here

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.158
there's no guarantee
he can beat them.

I was expecting to
have to hunt for it,

but alas... It might as
well be gift-wrapped.

00:15:09.017 --> 00:15:10.955
[KRILLIN] Turns out that
Kami was actually a Namekian

00:15:10.988 --> 00:15:12.692
who came to Earth
when he was young.

00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:14.028
Maybe about your age.

00:15:14.128 --> 00:15:15.330
We figured since
he was the one

00:15:15.363 --> 00:15:16.866
who created the Dragon
Balls on our planet,

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.640
we might find more on Namek and
wish our friends back to life.

00:15:20.674 --> 00:15:22.010
If this works
the way we hope,

00:15:22.043 --> 00:15:23.780
the Earth's Dragon Balls
should be restored

00:15:23.814 --> 00:15:25.016
at the same time
as our friends.

00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:27.621
Oh... that pretty much
explains everything.

00:15:27.654 --> 00:15:28.857
And that's how those bad guys

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.928
found out about
the Dragon balls, too.

Who's the Grand Elder?

00:15:42.751 --> 00:15:44.622
Is he like your
king or something?

I don't know what that is,

00:15:46.025 --> 00:15:48.195
but the Grand Elder gave
birth to all the Namekians.

00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:50.232
When the weather on Namek
suddenly changed,

00:15:50.266 --> 00:15:52.004
he was the only survivor!

00:15:52.037 --> 00:15:53.607
He's also the one
who started trying to

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.477
bring the Ajissa trees back!

was the sole survivor,

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:04.829
how was he able
to have children?

Same way as everyone else...

He hatched us from eggs
that came out of his mouth.

Uh... yeah...That's
not strange or anything.

00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:15.249
So... that means your elder's
actually a woman, right?

00:16:15.282 --> 00:16:16.418
Because you keep saying "he"...

00:16:16.451 --> 00:16:20.193
"Wo... man"...?
What does "woman" mean?

00:16:20.226 --> 00:16:22.330
[BULMA] You know,
a female... A girl...!

00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:24.502
If the Grand Elder laid
an egg out of her mouth,

00:16:24.536 --> 00:16:25.838
she must be female!

00:16:25.871 --> 00:16:27.975
There are two kinds
of Namekians, right?

and your father is a boy!

00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:36.424
Uhh...

00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:38.730
Wow, it sounds like they really
only have one gender here...

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.266
How boring is that?

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.738
I don't know, I don't think I
could handle being Namekian...

00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:44.307
Not for long.

00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:46.412
Look, this is all really
fascinating and everything,

00:16:46.445 --> 00:16:48.048
but why do you want
us to come with you

00:16:48.082 --> 00:16:49.384
to meet your Grand Elder?

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:51.422
Well... When those people
attacked our village,

00:16:51.455 --> 00:16:53.359
they said they'd already
collected four of

00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:56.498
the Dragon Balls from four
other neighboring villages.

00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:57.835
And... over there...

00:16:57.869 --> 00:17:00.608
You said a lot of energies just
disappeared in that direction.

00:17:00.641 --> 00:17:01.676
Right?

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.178
That someone had attacked
more of my people?

00:17:03.211 --> 00:17:05.016
[KRILLIN] Probably
so... yeah...

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:07.120
Maybe a guy
named Vegeta.

00:17:07.153 --> 00:17:10.192
[GOHAN] And it wasn't just
a lot of energies, Dende.

00:17:10.225 --> 00:17:12.899
It was all of them
in that direction.

00:17:12.932 --> 00:17:14.301
If so... then I guess...

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:16.037
that makes me one
of the last Namekians

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:17.875
left on the whole planet.

00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:19.411
This is terrible.

00:17:19.444 --> 00:17:21.448
We're gonna have to
assume that Vegeta found

00:17:21.481 --> 00:17:23.419
the Dragon Ball in that
village while he was attacking,

00:17:23.452 --> 00:17:25.423
which means there's
only one them left.

00:17:25.457 --> 00:17:27.060
[KRILLIN]
This is a long shot, but...

00:17:27.093 --> 00:17:29.164
does the Grand Elder have
one of the Dragon Balls?

00:17:29.197 --> 00:17:30.867
Yes... he does.

00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:32.003
No...! This is bad!

00:17:32.036 --> 00:17:33.472
[GROUP gasps]

00:17:33.507 --> 00:17:34.976
Frieza can't find it because
he doesn't have a Scouter...

00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:38.015
but now that Vegeta can sense
energy without one, he can!

00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:39.518
If Vegeta keeps
searching out Namekians,

00:17:39.552 --> 00:17:42.057
he'll eventually find
his way to the Grand Elder!

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.325
And when he does,

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:44.596
he'll steal the seventh
Dragon Ball from him!

00:17:44.629 --> 00:17:46.165
Then we have to go
warn the Grand Elder...!

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:48.970
Now...! Before
something horrible happens!

00:17:49.004 --> 00:17:50.641
You've got to
come with me!

00:17:50.674 --> 00:17:51.910
Please, I'm begging you!

00:17:51.943 --> 00:17:53.279
He's right, you
have to go with him...

00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:54.549
I don't wanna think
about what it'd be like

00:17:54.582 --> 00:17:58.189
if Frieza or Vegeta
wishes for eternal life.

00:17:58.222 --> 00:17:59.558
Fine, let's go...

00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:02.330
But we don't have much time.
We have to move fast!

00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:03.533
Right!

00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:05.870
I'll go with Dende to see
the Grand Elder... but...

00:18:05.904 --> 00:18:07.708
I want you and
Bulma to stay here.

00:18:07.742 --> 00:18:09.311
It's safer that way.

00:18:09.344 --> 00:18:10.681
There's no point
in all of us going.

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:11.816
Just take
care of Bulma.

00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:12.785
Yeah, okay.

00:18:12.818 --> 00:18:14.722
But be extra careful out there.

00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:16.959
We'll be back!

00:18:16.992 --> 00:18:18.128
[KRILLIN laughs]

00:18:18.162 --> 00:18:19.699
Hold down the fort
and we'll see you soon!

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:21.468
Okay!

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:29.283
[VEGETA]
Ah... Perfect.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.033
No one would think to
look for it underwater...

00:18:37.067 --> 00:18:40.139
And I'll be the only one
who knows where it is.

00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:41.408
[VEGETA laughs]

00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:44.915
That should give
me plenty of leverage.

00:18:46.118 --> 00:18:48.089
[VEGETA] Frieza already
has five Dragon Balls,

00:18:48.122 --> 00:18:50.459
and I have the sixth.

00:18:50.493 --> 00:18:53.700
There's only one left.
Where is it?

00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:09.632
I can't help but wonder what's
taking Dodoria so long...

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:12.871
Taking care of those runts
shouldn't be that difficult.

00:19:12.904 --> 00:19:14.408
[FRIEZA] It's not
that important.

00:19:14.441 --> 00:19:16.813
If Dodoria has trouble catching
a couple of children,

00:19:16.847 --> 00:19:18.048
then what use is he?

00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:18.917
Forget him...

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.052
For now, your task

00:19:20.085 --> 00:19:21.689
is to locate the
remaining Dragon Balls.

00:19:21.723 --> 00:19:23.560
[APPULE] We're not going
to let you down, Frieza.

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:24.995
There aren't
many villages left,

00:19:25.028 --> 00:19:27.568
so the last two Dragon Balls
shouldn't be hard to find.

00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:28.335
If we split up,

00:19:28.368 --> 00:19:29.470
I'm sure we'll be able to find

00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:31.876
the other villages
relatively quickly.

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:33.245
[FRIEZA]
In that case,

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:34.782
I suppose I'll just take
these five back to the ship

00:19:34.815 --> 00:19:36.752
and wait for you there.

00:19:38.389 --> 00:19:40.292
You won't disappoint me.

00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:43.032
Not now that we're so close
to using these little toys

00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:44.434
to grant my immortality.

00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:45.804
[APPULE and ZARBON] Sir.

00:19:47.674 --> 00:19:48.977
[ZARBON] You start
heading that way.

00:19:49.011 --> 00:19:49.945
I'll go the other...

00:19:49.978 --> 00:19:51.114
If you come across a village,

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.752
don't do anything
until you notify me.

00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:54.888
Some Namekians have
decent power levels.

00:19:54.922 --> 00:19:56.726
You can't handle
more than one.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.830
In any case, we'll meet
back on the spaceship

00:19:58.863 --> 00:20:00.132
in exactly three hours.

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:01.502
[APPULE] Yes, sir.

00:20:06.513 --> 00:20:09.384
I have to consider the
possibility that Vegeta has

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:12.758
found one or both of
the Dragon Balls I need...

00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:14.093
But either way,

00:20:14.127 --> 00:20:16.866
I'm certain he'll try to come
after the ones we already have.

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:18.335
Who knows...?

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:20.741
He may even bring the last
two Dragon Balls right to me.

00:20:20.774 --> 00:20:22.343
I doubt that he's
stupid enough to walk

00:20:22.376 --> 00:20:23.947
into the enemy camp with them,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.819
but I'll be happy to take
them from him if he does.

00:20:26.852 --> 00:20:28.155
[FRIEZA laughs]

00:20:28.189 --> 00:20:33.065
Vegeta might still be working
for me and not even realize it!

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:34.868
[FRIEZA laughs]

00:20:37.875 --> 00:20:42.618
Yes. I'll wait for the
Dragon Balls to come to me.

00:20:42.651 --> 00:20:43.720
[FRIEZA laughs]

00:20:43.754 --> 00:20:47.293
[rumbling]

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.801
[KRILLIN]
I'm worried...

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.506
Vegeta seems like he's a lot
stronger than he was on Earth,

00:20:53.539 --> 00:20:56.646
and that Frieza guy's power
level is even higher than his.

00:20:56.679 --> 00:20:58.850
I don't know what kind
of training Goku is doing,

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:01.088
but whatever it is,
it might not be enough

00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:02.624
to handle those two together.

00:21:02.658 --> 00:21:04.595
Our only chance is to
find the Grand Elder,

00:21:04.629 --> 00:21:05.897
get the last Dragon Ball,

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.837
then keep it hidden
until Goku gets here.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:09.905
And when he does,

00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:12.243
we're still gonna need
some kind of miracle.

00:21:12.277 --> 00:21:14.113
Heh... I guess
it's a bad sign

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.684
when you start
relying on miracles.

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:17.688
I'm probably going
to die here...

00:21:17.722 --> 00:21:20.159
and I've never even
had a girlfriend!

00:21:20.192 --> 00:21:22.631
[NARRATOR] Planet
Namek is under seige!

00:21:22.664 --> 00:21:23.666
Not only Frieza,

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.371
but now Vegeta has begun
his spree of terror.

00:21:26.405 --> 00:21:29.377
And Krillin is just one
chance to slow them down

00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:31.181
until Goku arrives!

00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:34.922
The race is on...
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:38.215 --> 00:22:39.317
[GOKU] Hey! It's Goku!

00:22:39.351 --> 00:22:40.787
Finally, I'm getting
used to training

00:22:40.821 --> 00:22:42.457
in twenty times
Earth's gravity!

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.760
[KING KAI]
Glad to hear it!

00:22:43.793 --> 00:22:46.297
Anywhoo, I had some
visitors stop by earlier!

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:47.668
[GOKU]
Visitors? That's great,

00:22:47.701 --> 00:22:49.738
but what does your social
life have to do with me?

00:22:49.771 --> 00:22:51.676
[KING KAI] Everything!
Unless I'm mistaken,

00:22:51.709 --> 00:22:53.947
you should know
these four very well!

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.848
[GOKU]
Four of 'em, huh?

00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:57.521
Next time, on
Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:57.554 --> 00:23:01.294
"Friends Reborn! Zarbon's
Hideous Transformation!"

00:23:01.328 --> 00:23:02.531
[GOHAN] Hang on, Piccolo!

00:23:02.564 --> 00:23:04.768
I'll see you real soon!
