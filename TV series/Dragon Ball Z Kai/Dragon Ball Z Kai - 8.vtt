[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:06.479
Gohan's intense physical
training with Piccolo continued,

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:09.152
as the young warrior was pushed
to the edge of his limits

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:11.322
by Piccolo's punishing attacks.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:13.326
Meanwhile--
Tien, Yamcha,

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.264
and the rest of the
Earth's fighters also

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:16.900
prepared for the
Saiyans' arrival,

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:20.808
honing their skills under the
watchful eye of Kami himself.

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:22.077
In Other World,

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:24.249
Goku continued to
master King Kai's special

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:26.787
Kaio Ken technique,
a skill enabling him

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.427
to multiply his strength
and speed in short bursts.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.231
But will the efforts
of the Earth's fighters

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.470
be enough to save their world
from the coming Saiyan invasion?

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:39.445

That's the idea... yeah.

00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:01.690
[KING KAI] Matter of fact,
that was pretty amazing...

00:06:01.724 --> 00:06:03.894
I never would have believed
anyone could master the

00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:06.499
Spirit Bomb technique
in such a short time.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.369
Thanks, I've
been practicing.

00:06:08.971 --> 00:06:11.275
Of course...
I explained this before...

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:12.612
but it's important for you

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:14.716
to remember how the
Spirit Bomb technique works.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.853
[KING KAI] Only then
can you use it correctly.

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:19.425
Essentially, it pulls
a small sliver of energy

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:22.464
from the grass,
trees, people, animals;

00:06:22.498 --> 00:06:25.437
every living thing on
the planet... even the air.

00:06:25.471 --> 00:06:26.606
It pools that energy

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.178
and releases it
in one giant burst.

00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.184
[GOKU] Yeah, it's a pretty
awesome technique alright.

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:33.921
Even here...
on a planet as small

00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:37.494
as the one we're on...
you see what it's capable of.

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:39.566
[KING KAI] You can
only imagine how powerful

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.834
it will be on Earth,

00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:43.640
which has so many more
life forms to draw from.

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:44.843
Not to mention the energy

00:06:44.877 --> 00:06:47.114
you'll be able to
pull from the sun...

00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:48.315
But you should be careful--

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:49.919
The raw power
of your Spirit Bomb

00:06:49.953 --> 00:06:52.926
could easily become too much
for you to control alone...

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:56.165
One slip and you'll destroy
your home and all the friends

00:06:56.198 --> 00:06:58.202
you're fighting to protect.

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:01.543
[KING KAI] For that
reason... promise me...

00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:03.847
don't use it unless
you absolutely have to...

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.952
And even then,
just use it once...

00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:07.589
Understand?

00:07:07.622 --> 00:07:08.824
You're the boss...

00:07:08.857 --> 00:07:10.126
Plus with everything
else you've taught me...

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.864
I probably won't
even need it!

00:07:11.897 --> 00:07:13.701
I'm afraid we don't
have much time left to

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:15.705
put the final touches
on your training...

00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:17.240

Um... So... Uh...

Don't lose your head,
but I may have forgotten to

00:07:30.768 --> 00:07:33.707
factor in how long it would
take you to get back home.

00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:37.515
But... I thought you were gonna
send me back home... right...?!

00:07:37.549 --> 00:07:39.653
Can't you just teleport
me there or something?

Way all the way back...?

It took me six
months to get here!

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:47.367
I can't make it by tomorrow!

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:48.771
[KING KAI] No...
but you're faster now,

00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:49.939

take you as long...

Maybe two days at most,
and I'll have Kami

00:07:51.843 --> 00:07:54.081
meet you at the end to take
you the rest of the way.

00:07:54.114 --> 00:07:55.551
No...! I don't
have two days!

there now...!

I feel bad enough already?

back on Earth...
and fast...!

don't have a phone...

You're going to put
your hand on my back...

00:08:18.396 --> 00:08:19.766

as you can...

be a little late.

back right away.

So how's it going?

You think you're ready
to take on the Saiyans?

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.404
[GOKU] Uh huh...

00:10:02.437 --> 00:10:04.141
Absolutely!

00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:05.811
[MASTER ROSHI]
Oh, what a relief!

00:10:05.844 --> 00:10:09.852
Hearing that makes me feel
a good ten pounds lighter!

Uh-oh...
