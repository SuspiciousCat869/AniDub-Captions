it back home safe and sound...
So... How'd it go...?

00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:45.691
[A17] You don't mind having
one less plaything...?

00:10:45.724 --> 00:10:49.431
Whatever you want. No use
me getting in the way.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.304
[A18] This is going
to be a lot more fun

00:10:52.337 --> 00:10:54.374
than that cheesy video game.

00:10:56.646 --> 00:10:57.548
[explosion]

00:10:57.581 --> 00:10:58.783
[A18]
Huh?

00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:01.421
[A17]
Behind you!

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.770
[A18]
You jerk!

00:11:08.803 --> 00:11:10.674
Now I'm pissed!

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:27.642
[A18] Ugh...!
You are going to pay!

00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:29.579
[A17] Wow, you've
gotten better.

00:11:29.612 --> 00:11:32.084
Eighteen's actually
about to flip her lid.

00:11:32.117 --> 00:11:34.121
[TRUNKS] In the past
I traveled to neither one

00:11:34.154 --> 00:11:35.090
of you was so bad.

00:11:35.123 --> 00:11:37.393
But in this time,
you're monsters...

00:11:37.427 --> 00:11:40.033
Here, you just destroy whatever
and whoever you feel like

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:43.840
with no one around strong
enough to reign you in.

00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:46.078
[TRUNKS] That's
finished as of now.

00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:48.617
[A17] Did they give you a
sense of humor in the past?

00:11:48.651 --> 00:11:51.789
[A18] Oh, blah blah blah...
Let's take him down!

00:12:07.555 --> 00:12:10.493
[explosion]

00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:22.317
[A17] No...
Impossible!

00:12:24.054 --> 00:12:25.591
[A17] There... There's
no way someone like you

00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:26.793
could be powerful enough...!

00:12:26.827 --> 00:12:29.131
[TRUNKS] That one
was for my friends.

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:30.801
[TRUNKS]
This one's for me...

00:12:31.803 --> 00:12:33.974
And my teacher Gohan!

00:12:39.786 --> 00:12:45.530
[explosion]

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:07.106
<i>[TRUNKS] There's
still one monster left.</i>

00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:11.348
<i>[NARRATOR] And so,
time marched on.</i>

00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:13.754
<i>With the threat of the
Androids finally lifted,</i>

00:13:13.787 --> 00:13:17.961
<i>a sense of hope has returned to
the remaining citizens
of Earth.</i>

00:13:17.995 --> 00:13:21.803
<i>Slowly but surely, the world
has started to rebuild...</i>

00:13:21.836 --> 00:13:23.273
<i>And back at
Capsule Corporation,</i>

00:13:23.306 --> 00:13:25.544
<i>the time machine is
at last fully recharged,</i>

00:13:25.577 --> 00:13:28.984
<i>ready for one final
round-trip into the past...</i>

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:30.453
[TRUNKS] Well, I'm
off to tell the guys

00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:33.827
Seventeen and Eighteen are
no longer a problem here.

00:13:33.861 --> 00:13:36.533
[BULMA] Alright, then...
Just be careful...

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:37.935
And tell them I said hi.

00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:40.072
[TRUNKS]
Done. Goodbye.

00:13:42.144 --> 00:13:44.047
[TRUNKS] Mom,
get inside. Now.

00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:47.522
[BULMA]
Huh? Ahhh...

00:13:47.555 --> 00:13:49.592
Do you have a
girlfriend...?

00:13:49.626 --> 00:13:50.928
Little, rascal...

00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:54.467
Where on Earth do you
find the time? Heh heh heh...

00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:02.951
[TRUNKS] I know
you're there, Cell.

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:04.087
[CELL]
Huh?

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.758
[TRUNKS]
I'm on to you...

00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:08.229
You intend to steal
the time machine...

00:14:08.262 --> 00:14:11.335
revert to an egg...
travel back into the past...

00:14:11.368 --> 00:14:15.443
assimilate the androids...
and achieve perfect form.

00:14:15.476 --> 00:14:18.316
[CELL] You... You
cannot possibly know...

00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:21.054
[TRUNKS] Hate to say it,
but... your plan...?

00:14:21.088 --> 00:14:23.492
It's already failed.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.190
[CELL] My plan has
"failed," you say...?

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:41.462
Ah... No doubt because
of you, I'm assuming...

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:44.067
[TRUNKS] Listen... I'm not
going to mince words here.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.940
In perfect form you're
a monster, naturally...

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:48.276
But, as things are now,

00:14:48.309 --> 00:14:51.549
I could take you without
breaking a sweat.

00:14:51.582 --> 00:14:52.752
[CELL]
Of course...!

00:14:52.785 --> 00:14:54.522
You've already
traveled into the past...!

00:14:54.555 --> 00:15:00.399
Ha...! Clever... That
explains why you're so informed.

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:01.603
[CELL]
Even so...

00:15:01.636 --> 00:15:04.976
I think you're giving
yourself a bit too much credit.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:06.478
[CELL]
Trust me...

00:15:06.512 --> 00:15:10.153
My robot spies are very good
at reconnaissance, my friend...

00:15:10.186 --> 00:15:11.421
I've got your number...

00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:13.560
Your stats, your style;
what's you're into...

00:15:13.594 --> 00:15:15.062
what's you're not...

00:15:15.697 --> 00:15:18.069
[TRUNKS] Then...your
robot spies must've told you

00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:20.707
how the other
Androids disappeared?

00:15:21.676 --> 00:15:23.445
[CELL]
So that's it...

00:15:23.478 --> 00:15:26.619
You were the one responsible
for that... you little...!

00:15:26.652 --> 00:15:29.792
[CELL] All the more reason
not to let you run loose...

00:15:29.826 --> 00:15:33.366
Make no mistake, I do intend
to steal the time machine...

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:36.438
And when I find the
Androids I shall devour them!

00:15:36.472 --> 00:15:39.344
[TRUNKS] I'm not going to
fight you within city limits...

00:15:39.377 --> 00:15:42.350
The reconstruction is too
far along to risk that...

00:15:42.384 --> 00:15:44.688
I vote the two
of us relocate.

00:16:10.105 --> 00:16:11.709
[CELL] Well,
look at you...

00:16:11.742 --> 00:16:13.780
You have improved
considerably...

00:16:13.813 --> 00:16:15.416
But you're in for
a rude awakening

00:16:15.449 --> 00:16:17.387
if you think
that'll be enough.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.125
[CELL] After all I am
the ultimate life form...!

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:22.396
Dr. Gero's
dream realized...!

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.637
All who oppose me will simply
be absorbed into my being!

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.373
[TRUNKS]
Well, we'll see.

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:37.895
[TRUNKS]
Give up, Cell...

00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:39.665
You're not going
into the past!

00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:40.634
[CELL]
Enough!

00:16:44.876 --> 00:16:46.011
[CELL]
Whoa!

00:16:50.554 --> 00:16:52.825
[CELL] Wha... What
just happened...?

00:16:52.858 --> 00:16:54.461
I don't understand...

00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:57.433
It shouldn't be this easy
for him to fend me off...!

00:16:57.467 --> 00:17:00.640
I'm far too powerful
to lose to a kid!

00:17:16.105 --> 00:17:18.510
[TRUNKS] Cell...
It's all over...

00:17:18.543 --> 00:17:20.781
At long last...
with you gone for good,

00:17:20.815 --> 00:17:23.151
the Earth is finally safe.

00:17:26.025 --> 00:17:27.794
[TRUNKS]
Aaaahh!

00:17:31.736 --> 00:17:34.676
[CELL]
Aaaugh!!

00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:36.445
[CELL]
Why you little...

00:17:36.478 --> 00:17:40.019
Let's see if you can
deal with this maneuver!

00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:42.758
Ka... me...

00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:45.463
Ha... me...

00:17:45.496 --> 00:17:46.498
Huh?!

00:17:48.704 --> 00:17:51.709
[TRUNKS] Say hello
to your doom, Cell!

00:17:54.447 --> 00:17:56.485
[CELL]
No, it can't be...!

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.227
[CELL]
Aaaaagh!

00:18:11.115 --> 00:18:15.356
<i>[TRUNKS] It's over.
It's finally over...</i>

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:17.561
<i>Thank you, my friends...</i>

00:18:17.594 --> 00:18:22.103
<i>And most of all,
thank you, Goku.</i>

00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:29.150
[KING KAI]
It's finished!

00:18:29.183 --> 00:18:31.556
[GOKU] Wow!
King Kai, nice work.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.925
[KING KAI]
Mhmmm.

00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:37.266
[crash]

00:18:38.637 --> 00:18:39.104
[GOKU]
Sorry...!

00:18:39.639 --> 00:18:41.442
Don't know my own
strength... Um, yeah...

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:43.112
[sighs]

00:18:43.146 --> 00:18:44.447
[KING KAI]
Well...

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.918
So much for ruggedness and
the sweat of one's brow.

00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:47.420
[GOKU] Aw,
come on...!

00:18:47.454 --> 00:18:49.391
Hey... It's
not so bad...

00:18:49.424 --> 00:18:51.261
I mean, surely you weren't
planning to settle down

00:18:51.294 --> 00:18:53.766
here once and
for all, am I right?

00:18:55.003 --> 00:18:56.338
[GOKU]
I know...!

00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:58.041
Let's find those fighting
masters you told me about.

00:18:58.075 --> 00:19:02.618
[KING KAI] Uh... Now may
not be the right time...

00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:03.753
[GOKU]
King Kai...!

00:19:03.786 --> 00:19:05.591
You promised me we'd try
to find them at some point,

00:19:05.624 --> 00:19:08.362
and now's as good a time as
any as far as I can see...!

00:19:08.395 --> 00:19:10.400
Or maybe you just don't
know where to look...

00:19:10.433 --> 00:19:13.005
[KING KAI] Hey...!
I know exactly where...!

00:19:13.038 --> 00:19:14.207
It's just... you're...

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.711
[GOKU] Then let's
get a move on!

00:19:15.744 --> 00:19:18.783
It's not like the Masters of
Other World are looking for us.

00:19:18.816 --> 00:19:21.488
