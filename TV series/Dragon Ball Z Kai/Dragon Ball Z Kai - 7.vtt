Goku completed his journey down
Snake Way to reach King Kai!

But before his real
training can begin,

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:13.192
Goku must learn to
overcome the intense

gravity on King Kai's planet--
by chasing a monkey!

there is to it, of course...

00:11:50.555 --> 00:11:52.223
Take this seriously!

00:11:52.256 --> 00:11:53.960
[YAJIROBE] Fine.

00:11:59.673 --> 00:12:01.909
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-
ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:27.127
[GOKU] I did it!

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.431
[GOKU laughs]

00:12:29.464 --> 00:12:33.974
[GOKU] I caught the monkey!
I caught the monkey!

00:12:34.008 --> 00:12:35.110
That wasn't nearly as hard

00:12:35.143 --> 00:12:36.780
as I thought it
would be--so now what?

00:12:36.813 --> 00:12:38.784
Now then...
Let me see...

00:12:38.817 --> 00:12:42.057
Something tough...
A real grind...

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:42.825
Yeah!

00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:45.363
Try grinding some sesame seeds!

00:12:45.396 --> 00:12:47.266
[KING KAI laughs]

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.747
Okay, not that that
isn't a laugh riot--

00:12:53.781 --> 00:12:54.949
but if I don't
start training soon,

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.218
[GOKU] the Saiyans will--

00:12:56.252 --> 00:12:58.155
[KING KAI] Naw! Now...
Don't be over-hasty...

00:12:58.188 --> 00:13:00.293
You've got a hundred
and thirty-five days left.

00:13:00.327 --> 00:13:03.298
But that's practically
no time at all!

00:13:04.602 --> 00:13:07.975
[KING KAI inhales]

00:13:08.008 --> 00:13:11.214
[KING KAI bellows]

00:13:19.397 --> 00:13:21.268
What was that?

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:23.974
It'll make a
full circuit soon.

00:13:24.007 --> 00:13:26.144
A full circuit...?

00:13:31.122 --> 00:13:32.825
Oh, yeah.

00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:44.447
Practically no time at all
is time enough, my boy.

00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:45.951
[KING KAI chuckles]

00:13:45.984 --> 00:13:47.354
I've gotta remember that one!

00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:50.426
You've got to be kiddin' me--
no one is that strong!

00:13:50.995 --> 00:13:53.065
[GREGORY] How uncouth!

00:13:55.671 --> 00:13:57.875
[beeping]

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.052
Huh...? Now what?

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:09.364
But... You're just
a grasshopper...!

00:14:09.398 --> 00:14:10.934
Ha! "Just," he says!

00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:13.206
He's got a leg up on you.

00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:14.642
[KING KAI laughing]
I'm on a roll today!

00:14:14.675 --> 00:14:15.544
You, sir...

00:14:15.578 --> 00:14:16.947
are an ill-mannered clod!

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.718
And for your information,
this "just a grasshopper"

00:14:19.752 --> 00:14:22.457
goes by the name
of Gregory... Jerk.

00:14:22.491 --> 00:14:24.061
Uh huh...

00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:26.331
Can't you see? You are
in the presence of one of

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.469
the most powerful
beings in the universe...

00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:30.340
King Kai himself!

00:14:30.373 --> 00:14:31.108
[KING KAI laughs]

00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:32.344
[KING KAI] "Leg up"....

00:14:32.377 --> 00:14:34.782
Oh that is just too
rich! Because he's...

00:14:34.815 --> 00:14:36.853
Uh, a-hem, yes,
well as I was saying...

00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:39.324
His strength is undeniable...!

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:41.395
And you dare
to question it...?!

00:14:41.428 --> 00:14:44.167
There's only so much
ignorance I can bear.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.939
Right... You mean 'cause
you're a grasshopper.

00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:48.810
[laughing]

00:14:48.843 --> 00:14:50.914
[KING KAI] Bravo, Goku!
Excellent comeback!

00:14:50.948 --> 00:14:52.785
We'll make a
comedian out of you yet!

00:14:52.818 --> 00:14:54.522
King Kai,
could you not laugh?

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:56.258
I'm trying to defend your honor!

00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:58.462
Ah, what luck...
This is perfect...

00:14:58.496 --> 00:15:03.406
Since you've captured Bubbles,
your next task is Gregory.

00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:04.274
But, he's...

00:15:04.307 --> 00:15:06.713
Don't even say it!
You've no idea!

00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:08.015
King Kai, sir...

00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:10.888
No, uh, disrespect,
but you're jokin', right?

00:15:10.921 --> 00:15:12.190
Your greatness,

00:15:12.223 --> 00:15:13.960
do you hear the way
this idiot insults me...?!

00:15:13.994 --> 00:15:15.196
With your permission, sir,

00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:17.100
I'd be happy to take
him down a few notches--

00:15:17.134 --> 00:15:19.404
and teach him a thing
or two about respect.

00:15:19.437 --> 00:15:21.141
Yes. Of course.

00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:25.116
What's that for?

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.586
Uh, is it me, or...

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.924
...does that thing seem
a bit on the hefty side?

00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.394
Here, Goku... Catch.

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:36.639
Come now...
It's only a mallet.

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:39.478
[GREGORY laughs]

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:41.950
The real challenge...
will be to see if you can

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.421
swat our friend
Gregory here with it, eh?

00:15:44.455 --> 00:15:46.324
Seriously?

00:15:47.728 --> 00:15:48.997
Once you've managed to do that,

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:51.102
your training with
me will truly begin.

00:15:51.135 --> 00:15:52.571
Now how's that sound?

00:15:52.605 --> 00:15:54.008
Now you're talkin'!

00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:55.945
This two-bit rookie
couldn't catch a cold--

00:15:55.978 --> 00:15:58.650
let alone someone
as quick as moi.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.664
Ahhhhh!

00:16:16.318 --> 00:16:18.021
[GOKU] Argh!

00:16:19.926 --> 00:16:22.296
Man, he's fast! Huh?!

00:16:25.904 --> 00:16:27.440
Damn!

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:42.838
[KING KAI] Looks like I'll have
plenty of time to prepare...

00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:44.609
Come on, Bubbles.

00:16:44.642 --> 00:16:46.646
That was just a lucky shot!

00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:55.096
Oh, that is it!

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:57.133
[GOKU] Enjoy it now,
grasshopper!

00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:58.503
But just you wait
'til I get this

00:16:58.537 --> 00:17:01.241
thing within striking
distance of that skull!

00:17:01.275 --> 00:17:04.247
[GOKU]
Yeah, you better run!

00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:06.819
[GOKU] Sorry!

00:17:06.852 --> 00:17:08.723
Hey! Careful!

00:17:09.257 --> 00:17:11.461
[KING KAI shrieks]

00:17:16.171 --> 00:17:19.010
Well, at least he's
got the right attitude...

00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:22.149
[KING KAI weeps]

00:17:23.452 --> 00:17:25.658
[KING KAI]
Thank you, Bubbles.

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:28.161
[GOKU]
I've got you now!

00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:40.587
[worried monkey sounds]

00:17:40.687 --> 00:17:42.290
[GOKU] You little...!

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:51.474
[GOKU] I will become
stronger than the Saiyans!

00:17:54.147 --> 00:17:55.684
[GOKU] Damn it!

00:17:55.817 --> 00:17:57.153
[KAMI] I am
pleased to confess

00:17:57.187 --> 00:17:59.391
that there is nothing
left for us to teach you...

00:17:59.424 --> 00:18:01.395
Without a doubt,
you have far surpassed

00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:03.800
both Mr. Popo and myself...

00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:07.508
Return now to your homes and,
hone the skills you have learned

00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:10.948
until the fated day
of conflict is upon us.

00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:12.785
The future is in your hands.

00:18:12.818 --> 00:18:14.020
Right!

00:18:14.053 --> 00:18:15.289
Um, hey...

00:18:15.323 --> 00:18:17.227
Can we get outta these
heavy clothes now or what?

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.763
Yes; you may do as you wish.

00:18:18.796 --> 00:18:21.367
I say we go and put the
finishing touches on.

00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:22.871
Yeah, at this
rate I feel like we

00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:24.207
can keep powering up forever!

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.844
We're invincible!

00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:28.315
[TIEN]
If we're invincible,

00:18:28.348 --> 00:18:30.921
I can't wait to see
what's become of Goku.

00:18:31.589 --> 00:18:33.560
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
after two weeks

00:18:33.593 --> 00:18:36.331
of lugging an
enormous hammer around...

Huh?

[GOKU] You're mine!

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:55.369
This jerk won't let up!

00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:58.208
Right... now...!

00:19:11.636 --> 00:19:12.637
Huh?

00:19:15.008 --> 00:19:16.545
[GREGORY] Oh no!

00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:18.684
Bedtime, Gregory!

Hmm?

[chatters]

00:19:25.462 --> 00:19:27.133
If I whacked you as
hard as I could,

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:28.069
you'd be smushed.

00:19:28.102 --> 00:19:29.438
Ha! Dream on, ape...!

00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:32.277
My body is as tough as marble,
I will have you know...

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.015
Good luck with the Saiyans
if that's all you've got!

00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:37.120
Really...? So...

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:39.223
That bump was already there...

00:19:39.323 --> 00:19:41.027
[GREGORY groans]

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.266
[GOKU laughs]

00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:44.569
[KING KAI] Excellent.

00:19:44.602 --> 00:19:46.405
And still a hundred
and eighteen days left...

00:19:46.438 --> 00:19:49.277
Could he really be the one?
The student I've been waiting

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.148
for who can master
my techniques?

00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:53.586
[GOKU laughs]

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.755
[KING KAI] Not only
does he possess

00:19:54.788 --> 00:19:56.892
the strength to
perform the Kaio-ken...

00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:58.128
he has the purity of heart

00:19:58.161 --> 00:20:00.734
required to wield my
most powerful attack--

00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:01.969
the Spirit Bomb!

00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:04.274
You're still gonna keep
your promise, aren't you?

00:20:04.308 --> 00:20:05.376
Make no mistake, boy,

00:20:05.409 --> 00:20:06.579
this training will
be more strenuous

00:20:06.613 --> 00:20:08.315
than you can
possibly imagine...!

00:20:08.348 --> 00:20:09.885
Are you ready?!

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.355
You bet I am!

00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:12.758
Very well, Goku...

00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:15.162
Expect nothing less of
yourself than to be the best...

00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:17.701
I want you to aspire to
greatness, you hear...?

00:20:17.735 --> 00:20:19.304
Greatness!

00:20:19.337 --> 00:20:21.474
It's a deal.

00:20:25.482 --> 00:20:27.253
Sister, I'd really
appreciate it

00:20:27.286 --> 00:20:29.224
if you'd tell us the
future of the Earth.

00:20:29.257 --> 00:20:30.459
Sure. No sweat...

00:20:30.492 --> 00:20:32.296
Easiest thing in the world...

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.700
You don't have
to look that far...

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.970
Just to next year.

00:20:36.004 --> 00:20:38.375
Fine then...
But you're gonna owe me.

00:20:38.409 --> 00:20:41.615
[BABA babbles incantation]

00:20:49.163 --> 00:20:50.634
That's odd...
Either this thing

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:54.140
is on the fritz, or
the Earth has no future.

00:20:54.174 --> 00:20:55.376
Oh, no...

00:20:55.409 --> 00:20:57.581
Yes. That's right...
Focus your strength!

00:20:57.614 --> 00:20:59.818
Learn to control your power!

00:21:02.791 --> 00:21:05.530
[NARRATOR] Exactly what are
these powerful techniques

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:08.435
that King Kai
hopes to teach Goku?

00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:10.406
And will they be
enough to counter

00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:12.577
the approaching Saiyan threat?

00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:14.280
With each passing moment,

00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:16.786
the Saiyans draw
closer to Earth.

00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:19.959
Ready or not, in one hundred
eighteen short days,

00:21:19.992 --> 00:21:21.227
the fate of the planet

00:21:21.261 --> 00:21:24.333
will rest squarely
on Goku's shoulders!

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:27.206
The Earth's greatest
warriors prepare

00:21:27.239 --> 00:21:29.512
for the fight of their lives--

00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:32.751
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:39.685 --> 00:22:42.456
Talk about being caught
between a rock and a hard place.

00:22:42.489 --> 00:22:43.860
Those nasty
Saiyans get to Earth

00:22:43.893 --> 00:22:45.496
ahead of schedule
and yours truly

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.701
has got only one day
to get back to Earth!

00:22:47.734 --> 00:22:49.739
[PICCOLO]
What the--What's going on?

00:22:49.772 --> 00:22:52.176
Why is it getting
so dark all of a sudden?

00:22:52.209 --> 00:22:54.982
[GOKU] Next time
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:55.015 --> 00:22:56.318
"Shenron Appears!

00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:58.756
The Saiyans Arrive
Sooner Than Expected!"

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.795
[GOHAN] I wonder if Dad's
strong enough to beat them yet.
