What? Krillin?

[BULMA]
No, but let me look.

No sign of him...

[ROSHI ON PHONE]
Well, keep your eyes peeled.

00:18:10.212 --> 00:18:11.281
He should be there

00:18:11.315 --> 00:18:12.685
to get the controller
any second.

00:18:12.718 --> 00:18:15.022
Oh, really...?
Good, that ll be a big help.

so I should get him home soon.
